<p class="mathjax">Discovering a high-performing sparse network within a massive neural network
is advantageous for deploying them on devices with limited storage, such as
mobile phones. Additionally, model explainability is essential to fostering
trust in AI. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) finds a network within a deep
network with comparable or superior performance to the original model. However,
limited study has been conducted on the success or failure of LTH in terms of
explainability. In this work, we examine why the performance of the pruned
networks gradually increases or decreases. Using Grad-CAM and Post-hoc concept
bottleneck models (PCBMs), respectively, we investigate the explainability of
pruned networks in terms of pixels and high-level concepts. We perform
extensive experiments across vision and medical imaging datasets. As more
weights are pruned, the performance of the network degrades. The discovered
concepts and pixels from the pruned networks are inconsistent with the original
network -- a possible reason for the drop in performance.

<p class="mathjax">This study applies Activity Theory and investigates the attitudes and
contradictions of 67 English as a foreign language (EFL) students from four
Hong Kong secondary schools towards machine-in-the-loop writing, where
artificial intelligence (AI) suggests ideas during composition. Students
answered an open-ended question about their feelings on writing with AI.
Results revealed mostly positive attitudes, with some negative or mixed
feelings. From a thematic analysis, contradictions or points of tension between
students and AI stemmed from AI inadequacies, students' balancing enthusiasm
with preference, and their striving for language autonomy. The research
highlights the benefits and challenges of implementing machine-in-the-loop
writing in EFL classrooms, suggesting educators align activity goals with
students' values, language abilities, and AI capabilities to enhance students'
activity systems.

<p class="mathjax">Cricket is the second most popular sport after soccer in terms of viewership.
However, the assessment of individual player performance, a fundamental task in
team sports, is currently primarily based on aggregate performance statistics,
including average runs and wickets taken. We propose Context-Aware Metric of
player Performance, CAMP, to quantify individual players' contributions toward
a cricket match outcome. CAMP employs data mining methods and enables effective
data-driven decision-making for selection and drafting, coaching and training,
team line-ups, and strategy development. CAMP incorporates the exact context of
performance, such as opponents' strengths and specific circumstances of games,
such as pressure situations. We empirically evaluate CAMP on data of
limited-over cricket matches between 2001 and 2019. In every match, a committee
of experts declares one player as the best player, called Man of the M}atch
(MoM). The top two rated players by CAMP match with MoM in 83\% of the 961
games. Thus, the CAMP rating of the best player closely matches that of the
domain experts. By this measure, CAMP significantly outperforms the current
best-known players' contribution measure based on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern
(DLS) method.

<p class="mathjax">To answer complex queries on knowledge graphs, logical reasoning over
incomplete knowledge is required due to the open-world assumption.
Learning-based methods are essential because they are capable of generalizing
over unobserved knowledge. Therefore, an appropriate dataset is fundamental to
both obtaining and evaluating such methods under this paradigm. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for data generation, model training, and
method evaluation that covers the combinatorial space of Existential
First-order Queries with multiple variables ($\text{EFO}_{k}$). The
combinatorial query space in our framework significantly extends those defined
by set operations in the existing literature. Additionally, we construct a
dataset, $\text{EFO}_{k}$-CQA, with 741 types of query for empirical
evaluation, and our benchmark results provide new insights into how query
hardness affects the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing
dataset construction process is systematically biased that hinders the
appropriate development of query-answering methods, highlighting the importance
of our work. Our code and data are provided

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step,
"Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is
unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual
reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate
hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model
predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or
paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they
condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on
the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not
seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information
encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and
more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study.
Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such
as the model size and task are carefully chosen.

<p class="mathjax">The graphical modeling language GRAFCET is used as a formal specification
language in industrial control design. This paper proposes a structural
analysis that approximates the variable values of GRAFCET to allow verification
on specification level. GRAFCET has different elements resulting in concurrent
behavior, which in general results in a large state space for analyses like
model checking. The proposed analysis approach approximates that state space
and takes into consideration the entire set of GRAFCET elements leading to
concurrent behavior. The analysis consists of two parts: We present an
algorithm analyzing concurrent steps to approximate the step variables and we
adapt analysis means from the field of Petri nets to approximate internal and
output variables. The proposed approach is evaluated using an industrial-sized
example to demonstrate that the analysis is capable of verifying behavioral
errors and is not limited by the specification size of practical plants.

part of machine learning, allowing to explain the predictions of complex
models. XAI is especially required in risky applications, particularly in
health care, where human lives depend on the decisions of AI systems. One area
of medical research is age prediction and identification of biomarkers of aging
and age-related diseases. However, the role of XAI in the age prediction task
has not previously been explored directly. In this review, we discuss the
application of XAI approaches to age prediction tasks. We give a systematic
review of the works organized by body systems, and discuss the benefits of XAI
in medical applications and, in particular, in the age prediction domain.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Emotion Detection (ED) aims to build systems to identify users'
emotions automatically. This field has the potential to enhance HCI, creating
an individualised experience for the user. However, ED systems tend to perform
poorly on people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Hence, the need to create
ED systems tailored to how people with autism express emotions. Previous works
have created ED systems tailored for children with ASD but did not share the
resulting dataset. Sharing annotated datasets is essential to enable the
development of more advanced computer models for ED within the research
community. In this paper, we describe our experience establishing a process to
create a multimodal annotated dataset featuring children with a level 1
diagnosis of autism. In addition, we introduce CALMED (Children, Autism,
Multimodal, Emotion, Detection), the resulting multimodal emotion detection
dataset featuring children with autism aged 8-12. CALMED includes audio and

<p class="mathjax">An impressive number of new startups are launched every day as a result of
growing new markets, accessible technologies, and venture capital. New ventures
such as Facebook, Supercell, Linkedin, Spotify, {WhatsApp}, and Dropbox, to
name a few, are good examples of startups that evolved into successful
businesses. However, despite many successful stories, the great majority of
them fail prematurely. Operating in a chaotic and rapidly evolving domain
conveys new uncharted challenges for startuppers. In this study, the authors
characterize their context and identify common software development startup
practices.

<p class="mathjax">Many properties in real world, such as desirability or strength in
competitive environment, can't be directly observed, which makes them difficult
to evaluate. To deal with this challenging problem, prior work has primarily
focused on estimating those properties of known items, especially the strength
of sports players, only of those who appears in paired comparison dataset. In
this paper, we introduce Deep Bradley-Terry Rating (DBTR), a novel ML framework
to evaluate any properties of unknown items, not necessarily present in
dataset. Our method seamlessly integrates traditional Bradley-Terry model with
a neural network structure. We also generalizes this architecture further for
asymmetric environment with unfairness, which is much more common in real world
settings. In our experimental analysis, DBTR successfully learned desired
quantification of those properties.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a stochastic block model with dynamics where the
population grows using preferential attachment. Nodes with higher weighted
degree are more likely to recruit new nodes, and nodes always recruit nodes
from their own community. This model can capture how communities grow or shrink
based on their collaborations with other nodes in the network, where an edge
represents collaboration on a project.
<br />Focusing on the case of two communities, we derive a deterministic
approximation to the dynamics and characterize the phase transitions for
diversity, i.e. the parameter regimes in which either one of the communities
dies out or the two communities reach parity over time.
<br />In particular, we find that the minority may vanish when the probability of
cross-community edges is low, even when cross-community projects are more
valuable than projects with collaborators from the same community.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that AI-based language technology -- large language models,
machine translation systems, multilingual dictionaries, and corpora -- is
currently limited to 2 to 3 percent of the world's most widely spoken and/or
financially and politically best supported languages. In response, recent
research efforts have sought to extend the reach of AI technology to
``underserved languages.'' In this paper, we show that many of these attempts
produce flawed solutions that adhere to a hard-wired representational
preference for certain languages, which we call techno-linguistic bias.
Techno-linguistic bias is distinct from the well-established phenomenon of
linguistic bias as it does not concern the languages represented but rather the
design of the technologies. As we show through the paper, techno-linguistic
bias can result in systems that can only express concepts that are part of the
language and culture of dominant powers, unable to correctly represent concepts
from other communities. We argue that at the root of this problem lies a
systematic tendency of technology developer communities to apply a simplistic
understanding of diversity which does not do justice to the more profound
differences that languages, and ultimately the communities that speak them,
embody. Drawing on the concept of epistemic injustice, we point to the broader
sociopolitical consequences of the bias we identify and show how it can lead
not only to a disregard for valuable aspects of diversity but also to an
under-representation of the needs and diverse worldviews of marginalized
language communities.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional federated learning uses the number of samples to calculate the
weights of each client model and uses this fixed weight value to fusion the
global model. However, in practical scenarios, each client's device and data
heterogeneity leads to differences in the quality of each client's model. Thus
the contribution to the global model is not wholly determined by the sample
size. In addition, if clients intentionally upload low-quality or malicious
models, using these models for aggregation will lead to a severe decrease in
global model accuracy. Traditional federated learning algorithms do not address
these issues. To solve this probelm, we propose FedDRL, a model fusion approach
using reinforcement learning based on a two staged approach. In the first
stage, Our method could filter out malicious models and selects trusted client
models to participate in the model fusion. In the second stage, the FedDRL
algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights of the trusted client models and
aggregates the optimal global model. We also define five model fusion scenarios
and compare our method with two baseline algorithms in those scenarios. The
experimental results show that our algorithm has higher reliability than other
algorithms while maintaining accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">For an artist or a graphic designer, the spatial layout of a scene is a
critical design choice. However, existing text-to-image diffusion models
provide limited support for incorporating spatial information. This paper
introduces Composite Diffusion as a means for artists to generate high-quality
images by composing from the sub-scenes. The artists can specify the
arrangement of these sub-scenes through a flexible free-form segment layout.
They can describe the content of each sub-scene primarily using natural text
and additionally by utilizing reference images or control inputs such as line
art, scribbles, human pose, canny edges, and more.
<br />We provide a comprehensive and modular method for Composite Diffusion that
enables alternative ways of generating, composing, and harmonizing sub-scenes.
Further, we wish to evaluate the composite image for effectiveness in both
image quality and achieving the artist's intent. We argue that existing image
quality metrics lack a holistic evaluation of image composites. To address
this, we propose novel quality criteria especially relevant to composite
generation.
<br />We believe that our approach provides an intuitive method of art creation.
Through extensive user surveys, quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show
how it achieves greater spatial, semantic, and creative control over image
generation. In addition, our methods do not need to retrain or modify the
architecture of the base diffusion models and can work in a plug-and-play
manner with the fine-tuned models.

<p class="mathjax">Vision systems to see and reason about the compositional nature of visual
scenes are fundamental to understanding our world. The complex relations
between objects and their locations, ambiguities, and variations in the
real-world environment can be better described in human language, naturally
governed by grammatical rules and other modalities such as audio and depth. The
models learned to bridge the gap between such modalities coupled with
large-scale training data facilitate contextual reasoning, generalization, and
prompt capabilities at test time. These models are referred to as foundational
models. The output of such models can be modified through human-provided
prompts without retraining, e.g., segmenting a particular object by providing a
bounding box, having interactive dialogues by asking questions about an image
or video scene or manipulating the robot's behavior through language
instructions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of such
emerging foundational models, including typical architecture designs to combine
different modalities (vision, text, audio, etc), training objectives
(contrastive, generative), pre-training datasets, fine-tuning mechanisms, and
the common prompting patterns; textual, visual, and heterogeneous. We discuss
the open challenges and research directions for foundational models in computer
vision, including difficulties in their evaluations and benchmarking, gaps in
their real-world understanding, limitations of their contextual understanding,
biases, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and interpretability issues. We
review recent developments in this field, covering a wide range of applications
of foundation models systematically and comprehensively. A comprehensive list
of foundational models studied in this work is available at

<p class="mathjax">Quasi-Newton methods still face significant challenges in training
large-scale neural networks due to additional compute costs in the Hessian
related computations and instability issues in stochastic training. A
well-known method, L-BFGS that efficiently approximates the Hessian using
history parameter and gradient changes, suffers convergence instability in
stochastic training. So far, attempts that adapt L-BFGS to large-scale
stochastic training incur considerable extra overhead, which offsets its
convergence benefits in wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose mL-BFGS, a
lightweight momentum-based L-BFGS algorithm that paves the way for quasi-Newton
(QN) methods in large-scale distributed deep neural network (DNN) optimization.
mL-BFGS introduces a nearly cost-free momentum scheme into L-BFGS update and
greatly reduces stochastic noise in the Hessian, therefore stabilizing
convergence during stochastic optimization. For model training at a large
scale, mL-BFGS approximates a block-wise Hessian, thus enabling distributing
compute and memory costs across all computing nodes. We provide a supporting
convergence analysis for mL-BFGS in stochastic settings. To investigate mL-BFGS
potential in large-scale DNN training, we train benchmark neural models using
mL-BFGS and compare performance with baselines (SGD, Adam, and other
quasi-Newton methods). Results show that mL-BFGS achieves both noticeable
iteration-wise and wall-clock speedup.

<p class="mathjax">In this research work, we proposed a novel ChildGAN, a pair of GAN networks
for generating synthetic boys and girls facial data derived from StyleGAN2.
ChildGAN is built by performing smooth domain transfer using transfer learning.
It provides photo-realistic, high-quality data samples. A large-scale dataset
is rendered with a variety of smart facial transformations: facial expressions,
age progression, eye blink effects, head pose, skin and hair color variations,
and variable lighting conditions. The dataset comprises more than 300k distinct
data samples. Further, the uniqueness and characteristics of the rendered
facial features are validated by running different computer vision application
tests which include CNN-based child gender classifier, face localization and
facial landmarks detection test, identity similarity evaluation using ArcFace,
and lastly running eye detection and eye aspect ratio tests. The results
demonstrate that synthetic child facial data of high quality offers an
alternative to the cost and complexity of collecting a large-scale dataset from
real children.

<p class="mathjax">We study the consistent k-center clustering problem. In this problem, the
goal is to maintain a constant factor approximate $k$-center solution during a
sequence of $n$ point insertions and deletions while minimizing the recourse,
i.e., the number of changes made to the set of centers after each point
insertion or deletion. Previous works by Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii [ICML '12]
and Fichtenberger, Lattanzi, Norouzi-Fard, and Svensson [SODA '21] showed that
in the incremental setting, where deletions are not allowed, one can obtain $k
\cdot \textrm{polylog}(n) / n$ amortized recourse for both $k$-center and
$k$-median, and demonstrated a matching lower bound. However, no algorithm for
the fully dynamic setting achieves less than the trivial $O(k)$ changes per
update, which can be obtained by simply reclustering the full dataset after
every update.
<br />In this work, we give the first algorithm for consistent $k$-center
clustering for the fully dynamic setting, i.e., when both point insertions and
deletions are allowed, and improves upon a trivial $O(k)$ recourse bound.
Specifically, our algorithm maintains a constant factor approximate solution
while ensuring worst-case constant recourse per update, which is optimal in the
fully dynamic setting. Moreover, our algorithm is deterministic and is
therefore correct even if an adaptive adversary chooses the insertions and
deletions.

<p class="mathjax">The Russian invasion of Ukraine has elicited a diverse array of responses
from nations around the globe. During a global conflict, polarized narratives
are spread on social media to sway public opinion. We examine the dynamics of
the political narratives surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war during the first
two months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (RU) using the Chinese Twitter
space as a case study. Since the beginning of the RU, pro-Chinese-state and
anti-Chinese-state users have spread divisive opinions, rumors, and conspiracy
theories. We investigate how the pro- and anti-state camps contributed to the
evolution of RU-related narratives, as well as how a few influential accounts
drove the narrative evolution. We identify pro-state and anti-state actors on
Twitter using network analysis and text-based classifiers, and we leverage text
analysis, along with the users' social interactions (e.g., retweeting), to
extract narrative coordination and evolution. We find evidence that both
pro-state and anti-state camps spread propaganda narratives about RU. Our
analysis illuminates how actors coordinate to advance particular viewpoints or
act against one another in the context of global conflict.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) can incorporate limited labeled data
and large amounts of unlabeled data to improve the performance and
generalization of existing object detectors. Despite many advances, recent SSOD
methods are still challenged by noisy/misleading pseudo-labels, classical
exponential moving average (EMA) strategy, and the consensus of Teacher-Student
models in the latter stages of training. This paper proposes a novel
training-based model refinement (TMR) stage and a simple yet effective
representation disagreement (RD) strategy to address the limitations of
classical EMA and the consensus problem. The TMR stage of Teacher-Student
models optimizes the lightweight scaling operation to refine the model's
weights and prevent overfitting or forgetting learned patterns from unlabeled
data. Meanwhile, the RD strategy helps keep these models diverged to encourage
the student model to explore complementary representations. In addition, we use
cascade regression to generate more reliable pseudo-labels for supervising the
student model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach over state-of-the-art SSOD methods. Specifically, the proposed
approach outperforms the Unbiased-Teacher method by an average mAP margin of
4.6% and 5.3% when using partially-labeled and fully-labeled data on the
MS-COCO dataset, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">3D plane recovery from a single image can usually be divided into several
subtasks of plane detection, segmentation, parameter estimation and possibly
depth estimation. Previous works tend to solve this task by either extending
the RCNN-based segmentation network or the dense pixel embedding-based
clustering framework. However, none of them tried to integrate above related
subtasks into a unified framework but treat them separately and sequentially,
which we suspect is potentially a main source of performance limitation for
existing approaches. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based
learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we
propose PlaneRecTR, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time
unifies all subtasks related to single-view plane recovery with a single
compact model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across subtasks,
obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNet and NYUv2-Plane
datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/SJingjia/PlaneRecTR.

challenging but essential for informed decision-making. We present Upload,
PREprocess, Visualize, and Evaluate (UPREVE), a user-friendly web-based
graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simplify the process of causal

<p class="mathjax">The use of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is expected to
significantly improve road safety and traffic management. We present an
efficient protocol, called the AEE protocol, for protecting data authenticity
and user privacy in V2X applications. Our protocol provides event-based
likability, which enables messages from a subject vehicle to be linked to a
specific event in order to prevent Sybil attacks. Messages on different events
are unlinkable to preserve the long-term privacy of vehicles. Moreover, our
protocol introduces a new method for generating temporary public keys to reduce
computing and transmission overheads. Such a temporary public key is bound with
a certain event and is automatically revoked when the event is over. We
describe how to apply our protocol in vehicular communications using two
exemplar use cases. To further reduce the real-time computational complexity,
our protocol enables us to decompose the cryptographic operations into offline
processes for complex operations and real-time processes for fast computations.

<p class="mathjax">Neuromorphic processors have garnered considerable interest in recent years
for their potential in energy-efficient and high-speed computing. The Locally
Competitive Algorithm (LCA) has been utilized for power efficient sparse coding
on neuromorphic processors, including the first Loihi processor. With the Loihi
2 processor enabling custom neuron models and graded spike communication, more
complex implementations of LCA are possible. We present a new implementation of
LCA designed for the Loihi 2 processor and perform an initial set of benchmarks
comparing it to LCA on CPU and GPU devices. In these experiments LCA on Loihi 2
is orders of magnitude more efficient and faster for large sparsity penalties,
while maintaining similar reconstruction quality. We find this performance
improvement increases as the LCA parameters are tuned towards greater
representation sparsity.
<br />Our study highlights the potential of neuromorphic processors, particularly
Loihi 2, in enabling intelligent, autonomous, real-time processing on small
robots, satellites where there are strict SWaP (small, lightweight, and low
power) requirements. By demonstrating the superior performance of LCA on Loihi
2 compared to conventional computing device, our study suggests that Loihi 2
could be a valuable tool in advancing these types of applications. Overall, our
study highlights the potential of neuromorphic processors for efficient and
accurate data processing on resource-constrained devices.

cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability. Addressing these
shortcomings, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging an advanced
version of the YOLOv8 object detection model, supplemented with a Convolutional
Block Attention Module (CBAM) for improved feature recognition. The optimized
loss function further refines the learning process. Employing a dataset of
5,432 images from the Saemangeum offshore wind farm and a publicly available

substantial enhancement in defect detection stability, marking a significant

<p class="mathjax">In practical scenarios, the effectiveness of sequential recommendation
systems is hindered by the user cold-start problem, which arises due to limited
interactions for accurately determining user preferences. Previous studies have
attempted to address this issue by combining meta-learning with user and
item-side information. However, these approaches face inherent challenges in
modeling user preference dynamics, particularly for "minor users" who exhibit
distinct preferences compared to more common or "major users." To overcome
these limitations, we present a novel approach called ClusterSeq, a
Meta-Learning Clustering-Based Sequential Recommender System. ClusterSeq
leverages dynamic information in the user sequence to enhance item prediction
accuracy, even in the absence of side information. This model preserves the
preferences of minor users without being overshadowed by major users, and it
capitalizes on the collective knowledge of users within the same cluster.
Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of ClusterSeq. Empirical results consistently demonstrate that
ClusterSeq outperforms several state-of-the-art meta-learning recommenders.
Notably, compared to existing meta-learning methods, our proposed approach
achieves a substantial improvement of 16-39% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).

<p class="mathjax">As the size of transformer-based models continues to grow, fine-tuning these
large-scale pretrained vision models for new tasks has become increasingly
parameter-intensive. Parameter-efficient learning has been developed to reduce
the number of tunable parameters during fine-tuning. Although these methods
show promising results, there is still a significant performance gap compared
to full fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we propose an Effective and
Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning (E^2VPT) approach for large-scale
transformer-based model adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a set of
learnable key-value prompts and visual prompts into self-attention and input
layers, respectively, to improve the effectiveness of model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we design a prompt pruning procedure to systematically prune low
importance prompts while preserving model performance, which largely enhances
the model's efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with
considerably low parameter usage (e.g., 0.32% of model parameters on VTAB-1k).

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) models can memorize training datasets. As a result,
training ML models over private datasets can violate the privacy of
individuals. Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous privacy notion to preserve
the privacy of underlying training datasets in ML models. Yet, training ML
models in a DP framework usually degrades the accuracy of ML models. This paper
aims to boost the accuracy of a DP-ML model, specifically a logistic regression
model, via a pre-training module. In more detail, we initially pre-train our
model on a public training dataset that there is no privacy concern about it.
Then, we fine-tune our model via the DP logistic regression with the private
dataset. In the numerical results, we show that adding a pre-training module
significantly improves the accuracy of the DP logistic regression.

<p class="mathjax">Software systems are increasingly relying on deep learning components, due to
their remarkable capability of identifying complex data patterns and powering
intelligent behaviour. A core enabler of this change in software development is
the availability of easy-to-use deep learning libraries. Libraries like PyTorch
and TensorFlow empower a large variety of intelligent systems, offering a
multitude of algorithms and configuration options, applicable to numerous
domains of systems. However, bugs in those popular deep learning libraries also
may have dire consequences for the quality of systems they enable; thus, it is
important to understand how bugs are identified and fixed in those libraries.
<br />Inspired by a study of Jia et al., which investigates the bug identification
and fixing process at TensorFlow, we characterize bugs in the PyTorch library,
a very popular deep learning framework. We investigate the causes and symptoms
of bugs identified during PyTorch's development, and assess their locality
within the project, and extract patterns of bug fixes. Our results highlight
that PyTorch bugs are more like traditional software projects bugs, than
related to deep learning characteristics. Finally, we also compare our results
with the study on TensorFlow, highlighting similarities and differences across
the bug identification and fixing process.

<p class="mathjax">Many studies have shown that humans are "predictably irrational": they do not
act in a fully rational way, but their deviations from rational behavior are
quite systematic. Our goal is to see the extent to which we can explain and
justify these deviations as the outcome of rational but resource-bounded agents
doing as well as they can, given their limitations. We focus on the
well-studied ranger-poacher game, where rangers are trying to protect a number
of sites from poaching. We capture the computational limitations by modeling
the poacher and the ranger as probabilistic finite automata (PFAs). We show
that, with sufficiently large memory, PFAs learn to play the Nash equilibrium
(NE) strategies of the game and achieve the NE utility. However, if we restrict
the memory, we get more "human-like" behaviors, such as probability matching
(i.e., visiting sites in proportion to the probability of a rhino being there),
and avoiding sites where there was a bad outcome (e.g., the poacher was caught
by the ranger), that we also observed in experiments conducted on Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Interestingly, we find that adding human-like behaviors such
as probability matching and overweighting significant events (like getting
caught) actually improves performance, showing that this seemingly irrational
behavior can be quite rational.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family
of large language models via a component perspective. The paper first examines
how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. Second, it
systematically varies aspects of situations to impact emotion intensity and
coping tendencies. Even without the use of prompt engineering, it is shown that
GPT's predictions align significantly with human-provided appraisals and
emotional labels. However, GPT faces difficulties predicting emotion intensity
and coping responses. GPT-4 showed the highest performance in the initial study
but fell short in the second, despite providing superior results after minor
prompt engineering. This assessment brings up questions on how to effectively
employ the strong points and address the weak areas of these models,
particularly concerning response variability. These studies underscore the
merits of evaluating models from a componential perspective.

<p class="mathjax">We consider joint trajectory generation and tracking control for
under-actuated robotic systems. A common solution is to use a layered control
architecture, where the top layer uses a simplified model of system dynamics
for trajectory generation, and the low layer ensures approximate tracking of
this trajectory via feedback control. While such layered control architectures
are standard and work well in practice, selecting the simplified model used for
trajectory generation typically relies on engineering intuition and experience.
In this paper, we propose an alternative data-driven approach to dynamics-aware
trajectory generation. We show that a suitable augmented Lagrangian
reformulation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem results in a
layered decomposition of the overall problem into trajectory planning and
feedback control layers. Crucially, the resulting trajectory optimization is
dynamics-aware, in that, it is modified with a tracking penalty regularizer
encoding the dynamic feasibility of the generated trajectory. We show that this
tracking penalty regularizer can be learned from system rollouts for
independently-designed low layer feedback control policies, and instantiate our
framework in the context of a unicycle and a quadrotor control problem in
simulation. Further, we show that our approach handles the sim-to-real gap
through experiments on the quadrotor hardware platform without any additional
training. For both the synthetic unicycle example and the quadrotor system, our
framework shows significant improvements in both computation time and dynamic
feasibility in simulation and hardware experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Flexural wave scattering plays a crucial role in optimizing and designing
structures for various engineering applications. Mathematically, the flexural
wave scattering problem on an infinite thin plate is described by a
fourth-order plate-wave equation on an unbounded domain, making it challenging
to solve directly using the regular linear finite element method (FEM). In this
paper, we propose two numerical methods, the interior penalty FEM (IP-FEM) and
the boundary penalty FEM (BP-FEM) with a transparent boundary condition (TBC),
to study flexural wave scattering by an arbitrary-shaped cavity on an infinite
thin plate. Both methods decompose the fourth-order plate-wave equation into
the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations with coupled conditions at the
cavity boundary. A TBC is then constructed based on the analytical solutions of
the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations in the exterior domain,
effectively truncating the unbounded domain into a bounded one. Using linear
triangular elements, the IP-FEM and BP-FEM successfully suppress the
oscillation of the bending moment of the solution at the cavity boundary,
demonstrating superior stability and accuracy compared to the regular linear
FEM when applied to this problem.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning methods to aid defence systems in detecting malicious
activity typically rely on labelled data. In some domains, such labelled data
is unavailable or incomplete. In practice this can lead to low detection rates
and high false positive rates, which characterise for example anti-money
laundering systems. In fact, it is estimated that 1.7--4 trillion euros are
laundered annually and go undetected. We propose The GANfather, a method to
generate samples with properties of malicious activity, without label
requirements. We propose to reward the generation of malicious samples by
introducing an extra objective to the typical Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) loss. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the detection of illicit
activity using the discriminator network as a novel and robust defence system.
Optionally, we may encourage the generator to bypass pre-existing detection
systems. This setup then reveals defensive weaknesses for the discriminator to
correct. We evaluate our method in two real-world use cases, money laundering
and recommendation systems. In the former, our method moves cumulative amounts
close to 350 thousand dollars through a network of accounts without being
detected by an existing system. In the latter, we recommend the target item to
a broad user base with as few as 30 synthetic attackers. In both cases, we
train a new defence system to capture the synthetic attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Underwater acoustic target detection in remote marine sensing operations is
challenging due to complex sound wave propagation. Despite the availability of
reliable sonar systems, target recognition remains a difficult problem. Various
methods address improved target recognition. However, most struggle to
disentangle the high-dimensional, non-linear patterns in the observed target
recordings. In this work, a novel method combines a time delay neural network

<p class="mathjax">In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays
a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various
domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles,
and many others.With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large
amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities
(e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies,
including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support
the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of
Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced
transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection
models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues
such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.
Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its
ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. Digital Twin (DT),
proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by
creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic
trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. However, the
effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of
long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. This paper
introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection
model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed
model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system
for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model.
Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate
the application of the proposed model.

their conventional synchronous treatment by showing how to naturally also
accommodate asynchrony within them, namely, by decoupling the execution of
operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be
executed, and interrupting a running computation with the operation's result,
to which the computation can react by installing interrupt handlers. We
formalise these ideas in a small core calculus and demonstrate its flexibility
using examples ranging from a multi-party web application, to pre-emptive
multi-threading, to (cancellable) remote function calls, to a parallel variant
of runners of algebraic effects. In addition, the paper is accompanied by a
formalisation of the calculus's type safety proofs in Agda, and a prototype

detection research proposes incorporating watermarks into machine-generated
text through random vocabulary restrictions and utilizing this information for
detection. While these watermarks only induce a slight deterioration in
perplexity, our empirical investigation reveals a significant detriment to the

a simple yet effective semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that considers the

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method yields substantial

gained popularity recently, enabling users to explain the predictions or
decision processes of AI models. This paper introduces Forest Monkey (FM), a
toolkit designed to reason the outputs of any AI-based defect detection and/or
classification model with data explainability. Implemented as a Python package,
FM takes input in the form of dataset folder paths (including original images,
ground truth labels, and predicted labels) and provides a set of charts and a
text file to illustrate the reasoning results and suggest possible
improvements. The FM toolkit consists of processes such as feature extraction
from predictions to reasoning targets, feature extraction from images to defect
characteristics, and a decision tree-based AI-Reasoner. Additionally, this
paper investigates the time performance of the FM toolkit when applied to four
AI models with different datasets. Lastly, a tutorial is provided to guide
users in performing reasoning tasks using the FM toolkit.

<p class="mathjax">Urban road-based risk prediction is a crucial yet challenging aspect of
research in transportation safety. While most existing studies emphasize
accurate prediction, they often overlook the importance of model uncertainty.
In this paper, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Zero-Inflated Negative
Binomial Graph Neural Network (STZINB-GNN) for road-level traffic risk
prediction, with a focus on uncertainty quantification. Our case study,
conducted in the Lambeth borough of London, UK, demonstrates the superior
performance of our approach in comparison to existing methods. Although the
negative binomial distribution may not be the most suitable choice for handling
real, non-binary risk levels, our work lays a solid foundation for future
research exploring alternative distribution models or techniques. Ultimately,
the STZINB-GNN contributes to enhanced transportation safety and data-driven
decision-making in urban planning by providing a more accurate and reliable
framework for road-level traffic risk prediction and uncertainty
quantification.

<p class="mathjax">The Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) is a generative model for relational
data, where nodes are represented via latent vectors in low-dimensional
Euclidean space. RDPGs crucially postulate that edge formation probabilities
are given by the dot product of the corresponding latent positions.
Accordingly, the embedding task of estimating these vectors from an observed
graph is typically posed as a low-rank matrix factorization problem. The
workhorse Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE) enjoys solid statistical
properties, but it is formally solving a surrogate problem and can be
computationally intensive. In this paper, we bring to bear recent advances in
non-convex optimization and demonstrate their impact to RDPG inference. We
advocate first-order gradient descent methods to better solve the embedding
problem, and to organically accommodate broader network embedding applications
of practical relevance. Notably, we argue that RDPG embeddings of directed
graphs loose interpretability unless the factor matrices are constrained to
have orthogonal columns. We thus develop a novel feasible optimization method
in the resulting manifold. The effectiveness of the graph representation
learning framework is demonstrated on reproducible experiments with both
synthetic and real network data. Our open-source algorithm implementations are
scalable, and unlike the ASE they are robust to missing edge data and can track
slowly-varying latent positions from streaming graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Waveform-based deep learning faces a dilemma between nonparametric and
parametric approaches. On one hand, convolutional neural networks (convnets)
may approximate any linear time-invariant system; yet, in practice, their
frequency responses become more irregular as their receptive fields grow. On
the other hand, a parametric model such as LEAF is guaranteed to yield Gabor
filters, hence an optimal time-frequency localization; yet, this strong
inductive bias comes at the detriment of representational capacity. In this
paper, we aim to overcome this dilemma by introducing a neural audio model,
named multiresolution neural network (MuReNN). The key idea behind MuReNN is to
train separate convolutional operators over the octave subbands of a discrete
wavelet transform (DWT). Since the scale of DWT atoms grows exponentially
between octaves, the receptive fields of the subsequent learnable convolutions
in MuReNN are dilated accordingly. For a given real-world dataset, we fit the
magnitude response of MuReNN to that of a well-established auditory filterbank:
Gammatone for speech, CQT for music, and third-octave for urban sounds,
respectively. This is a form of knowledge distillation (KD), in which the
filterbank ''teacher'' is engineered by domain knowledge while the neural
network ''student'' is optimized from data. We compare MuReNN to the state of
the art in terms of goodness of fit after KD on a hold-out set and in terms of
Heisenberg time-frequency localization. Compared to convnets and Gabor
convolutions, we find that MuReNN reaches state-of-the-art performance on all
three optimization problems.

<p class="mathjax">The core challenge of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is dealing with the
(potentially catastrophic) extrapolation error induced by the distribution
shift between the history dataset and the desired policy. A large portion of
prior work tackles this challenge by implicitly/explicitly regularizing the
learning policy towards the behavior policy, which is hard to estimate reliably
in practice. In this work, we propose to regularize towards the Q-function of
the behavior policy instead of the behavior policy itself, under the premise
that the Q-function can be estimated more reliably and easily by a SARSA-style
estimate and handles the extrapolation error more straightforwardly. We propose
two algorithms taking advantage of the estimated Q-function through
regularizations, and demonstrate they exhibit strong performance on the D4RL
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">These are self-contained lecture notes for spectral independence. For an
$n$-vertex graph, the spectral independence condition is a bound on the maximum
eigenvalue of the $n\times n$ influence matrix whose entries capture the
influence between pairs of vertices, it is closely related to the covariance
matrix. We will present recent results showing that spectral independence
implies the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is polynomial (where the degree
of the polynomial depends on certain parameters). The proof utilizes
local-to-global theorems which we will detail in these notes. Finally, we will
present more recent results showing that spectral independence implies an
optimal bound on the relaxation time (inverse spectral gap) and with some
additional conditions implies an optimal mixing time bound of $O(n\log{n})$ for
the Glauber dynamics. Our focus is on the analysis of the spectral gap of the
Glauber dynamics from a functional analysis perspective of analyzing the
associated local and global variance, and we present proofs of the associated
local-to-global theorems from this same Markov chain perspective.

<p class="mathjax">Text-embedded images can serve as a means of spreading hate speech,
propaganda, and extremist beliefs. Throughout the Russia-Ukraine war, both
opposing factions heavily relied on text-embedded images as a vehicle for
spreading propaganda and hate speech. Ensuring the effective detection of hate
speech and propaganda is of utmost importance to mitigate the negative effect
of hate speech dissemination. In this paper, we outline our methodologies for
two subtasks of Multimodal Hate Speech Event Detection 2023. For the first
subtask, hate speech detection, we utilize multimodal deep learning models
boosted by ensemble learning and syntactical text attributes. For the second
subtask, target detection, we employ multimodal deep learning models boosted by
named entity features. Through experimentation, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our models compared to all textual, visual, and text-visual
baselines employed in multimodal hate speech detection. Furthermore, our models
achieve the first place in both subtasks on the final leaderboard of the shared
task.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the simplest deep learning optimizer
with which to train deep neural networks. While SGD can use various learning
rates, such as constant or diminishing rates, the previous numerical results
showed that SGD performs better than other deep learning optimizers using when
it uses learning rates given by line search methods. In this paper, we perform
a convergence analysis on SGD with a learning rate given by an Armijo line
search for nonconvex optimization. The analysis indicates that the upper bound
of the expectation of the squared norm of the full gradient becomes small when
the number of steps and the batch size are large. Next, we show that, for SGD
with the Armijo-line-search learning rate, the number of steps needed for
nonconvex optimization is a monotone decreasing convex function of the batch
size; that is, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization decreases
as the batch size increases. Furthermore, we show that the stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic gradient
computation cost, is a convex function of the batch size; that is, there exists
a critical batch size that minimizes the SFO complexity. Finally, we provide
numerical results that support our theoretical results. The numerical results
indicate that the number of steps needed for training deep neural networks
decreases as the batch size increases and that there exist the critical batch
sizes that can be estimated from the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Side-channel attacks pose significant challenges to the security of embedded
systems, often allowing attackers to circumvent encryption algorithms in
minutes compared to the trillions of years required for brute-force attacks. To
mitigate these vulnerabilities, various countermeasures have been developed.
This study focuses on two specific countermeasures: randomization of the
encryption algorithm's clock and the incorporation of a dummy core to disguise
power traces.
<br />The objective of this research is to identify the optimal frequencies that
yield the highest level of randomness when these two countermeasures are
combined. By investigating the interplay between clock randomization and the
presence of dummy cores, we aim to enhance the overall security of embedded
systems. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the development
of more robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, bolstering the
protection of sensitive information and systems.
<br />To achieve this, we conduct simulations and perform side-channel attacks on
an FPGA to establish the relationship between frequencies and the resulting
protection. We break the encryption on a non-duplicated circuit and note the
least amount of measured power traces necessary and the timing overhead. We do
this for all sets of frequencies considered which gives a good indication of
which sets of frequencies give good protection. By comparing the frequencies
generated with those from the duplicated circuit we use similar conclusions to
prove whether a frequency set is secure or not.
<br />Based on our results we argue that having one frequency lower than half of
the base frequency and the other frequencies being close but not higher than
the base gives the highest security compared to the timing overhead measured.

<p class="mathjax">Distributions on integers are ubiquitous in probabilistic modeling but remain
challenging for many of today's probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). The
core challenge comes from discrete structure: many of today's PPL inference
strategies rely on enumeration, sampling, or differentiation in order to scale,
which fail for high-dimensional complex discrete distributions involving
integers. Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these
approaches are not using. We present a binary encoding strategy for discrete
distributions that exploits the rich logical structure of integer operations
like summation and comparison. We leverage this structured encoding with
knowledge compilation to perform exact probabilistic inference, and show that
this approach scales to much larger integer distributions with arithmetic.

<p class="mathjax">Crafting effective deep learning models for medical image analysis is a
complex task, particularly in cases where the medical image dataset lacks
significant inter-class variation. This challenge is further aggravated when
employing such datasets to generate synthetic images using generative
adversarial networks (GANs), as the output of GANs heavily relies on the input
data. In this research, we propose a novel filtering algorithm called Cosine
Similarity-based Image Filtering (CosSIF). We leverage CosSIF to develop two
distinct filtering methods: Filtering Before GAN Training (FBGT) and Filtering
After GAN Training (FAGT). FBGT involves the removal of real images that
exhibit similarities to images of other classes before utilizing them as the
training dataset for a GAN. On the other hand, FAGT focuses on eliminating
synthetic images with less discriminative features compared to real images used
for training the GAN. Experimental results reveal that employing either the
FAGT or FBGT method with modern transformer and convolutional-based networks
leads to substantial performance gains in various evaluation metrics. FAGT
implementation on the ISIC-2016 dataset surpasses the baseline method in terms
of sensitivity by 1.59\% and AUC by 1.88\%. Furthermore, for the HAM10000
dataset, applying FABT outperforms the baseline approach in terms of recall by
13.75\%, and with the sole implementation of FAGT, achieves a maximum accuracy
of 94.44\%.

<p class="mathjax">Reachability types are a recent proposal that has shown promise in scaling to
higher-order but monomorphic settings, tracking aliasing and separation on top
of a substrate inspired by separation logic. The prior $\lambda^*$ reachability
type system qualifies types with sets of reachable variables and guarantees
separation if two terms have disjoint qualifiers. However, naive extensions
with type polymorphism and/or precise reachability polymorphism are unsound,
making $\lambda^*$ unsuitable for adoption in real languages. Combining
reachability and type polymorphism that is precise, sound, and parametric
remains an open challenge.
<br />This paper presents a rethinking of the design of reachability tracking and
proposes a solution to the key challenge of reachability polymorphism. Instead
of always tracking the transitive closure of reachable variables as in the
original design, we only track variables reachable in a single step and compute
transitive closures only when necessary, thus preserving chains of reachability
over known variables that can be refined using substitution. To enable this
property, we introduce a new freshness qualifier, which indicates variables
whose reachability sets may grow during evaluation steps. These ideas yield the
simply-typed $\lambda^\diamond$-calculus with precise lightweight, i.e.,
quantifier-free, reachability polymorphism, and the
$\mathsf{F}_{&lt;:}^\diamond$-calculus with bounded parametric polymorphism over
types and reachability qualifiers. We prove type soundness and a preservation
of separation property in Coq.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces TeleBTC, a fully decentralized protocol designed to
wrap Bitcoin (BTC) on programmable blockchains. The creation of a decentralized
wrapped BTC presents challenges due to the non-programmable nature of Bitcoin,
making it difficult to custody BTCs in a decentralized way. Existing solutions
have addressed this challenge by introducing an external layer of validators
who take custody of users' BTCs. However, the security and decentralization of
this layer are inferior to the underlying blockchains on which wrapped BTC is
built. Moreover, the process of joining or leaving for a validator has become
overly complex and expensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
approach that eliminates the need for such an external layer by leveraging the
light client bridge protocol. Additionally, we employ economic mechanisms such
as incentivization and slashing, resulting in a secure and trust-minimized
wrapped BTC solution. With TeleBTC, users can seamlessly transfer their BTC to
other blockchains and utilize it within decentralized applications.
Furthermore, they can unwrap their TeleBTC and reclaim the native BTC. To
address the high costs associated with light client bridges, we present an
optimistic approach that minimizes the cost. This approach significantly
reduces the operational expenses of running the protocol.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding multimodal perception for embodied AI is an open question
because such inputs may contain highly complementary as well as redundant
information for the task. A relevant direction for multimodal policies is
understanding the global trends of each modality at the fusion layer. To this
end, we disentangle the attributions for visual, language, and previous action
inputs across different policies trained on the ALFRED dataset. Attribution
analysis can be utilized to rank and group the failure scenarios, investigate
modeling and dataset biases, and critically analyze multimodal EAI policies for
robustness and user trust before deployment. We present MAEA, a framework to
compute global attributions per modality of any differentiable policy. In
addition, we show how attributions enable lower-level behavior analysis in EAI
policies for language and visual attributions.

<p class="mathjax">Decentralized machine learning has broadened its scope recently with the
invention of Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL), and their hybrids
like Split Federated Learning (SplitFed or SFL). The goal of SFL is to reduce
the computational power required by each client in FL and parallelize SL while
maintaining privacy. This paper investigates the robustness of SFL against
packet loss on communication links. The performance of various SFL aggregation
strategies is examined by splitting the model at two points -- shallow split
and deep split -- and testing whether the split point makes a statistically
significant difference to the accuracy of the final model. Experiments are
carried out on a segmentation model for human embryo images and indicate the
statistically significant advantage of a deeper split point.

<p class="mathjax">With generative AI advances, the exciting potential for autonomous agents to
manage daily tasks via natural language commands has emerged. However, cur rent
agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments,
substantially limiting real-world scenario representation. In this paper, we
build an environment for agent command and control that is highly realistic and
reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on websites,
and we create an environment with fully functional websites from four common
domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software
development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools
(e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage
human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of
benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task
completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and are
designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We
design and implement several autonomous agents, integrating recent techniques
such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex
tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end
task success rate of 10.59%. These results highlight the need for further
development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art LMs are far from
perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to
measure such progress. Our code, data, environment reproduction resources, and
video demonstrations are publicly available at https://webarena.dev/.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional layers have long served as the primary workhorse for image
classification. Recently, an alternative to convolution was proposed using the
Sharpened Cosine Similarity (SCS), which in theory may serve as a better
feature detector. While multiple sources report promising results, there has
not been to date a full-scale empirical analysis of neural network performance
using these new layers. In our work, we explore SCS's parameter behavior and
potential as a drop-in replacement for convolutions in multiple CNN
architectures benchmarked on CIFAR-10. We find that while SCS may not yield
significant increases in accuracy, it may learn more interpretable
representations. We also find that, in some circumstances, SCS may confer a
slight increase in adversarial robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Following their success in visual recognition tasks, Vision
Transformers(ViTs) are being increasingly employed for image restoration. As a
few recent works claim that ViTs for image classification also have better
robustness properties, we investigate whether the improved adversarial
robustness of ViTs extends to image restoration. We consider the recently
proposed Restormer model, as well as NAFNet and the "Baseline network" which
are both simplified versions of a Restormer. We use Projected Gradient Descent
(PGD) and CosPGD, a recently proposed adversarial attack tailored to pixel-wise
prediction tasks for our robustness evaluation. Our experiments are performed
on real-world images from the GoPro dataset for image deblurring. Our analysis
indicates that contrary to as advocated by ViTs in image classification works,
these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. We attempt to
improve their robustness through adversarial training. While this yields a
significant increase in robustness for Restormer, results on other networks are
less promising. Interestingly, the design choices in NAFNet and Baselines,
which were based on iid performance, and not on robust generalization, seem to
be at odds with the model robustness. Thus, we investigate this further and
find a fix.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work has shown that when both the chart and caption emphasize the same
aspects of the data, readers tend to remember the doubly-emphasized features as
takeaways; when there is a mismatch, readers rely on the chart to form
takeaways and can miss information in the caption text. Through a survey of 280
chart-caption pairs in real-world sources (e.g., news media, poll reports,
government reports, academic articles, and Tableau Public), we find that
captions often do not emphasize the same information in practice, which could
limit how effectively readers take away the authors' intended messages.
Motivated by the survey findings, we present EmphasisChecker, an interactive
tool that highlights visually prominent chart features as well as the features
emphasized by the caption text along with any mismatches in the emphasis. The
tool implements a time-series prominent feature detector based on the
Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and a text reference extractor that identifies
time references and data descriptions in the caption and matches them with
chart data. This information enables authors to compare features emphasized by
these two modalities, quickly see mismatches, and make necessary revisions. A
user study confirms that our tool is both useful and easy to use when authoring
charts and captions.

random rounding, which independently and probabilistically rounds discrete
numerical attribute values. In this work, we explore how hierarchical summative
correlation between discrete variables allows for both probabilistic and exact
solutions to attribute values in the 2021 Canadian Census disclosure. We
demonstrate that, in some cases, it is possible to "unround" and extract the
original private values before rounding, both in the presence and absence of
provided population invariants. Using these methods, we expose the exact value
of 624 previously private attributes in the 2021 Canadian census disclosure. We
also infer the potential values of more than 1000 private attributes with a
high probability of correctness. Finally, we propose how a simple solution
based on unbounded discrete noise can effectively negate exact unrounding while
maintaining high utility in the final product.

<p class="mathjax">Automated design of analog and radio-frequency circuits using supervised or
reinforcement learning from simulation data has recently been studied as an
alternative to manual expert design. It is straightforward for a design agent
to learn an inverse function from desired performance metrics to circuit
parameters. However, it is more common for a user to have threshold performance
criteria rather than an exact target vector of feasible performance measures.
In this work, we propose a method for generating from simulation data a dataset
on which a system can be trained via supervised learning to design circuits to
meet threshold specifications. We moreover perform the to-date most extensive
evaluation of automated analog circuit design, including experimenting in a
significantly more diverse set of circuits than in prior work, covering linear,
nonlinear, and autonomous circuit configurations, and show that our method
consistently reaches success rate better than 90% at 5% error margin, while
also improving data efficiency by upward of an order of magnitude. A demo of
this system is available at circuits.streamlit.app

<p class="mathjax">In the field of medical imaging, 3D deep learning models play a crucial role
in building powerful predictive models of disease progression. However, the
size of these models presents significant challenges, both in terms of
computational resources and data requirements. Moreover, achieving high-quality
pretraining of 3D models proves to be even more challenging. To address these
issues, hybrid 2.5D approaches provide an effective solution for utilizing 3D
volumetric data efficiently using 2D models. Combining 2D and 3D techniques
offers a promising avenue for optimizing performance while minimizing memory
requirements. In this paper, we explore 2.5D architectures based on a
combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory
(LSTM), and Transformers. In addition, leveraging the benefits of recent
non-contrastive pretraining approaches in 2D, we enhanced the performance and
data efficiency of 2.5D techniques even further. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of architectures and associated pretraining on a task of
predicting progression to wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) within a
six-month period on two large longitudinal OCT datasets.

the solution is defined by an integral over the domain. Therefore, the
physics-informed loss only provides a finite approximation, and selecting
appropriate collocation points becomes crucial to suppress the discretization
errors, although this aspect has often been overlooked. In this paper, we
propose a new technique called good lattice training (GLT) for PINNs, inspired
by number theoretic methods for numerical analysis. GLT offers a set of
collocation points that are effective even with a small number of points and
for multi-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that GLT requires
2--20 times fewer collocation points (resulting in lower computational cost)
than uniformly random sampling or Latin hypercube sampling, while achieving
competitive performance.

<p class="mathjax">When writing programs, people have the ability to tackle a new complex task
by decomposing it into smaller and more familiar subtasks. While it is
difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar
capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is,
whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently
able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several
different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program
synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks
for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a
novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals
to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step.
ExeDec has better synthesis performance and greatly improved compositional
generalization ability compared to baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models often need to be robust to noisy input data. The
effect of real-world noise (which is often random) on model predictions is
captured by a model's local robustness, i.e., the consistency of model
predictions in a local region around an input. However, the na\"ive approach to
computing local robustness based on Monte-Carlo sampling is statistically
inefficient, leading to prohibitive computational costs for large-scale
applications. In this work, we develop the first analytical estimators to
efficiently compute local robustness of multi-class discriminative models using
local linear function approximation and the multivariate Normal CDF. Through
the derivation of these estimators, we show how local robustness is connected
to concepts such as randomized smoothing and softmax probability. We also
confirm empirically that these estimators accurately and efficiently compute
the local robustness of standard deep learning models. In addition, we
demonstrate these estimators' usefulness for various tasks involving local
robustness, such as measuring robustness bias and identifying examples that are
vulnerable to noise perturbation in a dataset. By developing these analytical
estimators, this work not only advances conceptual understanding of local
robustness, but also makes its computation practical, enabling the use of local
robustness in critical downstream applications.

<p class="mathjax">The current framework for climate change negotiation models presents several
limitations that warrant further research and development. In this track, we
discuss mainly two key areas for improvement, focusing on the geographical
impacts and utility framework. In the aspects of geographical impacts, We
explore five critical aspects: (1) the shift from local to global impact, (2)
variability in climate change effects across regions, (3) heterogeneity in
geographical location and political structures, and (4) collaborations between
adjacent nations, (5) the importance of including historical and cultural
factors influencing climate negotiations. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to
refine the utility and rewards framework to reduce the homogeneity and the
level of overestimating the climate mitigation by integrating the positive
effects of saving rates into the reward function and heterogeneity among all
regions. By addressing these limitations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and
effectiveness of climate change negotiation models, enabling policymakers and
stakeholders to devise targeted and appropriate strategies to tackle climate
change at both regional and global levels.

<p class="mathjax">As our submission for track three of the AI for Global Climate Cooperation
(AI4GCC) competition, we propose a negotiation protocol for use in the RICE-N
climate-economic simulation. Our proposal seeks to address the challenges of
carbon leakage through methods inspired by the Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism (CBAM) and Climate Clubs (CC). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by comparing simulated outcomes to representative concentration
pathways (RCP) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP). Our protocol results in
a temperature rise comparable to RCP 3.4/4.5 and SSP 2. Furthermore, we provide
an analysis of our protocol's World Trade Organization compliance,
administrative and political feasibility, and ethical concerns. We recognize
that our proposal risks hurting the least developing countries, and we suggest
specific corrective measures to avoid exacerbating existing inequalities, such
as technology sharing and wealth redistribution. Future research should improve
the RICE-N tariff mechanism and implement actions allowing for the
aforementioned corrective measures.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a dynamic grouping negotiation model for climate
mitigation based on real-world business and political negotiation protocols.
Within the AI4GCC competition framework, we develop a three-stage process:
group formation and updates, intra-group negotiation, and inter-group
negotiation. Our model promotes efficient and effective cooperation between
various stakeholders to achieve global climate change objectives. By
implementing a group-forming method and group updating strategy, we address the
complexities and imbalances in multi-region climate negotiations. Intra-group
negotiations ensure that all members contribute to mitigation efforts, while
inter-group negotiations use the proposal-evaluation framework to set
mitigation and savings rates. We demonstrate our negotiation model within the
RICE-N framework, illustrating a promising approach for facilitating
international cooperation on climate change mitigation.

<p class="mathjax">We study few-shot Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks with Large
Language Models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) scenarios. It is a
challenging task due to limited labeled data and communication capacities in
FL, especially with mobile devices. Recent studies show LLMs can be prompted to
perform few-shot NLU tasks like sentiment analysis and arithmetic reasoning.
However, the huge sizes of LLMs result in high computation and communication
costs, making classical FL schemes impractical. To address these challenges, we
propose Low-Parameter Federated Learning (LP-FL). LP-FL combines few-shot
prompt learning from LLMs with efficient communication and federating
techniques. Our approach enables federated clients to assign soft labels to
unlabeled data using gradually learned knowledge from the global model. Through
iterative soft-label assigning, we continually expand the labeled set during
the FL process. Additionally, to reduce computation and communication costs,
LP-FL utilizes the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for compact learnable
parameter construction, efficient local model fine-tuning, and affordable
global model federation. LP-FL consistently outperforms Full-Parameter
Federated Learning (FP-FL) in sentiment analysis tasks across various FL
settings. Its resistance to overfitting allows LP-FL to equal or surpass
centralized training in few-shot scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Skin lesion segmentation (SLS) plays an important role in skin lesion
analysis. Vision transformers (ViTs) are considered an auspicious solution for
SLS, but they require more training data compared to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) due to their inherent parameter-heavy structure and lack of
some inductive biases. To alleviate this issue, current approaches fine-tune
pre-trained ViT backbones on SLS datasets, aiming to leverage the knowledge
learned from a larger set of natural images to lower the amount of skin
training data needed. However, fully fine-tuning all parameters of large
backbones is computationally expensive and memory intensive. In this paper, we
propose AViT, a novel efficient strategy to mitigate ViTs' data-hunger by
transferring any pre-trained ViTs to the SLS task. Specifically, we integrate
lightweight modules (adapters) within the transformer layers, which modulate
the feature representation of a ViT without updating its pre-trained weights.
In addition, we employ a shallow CNN as a prompt generator to create a prompt
embedding from the input image, which grasps fine-grained information and CNN's
inductive biases to guide the segmentation task on small datasets. Our
quantitative experiments on 4 skin lesion datasets demonstrate that AViT
achieves competitive, and at times superior, performance to SOTA but with
significantly fewer trainable parameters. Our code is available at
https://github.com/siyi-wind/AViT.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates methods for improving generative data augmentation
for deep learning. Generative data augmentation leverages the synthetic samples
produced by generative models as an additional dataset for classification with
small dataset settings. A key challenge of generative data augmentation is that
the synthetic data contain uninformative samples that degrade accuracy. This is
because the synthetic samples do not perfectly represent class categories in
real data and uniform sampling does not necessarily provide useful samples for
tasks. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for generative data
augmentation called meta generative regularization (MGR). To avoid the
degradation of generative data augmentation, MGR utilizes synthetic samples in
the regularization term for feature extractors instead of in the loss function,
e.g., cross-entropy. These synthetic samples are dynamically determined to
minimize the validation losses through meta-learning. We observed that MGR can
avoid the performance degradation of na\"ive generative data augmentation and
boost the baselines. Experiments on six datasets showed that MGR is effective
particularly when datasets are smaller and stably outperforms baselines.

<p class="mathjax">We present YOLOBench, a benchmark comprised of 550+ YOLO-based object
detection models on 4 different datasets and 4 different embedded hardware
platforms (x86 CPU, ARM CPU, Nvidia GPU, NPU). We collect accuracy and latency
numbers for a variety of YOLO-based one-stage detectors at different model
scales by performing a fair, controlled comparison of these detectors with a
fixed training environment (code and training hyperparameters).
Pareto-optimality analysis of the collected data reveals that, if modern
detection heads and training techniques are incorporated into the learning
process, multiple architectures of the YOLO series achieve a good
accuracy-latency trade-off, including older models like YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. We
also evaluate training-free accuracy estimators used in neural architecture
search on YOLOBench and demonstrate that, while most state-of-the-art zero-cost
accuracy estimators are outperformed by a simple baseline like MAC count, some
of them can be effectively used to predict Pareto-optimal detection models. We
showcase that by using a zero-cost proxy to identify a YOLO architecture
competitive against a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model on a Raspberry Pi 4 CPU.

<p class="mathjax">Deep operator networks (DeepONets) have demonstrated their capability of
approximating nonlinear operators for initial- and boundary-value problems. One
attractive feature of DeepONets is their versatility since they do not rely on
prior knowledge about the solution structure of a problem and can thus be
directly applied to a large class of problems. However, convergence in
identifying the parameters of the networks may sometimes be slow. In order to
improve on DeepONets for approximating the wave equation, we introduce the
Green operator networks (GreenONets), which use the representation of the exact
solution to the homogeneous wave equation in term of the Green's function. The
performance of GreenONets and DeepONets is compared on a series of numerical
experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media in one and two dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">I study the problem of learning a Lipschitz function with corrupted binary
signals. The learner tries to learn a Lipschitz function $f$ that the adversary
chooses. In each round, the adversary selects a context vector $x_t$ in the
input space, and the learner makes a guess to the true function value $f(x_t)$
and receives a binary signal indicating whether the guess was high or low. In a
total of $C$ rounds, the signal may be corrupted, though the value of $C$ is
unknown to the learner. The learner's goal is to incur a small cumulative loss.
I present a natural yet powerful technique sanity check, which proves useful in
designing corruption-robust algorithms. I design algorithms which (treating the
Lipschitz parameter $L$ as constant): for the symmetric loss, the learner
achieves regret $O(C\log T)$ with $d = 1$ and $O_d(C\log T + T^{(d-1)/d})$ with
$d &gt; 1$; for the pricing loss the learner achieves regret $\widetilde{O}
(T^{d/(d+1)} + C\cdot T^{1/(d+1)})$.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose reinforcement learning (RL) for sequential decoding
of moderate length generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes. Here,
sequential decoding refers to scheduling all the generalized constraint nodes
(GCNs) and single parity-check nodes (SPCNs) of a GLDPC code serially in each
iteration. A GLDPC decoding environment is modeled as a finite Markov decision
process (MDP) in which the state-space comprises of all possible sequences of
hard-decision values of the variables nodes (VNs) connected to the scheduled
GCN or SPCN, and the action-space of the MDP consists of all possible actions
(GCN and SPCN scheduling). The goal of RL is to determine an optimized
scheduling policy, i.e., one that results in a decoded codeword by minimizing
the complexity of the belief propagation (BP) decoder. For training, we
consider the proportion of correct bits at the output of the GCN or SPCN as a
reward once it is scheduled. The expected rewards for scheduling all the
GCNs/SPCNs in the code's Tanner graph are earned via BP decoding during the RL
phase. The proposed RL-based decoding scheme is shown to significantly
outperform the standard BP flooding decoder, as well as a sequential decoder in
which the GCNs/SPCNs are scheduled randomly.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven, neural network (NN) based anomaly detection and predictive
maintenance are emerging research areas. NN-based analytics of time-series data
offer valuable insights into past behaviors and estimates of critical
parameters like remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment and state-of-charge
(SOC) of batteries. However, input time series data can be exposed to
intentional or unintentional noise when passing through sensors, necessitating
robust validation and verification of these NNs. This paper presents a case
study of the robustness verification approach for time series regression NNs
(TSRegNN) using set-based formal methods. It focuses on utilizing
variable-length input data to streamline input manipulation and enhance network
architecture generalizability. The method is applied to two data sets in the
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) application areas: (1) SOC estimation
of a Lithium-ion battery and (2) RUL estimation of a turbine engine. The NNs'
robustness is checked using star-based reachability analysis, and several
performance measures evaluate the effect of bounded perturbations in the input
on network outputs, i.e., future outcomes. Overall, the paper offers a
comprehensive case study for validating and verifying NN-based analytics of
time-series data in real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of
robustness testing for accurate and reliable predictions, especially
considering the impact of noise on future outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-3D generation has recently garnered significant attention, fueled by
2D diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs. Existing methods
primarily rely on score distillation to leverage the 2D diffusion priors to
supervise the generation of 3D models, e.g., NeRF. However, score distillation
is prone to suffer the view inconsistency problem, and implicit NeRF modeling
can also lead to an arbitrary shape, thus leading to less realistic and
uncontrollable 3D generation. In this work, we propose a flexible framework of
Points-to-3D to bridge the gap between sparse yet freely available 3D points
and realistic shape-controllable 3D generation by distilling the knowledge from
both 2D and 3D diffusion models. The core idea of Points-to-3D is to introduce
controllable sparse 3D points to guide the text-to-3D generation. Specifically,
we use the sparse point cloud generated from the 3D diffusion model, Point-E,
as the geometric prior, conditioned on a single reference image. To better
utilize the sparse 3D points, we propose an efficient point cloud guidance loss
to adaptively drive the NeRF's geometry to align with the shape of the sparse
3D points. In addition to controlling the geometry, we propose to optimize the
NeRF for a more view-consistent appearance. To be specific, we perform score
distillation to the publicly available 2D image diffusion model ControlNet,
conditioned on text as well as depth map of the learned compact geometry.
Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that Points-to-3D improves
view consistency and achieves good shape controllability for text-to-3D
generation. Points-to-3D provides users with a new way to improve and control
text-to-3D generation.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks have emerged as an effective machine learning tool for
multi-disciplinary tasks such as pharmaceutical molecule classification and
chemical reaction prediction, because they can model non-euclidean
relationships between different entities. Particle crushing, as a significant
field of civil engineering, describes the breakage of granular materials caused
by the breakage of particle fragment bonds under the modeling of numerical
simulations, which motivates us to characterize the mechanical behaviors of
particle crushing through the connectivity of particle fragments with Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). However, there lacks an open-source large-scale
particle crushing dataset for research due to the expensive costs of laboratory
tests or numerical simulations. Therefore, we firstly generate a dataset with
45,000 numerical simulations and 900 particle types to facilitate the research
progress of machine learning for particle crushing. Secondly, we devise a
hybrid framework based on GNNs to predict particle crushing strength in a
particle fragment view with the advances of state of the art GNNs. Finally, we
compare our hybrid framework against traditional machine learning methods and
the plain MLP to verify its effectiveness. The usefulness of different features
is further discussed through the gradient attribution explanation w.r.t the
predictions. Our data and code are released at
https://github.com/doujiang-zheng/GNN-For-Particle-Crushing.

<p class="mathjax">The conventional single-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to
improve the recommendation performance on a sparser target domain by
transferring the knowledge from a source domain that contains relatively richer
information. By contrast, in recent years, dual-target CDR has been proposed to
improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously. However,
to this end, there are two challenges in dual-target CDR: (1) how to generate
both relevant and diverse augmented user representations, and (2) how to
effectively decouple domain-independent information from domain-specific
information, in addition to domain-shared information, to capture comprehensive
user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a
Disentanglement-based framework with Interpolative Data Augmentation for
dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called DIDA-CDR. In DIDA-CDR, we first
propose an interpolative data augmentation approach to generating both relevant
and diverse augmented user representations to augment sparser domain and
explore potential user preferences. We then propose a disentanglement module to
effectively decouple domain-specific and domain-independent information to
capture comprehensive user preferences. Both steps significantly contribute to
capturing more comprehensive user preferences, thereby improving the
recommendation performance on each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on
five real-world datasets show the significant superiority of DIDA-CDR over the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Can we design artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media
feeds to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as
part of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating
established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions,
which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with
application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes.
Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models,
however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative
codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation
into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create
a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media
post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude
model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and
behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by
manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic
attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these
scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants'
partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In
Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude
model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study
3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual
labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find
that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced
partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on
social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media
AIs.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian causal discovery aims to infer the posterior distribution over
causal models from observed data, quantifying epistemic uncertainty and
benefiting downstream tasks. However, computational challenges arise due to
joint inference over combinatorial space of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and
nonlinear functions. Despite recent progress towards efficient posterior
inference over DAGs, existing methods are either limited to variational
inference on node permutation matrices for linear causal models, leading to
compromised inference accuracy, or continuous relaxation of adjacency matrices
constrained by a DAG regularizer, which cannot ensure resulting graphs are
DAGs. In this work, we introduce a scalable Bayesian causal discovery framework
based on stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) that overcomes
these limitations. Our approach directly samples DAGs from the posterior
without requiring any DAG regularization, simultaneously draws function
parameter samples and is applicable to both linear and nonlinear causal models.
To enable our approach, we derive a novel equivalence to the permutation-based
DAG learning, which opens up possibilities of using any relaxed gradient
estimator defined over permutations. To our knowledge, this is the first
framework applying gradient-based MCMC sampling for causal discovery. Empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the algorithmic problem of finding large \textit{balanced}
independent sets in sparse random bipartite graphs, and more generally the
problem of finding independent sets with specified proportions of vertices on
each side of the bipartition. In a bipartite graph it is trivial to find an
independent set of density at least half (take one of the partition classes).
In contrast, in a random bipartite graph of average degree $d$, the largest
balanced independent sets (containing equal number of vertices from each class)
are typically of density $(2+o_d(1)) \frac{\log d}{d}$. Can we find such large
balanced independent sets in these graphs efficiently? By utilizing the overlap
gap property and the low-degree algorithmic framework, we prove that local and
low-degree algorithms (even those that know the bipartition) cannot find
balanced independent sets of density greater than $(1+\epsilon) \frac{\log
d}{d}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ fixed and $d$ large but constant. This factor $2$
statistical--computational gap between what exists and what local algorithms
can achieve is analogous to the gap for finding large independent sets in
(non-bipartite) random graphs. Our results therefor suggest that this gap is
pervasive in many models, and that hard computational problems can lurk inside
otherwise tractable ones. A particularly striking aspect of the gap in
bipartite graphs is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is extremely
simple and can be implemented as a $1$-local algorithm and a degree-$1$
polynomial (a linear function).

<p class="mathjax">The behaviour of multi-agent learning in many player games has been shown to
display complex dynamics outside of restrictive examples such as network
zero-sum games. In addition, it has been shown that convergent behaviour is
less likely to occur as the number of players increase. To make progress in
resolving this problem, we study Q-Learning dynamics and determine a sufficient
condition for the dynamics to converge to a unique equilibrium in any network
game. We find that this condition depends on the nature of pairwise
interactions and on the network structure, but is explicitly independent of the
total number of agents in the game. We evaluate this result on a number of
representative network games and show that, under suitable network conditions,
stable learning dynamics can be achieved with an arbitrary number of agents.

<p class="mathjax">Grammatical error correction aims to correct ungrammatical sentences
automatically. Recently, some work has demonstrated the excellent capabilities
of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) in grammatical
error correction. However, the potential of open-source LLMs remains
unexplored. In this paper, we introduced GrammarGPT, an open-source LLM, to
preliminary explore its potential for native Chinese grammatical error
correction. The core recipe of GrammarGPT is to leverage the hybrid dataset of
ChatGPT-generated and human-annotated. For grammatical errors with clues, we
proposed a heuristic method to guide ChatGPT to generate ungrammatical
sentences by providing those clues. For grammatical errors without clues, we
collected ungrammatical sentences from publicly available websites and manually
corrected them. In addition, we employed an error-invariant augmentation method
to enhance the ability of the model to correct native Chinese grammatical
errors. We ultimately constructed about 1k parallel data and utilized these
data to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., Phoenix, released by The Chinese
University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) with instruction tuning. The experimental
results show that GrammarGPT outperforms the existing SOTA system
significantly. Although model parameters are 20x larger than the SOTA baseline,
the required amount of data for instruction tuning is 1200x smaller,
illustrating the potential of open-source LLMs on native CGEC. Our GrammarGPT
ranks $3^{rd}$ on NLPCC2023 SharedTask1, demonstrating our approach's
effectiveness. The code and data are available at

<p class="mathjax">The field of trajectory forecasting has grown significantly in recent years,
partially owing to the release of numerous large-scale, real-world human
trajectory datasets for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrian motion
tracking. While such datasets have been a boon for the community, they each use
custom and unique data formats and APIs, making it cumbersome for researchers
to train and evaluate methods across multiple datasets. To remedy this, we
present trajdata: a unified interface to multiple human trajectory datasets. At
its core, trajdata provides a simple, uniform, and efficient representation and
API for trajectory and map data. As a demonstration of its capabilities, in
this work we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing
trajectory datasets, providing users with a rich understanding of the data
underpinning much of current pedestrian and AV motion forecasting research, and
proposing suggestions for future datasets from these insights. trajdata is

<p class="mathjax">3D anomaly detection is an emerging and vital computer vision task in
industrial manufacturing (IM). Recently many advanced algorithms have been
published, but most of them cannot meet the needs of IM. There are several
disadvantages: i) difficult to deploy on production lines since their
algorithms heavily rely on large pre-trained models; ii) hugely increase
storage overhead due to overuse of memory banks; iii) the inference speed
cannot be achieved in real-time. To overcome these issues, we propose an easy
and deployment-friendly network (called EasyNet) without using pre-trained
models and memory banks: firstly, we design a multi-scale multi-modality
feature encoder-decoder to accurately reconstruct the segmentation maps of
anomalous regions and encourage the interaction between RGB images and depth
images; secondly, we adopt a multi-modality anomaly segmentation network to
achieve a precise anomaly map; thirdly, we propose an attention-based
information entropy fusion module for feature fusion during inference, making
it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments show that EasyNet
achieves an anomaly detection AUROC of 92.6% without using pre-trained models
and memory banks. In addition, EasyNet is faster than existing methods, with a
high frame rate of 94.55 FPS on a Tesla V100 GPU.

<p class="mathjax">The level-$k$ $\ell_1$-Fourier weight of a Boolean function refers to the sum
of absolute values of its level-$k$ Fourier coefficients. Fourier growth refers
to the growth of these weights as $k$ grows. It has been extensively studied
for various computational models, and bounds on the Fourier growth, even for
the first few levels, have proven useful in learning theory, circuit lower
bounds, pseudorandomness, and quantum-classical separations.
<br />We investigate the Fourier growth of certain functions that naturally arise
from communication protocols for XOR functions (partial functions evaluated on
the bitwise XOR of the inputs to Alice and Bob). If a protocol $\mathcal C$
computes an XOR function, then $\mathcal C(x,y)$ is a function of the parity
$x\oplus y$. This motivates us to analyze the XOR-fiber of $\mathcal C$,
defined as $h(z):=\mathbb E_{x,y}[\mathcal C(x,y)|x\oplus y=z]$.
<br />We present improved Fourier growth bounds for the XOR-fibers of protocols
that communicate $d$ bits. For the first level, we show a tight $O(\sqrt d)$
bound and obtain a new coin theorem, as well as an alternative proof for the
tight randomized communication lower bound for Gap-Hamming. For the second
level, we show an $d^{3/2}\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ bound, which improves the
previous $O(d^2)$ bound by Girish, Raz, and Tal (ITCS 2021) and implies a
polynomial improvement on the randomized communication lower bound for the
XOR-lift of Forrelation, extending its quantum-classical gap.
<br />Our analysis is based on a new way of adaptively partitioning a relatively
large set in Gaussian space to control its moments in all directions. We
achieve this via martingale arguments and allowing protocols to transmit real
values. We also show a connection between Fourier growth and lifting theorems
with constant-sized gadgets as a potential approach to prove optimal bounds for
the second level and beyond.

<p class="mathjax">In image dehazing task, haze density is a key feature and affects the
performance of dehazing methods. However, some of the existing methods lack a
comparative image to measure densities, and others create intermediate results
but lack the exploitation of their density differences, which can facilitate
perception of density. To address these deficiencies, we propose a
density-aware dehazing method named Density Feature Refinement Network
(DFR-Net) that extracts haze density features from density differences and
leverages density differences to refine density features. In DFR-Net, we first
generate a proposal image that has lower overall density than the hazy input,
bringing in global density differences. Additionally, the dehazing residual of
the proposal image reflects the level of dehazing performance and provides
local density differences that indicate localized hard dehazing or high density
areas. Subsequently, we introduce a Global Branch (GB) and a Local Branch (LB)
to achieve density-awareness. In GB, we use Siamese networks for feature
extraction of hazy inputs and proposal images, and we propose a Global Density
Feature Refinement (GDFR) module that can refine features by pushing features
with different global densities further away. In LB, we explore local density
features from the dehazing residuals between hazy inputs and proposal images
and introduce an Intermediate Dehazing Residual Feedforward (IDRF) module to
update local features and pull them closer to clear image features. Sufficient
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results beyond the
state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The behaviour of multi-agent learning in competitive settings is often
considered under the restrictive assumption of a zero-sum game. Only under this
strict requirement is the behaviour of learning well understood; beyond this,
learning dynamics can often display non-convergent behaviours which prevent
fixed-point analysis. Nonetheless, many relevant competitive games do not
satisfy the zero-sum assumption.
<br />Motivated by this, we study a smooth variant of Q-Learning, a popular
reinforcement learning dynamics which balances the agents' tendency to maximise
their payoffs with their propensity to explore the state space. We examine this
dynamic in games which are `close' to network zero-sum games and find that
Q-Learning converges to a neighbourhood around a unique equilibrium. The size
of the neighbourhood is determined by the `distance' to the zero-sum game, as
well as the exploration rates of the agents. We complement these results by
providing a method whereby, given an arbitrary network game, the `nearest'
network zero-sum game can be found efficiently. As our experiments show, these
guarantees are independent of whether the dynamics ultimately reach an
equilibrium, or remain non-convergent.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent collaborative perception as a potential application for
vehicle-to-everything communication could significantly improve the perception
performance of autonomous vehicles over single-agent perception. However,
several challenges remain in achieving pragmatic information sharing in this
emerging research. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, a novel collaborative
perception framework that aggregates the spatio-temporal awareness
characteristics across on-road agents in an end-to-end manner. Specifically,
SCOPE has three distinct strengths: i) it considers effective semantic cues of
the temporal context to enhance current representations of the target agent;
ii) it aggregates perceptually critical spatial information from heterogeneous
agents and overcomes localization errors via multi-scale feature interactions;
iii) it integrates multi-source representations of the target agent based on
their complementary contributions by an adaptive fusion paradigm. To thoroughly
evaluate SCOPE, we consider both real-world and simulated scenarios of
collaborative 3D object detection tasks on three datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach and the necessity of
the proposed components.

<p class="mathjax">Driver distraction has become a significant cause of severe traffic accidents
over the past decade. Despite the growing development of vision-driven driver
monitoring systems, the lack of comprehensive perception datasets restricts
road safety and traffic security. In this paper, we present an AssIstive
Driving pErception dataset (AIDE) that considers context information both
inside and outside the vehicle in naturalistic scenarios. AIDE facilitates
holistic driver monitoring through three distinctive characteristics, including
multi-view settings of driver and scene, multi-modal annotations of face, body,
posture, and gesture, and four pragmatic task designs for driving
understanding. To thoroughly explore AIDE, we provide experimental benchmarks
on three kinds of baseline frameworks via extensive methods. Moreover, two
fusion strategies are introduced to give new insights into learning effective
multi-stream/modal representations. We also systematically investigate the
importance and rationality of the key components in AIDE and benchmarks. The

<p class="mathjax">The nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation with nonlocal diffusion operator is a
generalization of the classical Allen-Cahn equation. It satisfies the energy
dissipation law and maximum bound principle (MBP), and is important for
simulating a series of physical and biological phenomena involving
long-distance interactions in space. In this paper, we construct first- and
second-order (in time) accurate, unconditionally energy stable and
MBP-preserving schemes for the nonlocal Allen-Cahn type model based on the
stabilized exponential scalar auxiliary variable (sESAV) approach. On the one
hand, we have proved the MBP and unconditional energy stability carefully and
rigorously in the fully discrete levels. On the other hand, we adopt an
efficient FFT-based fast solver to compute the nearly full coefficient matrix
generated from the spatial discretization, which improves the computational
efficiency. Finally, typical numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate
the performance of our proposed schemes.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the Generalized Makespan Problem (GMP) on unrelated machines,
where we are given $n$ jobs and $m$ machines and each job $j$ has arbitrary
processing time $p_{ij}$ on machine $i$. Additionally, there is a general
symmetric monotone norm $\psi_i$ for each machine $i$, that determines the load
on machine $i$ as a function of the sizes of jobs assigned to it. The goal is
to assign the jobs to minimize the maximum machine load.
<br />Recently, Deng, Li, and Rabani (SODA'22) gave a $3$ approximation for GMP
when the $\psi_i$ are top-$k$ norms, and they ask the question whether an
$O(1)$ approximation exists for general norms $\psi$? We answer this negatively
and show that, under natural complexity assumptions, there is some fixed
constant $\delta&gt;0$, such that GMP is $\Omega(\log^{\delta} n)$ hard to
approximate. We also give an $\Omega(\log^{1/2} n)$ integrality gap for the
natural configuration LP.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) is an important task that
utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to reduce expenses on labeling
training examples. However, the effectiveness of SSS algorithms is limited by
the difficulty of fully exploiting the potential of unlabeled data. To address
this, we propose a dual-level Siamese structure network (DSSN) for pixel-wise
contrastive learning. By aligning positive pairs with a pixel-wise contrastive
loss using strong augmented views in both low-level image space and high-level
feature space, the proposed DSSN is designed to maximize the utilization of
available unlabeled data. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-aware
pseudo-label selection strategy for weak-to-strong supervision, which addresses
the limitations of most existing methods that do not perform selection or apply
a predefined threshold for all classes. Specifically, our strategy selects the
top high-confidence prediction of the weak view for each class to generate
pseudo labels that supervise the strong augmented views. This strategy is
capable of taking into account the class imbalance and improving the
performance of long-tailed classes. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results on two datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes,
outperforming other SSS algorithms by a significant margin.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a challenging machine learning
problem yet highly desirable in many high-stake applications. Existing methods
suffer from overly pessimistic modeling with low generalization confidence. As
generalizing to arbitrary test distributions is impossible, we hypothesize that
further structure on the topology of distributions is crucial in developing
strong OOD resilience. To this end, we propose topology-aware robust
optimization (TRO) that seamlessly integrates distributional topology in a
principled optimization framework. More specifically, TRO solves two
optimization objectives: (1) Topology Learning which explores data manifold to
uncover the distributional topology; (2) Learning on Topology which exploits
the topology to constrain robust optimization for tightly-bounded
generalization risks. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of
the arts in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and
semantic segmentation. Moreover, we empirically find the data-driven
distributional topology is consistent with domain knowledge, enhancing the
explainability of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive learning on graphs aims at extracting distinguishable high-level
representations of nodes. In this paper, we theoretically illustrate that the
entropy of a dataset can be approximated by maximizing the lower bound of the
mutual information across different views of a graph, \ie, entropy is estimated
by a neural network. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet effective
subset sampling strategy to contrast pairwise representations between views of
a dataset. In particular, we randomly sample nodes and edges from a given graph
to build the input subset for a view. Two views are fed into a parameter-shared
Siamese network to extract the high-dimensional embeddings and estimate the
information entropy of the entire graph. For the learning process, we propose
to optimize the network using two objectives, simultaneously. Concretely, the
input of the contrastive loss function consists of positive and negative pairs.
Our selection strategy of pairs is different from previous works and we present
a novel strategy to enhance the representation ability of the graph encoder by
selecting nodes based on cross-view similarities. We enrich the diversity of
the positive and negative pairs by selecting highly similar samples and totally
different data with the guidance of cross-view similarity scores, respectively.
We also introduce a cross-view consistency constraint on the representations
generated from the different views. This objective guarantees the learned
representations are consistent across views from the perspective of the entire
graph. We conduct extensive experiments on seven graph benchmarks, and the
proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be publicly released once this
paper is accepted.

<p class="mathjax">The growing demand for accurate control in varying and unknown environments
has sparked a corresponding increase in the requirements for power supply
components, including permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). To infer the
unknown part of the system, machine learning techniques are widely employed,
especially Gaussian process regression (GPR) due to its flexibility of
continuous system modeling and its guaranteed performance. For practical
implementation, distributed GPR is adopted to alleviate the high computational
complexity. However, the study of distributed GPR from a control perspective
remains an open problem. In this paper, a control-aware optimal aggregation
strategy of distributed GPR for PMSMs is proposed based on the Lyapunov
stability theory. This strategy exclusively leverages the posterior mean,
thereby obviating the need for computationally intensive calculations
associated with posterior variance in alternative approaches. Moreover, the
straightforward calculation process of our proposed strategy lends itself to
seamless implementation in high-frequency PMSM control. The effectiveness of
the proposed strategy is demonstrated in the simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Cancer grading is an essential task in pathology. The recent developments of
artificial neural networks in computational pathology have shown that these
methods hold great potential for improving the accuracy and quality of cancer
diagnosis. However, the issues with the robustness and reliability of such
methods have not been fully resolved yet. Herein, we propose a centroid-aware
feature recalibration network that can conduct cancer grading in an accurate
and robust manner. The proposed network maps an input pathology image into an
embedding space and adjusts it by using centroids embedding vectors of
different cancer grades via attention mechanism. Equipped with the recalibrated
embedding vector, the proposed network classifiers the input pathology image
into a pertinent class label, i.e., cancer grade. We evaluate the proposed
network using colorectal cancer datasets that were collected under different
environments. The experimental results confirm that the proposed network is
able to conduct cancer grading in pathology images with high accuracy
regardless of the environmental changes in the datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis
demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on
coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to
investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice
from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a
voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies
predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face
reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face
geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face
geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with
ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find
significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry,
such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on
voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for
anthropometry science.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) have achieved great
success in modern NLP. An important advantage of PLMs is good
out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Recently, diffusion models have attracted
a lot of work to apply diffusion to PLMs. It remains under-explored how
diffusion influences PLMs on OOD data. The core of diffusion models is a
forward diffusion process which gradually applies Gaussian noise to inputs, and
a reverse denoising process which removes noise. The noised input
reconstruction is a fundamental ability of diffusion models. We directly
analyze OOD robustness by measuring the reconstruction loss, including testing
the abilities to reconstruct OOD data, and to detect OOD samples. Experiments
are conducted by analyzing different training parameters and data statistical
features on eight datasets. It shows that finetuning PLMs with diffusion
degrades the reconstruction ability on OOD data. The comparison also shows that
diffusion models can effectively detect OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in most of the datasets with an absolute accuracy improvement up to
18%. These results indicate that diffusion reduces OOD robustness of PLMs.

<p class="mathjax">The success of re-localisation has crucial implications for the practical
deployment of robots operating within a prior map or relative to one another in
real-world scenarios. Using single-modality, place recognition and localisation
can be compromised in challenging environments such as forests. To address
this, we propose a strategy to prevent lidar-based re-localisation failure
using lidar-image cross-modality. Our solution relies on self-supervised 2D-3D
feature matching to predict alignment and misalignment. Leveraging a deep
network for lidar feature extraction and relative pose estimation between point
clouds, we train a model to evaluate the estimated transformation. A model
predicting the presence of misalignment is learned by analysing image-lidar
similarity in the embedding space and the geometric constraints available
within the region seen in both modalities in Euclidean space. Experimental
results using real datasets (offline and online modes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for robust re-localisation in
unstructured, natural environments.

<p class="mathjax">A diverse set of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming an integrated
part of daily lives, and playing an increasingly vital role in various
industry, enterprise and agricultural settings. The current IoT ecosystem
relies on several IoT management platforms to manage and operate a large number
of IoT devices, their data, and their connectivity. Considering their key role,
these platforms must be properly secured against cyber attacks. In this work,
we first explore the core operations/features of leading platforms to design a
framework to perform a systematic security evaluation of these platforms.
Subsequently, we use our framework to analyze a representative set of 52 IoT
management platforms, including 42 web-hosted and 10 locally-deployable
platforms. We discover a number of high severity unauthorized access
vulnerabilities in 9/52 evaluated IoT management platforms, which could be
abused to perform attacks such as remote IoT SIM deactivation, IoT SIM
overcharging and IoT device data forgery. More seriously, we also uncover
instances of broken authentication in 13/52 platforms, including complete
account takeover on 8/52 platforms along with remote code execution on 2/52
platforms. In effect, 17/52 platforms were affected by vulnerabilities that
could lead to platform-wide attacks. Overall, vulnerabilities were uncovered in
33 platforms, out of which 28 platforms responded to our responsible
disclosure. We were also assigned 11 CVEs and awarded bounty for our findings.

<p class="mathjax">This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features.
Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long
period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and
reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like
voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited.
Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech --
phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face.
Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and
face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us
explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes
v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each
phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our
results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to
consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a
specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more
predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and
lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent embodied tasks have recently been studied in complex indoor
visual environments. Collaboration among multiple agents can improve work
efficiency and has significant practical value. However, most of the existing
research focuses on homogeneous multi-agent tasks. Compared with homogeneous
agents, heterogeneous agents can leverage their different capabilities to
allocate corresponding sub-tasks and cooperate to complete complex tasks.
Heterogeneous multi-agent tasks are common in real-world scenarios, and the
collaboration strategy among heterogeneous agents is a challenging and
important problem to be solved. To study collaboration among heterogeneous
agents, we propose the heterogeneous multi-agent tidying-up task, in which
multiple heterogeneous agents with different capabilities collaborate with each
other to detect misplaced objects and place them in reasonable locations. This
is a demanding task since it requires agents to make the best use of their
different capabilities to conduct reasonable task planning and complete the
whole task. To solve this task, we build a heterogeneous multi-agent tidying-up
benchmark dataset in a large number of houses with multiple rooms based on
ProcTHOR-10K. We propose the hierarchical decision model based on misplaced
object detection, reasonable receptacle prediction, as well as the
handshake-based group communication mechanism. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The project's
website and videos of experiments can be found at https://hetercol.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, vision transformer based multimodal learning methods have been
proposed to improve the robustness of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems.
However, multimodal face data collected from the real world is often imperfect
due to missing modalities from various imaging sensors. Recently,
flexible-modal FAS~\cite{yu2023flexible} has attracted more attention, which
aims to develop a unified multimodal FAS model using complete multimodal face
data but is insensitive to test-time missing modalities. In this paper, we
tackle one main challenge in flexible-modal FAS, i.e., when missing modality
occurs either during training or testing in real-world situations. Inspired by
the recent success of the prompt learning in language models, we propose
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompt flexible-modal \textbf{FAS} (VP-FAS), which
learns the modal-relevant prompts to adapt the frozen pre-trained foundation
model to downstream flexible-modal FAS task. Specifically, both vanilla visual
prompts and residual contextual prompts are plugged into multimodal
transformers to handle general missing-modality cases, while only requiring
less than 4\% learnable parameters compared to training the entire model.
Furthermore, missing-modality regularization is proposed to force models to
learn consistent multimodal feature embeddings when missing partial modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal FAS benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our VP-FAS framework that improves the
performance under various missing-modality cases while alleviating the
requirement of heavy model re-training.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a method of data-driven parametric Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (p-DMD) to derive a linear parameter-varying reduced-order model
(LPV-ROM) for the nonlinear aeroelasticity of highly flexible aircraft. It
directly uses the data snapshots obtained at varying flight conditions, and
encodes the physical understanding of the nonlinear model's polynomial
dependency on flight conditions to produce a polynomial-dependent LPV-ROM.
Therefore, this method can handle not only the equilibrium flight conditions
but also the cases of continuously-varying flight conditions. In the numerical
studies, a highly flexible cantilever wing and a slender vehicle built based on
it are first studied with fixed angles of attack as the scheduling parameter.
The comparisons between traditional linearization-based parametric modeling and
the data-driven p-DMD modeling are performed to verify the modeling accuracy.
The results demonstrate that the current p-DMD modeling method can capture the
aeroelastic and flight dynamic responses of highly flexible aircraft in both
time and frequency domains. In addition, the proposed p-DMD method is applied
to the highly flexible aircraft in a perturbed longitudinal flight with varying
angles of attack as the scheduling parameter. The nonlinear aeroelastic and
flight dynamic data are compared with the simulation results of the data-driven
p-DMD model. The comparison results demonstrate that it can accurately capture
the non-equilibrium (or transient) aeroelastic and flight dynamic behaviors of
such slender vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we measure the linear separability of hidden layer outputs to
study the characteristics of deep neural networks. In particular, we first
propose Minkowski difference based linear separability measures (MD-LSMs) to
evaluate the linear separability degree of two points sets. Then, we
demonstrate that there is a synchronicity between the linear separability
degree of hidden layer outputs and the network training performance, i.e., if
the updated weights can enhance the linear separability degree of hidden layer
outputs, the updated network will achieve a better training performance, and
vice versa. Moreover, we study the effect of activation function and network
size (including width and depth) on the linear separability of hidden layers.
Finally, we conduct the numerical experiments to validate our findings on some
popular deep networks including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional
neural network (CNN), deep belief network (DBN), ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet,
vision transformer (ViT) and GoogLeNet.

<p class="mathjax">Visual object tracking is a fundamental video task in computer vision.
Recently, the notably increasing power of perception algorithms allows the
unification of single/multiobject and box/mask-based tracking. Among them, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) attracts much attention. In this report, we
propose HQTrack, a framework for High Quality Tracking anything in videos.
HQTrack mainly consists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask
refiner (MR). Given the object to be tracked in the initial frame of a video,
VMOS propagates the object masks to the current frame. The mask results at this
stage are not accurate enough since VMOS is trained on several closeset video
object segmentation (VOS) datasets, which has limited ability to generalize to
complex and corner scenes. To further improve the quality of tracking masks, a
pretrained MR model is employed to refine the tracking results. As a compelling
testament to the effectiveness of our paradigm, without employing any tricks
such as test-time data augmentations and model ensemble, HQTrack ranks the 2nd
place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation (VOTS2023) challenge. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/jiawen-zhu/HQTrack.

<p class="mathjax">Verifying the correct behavior of robots in contact tasks is challenging due
to model uncertainties associated with contacts. Standard methods for testing
often fall short since all (uncountable many) solutions cannot be obtained.
Instead, we propose to formally and efficiently verify robot behaviors in
contact tasks using reachability analysis, which enables checking all the
reachable states against user-provided specifications. To this end, we extend
the state of the art in reachability analysis for hybrid (mixed discrete and
continuous) dynamics subject to discrete-time input trajectories. In
particular, we present a novel and scalable guard intersection approach to
reliably compute the complex behavior caused by contacts. We model robots
subject to contacts as hybrid automata in which crucial time delays are
included. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated by verifying safe
human-robot interaction in the presence of constrained collisions, which was
out of reach for existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have emerged as a formidable AI tool to
generate realistic outputs based on training datasets. However, the challenge
of exerting control over the generation process of GANs remains a significant
hurdle. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to address this issue by
integrating a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with a latent-space GAN
(l-GAN), thereby facilitating the generation of desired outputs. More
specifically, we have developed an actor-critic RL agent with a meticulously
designed reward policy, enabling it to acquire proficiency in navigating the
latent space of the l-GAN and generating outputs based on specified tasks. To
substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we have conducted a series of
experiments employing the MNIST dataset, including arithmetic addition as an
illustrative task. The outcomes of these experiments serve to validate our
methodology. Our pioneering integration of an RL agent with a GAN model
represents a novel advancement, holding great potential for enhancing
generative networks in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays an indispensable role in
monitoring and improving the end-users' viewing experience in various
real-world video-enabled media applications. As an experimental field, the
improvements of BVQA models have been measured primarily on a few human-rated
VQA datasets. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of existing
VQA datasets in order to properly evaluate the current progress in BVQA.
Towards this goal, we conduct a first-of-its-kind computational analysis of VQA
datasets via designing minimalistic BVQA models. By minimalistic, we restrict
our family of BVQA models to build only upon basic blocks: a video preprocessor
(for aggressive spatiotemporal downsampling), a spatial quality analyzer, an
optional temporal quality analyzer, and a quality regressor, all with the
simplest possible instantiations. By comparing the quality prediction
performance of different model variants on eight VQA datasets with realistic
distortions, we find that nearly all datasets suffer from the easy dataset
problem of varying severity, some of which even admit blind image quality
assessment (BIQA) solutions. We additionally justify our claims by contrasting
our model generalizability on these VQA datasets, and by ablating a dizzying
set of BVQA design choices related to the basic building blocks. Our results
cast doubt on the current progress in BVQA, and meanwhile shed light on good
practices of constructing next-generation VQA datasets and models.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples (AEs). In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means
AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target
model) with a non-trivial probability. In previous studies, it was confirmed
that the vision transformer (ViT) is more robust against the property of
adversarial transferability than convolutional neural network (CNN) models such
as ConvMixer, and moreover encrypted ViT is more robust than ViT without any
encryption. In this article, we propose a random ensemble of encrypted ViT
models to achieve much more robust models. In experiments, the proposed scheme
is verified to be more robust against not only black-box attacks but also
white-box ones than convention methods.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we consider the problem of distributed computing of functions
of structured sources, focusing on the classical setting of two correlated
sources and one user that seeks the outcome of the function while benefiting
from low-rate side information provided by a helper node. Focusing on the case
where the sources are jointly distributed according to a very general mixture
model, we here provide an achievable coding scheme that manages to
substantially reduce the communication cost of distributed computing by
exploiting the nature of the joint distribution of the sources, the side
information, as well as the symmetry enjoyed by the desired functions. Our
scheme -- which can readily apply in a variety of real-life scenarios including
learning, combinatorics, and graph neural network applications -- is here shown
to provide substantial reductions in the communication costs, while
simultaneously providing computational savings by reducing the exponential
complexity of joint decoding techniques to a complexity that is merely linear.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models underestimate the impact of negations on how much they
change the meaning of a sentence. Therefore, learned evaluation metrics based
on these models are insensitive to negations. In this paper, we propose
NegBLEURT, a negation-aware version of the BLEURT evaluation metric. For that,
we designed a rule-based sentence negation tool and used it to create the
CANNOT negation evaluation dataset. Based on this dataset, we fine-tuned a
sentence transformer and an evaluation metric to improve their negation
sensitivity. Evaluating these models on existing benchmarks shows that our
fine-tuned models outperform existing metrics on the negated sentences by far
while preserving their base models' performances on other perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation in off-road conditions requires an accurate estimation
of terrain traversability. However, traversability estimation in unstructured
environments is subject to high uncertainty due to the variability of numerous
factors that influence vehicle-terrain interaction. Consequently, it is
challenging to obtain a generalizable model that can accurately predict
traversability in a variety of environments. This paper presents METAVerse, a
meta-learning framework for learning a global model that accurately and
reliably predicts terrain traversability across diverse environments. We train
the traversability prediction network to generate a dense and continuous-valued
cost map from a sparse LiDAR point cloud, leveraging vehicle-terrain
interaction feedback in a self-supervised manner. Meta-learning is utilized to
train a global model with driving data collected from multiple environments,
effectively minimizing estimation uncertainty. During deployment, online
adaptation is performed to rapidly adapt the network to the local environment
by exploiting recent interaction experiences. To conduct a comprehensive
evaluation, we collect driving data from various terrains and demonstrate that
our method can obtain a global model that minimizes uncertainty. Moreover, by
integrating our model with a model predictive controller, we demonstrate that
the reduced uncertainty results in safe and stable navigation in unstructured
and unknown terrains.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Based
on the statistical correlations uncovered by deep learning-based methods,
computer vision technology has contributed to tremendous growth in areas such
as autonomous driving and robotics. Despite being the basis of deep learning,
such correlation is not stable and is susceptible to uncontrolled factors. In
the absence of the guidance of prior knowledge, statistical correlations can
easily turn into spurious correlations and cause confounders. As a result,
researchers are beginning to refine deep learning-based methods with causal
theory. Causal theory models the intrinsic causal structure unaffected by data
bias and is effective in avoiding spurious correlations. This paper aims to
comprehensively review the existing causal methods in typical vision and
vision-language tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and
image captioning. The advantages of causality and the approaches for building
causal paradigms will be summarized. Future roadmaps are also proposed,
including facilitating the development of causal theory and its application in
other complex scenes and systems.

<p class="mathjax">There is a critical need to develop and validate non-invasive animal-based
indicators of affective states in livestock species, in order to integrate them
into on-farm assessment protocols, potentially via the use of precision
livestock farming (PLF) tools. One such promising approach is the use of vocal
indicators. The acoustic structure of vocalizations and their functions were
extensively studied in important livestock species, such as pigs, horses,
poultry and goats, yet cattle remain understudied in this context to date. Cows
were shown to produce two types vocalizations: low-frequency calls (LF),
produced with the mouth closed, or partially closed, for close distance
contacts and open mouth emitted high-frequency calls (HF), produced for long
distance communication, with the latter considered to be largely associated
with negative affective states. Moreover, cattle vocalizations were shown to
contain information on individuality across a wide range of contexts, both
negative and positive. Nowadays, dairy cows are facing a series of negative
challenges and stressors in a typical production cycle, making vocalizations
during negative affective states of special interest for research. One
contribution of this study is providing the largest to date pre-processed
(clean from noises) dataset of lactating adult multiparous dairy cows during
negative affective states induced by visual isolation challenges. Here we
present two computational frameworks - deep learning based and explainable
machine learning based, to classify high and low-frequency cattle calls, and
individual cow voice recognition. Our models in these two frameworks reached
87.2% and 89.4% accuracy for LF and HF classification, with 68.9% and 72.5%
accuracy rates for the cow individual identification, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized federated learning (PFL) is a popular framework that allows
clients to have different models to address application scenarios where
clients' data are in different domains. The typical model of a client in PFL
features a global encoder trained by all clients to extract universal features
from the raw data and personalized layers (e.g., a classifier) trained using
the client's local data. Nonetheless, due to the differences between the data
distributions of different clients (aka, domain gaps), the universal features
produced by the global encoder largely encompass numerous components irrelevant
to a certain client's local task. Some recent PFL methods address the above
problem by personalizing specific parameters within the encoder. However, these
methods encounter substantial challenges attributed to the high dimensionality
and non-linearity of neural network parameter space. In contrast, the feature
space exhibits a lower dimensionality, providing greater intuitiveness and
interpretability as compared to the parameter space. To this end, we propose a
novel PFL framework named FedPick. FedPick achieves PFL in the low-dimensional
feature space by selecting task-relevant features adaptively for each client
from the features generated by the global encoder based on its local data
distribution. It presents a more accessible and interpretable implementation of
PFL compared to those methods working in the parameter space. Extensive
experimental results show that FedPick could effectively select task-relevant
features for each client and improve model performance in cross-domain FL.

(KRM) has become a complement to the classical maximum likelihood/prediction
error method and an emerging new system identification paradigm. One recent
example is its application in the non-causal system identification, and the key
issue lies in the design and analysis of kernels for non-causal systems. In
this paper, we develop systematic ways to deal with this issue. In particular,
we first introduce the guidelines for kernel design and then extend the system
theoretic framework to design the so-called non-causal simulation-induced
(NCSI) kernel, and we also study its structural properties, including stability
and semiseparability. Finally, we consider some special cases of the NCSI
kernel and show their advantage over the existing kernels through numerical

approximations in time are obtained with errors, and at a cost, that are
independent of the oscillation frequency. {This work is part of a long time
project, and the final goal is the resolution of a Stokes-advection-diffusion
system, in which the expression for the velocity in the advection term, is the
solution of the Stokes equations.} This paper focuses on the time multiscale
challenge, coming from the velocity that is an $\varepsilon-$periodic function,
whose expression is explicitly known. We also introduce a two--scale
formulation, as a first step to the numerical resolution of the complete
oscillatory Stokes-advection-diffusion system, that is currently under
investigation. This two--scale formulation is also useful to understand the
asymptotic behaviour of the solution.

<p class="mathjax">Models for affective text generation have shown a remarkable progress, but
they commonly rely only on basic emotion theories or valance/arousal values as
conditions. This is appropriate when the goal is to create explicit emotion
statements ("The kid is happy."). Emotions are, however, commonly communicated
implicitly. For instance, the emotional interpretation of an event ("Their dog
died.") does often not require an explicit emotion statement. In psychology,
appraisal theories explain the link between a cognitive evaluation of an event
and the potentially developed emotion. They put the assessment of the situation
on the spot, for instance regarding the own control or the responsibility for
what happens. We hypothesize and subsequently show that including appraisal
variables as conditions in a generation framework comes with two advantages.
(1) The generation model is informed in greater detail about what makes a
specific emotion and what properties it has. This leads to text generation that
better fulfills the condition. (2) The variables of appraisal allow a user to
perform a more fine-grained control of the generated text, by stating
properties of a situation instead of only providing the emotion category. Our
Bart and T5-based experiments with 7 emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt,
Joy, Sadness, Shame), and 7 appraisals (Attention, Responsibility, Control,
Circumstance, Pleasantness, Effort, Certainty) show that (1) adding appraisals
during training improves the accurateness of the generated texts by 10 pp in
F1. Further, (2) the texts with appraisal variables are longer and contain more
details. This exemplifies the greater control for users.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an unsupervised, corpus-independent method to extract keywords
from a single text. It is based on the spatial distribution of words and the
response of this distribution to a random permutation of words. As compared to
existing methods (such as e.g. YAKE) our method has three advantages. First, it
is significantly more effective at extracting keywords from long texts. Second,
it allows inference of two types of keywords: local and global. Third, it
uncovers basic themes in texts. Additionally, our method is
language-independent and applies to short texts. The results are obtained via
human annotators with previous knowledge of texts from our database of
classical literary works (the agreement between annotators is from moderate to
substantial). Our results are supported via human-independent arguments based
on the average length of extracted content words and on the average number of
nouns in extracted words. We discuss relations of keywords with higher-order
textual features and reveal a connection between keywords and chapter
divisions.

<p class="mathjax">Existing Graph Convolutional Networks to achieve human motion prediction
largely adopt a one-step scheme, which output the prediction straight from
history input, failing to exploit human motion patterns. We observe that human
motions have transitional patterns and can be split into snippets
representative of each transition. Each snippet can be reconstructed from its
starting and ending poses referred to as the transitional poses. We propose a
snippet-to-motion multi-stage framework that breaks motion prediction into
sub-tasks easier to accomplish. Each sub-task integrates three modules:
transitional pose prediction, snippet reconstruction, and snippet-to-motion
prediction. Specifically, we propose to first predict only the transitional
poses. Then we use them to reconstruct the corresponding snippets, obtaining a
close approximation to the true motion sequence. Finally we refine them to
produce the final prediction output. To implement the network, we propose a
novel unified graph modeling, which allows for direct and effective feature
propagation compared to existing approaches which rely on separate space-time
modeling. Extensive experiments on Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW datasets
verify the effectiveness of our method which achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Recent vision transformers, large-kernel CNNs and MLPs have attained
remarkable successes in broad vision tasks thanks to their effective
information fusion in the global scope. However, their efficient deployments,
especially on mobile devices, still suffer from noteworthy challenges due to
the heavy computational costs of self-attention mechanisms, large kernels, or
fully connected layers. In this work, we apply conventional convolution theorem
to deep learning for addressing this and reveal that adaptive frequency filters
can serve as efficient global token mixers. With this insight, we propose
Adaptive Frequency Filtering (AFF) token mixer. This neural operator transfers
a latent representation to the frequency domain via a Fourier transform and
performs semantic-adaptive frequency filtering via an elementwise
multiplication, which mathematically equals to a token mixing operation in the
original latent space with a dynamic convolution kernel as large as the spatial
resolution of this latent representation. We take AFF token mixers as primary
neural operators to build a lightweight neural network, dubbed AFFNet.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AFF token
mixer and show that AFFNet achieve superior accuracy and efficiency trade-offs
compared to other lightweight network designs on broad visual tasks, including
visual recognition and dense prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Compositional neural scene graph studies have shown that radiance fields can
be an efficient tool in an editable autonomous driving simulator. However,
previous studies learned within a sequence of autonomous driving datasets,
resulting in unsatisfactory blurring when rotating the car in the simulator. In
this letter, we propose a pipeline for learning unconstrained images and
building a dataset from processed images. To meet the requirements of the
simulator, which demands that the vehicle maintain clarity when the perspective
changes and that the contour remains sharp from the background to avoid
artifacts when editing, we design a radiation field of the vehicle, a crucial
part of the urban scene foreground. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our model achieves competitive performance compared to baselines. Using the
datasets built from in-the-wild images, our method gradually presents a
controllable appearance editing function. We will release the dataset and code
on https://lty2226262.github.io/car-studio/ to facilitate further research in
the field.

<p class="mathjax">Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR) aims to restore a
high-resolution hyperspectral image from a low-resolution observation. However,
the prevailing CNN-based approaches have shown limitations in building
long-range dependencies and capturing interaction information between spectral
features. This results in inadequate utilization of spectral information and
artifacts after upsampling. To address this issue, we propose ESSAformer, an
ESSA attention-embedded Transformer network for single-HSI-SR with an iterative
refining structure. Specifically, we first introduce a robust and
spectral-friendly similarity metric, \ie, the spectral correlation coefficient
of the spectrum (SCC), to replace the original attention matrix and
incorporates inductive biases into the model to facilitate training. Built upon
it, we further utilize the kernelizable attention technique with theoretical
support to form a novel efficient SCC-kernel-based self-attention (ESSA) and
reduce attention computation to linear complexity. ESSA enlarges the receptive
field for features after upsampling without bringing much computation and
allows the model to effectively utilize spatial-spectral information from
different scales, resulting in the generation of more natural high-resolution
images. Without the need for pretraining on large-scale datasets, our
experiments demonstrate ESSA's effectiveness in both visual quality and
quantitative results.

<p class="mathjax">Palmprint recently shows great potential in recognition applications as it is
a privacy-friendly and stable biometric. However, the lack of large-scale
public palmprint datasets limits further research and development of palmprint
recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic pseudo-palmprint
generation (RPG) model to synthesize palmprints with massive identities. We
first introduce a conditional modulation generator to improve the intra-class
diversity. Then an identity-aware loss is proposed to ensure identity
consistency against unpaired training. We further improve the B\'ezier palm
creases generation strategy to guarantee identity independence. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining significantly
boosts the recognition model performance. For example, our model improves the
state-of-the-art B\'ezierPalm by more than $5\%$ and $14\%$ in terms of
TAR@FAR=1e-6 under the $1:1$ and $1:3$ Open-set protocol. When accessing only
$10\%$ of the real training data, our method still outperforms ArcFace with
$100\%$ real training data, indicating that we are closer to real-data-free
palmprint recognition.

<p class="mathjax">The precision of unsupervised point cloud registration methods is typically
limited by the lack of reliable inlier estimation and self-supervised signal,
especially in partially overlapping scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
effective inlier estimation method for unsupervised point cloud registration by
capturing geometric structure consistency between the source point cloud and
its corresponding reference point cloud copy. Specifically, to obtain a high
quality reference point cloud copy, an One-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN) point
cloud is generated by input point cloud. This facilitates matching map
construction and allows for integrating dual neighborhood matching scores of
1-NN point cloud and input point cloud to improve matching confidence.
Benefiting from the high quality reference copy, we argue that the neighborhood
graph formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between
source point cloud and its corresponding reference copy. Based on this
observation, we construct transformation-invariant geometric structure
representations and capture geometric structure consistency to score the inlier
confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its
reference copy. This strategy can simultaneously provide the reliable
self-supervised signal for model optimization. Finally, we further calculate
transformation estimation by the weighted SVD algorithm with the estimated
correspondences and corresponding inlier confidence. We train the proposed
model in an unsupervised manner, and extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Strip-decomposable quadrilateral (SDQ) meshes, i.e., quad meshes that can be
decomposed into two transversal strip networks, are vital in numerous
fabrication processes; examples include woven structures, surfaces from sheets,
custom rebar, or cable-net structures. However, their design is often
challenging and includes tedious manual work, and there is a lack of
methodologies for editing such meshes while preserving their strip
decomposability. We present an interactive methodology to generate and edit SDQ
meshes aligned to user-defined directions, while also incorporating desirable
properties to the strips for fabrication. Our technique is based on the
computation of two coupled transversal tangent direction fields, integrated
into two overlapping networks of strips on the surface. As a case study, we
consider the fabrication scenario of robotic non-planar 3D printing of freefrom
shell surfaces and apply the presented methodology to design and fabricate
non-planar print paths.

<p class="mathjax">Brain encoding models aim to predict brain voxel-wise responses to stimuli
images, replicating brain signals captured by neuroimaging techniques. There is
a large volume of publicly available data, but training a comprehensive brain
encoding model is challenging. The main difficulties stem from a) diversity
within individual brain, with functional heterogeneous brain regions; b)
diversity of brains from different subjects, due to genetic and developmental
differences; c) diversity of imaging modalities and processing pipelines. We
use this diversity to our advantage by introducing the All-for-One training
recipe, which divides the challenging one-big-model problem into multiple small
models, with the small models aggregating the knowledge while preserving the
distinction between the different functional regions. Agnostic of the training
recipe, we use biological knowledge of the brain, specifically retinotopy, to
introduce inductive bias to learn a 3D brain-to-image mapping that ensures a)
each neuron knows which image regions and semantic levels to gather
information, and b) no neurons are left behind in the model.
<br />We pre-trained a brain encoding model using over one million data points from
five public datasets spanning three imaging modalities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the most comprehensive brain encoding model to the date. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-trained model as a drop-in replacement
for commonly used vision backbone models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
application of the model to brain decoding. Code and the model checkpoint will
be made available.

<p class="mathjax">Existing analyses of the expressive capacity of Transformer models have
required excessively deep layers for data memorization, leading to a
discrepancy with the Transformers actually used in practice. This is primarily
due to the interpretation of the softmax function as an approximation of the
hardmax function. By clarifying the connection between the softmax function and
the Boltzmann operator, we prove that a single layer of self-attention with
low-rank weight matrices possesses the capability to perfectly capture the
context of an entire input sequence. As a consequence, we show that
single-layer Transformer has a memorization capacity for finite samples, and
that Transformers consisting of one self-attention layer with two feed-forward
neural networks are universal approximators for continuous functions on a
compact domain.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) aim to interactively acquire user
preferences and accordingly recommend items to users. Accurately learning the
dynamic user preferences is of crucial importance for CRS. Previous works learn
the user preferences with pairwise relations from the interactive conversation
and item knowledge, while largely ignoring the fact that factors for a
relationship in CRS are multiplex. Specifically, the user likes/dislikes the
items that satisfy some attributes (Like/Dislike view). Moreover social
influence is another important factor that affects user preference towards the
item (Social view), while is largely ignored by previous works in CRS. The user
preferences from these three views are inherently different but also correlated
as a whole. The user preferences from the same views should be more similar
than that from different views. The user preferences from Like View should be
similar to Social View while different from Dislike View. To this end, we
propose a novel model, namely Multi-view Hypergraph Contrastive Policy Learning
(MHCPL). Specifically, MHCPL timely chooses useful social information according
to the interactive history and builds a dynamic hypergraph with three types of
multiplex relations from different views. The multiplex relations in each view
are successively connected according to their generation order.

<p class="mathjax">Diagnosing rare anemia disorders using microscopic images is challenging for
skilled specialists and machine-learning methods alike. Due to thousands of
disease-relevant cells in a single blood sample, this constitutes a complex
multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem. While the spatial neighborhood of red
blood cells is not meaningful per se, the topology, i.e., the geometry of blood
samples as a whole, contains informative features to remedy typical MIL issues,
such as vanishing gradients and overfitting when training on limited data. We
thus develop a topology-based approach that extracts multi-scale topological
features from bags of single red blood cell images. The topological features
are used to regularize the model, enforcing the preservation of characteristic
topological properties of the data. Applied to a dataset of 71 patients
suffering from rare anemia disorders with 521 microscopic images of red blood
cells, our experiments show that topological regularization is an effective
method that leads to more than 3% performance improvements for the automated
classification of rare anemia disorders based on single-cell images. This is
the first approach that uses topological properties for regularizing the MIL
process.

<p class="mathjax">RANSAC and its variants are widely used for robust estimation, however, they
commonly follow a greedy approach to finding the highest scoring model while
ignoring other model hypotheses. In contrast, Iteratively Reweighted Least
Squares (IRLS) techniques gradually approach the model by iteratively updating
the weight of each correspondence based on the residuals from previous
iterations. Inspired by these methods, we propose a new RANSAC framework that
learns to explore the parameter space by considering the residuals seen so far
via a novel attention layer. The attention mechanism operates on a batch of
point-to-model residuals, and updates a per-point estimation state to take into
account the consensus found through a lightweight one-step transformer. This
rich state then guides the minimal sampling between iterations as well as the
model refinement. We evaluate the proposed approach on essential and
fundamental matrix estimation on a number of indoor and outdoor datasets. It
outperforms state-of-the-art estimators by a significant margin adding only a
small runtime overhead. Moreover, we demonstrate good generalization properties
of our trained model, indicating its effectiveness across different datasets
and tasks. The proposed attention mechanism and one-step transformer provide an
adaptive behavior that enhances the performance of RANSAC, making it a more
effective tool for robust estimation. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Creating high-quality annotated data for task-oriented dialog (ToD) is known
to be notoriously difficult, and the challenges are amplified when the goal is
to create equitable, culturally adapted, and large-scale ToD datasets for
multiple languages. Therefore, the current datasets are still very scarce and
suffer from limitations such as translation-based non-native dialogs with
translation artefacts, small scale, or lack of cultural adaptation, among
others. In this work, we first take stock of the current landscape of
multilingual ToD datasets, offering a systematic overview of their properties
and limitations. Aiming to reduce all the detected limitations, we then
introduce Multi3WOZ, a novel multilingual, multi-domain, multi-parallel ToD
dataset. It is large-scale and offers culturally adapted dialogs in 4 languages
to enable training and evaluation of multilingual and cross-lingual ToD
systems. We describe a complex bottom-up data collection process that yielded
the final dataset, and offer the first sets of baseline scores across different
ToD-related tasks for future reference, also highlighting its challenging
nature.

<p class="mathjax">We first define appropriate state representation and action space, and then
design an adjustment mechanism based on the actions selected by the intelligent
agent. The adjustment mechanism outputs the next state and reward value of the
agent. Additionally, the adjustment mechanism calculates the error between the
adjusted state and the unadjusted state. Furthermore, the intelligent agent
stores the acquired experience samples containing states and reward values in a
buffer and replays the experiences during each iteration to learn the dynamic
characteristics of the environment. We name the improved algorithm as the DQM
algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the intelligent agent using
our proposed algorithm effectively reduces the accumulated errors of inertial
navigation in dynamic environments. Although our research provides a basis for
achieving autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, there is still
room for significant optimization. Further research can include testing
unmanned aerial vehicles in simulated environments, testing unmanned aerial
vehicles in real-world environments, optimizing the design of reward functions,
improving the algorithm workflow to enhance convergence speed and performance,
and enhancing the algorithm's generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies on face forgery detection have shown satisfactory performance
for methods involved in training datasets, but are not ideal enough for unknown
domains. This motivates many works to improve the generalization, but
forgery-irrelevant information, such as image background and identity, still
exists in different domain features and causes unexpected clustering, limiting
the generalization. In this paper, we propose a controllable guide-space (GS)
method to enhance the discrimination of different forgery domains, so as to
increase the forgery relevance of features and thereby improve the
generalization. The well-designed guide-space can simultaneously achieve both
the proper separation of forgery domains and the large distance between
real-forgery domains in an explicit and controllable manner. Moreover, for
better discrimination, we use a decoupling module to weaken the interference of
forgery-irrelevant correlations between domains. Furthermore, we make
adjustments to the decision boundary manifold according to the clustering
degree of the same domain features within the neighborhood. Extensive
experiments in multiple in-domain and cross-domain settings confirm that our
method can achieve state-of-the-art generalization.

<p class="mathjax">We propose two approaches, based on Riemannian optimization, for computing a
stochastic approximation of the $p$th root of a stochastic matrix $A$. In the
first approach, the approximation is found in the Riemannian manifold of
positive stochastic matrices. In the second approach, we introduce the
Riemannian manifold of positive stochastic matrices sharing with $A$ the Perron
eigenvector and we compute the approximation of the $p$th root of $A$ in such a
manifold. This way, differently from the available methods based on constrained
optimization, $A$ and its $p$th root approximation share the Perron
eigenvector. Such a property is relevant, from a modelling point of view, in
the embedding problem for Markov chains. The extended numerical experimentation
shows that, in the first approach, the Riemannian optimization methods are
generally faster and more accurate than the available methods based on
constrained optimization. In the second approach, even though the stochastic
approximation of the $p$th root is found in a smaller set, the approximation is
generally more accurate than the one obtained by standard constrained
optimization.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in a
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided Integrated Sensing and
Multicast-Unicast Communication (ISMUC) system, where the multicast signal is
used for sensing and communications while the unicast signal is used only for
communications. Our goal is to depict whether the IRS improves the performance
of NOMA-ISMUC system or not under the imperfect/perfect successive interference
cancellation (SIC) scenario. Towards this end, we formulate a non-convex
problem to maximize the unicast rate while ensuring the minimum target
illumination power and multicast rate. To settle this problem, we employ the
Dinkelbach method to transform this original problem into an equivalent one,
which is then solved via alternating optimization algorithm and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) with Sequential Rank-One Constraint Relaxation (SROCR). Based
on this, an iterative algorithm is devised to obtain a near-optimal solution.
Computer simulations verify the quick convergence of the devised iterative
algorithm, and provide insightful results. Compared to NOMA-ISMUC without IRS,
IRS-aided NOMA-ISMUC achieves a higher rate with perfect SIC but keeps the
almost same rate in the case of imperfect SIC.

<p class="mathjax">Shape generation is the practice of producing 3D shapes as various
representations for 3D content creation. Previous studies on 3D shape
generation have focused on shape quality and structure, without or less
considering the importance of semantic information. Consequently, such
generative models often fail to preserve the semantic consistency of shape
structure or enable manipulation of the semantic attributes of shapes during
generation. In this paper, we proposed a novel semantic generative model named
3D Semantic Subspace Traverser that utilizes semantic attributes for
category-specific 3D shape generation and editing. Our method utilizes implicit
functions as the 3D shape representation and combines a novel latent-space GAN
with a linear subspace model to discover semantic dimensions in the local
latent space of 3D shapes. Each dimension of the subspace corresponds to a
particular semantic attribute, and we can edit the attributes of generated
shapes by traversing the coefficients of those dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can produce plausible shapes with complex
structures and enable the editing of semantic attributes. The code and trained
models are available at

<p class="mathjax">High-accuracy Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) aims to pinpoint
category-agnostic foreground objects from natural scenes. The main challenge
for DIS involves identifying the highly accurate dominant area while rendering
detailed object structure. However, directly using a general encoder-decoder
architecture may result in an oversupply of high-level features and neglect the
shallow spatial information necessary for partitioning meticulous structures.
To fill this gap, we introduce a novel Unite-Divide-Unite Network (UDUN} that
restructures and bipartitely arranges complementary features to simultaneously
boost the effectiveness of trunk and structure identification. The proposed
UDUN proceeds from several strengths. First, a dual-size input feeds into the
shared backbone to produce more holistic and detailed features while keeping
the model lightweight. Second, a simple Divide-and-Conquer Module (DCM) is
proposed to decouple multiscale low- and high-level features into our structure
decoder and trunk decoder to obtain structure and trunk information
respectively. Moreover, we design a Trunk-Structure Aggregation module (TSA) in
our union decoder that performs cascade integration for uniform high-accuracy
segmentation. As a result, UDUN performs favorably against state-of-the-art
competitors in all six evaluation metrics on overall DIS-TE, i.e., achieving
0.772 weighted F-measure and 977 HCE. Using 1024*1024 input, our model enables
real-time inference at 65.3 fps with ResNet-18.

<p class="mathjax">With the advance in malware technology, attackers create new ways to hide
their malicious code from antivirus services. One way to obfuscate an attack is
to use common files as cover to hide the malicious scripts, so the malware will
look like a legitimate file. Although cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and
content signature exist, evasive malware successfully bypasses next-generation
malware detection using advanced methods like steganography. Some of the files
commonly used to hide malware are image files (e.g., JPEG). In addition, some
malware use steganography to hide malicious scripts or sensitive data in
images. Steganography in images is difficult to detect even with specialized
tools. Image-based attacks try to attack the user's device using malicious
payloads or utilize image steganography to hide sensitive data inside
legitimate images and leak it outside the user's device. Therefore in this
paper, we present a novel Image Content Disarm and Reconstruction (ICDR). Our
ICDR system removes potential malware, with a zero trust approach, while
maintaining high image quality and file usability. By extracting the image
data, removing it from the rest of the file, and manipulating the image pixels,
it is possible to disable or remove the hidden malware inside the file.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the presence of the classification task in many different benchmark
datasets for perception in the automotive domain, few efforts have been
undertaken to define consistent classification requirements. This work
addresses the topic by proposing a structured method to generate a
classification structure. First, legal categories are identified based on
behavioral requirements for the vehicle. This structure is further
substantiated by considering the two aspects of collision safety for objects as
well as perceptual categories. A classification hierarchy is obtained by
applying the method to an exemplary legal text. A comparison of the results
with benchmark dataset categories shows limited agreement. This indicates the
necessity for explicit consideration of legal requirements regarding
perception.

<p class="mathjax">Modern web-based platforms show ranked lists of recommendations to users,
attempting to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the
goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability for
items that are deemed "reward-maximising" according to a metric of interest.
This general framing comprises streaming applications, as well as e-commerce or
job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be
used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically
tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor
in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items
will be engaged with (clicked, streamed,...) before a user leaves the ranked
list. Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general
framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed
after e.g. liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to
scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or
user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately
capture users' interaction modalities.
<br />In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised
position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a
hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given
1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a scrolling
budget drawn according to some distribution, and show how the survival function
of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for
personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights from a large-scale
social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more
accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way
for unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models have shown vulnerability to
adversarial examples in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, malicious adversaries
can be deliberately transferred to attack other black-box models. However,
existing work has mainly focused on investigating white-box attacks. In this
paper, we present the first study to investigate the adversarial
transferability of recent VLP models. We observe that existing methods exhibit
much lower transferability, compared to the strong attack performance in
white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly caused by the
under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal
learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the
multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in
various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable
Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions
and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples
that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream
vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the
attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin
(at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Image recognition has recently witnessed a paradigm shift, where
vision-language models are now used to perform few-shot classification based on
textual prompts. Among these, the CLIP model has shown remarkable capabilities
for zero-shot transfer by matching an image and a custom textual prompt in its
latent space. This has paved the way for several works that focus on
engineering or learning textual contexts for maximizing CLIP's classification
capabilities. In this paper, we follow this trend by learning an ensemble of
prompts for image classification. We show that learning diverse and possibly
shorter contexts improves considerably and consistently the results rather than
relying on a single trainable prompt. In particular, we report better few-shot
capabilities with no additional cost at inference time. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our approach on 11 different benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Relay-enabled backscatter communication (BC) is an intriguing paradigm to
alleviate energy shortage and improve throughput of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
devices. Most of the existing works focus on the resource allocation that
considered the unequal and continuous time allocation for both source-relay and
relay-destination links. However, the continuous time allocation may be
infeasible since in practice, the time allocation shall be carried out in
integral multiple of the subframe duration unit. In this article, we study a
discrete time scheme from the perspective of frame structure, where one
transmission block is divided into two phases and the linear mapping is
employed as a re-encoding method to determine the number of subframes for both
phases and the power allocation for each subframe in a relay-enabled BC system.
Based on this, we derive an accurate system-throughput expression and formulate
a mixed-integral non-convex optimization problem to maximize the system
throughput by jointly optimizing the power reflection coefficient (PRC) of the
IoT node, the power allocation of the hybrid access point (HAP) and the linear
mapping matrix, and solve it via a three-step approach. Accordingly, we propose
a low complexity iterative algorithm to obtain the throughput
maximization-based resource allocation solution. Numerical results analyze the
performance of our proposed algorithm, verify the superiority of our proposed
scheme, and evaluate the impacts of network parameters on the system
throughput.

<p class="mathjax">Medical radiography segmentation, and specifically dental radiography, is
highly limited by the cost of labeling which requires specific expertise and
labor-intensive annotations. In this work, we propose a straightforward
pre-training method for semantic segmentation leveraging Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have shown impressive results for generative
modeling. Our straightforward approach achieves remarkable performance in terms
of label efficiency and does not require architectural modifications between
pre-training and downstream tasks. We propose to first pre-train a Unet by
exploiting the DDPM training objective, and then fine-tune the resulting model
on a segmentation task. Our experimental results on the segmentation of dental
radiographs demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with
state-of-the-art pre-training methods.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of easily missed hidden patterns with fast processing power makes
machine learning (ML) indispensable to today's healthcare system. Though many
ML applications have already been discovered and many are still under
investigation, only a few have been adopted by current healthcare systems. As a
result, there exists an enormous opportunity in healthcare system for ML but
distributed information, scarcity of properly arranged and easily explainable
documentation in related sector are major impede which are making ML
applications difficult to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to gather
ML applications in different areas of healthcare concisely and more effectively
so that necessary information can be accessed immediately with relevant
references. We divided our study into five major groups: community level work,
risk management/ preventive care, healthcare operation management, remote care,
and early detection. Dividing these groups into subgroups, we provided relevant
references with description in tabular form for quick access. Our objective is
to inform people about ML applicability in healthcare industry, reduce the
knowledge gap of clinicians about the ML applications and motivate healthcare
professionals towards more machine learning based healthcare system.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) aims to transfer knowledge
from related source domains to an unlabeled target domain. While recent MUDA
methods have shown promising results, most focus on aligning the overall
feature distributions across source domains, which can lead to negative effects
due to redundant features within each domain. Moreover, there is a significant
performance gap between MUDA and supervised methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Domain Discrepancy
Adjustment for Active Multi-Domain Adaptation (D3AAMDA). Firstly, we establish
a multi-source dynamic modulation mechanism during the training process based
on the degree of distribution differences between source and target domains.
This mechanism controls the alignment level of features between each source
domain and the target domain, effectively leveraging the local advantageous
feature information within the source domains. Additionally, we propose a
Multi-source Active Boundary Sample Selection (MABS) strategy, which utilizes a
guided dynamic boundary loss to design an efficient query function for
selecting important samples. This strategy achieves improved generalization to
the target domain with minimal sampling costs. We extensively evaluate our
proposed method on commonly used domain adaptation datasets, comparing it
against existing UDA and ADA methods. The experimental results unequivocally
demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Relying on large-scale training data with pixel-level labels, previous edge
detection methods have achieved high performance. However, it is hard to
manually label edges accurately, especially for large datasets, and thus the
datasets inevitably contain noisy labels. This label-noise issue has been
studied extensively for classification, while still remaining under-explored
for edge detection. To address the label-noise issue for edge detection, this
paper proposes to learn Pixel-level NoiseTransitions to model the
label-corruption process. To achieve it, we develop a novel Pixel-wise Shift
Learning (PSL) module to estimate the transition from clean to noisy labels as
a displacement field. Exploiting the estimated noise transitions, our model,
named PNT-Edge, is able to fit the prediction to clean labels. In addition, a
local edge density regularization term is devised to exploit local structure
information for better transition learning. This term encourages learning large
shifts for the edges with complex local structures. Experiments on SBD and
Cityscapes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in relieving the impact
of label noise. Codes will be available at github.

<p class="mathjax">Correlation based stereo matching has achieved outstanding performance, which
pursues cost volume between two feature maps. Unfortunately, current methods
with a fixed model do not work uniformly well across various datasets, greatly
limiting their real-world applicability. To tackle this issue, this paper
proposes a new perspective to dynamically calculate correlation for robust
stereo matching. A novel Uncertainty Guided Adaptive Correlation (UGAC) module
is introduced to robustly adapt the same model for different scenarios.
Specifically, a variance-based uncertainty estimation is employed to adaptively
adjust the sampling area during warping operation. Additionally, we improve the
traditional non-parametric warping with learnable parameters, such that the
position-specific weights can be learned. We show that by empowering the
recurrent network with the UGAC module, stereo matching can be exploited more
robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance over the ETH3D, KITTI, and Middlebury
datasets when employing the same fixed model over these datasets without any
retraining procedure. To target real-time applications, we further design a
lightweight model based on UGAC, which also outperforms other methods over
KITTI benchmarks with only 0.6 M parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, diffusion models like StableDiffusion have achieved impressive
image generation results. However, the generation process of such diffusion
models is uncontrollable, which makes it hard to generate videos with
continuous and consistent content. In this work, by using the diffusion model
with ControlNet, we proposed a new motion-guided video-to-video translation
framework called VideoControlNet to generate various videos based on the given
prompts and the condition from the input video. Inspired by the video codecs
that use motion information for reducing temporal redundancy, our framework
uses motion information to prevent the regeneration of the redundant areas for
content consistency. Specifically, we generate the first frame (i.e., the
I-frame) by using the diffusion model with ControlNet. Then we generate other
key frames (i.e., the P-frame) based on the previous I/P-frame by using our
newly proposed motion-guided P-frame generation (MgPG) method, in which the
P-frames are generated based on the motion information and the occlusion areas
are inpainted by using the diffusion model. Finally, the rest frames (i.e., the
B-frame) are generated by using our motion-guided B-frame interpolation (MgBI)
module. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoControlNet inherits
the generation capability of the pre-trained large diffusion model and extends
the image diffusion model to the video diffusion model by using motion
information. More results are provided at our project page.

<p class="mathjax">RDMA has been widely adopted for high-speed datacenter networks. However,
native RDMA merely supports one-to-one reliable connection, which mismatches
various applications with group communication patterns (e.g., one-to-many).
While there are some multicast enhancements to address it, they all fail to
simultaneously achieve optimal multicast forwarding and fully unleash the
distinguished RDMA capabilities.
<br />In this paper, we present Gleam, an RDMA-accelerated multicast protocol that
simultaneously supports optimal multicast forwarding, efficient utilization of
the prominent RDMA capabilities, and compatibility with the commodity RNICs. At
its core, Gleam re-purposes the existing RDMA RC logic with careful switch
coordination as an efficient multicast transport. Gleam performs the
one-to-many connection maintenance and many-to-one feedback aggregation, based
on an extended multicast forwarding table structure, to achieve integration
between standard RC logic and in-fabric multicast. We implement a fully
functional Gleam prototype. With extensive testbed experiments and simulations,
we demonstrate Gleam's significant improvement in accelerating multicast
communication of realistic applications. For instance, Gleam achieves 2.9X
lower communication time of an HPC benchmark application and 2.7X higher data
replication throughput.

<p class="mathjax">We study reinforcement learning (RL) for learning a Quantal Stackelberg
Equilibrium (QSE) in an episodic Markov game with a leader-follower structure.
In specific, at the outset of the game, the leader announces her policy to the
follower and commits to it. The follower observes the leader's policy and, in
turn, adopts a quantal response policy by solving an entropy-regularized policy
optimization problem induced by leader's policy. The goal of the leader is to
find her optimal policy, which yields the optimal expected total return, by
interacting with the follower and learning from data. A key challenge of this
problem is that the leader cannot observe the follower's reward, and needs to
infer the follower's quantal response model from his actions against leader's
policies. We propose sample-efficient algorithms for both the online and
offline settings, in the context of function approximation. Our algorithms are
based on (i) learning the quantal response model via maximum likelihood
estimation and (ii) model-free or model-based RL for solving the leader's
decision making problem, and we show that they achieve sublinear regret upper
bounds. Moreover, we quantify the uncertainty of these estimators and leverage
the uncertainty to implement optimistic and pessimistic algorithms for online
and offline settings. Besides, when specialized to the linear and myopic
setting, our algorithms are also computationally efficient. Our theoretical
analysis features a novel performance-difference lemma which incorporates the
error of quantal response model, which might be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">As for term rewrite systems, the dependency pair (DP, for short) framework
with several kinds of DP processors is useful for proving termination of
logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs, for short). However, the
polynomial interpretation processor is not so effective against LCTRSs with
bit-vector arithmetic (BV-LCTRSs, for short). In this paper, we propose a novel
DP processor for BV-LCTRSs to solve a singleton DP problem consisting of a
dependency pair forming a self-loop. The processor is based on an acyclic
directed graph such that the nodes are bit-vectors and any dependency chain of
the problem is projected to a path of the graph. We show a sufficient condition
for the existence of such an acyclic graph, and simplify it for a specific
case.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a robust secondary control strategy for frequency
synchronization and active power sharing for inverter-based microgrids. The
problem is addressed in a multi-agent fashion where the local controllers of
the distributed generators play the role of agents, and communication is
affected by time-varying delays. {The approach is fully distributed and based
on a synergic combination of linear consensus and integral sliding-mode
control. Lyapunovanalysis is presented to assess the stability properties of
the closed loop.} Delay-dependent stability conditions are expressed as a set
of linear matrix inequalities whose solution yields appropriate control gains
such that frequency restoration is achieved despite delays and active power
sharing constraints. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
control strategy.

<p class="mathjax">In ground-view object change detection, the recently emerging map-less
navigation has great potential as a means of navigating a robot to distantly
detected objects and identifying their changing states
(appear/disappear/no-change) with high resolution imagery. However, the
brute-force naive action strategy of navigating to every distant object
requires huge sense/plan/action costs proportional to the number of objects. In
this work, we study this new problem of ``Which distant objects should be
prioritized for map-less navigation?" and in order to speed up the R{\&amp;}D
cycle, propose a highly-simplified approach that is easy to implement and easy
to extend. In our approach, a new layer called map-based navigation is added on
top of the map-less navigation, which constitutes a hierarchical planner.
First, a dataset consisting of $N$ view sequences is acquired by a real robot
via map-less navigation. Then, an environment simulator was built to simulate a
simple action planning problem: ``Which view sequence should the robot select
next?". Then, a solver was built inspired by the analogy to the multi-armed
bandit problem: ``Which arm should the player select next?". Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed framework was verified using the semantically
non-trivial scenario ``sofa as bookshelf".

learning generative models for graphs. We replicate the results of You et al.
using a reproduced implementation of the GraphRNN architecture and evaluate

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning is challenging for multiple robots in cluttered environments
without communication, especially in view of real-time efficiency, motion
safety, distributed computation, and trajectory optimality, etc. In this paper,
a reinforced potential field method is developed for distributed multi-robot
motion planning, which is a synthesized design of reinforcement learning and
artificial potential fields. An observation embedding with a self-attention
mechanism is presented to model the robot-robot and robot-environment
interactions. A soft wall-following rule is developed to improve the trajectory
smoothness. Our method belongs to reactive planning, but environment properties
are implicitly encoded. The total amount of robots in our method can be scaled
up to any number. The performance improvement over a vanilla APF and RL method
has been demonstrated via numerical simulations. Experiments are also performed
using quadrotors to further illustrate the competence of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Periocular biometrics has been established as an independent modality due to
concerns on the performance of iris or face systems in uncontrolled conditions.
Periocular refers to the facial region in the eye vicinity, including eyelids,
lashes and eyebrows. It is available over a wide range of acquisition
distances, representing a trade-off between the whole face (which can be
occluded at close distances) and the iris texture (which do not have enough
resolution at long distances). Since the periocular region appears in face or
iris images, it can be used also in conjunction with these modalities. Features
extracted from the periocular region have been also used successfully for
gender classification and ethnicity classification, and to study the impact of
gender transformation or plastic surgery in the recognition performance. This
paper presents a review of the state of the art in periocular biometric
research, providing an insight of the most relevant issues and giving a
thorough coverage of the existing literature. Future research trends are also
briefly discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Risk assessment plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and resilience
of modern computer systems. Existing methods for conducting risk assessments
often suffer from tedious and time-consuming processes, making it challenging
to maintain a comprehensive overview of potential security issues. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages attack graphs to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of risk assessment. Attack graphs visually
represent the various attack paths that adversaries can exploit within a
system, enabling a systematic exploration of potential vulnerabilities. By
extending attack graphs with capabilities to include countermeasures and
consequences, they can be leveraged to constitute the complete risk assessment
process. Our method offers a more streamlined and comprehensive analysis of
system vulnerabilities, where system changes, or environment changes can easily
be adapted and the issues exposing the highest risk can easily be identified.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study, as well
as the applicability by combining existing risk assessment standards with our
method. Our work aims to bridge the gap between risk assessment practices and
evolving threat landscapes, offering an improved methodology for managing and
mitigating risks in modern computer systems.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work in Machine Learning and Computer Vision has highlighted the
presence of various types of systematic flaws inside ground truth object
recognition benchmark datasets. Our basic tenet is that these flaws are rooted
in the many-to-many mappings which exist between the visual information encoded
in images and the intended semantics of the labels annotating them. The net
consequence is that the current annotation process is largely under-specified,
thus leaving too much freedom to the subjective judgment of annotators. In this
paper, we propose vTelos, an integrated Natural Language Processing, Knowledge
Representation, and Computer Vision methodology whose main goal is to make
explicit the (otherwise implicit) intended annotation semantics, thus
minimizing the number and role of subjective choices. A key element of vTelos
is the exploitation of the WordNet lexico-semantic hierarchy as the main means
for providing the meaning of natural language labels and, as a consequence, for
driving the annotation of images based on the objects and the visual properties
they depict. The methodology is validated on images populating a subset of the
ImageNet hierarchy.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in event camera research emphasize processing data in its
original sparse form, which allows the use of its unique features such as high
temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, and resistance to image
blur. One promising approach for analyzing event data is through graph
convolutional networks (GCNs). However, current research in this domain
primarily focuses on optimizing computational costs, neglecting the associated
memory costs. In this paper, we consider both factors together in order to
achieve satisfying results and relatively low model complexity. For this
purpose, we performed a comparative analysis of different graph convolution
operations, considering factors such as execution time, the number of trainable
model parameters, data format requirements, and training outcomes. Our results
show a 450-fold reduction in the number of parameters for the feature
extraction module and a 4.5-fold reduction in the size of the data
representation while maintaining a classification accuracy of 52.3%, which is
6.3% higher compared to the operation used in state-of-the-art approaches. To
further evaluate performance, we implemented the object detection architecture
and evaluated its performance on the N-Caltech101 dataset. The results showed
an accuracy of 53.7 % mAP@0.5 and reached an execution rate of 82 graphs per
second.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithms for state estimation of humanoid robots usually assume that the
feet remain flat and in a constant position while in contact with the ground.
However, this hypothesis is easily violated while walking, especially for
human-like gaits with heel-toe motion. This reduces the time during which the
contact assumption can be used, or requires higher variances to account for
errors. In this paper, we present a novel state estimator based on the extended
Kalman filter that can properly handle any contact configuration. We consider
multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) distributed throughout the robot's
structure, including on both feet, which are used to track multiple bodies of
the robot. This multi-IMU instrumentation setup also has the advantage of
allowing the deformations in the robot's structure to be estimated, improving
the kinematic model used in the filter. The proposed approach is validated
experimentally on the exoskeleton Atalante and is shown to present low drift,
performing better than similar single-IMU filters. The obtained trajectory
estimates are accurate enough to construct elevation maps that have little
distortion with respect to the ground truth.

<p class="mathjax">The missing modality issue is critical but non-trivial to be solved by
multi-modal models. Current methods aiming to handle the missing modality
problem in multi-modal tasks, either deal with missing modalities only during
evaluation or train separate models to handle specific missing modality
settings. In addition, these models are designed for specific tasks, so for
example, classification models are not easily adapted to segmentation tasks and
vice versa. In this paper, we propose the Shared-Specific Feature Modelling
(ShaSpec) method that is considerably simpler and more effective than competing
approaches that address the issues above. ShaSpec is designed to take advantage
of all available input modalities during training and evaluation by learning
shared and specific features to better represent the input data. This is
achieved from a strategy that relies on auxiliary tasks based on distribution
alignment and domain classification, in addition to a residual feature fusion
procedure. Also, the design simplicity of ShaSpec enables its easy adaptation
to multiple tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Experiments are
conducted on both medical image segmentation and computer vision
classification, with results indicating that ShaSpec outperforms competing
methods by a large margin. For instance, on BraTS2018, ShaSpec improves the
SOTA by more than 3% for enhancing tumour, 5% for tumour core and 3% for whole
tumour.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel method for single-view 3D style transfer
that generates a unique 3D object with both shape and texture transfer. Our
focus lies primarily on birds, a popular subject in 3D reconstruction, for
which no existing single-view 3D transfer methods have been developed.The
method we propose seeks to generate a 3D mesh shape and texture of a bird from
two single-view images. To achieve this, we introduce a novel shape transfer
generator that comprises a dual residual gated network (DRGNet), and a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). DRGNet extracts the features of source and target
images using a shared coordinate gate unit, while the MLP generates spatial
coordinates for building a 3D mesh. We also introduce a semantic UV texture
transfer module that implements textural style transfer using semantic UV
segmentation, which ensures consistency in the semantic meaning of the
transferred regions. This module can be widely adapted to many existing
approaches. Finally, our method constructs a novel 3D bird using a
differentiable renderer. Experimental results on the CUB dataset verify that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-view 3D style
transfer task. Code is available in

<p class="mathjax">RNN-T models are widely used in ASR, which rely on the RNN-T loss to achieve
length alignment between input audio and target sequence. However, the
implementation complexity and the alignment-based optimization target of RNN-T
loss lead to computational redundancy and a reduced role for predictor network,
respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel model named CIF-Transducer
(CIF-T) which incorporates the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism
with the RNN-T model to achieve efficient alignment. In this way, the RNN-T
loss is abandoned, thus bringing a computational reduction and allowing the
predictor network a more significant role. We also introduce Funnel-CIF,
Context Blocks, Unified Gating and Bilinear Pooling joint network, and
auxiliary training strategy to further improve performance. Experiments on the
178-hour AISHELL-1 and 10000-hour WenetSpeech datasets show that CIF-T achieves
state-of-the-art results with lower computational overhead compared to RNN-T
models.

<p class="mathjax">We study the piecewise stationary combinatorial semi-bandit problem with
causally related rewards. In our nonstationary environment, variations in the
base arms' distributions, causal relationships between rewards, or both, change
the reward generation process. In such an environment, an optimal
decision-maker must follow both sources of change and adapt accordingly. The
problem becomes aggravated in the combinatorial semi-bandit setting, where the
decision-maker only observes the outcome of the selected bundle of arms. The
core of our proposed policy is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. We
assume the agent relies on an adaptive approach to overcome the challenge. More
specifically, it employs a change-point detector based on the Generalized
Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test. Besides, we introduce the notion of group restart
as a new alternative restarting strategy in the decision making process in
structured environments. Finally, our algorithm integrates a mechanism to trace
the variations of the underlying graph structure, which captures the causal
relationships between the rewards in the bandit setting. Theoretically, we
establish a regret upper bound that reflects the effects of the number of
structural- and distribution changes on the performance. The outcome of our
numerical experiments in real-world scenarios exhibits applicability and
superior performance of our proposal compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Visual question answering (VQA) has been intensively studied as a multimodal
task that requires effort in bridging vision and language to infer answers
correctly. Recent attempts have developed various attention-based modules for
solving VQA tasks. However, the performance of model inference is largely
bottlenecked by visual processing for semantics understanding. Most existing
detection methods rely on bounding boxes, remaining a serious challenge for VQA
models to understand the causal nexus of object semantics in images and
correctly infer contextual information. To this end, we propose a finer model
framework without bounding boxes in this work, termed Looking Out of Instance
Semantics (LOIS) to tackle this important issue. LOIS enables more fine-grained
feature descriptions to produce visual facts. Furthermore, to overcome the
label ambiguity caused by instance masks, two types of relation attention
modules: 1) intra-modality and 2) inter-modality, are devised to infer the
correct answers from the different multi-view features. Specifically, we
implement a mutual relation attention module to model sophisticated and deeper
visual semantic relations between instance objects and background information.
In addition, our proposed attention model can further analyze salient image
regions by focusing on important word-related questions. Experimental results
on four benchmark VQA datasets prove that our proposed method has favorable
performance in improving visual reasoning capability.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on a novel robotic system MorphoLander representing
heterogeneous swarm of drones for exploring rough terrain environments. The
morphogenetic leader drone is capable of landing on uneven terrain, traversing
it, and maintaining horizontal position to deploy smaller drones for extensive
area exploration. After completing their tasks, these drones return and land
back on the landing pads of MorphoGear. The reinforcement learning algorithm
was developed for a precise landing of drones on the leader robot that either
remains static during their mission or relocates to the new position. Several
experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed landing
algorithm under both even and uneven terrain conditions. The experiments
revealed that the proposed system results in high landing accuracy of 0.5 cm
when landing on the leader drone under even terrain conditions and 2.35 cm
under uneven terrain conditions. MorphoLander has the potential to
significantly enhance the efficiency of the industrial inspections, seismic
surveys, and rescue missions in highly cluttered and unstructured environments.

disentangled representations by replacing the standard Gaussian variational

that the underlying grid structure of categorical distributions mitigates the
problem of rotational invariance associated with multivariate Gaussian

<p class="mathjax">The advent of 5G New Radio (NR) technology has revolutionized the landscape
of wireless communication, offering various enhancements such as elevated
system capacity, improved spectrum efficiency, and higher data transmission
rates. To achieve these benefits, 5G has implemented the Ultra-Dense Network
(UDN) architecture, characterized by the deployment of numerous small general
Node B (gNB) units. While this approach boosts system capacity and frequency
reuse, it also raises concerns such as increased signal interference, longer
handover times, and higher handover failure rates. To address these challenges,
the critical factor of Time to Trigger (TTT) in handover management must be
accurately determined. Furthermore, the density of gNBs has a significant
impact on handover performance. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of
5G handover management. Through the development and utilization of a downlink
system-level simulator, the effects of various TTT values and gNB densities on
5G handover were evaluated, taking into consideration the movement of Traffic
Users (TUs) with varying velocities. Simulation results showed that the
handover performance can be optimized by adjusting the TTT under different gNB
densities, providing valuable insights into the proper selection of TTT, UDN,
and TU velocity to enhance 5G handover performance.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication opens an ample
amount of opportunities to increase the safety of drivers and passengers and
improve traffic efficiency which enables direct communication between vehicles.
The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified a 5G New Radio
(NR) Sidelink (SL) PC5 interface for supporting Cellular V2X (C-V2X)
communication in Release 16 in 2017. 5G NR V2X communication is expected to
provide high reliability, extra-low latency, and a high data rate for vehicular
networks. In this paper, the newly introduced features of 5G NR standards like
flexible numerology, variable Subcarrier Spacing (SCS), and allocated Physical
Resource Blocks (PRBs) have been inspected in 5G NR V2X communications.
Moreover, the 5G NR V2X data packet will be distributed to all nearby User
Equipment (UE) by the Transmitter (Tx). However, there may be instances where
certain UEs fail to receive the data packets in a single transmission.
Unfortunately, the SL Tx lacks a feedback channel to verify if the Receivers
(Rxs) have received the information. To meet the stringent reliability and
latency requirements of C-V2X communication, we suggest and assess a
retransmission scheme along with a scheme that incorporates varying resource
allocations for retransmission in NR V2X communication. The effect of
retransmission schemes on NR V2X communication systems has been detected.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new method to quantify the impact of cyber attacks in Cyber
Physical Systems (CPSs). In particular, our method allows to identify the
Design Parameter (DPs) affected due to a cyber attack launched on a different
set of DPs in the same CPS. To achieve this, we adopt causal graphs to causally
link DPs with each other and quantify the impact of one DP on another. Using
SWaT, a real world testbed of a water treatment system, we demonstrate that
causal graphs can be build in two ways: i) using domain knowledge of the
control logic and the physical connectivity structure of the DPs, we call these
causal domain graphs and ii) learning from operational data logs, we call these
causal learnt graphs. We then compare these graphs when a same set of DPs is
used. Our analysis shows a common set of edges between the causal domain graphs
and the causal learnt graphs exists, which helps validate the causal learnt
graphs. Additionally, we show that the learnt graphs can discover new causal
relations, not initially considered in the domain graphs, that help
significantly characterising the impact of the attack. We use causal domain
graphs to estimate the parameters of the graphs, and the causal learnt graphs
for causal inference. To learn the structure of the causal learnt graphs in all
the six-stages of SWaT, we experiment with three learning algorithms: Peter
Clarke (PC), Hill Climb (HC) search and Chow-Lie (CH). Finally, we demonstrate
how causal graphs can be used to analyse the impact of cyber attacks by
analysing nine well known cyber attacks on the SWaT test bed. We find that by
using causal learnt graphs the DPs impacted by the attacks are correctly
discovered with a probability greater than 0.9.

<p class="mathjax">The control of free-floating robots requires dealing with several challenges.
The motion of such robots evolves on a continuous manifold described by the
Special Euclidean Group of dimension 3, known as SE(3). Methods from finite
horizon Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) control have gained recent traction
in the robotics community. However, such approaches are inherently solving an
unconstrained optimization problem and hence are unable to respect the manifold
constraints imposed by the group structure of SE(3). This may lead to small
errors, singularity problems and double cover issues depending on the choice of
coordinates to model the floating base motion. In this paper, we propose the
use of canonical exponential coordinates of SE(3) and the associated
Exponential map along with its differentials to embed this structure in the
theory of finite horizon LQR controllers.

<p class="mathjax">$\text{TT}^{\Box}_{{\mathcal C}}$ is a generic family of effectful,
extensional type theories with a forcing interpretation parameterized by
modalities. This paper identifies a subclass of $\text{TT}^{\Box}_{{\mathcal
C}}$ theories that internally realizes continuity principles through stateful
computations, such as reference cells. The principle of continuity is a seminal
property that holds for a number of intuitionistic theories such as System T.
Roughly speaking, it states that functions on real numbers only need
approximations of these numbers to compute. Generally, continuity principles
have been justified using semantical arguments, but it is known that the
modulus of continuity of functions can be computed using effectful computations
such as exceptions or reference cells. In this paper, the modulus of continuity
of the functionals on the Baire space is directly computed using the stateful
computations enabled internally in the theory.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo approach for estimating quantities
of interest for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Drawing
inspiration from [Giles and Szpruch: Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo
estimation for multi-dimensional SDEs without L\'evy area simulation, Annals of
Appl. Prob., 2014], we extend the antithetic Milstein scheme for
finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations to Hilbert space-valued
SPDEs. Our method has the advantages of both Euler and Milstein
discretizations, as it is easy to implement and does not involve intractable
L\'evy area terms. Moreover, the antithetic correction in our method leads to
the same variance decay in a MLMC algorithm as the standard Milstein method,
resulting in significantly lower computational complexity than a corresponding
MLMC Euler scheme. Our approach is applicable to a broader range of non-linear
diffusion coefficients and does not require any commutative properties. The key
component of our MLMC algorithm is a truncated Milstein-type time stepping
scheme for SPDEs, which accelerates the rate of variance decay in the MLMC
method when combined with an antithetic coupling on the fine scales. We combine
the truncated Milstein scheme with appropriate spatial discretizations and
noise approximations on all scales to obtain a fully discrete scheme and show
that the antithetic coupling does not introduce an additional bias.

<p class="mathjax">DeepLab is a widely used deep neural network for semantic segmentation, whose
success is attributed to its parallel architecture called atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP). ASPP uses multiple atrous convolutions with different
atrous rates to extract both local and global information. However, fixed
values of atrous rates are used for the ASPP module, which restricts the size
of its field of view. In principle, atrous rate should be a hyperparameter to
change the field of view size according to the target task or dataset. However,
the manipulation of atrous rate is not governed by any guidelines. This study
proposes practical guidelines for obtaining an optimal atrous rate. First, an
effective receptive field for semantic segmentation is introduced to analyze
the inner behavior of segmentation networks. We observed that the use of ASPP
module yielded a specific pattern in the effective receptive field, which was
traced to reveal the module's underlying mechanism. Accordingly, we derive
practical guidelines for obtaining the optimal atrous rate, which should be
controlled based on the size of input image. Compared to other values, using
the optimal atrous rate consistently improved the segmentation results across
multiple datasets, including the STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF, Cityscapes, and iSAID
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Low-lying coastal cities, exemplified by Norfolk, Virginia, face the
challenge of street flooding caused by rainfall and tides, which strain
transportation and sewer systems and can lead to property damage. While
high-fidelity, physics-based simulations provide accurate predictions of urban
pluvial flooding, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for
real-time applications. Using data from Norfolk rainfall events between 2016
and 2018, this study compares the performance of a previous surrogate model
based on a random forest algorithm with two deep learning models: Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This investigation
underscores the importance of using a model architecture that supports the
communication of prediction uncertainty and the effective integration of
relevant, multi-modal features.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless communication is enabling billions of people to connect to each
other and the internet, transforming every sector of the economy, and building
the foundations for powerful new technologies that hold great promise to
improve lives at an unprecedented rate and scale. The rapid increase in the
number of devices and the associated demands for higher data rates and broader
network coverage fuels the need for more robust wireless technologies. The key
technology identified to address this problem is referred to as Cell-Free
Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO). CF-mMIMO is accompanied by many challenges, one of
which is efficiently allocating limited resources. In this paper, we focus on a
major resource allocation problem in wireless networks, namely the Pilot
Assignment problem (PA). We show that PA is strongly NP-hard and that it does
not admit a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm. Further,
we show that PA cannot be approximated in polynomial time within
$\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ (where $K$ is the number of users) when the system consists
of at least three pilots. Finally, we present an approximation lower bound of
$1.058$ (resp. $\epsilon|K|^2$, for $\epsilon &gt;0$) in special cases where the
system consists of exactly two (resp. three) pilots.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting future trajectories of agents in complex traffic scenes requires
reliable and efficient predictions for all agents in the scene. However,
existing methods for trajectory prediction are either inefficient or sacrifice
accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose ADAPT, a novel approach for
jointly predicting the trajectories of all agents in the scene with dynamic
weight learning. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
single-agent and multi-agent settings on the Argoverse and Interaction
datasets, with a fraction of their computational overhead. We attribute the
improvement in our performance: first, to the adaptive head augmenting the
model capacity without increasing the model size; second, to our design choices
in the endpoint-conditioned prediction, reinforced by gradient stopping. Our
analyses show that ADAPT can focus on each agent with adaptive prediction,
allowing for accurate predictions efficiently. https://KUIS-AI.github.io/adapt

<p class="mathjax">Numerous models for supervised and reinforcement learning benefit from
combinations of discrete and continuous model components. End-to-end learnable
discrete-continuous models are compositional, tend to generalize better, and
are more interpretable. A popular approach to building discrete-continuous
computation graphs is that of integrating discrete probability distributions
into neural networks using stochastic softmax tricks. Prior work has mainly
focused on computation graphs with a single discrete component on each of the
graph's execution paths. We analyze the behavior of more complex stochastic
computations graphs with multiple sequential discrete components. We show that
it is challenging to optimize the parameters of these models, mainly due to
small gradients and local minima. We then propose two new strategies to
overcome these challenges. First, we show that increasing the scale parameter
of the Gumbel noise perturbations during training improves the learning
behavior. Second, we propose dropout residual connections specifically tailored
to stochastic, discrete-continuous computation graphs. With an extensive set of
experiments, we show that we can train complex discrete-continuous models which
one cannot train with standard stochastic softmax tricks. We also show that
complex discrete-stochastic models generalize better than their continuous
counterparts on several benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The hydrometallurgical method of zinc production involves leaching zinc from
ore and then separating the solid residue from the liquid solution by pressure
filtration. This separation process is very important since the solid residue
contains some moisture that can reduce the amount of zinc recovered. This study
modeled the pressure filtration process through Random Forest (RF) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). The models take continuous variables (extracted features)
from the lab samples as inputs. Thus, regression models namely Random Forest
Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were chosen. A total
dataset was obtained during the pressure filtration process in two conditions:
1) Polypropylene (S1) and 2) Polyester fabrics (S2). To predict the cake
moisture, solids concentration (0.2 and 0.38), temperature (35 and 65
centigrade), pH (2, 3.5, and 5), pressure, cake thickness (14, 20, 26, and 34
mm), air-blow time (2, 10 and 15 min) and filtration time were applied as input
variables. The models' predictive accuracy was evaluated by the coefficient of
determination (R2) parameter. The results revealed that the RFR model is
superior to the SVR model for cake moisture prediction.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates a spherical transmitter (TX) with a membrane covered
by heterogeneous receptors of varying sizes and arbitrary locations for
molecular communication (MC), where molecules are encapsulated within vesicles
and released from the TX through membrane fusion. Assuming continuous vesicle
generation at the TX and a transparent receiver (RX), we calculate the molecule
release rate, the fraction of absorbed molecules at the TX, and the received
signal at the RX. All obtained analytical expressions are functions of all
receptors locations and sizes, and are validated by particle-based simulations.
Our numerical results indicate that evenly distributed receptors on the TX
membrane can absorb more molecules than randomly distributed receptors or a
single receptor. Furthermore, inspired by the autoreceptor functionality in
synaptic communication, we incorporate a negative feedback mechanism (NFM) at
the TX, such that molecule release stops after a certain period. We then derive
the fraction of molecules that can be reused for the subsequent emissions when
considering both NFM and molecule harvesting. Our numerical results demonstrate
that incorporating NFM can reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI) while
maintaining the same peak received signal as the case without NFM.
Additionally, our results show that TXs incorporating both molecule harvesting
and NFM can achieve a higher energy efficiency and lower error probability than
TXs employing only molecule harvesting or neither functionality.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven requirements engineering leverages the abundance of openly
accessible and crowdsourced information on the web. By incorporating user
feedback provided about a software product, such as reviews in mobile app
stores, these approaches facilitate the identification of issues, bug fixes,
and implementation of change requests. However, relying solely on user feedback
about a software product limits the possibility of eliciting all requirements,
as users may not always have a clear understanding of their exact needs from
the software, despite their wealth of experience with the problem, event, or
challenges they encounter and use the software to assist them. In this study,
we propose a shift in requirements elicitation, focusing on gathering feedback
related to the problem itself rather than relying solely on feedback about the
software product. We conducted a case study on student requirements during the
COVID-19 pandemic in a higher education institution. We gathered their
communications from Reddit during the pandemic and employed multiple
machine-learning and natural language processing techniques to identify
requirement sentences. We achieved the F-score of 0.79 using Naive Bayes with
TF-IDF when benchmarking multiple techniques. The results lead us to believe
that mining requirements from communication about a problem are feasible. While
we present the preliminary results, we envision a future where these
requirements complement conventionally elicited requirements and help to close
the requirements gap.

<p class="mathjax">Flexible robots have advantages over rigid robots in their ability to conform
physically to their environment and to form a wide variety of shapes. Sensing
the force applied by or to flexible robots is useful for both navigation and
manipulation tasks, but it is challenging due to the need for the sensors to
withstand the robots' shape change without encumbering their functionality.
Also, for robots with long or large bodies, the number of sensors required to
cover the entire surface area of the robot body can be prohibitive due to high
cost and complexity. We present a novel soft air pocket force sensor that is
highly flexible, lightweight, relatively inexpensive, and easily scalable to
various sizes. Our sensor produces a change in internal pressure that is linear
with the applied force. We present results of experimental testing of how
uncontrollable factors (contact location and contact area) and controllable
factors (initial internal pressure, thickness, size, and number of interior
seals) affect the sensitivity. We demonstrate our sensor applied to a vine
robot-a soft inflatable robot that "grows" from the tip via eversion-and we
show that the robot can successfully grow and steer towards an object with
which it senses contact.

equations with homogeneous Dirichlet/no-slip boundary conditions. We show error
estimates for the fully discrete problem, where a discontinuous Galerkin method
in time and inf-sup stable finite elements in space are used. Recently, best
approximation type error estimates for the Stokes problem in the
$L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$, $L^2(I;H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^2(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norms
have been shown. The main result of the present work extends the error estimate
in the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norm to the Navier-Stokes equations, by
pursuing an error splitting approach and an appropriate duality argument. In
order to discuss the stability of solutions to the discrete primal and dual
equations, a specialized discrete Gronwall lemma is presented. The techniques
developed towards showing the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$ error estimate, also
allow us to show best approximation type error estimates in the
$L^2(I;H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^2(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norms, which complement this

<p class="mathjax">The "Sum-Over-Paths" formalism is a way to symbolically manipulate linear
maps that describe quantum systems, and is a tool that is used in formal
verification of such systems. We give here a new set of rewrite rules for the
formalism, and show that it is complete for "Toffoli-Hadamard", the simplest
approximately universal fragment of quantum mechanics. We show that the
rewriting is terminating, but not confluent (which is expected from the
universality of the fragment). We do so using the connection between
Sum-over-Paths and graphical language ZH-calculus, and also show how the
axiomatisation translates into the latter. We provide generalisations of the
presented rewrite rules, that can prove useful when trying to reduce terms in
practice, and we show how to graphically make sense of these new rules. We show
how to enrich the rewrite system to reach completeness for the dyadic fragments
of quantum computation, used in particular in the Quantum Fourier Transform,
and obtained by adding phase gates with dyadic multiples of $\pi$ to the
Toffoli-Hadamard gate-set. Finally, we show how to perform sums and
concatenation of arbitrary terms, something which is not native in a system
designed for analysing gate-based quantum computation, but necessary when
considering Hamiltonian-based quantum computation.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional recommender systems leverage users' item preference history to
recommend novel content that users may like. However, modern dialog interfaces
that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally
different modality for preference input. Inspired by recent successes of
prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for
making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in
comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods.
To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both
item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their
ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items.
Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive
recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item
preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF
methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task
(zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot). This is particularly promising as
language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable
than item-based or vector-based representations.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional Chinese Painting (TCP) is an invaluable cultural heritage
resource and a unique visual art style. In recent years, increasing interest
has been placed on digitalizing TCPs to preserve and revive the culture. The
resulting digital copies have enabled the advancement of computational methods
for structured and systematic understanding of TCPs. To explore this topic, we
conducted an in-depth analysis of 92 pieces of literature. We examined the
current use of computer technologies on TCPs from three perspectives, based on
numerous conversations with specialists. First, in light of the "Six Principles
of Painting" theory, we categorized the articles according to their research
focus on artistic elements. Second, we created a four-stage framework to
illustrate the purposes of TCP applications. Third, we summarized the popular
computational techniques applied to TCPs. The framework also provides insights
into potential applications and future prospects, with professional opinion.

<p class="mathjax">Modern computer systems are ubiquitous in contemporary life yet many of them
remain opaque. This poses significant challenges in domains where desiderata
such as fairness or accountability are crucial. We suggest that the best
strategy for achieving system transparency varies depending on the specific
source of opacity prevalent in a given context. Synthesizing and extending
existing discussions, we propose a taxonomy consisting of eight sources of
opacity that fall into three main categories: architectural, analytical, and
socio-technical. For each source, we provide initial suggestions as to how to
address the resulting opacity in practice. The taxonomy provides a starting
point for requirements engineers and other practitioners to understand
contextually prevalent sources of opacity, and to select or develop appropriate
strategies for overcoming them.

<p class="mathjax">Many swarm robotics tasks consist of multiple conflicting objectives. This
research proposes a multi-objective evolutionary neural network approach to
developing controllers for swarms of robots. The swarm robot controllers are
trained in a low-fidelity Python simulator and then tested in a high-fidelity
simulated environment using Webots. Simulations are then conducted to test the
scalability of the evolved multi-objective robot controllers to environments
with a larger number of robots. The results presented demonstrate that the
proposed approach can effectively control each of the robots. The robot swarm
exhibits different behaviours as the weighting for each objective is adjusted.
The results also confirm that multi-objective neural network controllers
evolved in a low-fidelity simulator can be transferred to high-fidelity
simulated environments and that the controllers can scale to environments with
a larger number of robots without further retraining needed.

<p class="mathjax">Visual-Semantic Embedding (VSE) networks can help search engines better
understand the meaning behind visual content and associate it with relevant
textual information, leading to more accurate search results. VSE networks can
be used in cross-modal search engines to embed image and textual descriptions
in a shared space, enabling image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks.
However, the full potential of VSE networks for search engines has yet to be
fully explored. This paper presents Boon, a novel cross-modal search engine
that combines two state-of-the-art networks: the GPT-3.5-turbo large language
model, and the VSE network VITR (VIsion Transformers with Relation-focused
learning) to enhance the engine's capabilities in extracting and reasoning with
regional relationships in images. VITR employs encoders from CLIP that were
trained with 400 million image-description pairs and it was fine-turned on the
RefCOCOg dataset. Boon's neural-based components serve as its main
functionalities: 1) a 'cross-modal search engine' that enables end-users to
perform image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval. 2) a 'multi-lingual
conversational AI' component that enables the end-user to converse about one or
more images selected by the end-user. Such a feature makes the search engine
accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual impairments. 3) Boon
is multi-lingual and can take queries and handle conversations about images in
multiple languages. Boon was implemented using the Django and PyTorch
frameworks. The interface and capabilities of the Boon search engine are
demonstrated using the RefCOCOg dataset, and the engine's ability to search for
multimedia through the web is facilitated by Google's API.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Recent advances in Surgical Data Science (SDS) have contributed to
an increase in video recordings from hospital environments. While methods such
as surgical workflow recognition show potential in increasing the quality of
patient care, the quantity of video data has surpassed the scale at which
images can be manually anonymized. Existing automated 2D anonymization methods
under-perform in Operating Rooms (OR), due to occlusions and obstructions. We
propose to anonymize multi-view OR recordings using 3D data from multiple
camera streams. Methods: RGB and depth images from multiple cameras are fused
into a 3D point cloud representation of the scene. We then detect each
individual's face in 3D by regressing a parametric human mesh model onto
detected 3D human keypoints and aligning the face mesh with the fused 3D point
cloud. The mesh model is rendered into every acquired camera view, replacing
each individual's face. Results: Our method shows promise in locating faces at
a higher rate than existing approaches. DisguisOR produces geometrically
consistent anonymizations for each camera view, enabling more realistic
anonymization that is less detrimental to downstream tasks. Conclusion:
Frequent obstructions and crowding in operating rooms leaves significant room
for improvement for off-the-shelf anonymization methods. DisguisOR addresses
privacy on a scene level and has the potential to facilitate further research
in SDS.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are successfully used in various applications, but show
their vulnerability to adversarial examples. With the development of
adversarial patches, the feasibility of attacks in physical scenes increases,
and the defenses against patch attacks are urgently needed. However, defending
such adversarial patch attacks is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we
analyse the properties of adversarial patches, and find that: on the one hand,
adversarial patches will lead to the appearance or contextual inconsistency in
the target objects; on the other hand, the patch region will show abnormal
changes on the high-level feature maps of the objects extracted by a backbone
network. Considering the above two points, we propose a novel defense method
based on a ``localizing and inpainting" mechanism to pre-process the input
examples. Specifically, we design an unified framework, where the ``localizing"
sub-network utilizes a two-branch structure to represent the above two aspects
to accurately detect the adversarial patch region in the image. For the
``inpainting" sub-network, it utilizes the surrounding contextual cues to
recover the original content covered by the adversarial patch. The quality of
inpainted images is also evaluated by measuring the appearance consistency and
the effects of adversarial attacks. These two sub-networks are then jointly
trained via an iterative optimization manner. In this way, the ``localizing"
and ``inpainting" modules can interact closely with each other, and thus learn
a better solution. A series of experiments versus traffic sign classification
and detection tasks are conducted to defend against various adversarial patch
attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Creating an intelligent search and retrieval system for artwork images,
particularly paintings, is crucial for documenting cultural heritage, fostering
wider public engagement, and advancing artistic analysis and interpretation.
Visual-Semantic Embedding (VSE) networks are deep learning models used for
information retrieval, which learn joint representations of textual and visual
data, enabling 1) cross-modal search and retrieval tasks, such as image-to-text
and text-to-image retrieval; and 2) relation-focused retrieval to capture
entity relationships and provide more contextually relevant search results.
Although VSE networks have played a significant role in cross-modal information
retrieval, their application to painting datasets, such as ArtUK, remains
unexplored. This paper introduces BoonArt, a VSE-based cross-modal search
engine that allows users to search for images using textual queries, and to
obtain textual descriptions along with the corresponding images when using
image queries. The performance of BoonArt was evaluated using the ArtUK
dataset. Experimental evaluations revealed that BoonArt achieved 97% Recall@10
for image-to-text retrieval, and 97.4% Recall@10 for text-to-image Retrieval.
By bridging the gap between textual and visual modalities, BoonArt provides a
much-improved search performance compared to traditional search engines, such
as the one provided by the ArtUK website. BoonArt can be utilised to work with
other artwork datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Navigation of a mobile robot is conditioned on the knowledge of its pose. In
observer-based localisation configurations its initial pose may not be knowable
in advance, leading to the need of its estimation. Solutions to the problem of
global localisation are either robust against noise and environment
arbitrariness but require motion and time, which may (need to) be economised
on, or require minimal estimation time but assume environmental structure, may
be sensitive to noise, and demand preprocessing and tuning. This article
proposes a method that retains the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of the
two approaches. The method leverages properties of the Cumulative Absolute
Error per Ray metric with respect to the errors of pose estimates of a 2D LIDAR
sensor, and utilises scan--to--map-scan matching for fine(r) pose
approximations. A large number of tests, in real and simulated conditions,
involving disparate environments and sensor properties, illustrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods of both classes of
solutions in terms of pose discovery rate and execution time. The source code

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers (ViT) have been of broad interest in recent theoretical
and empirical works. They are state-of-the-art thanks to their attention-based
approach, which boosts the identification of key features and patterns within
images thanks to the capability of avoiding inductive bias, resulting in highly
accurate image analysis. Meanwhile, neoteric studies have reported a ``sparse
double descent'' phenomenon that can occur in modern deep-learning models,
where extremely over-parametrized models can generalize well. This raises
practical questions about the optimal size of the model and the quest over
finding the best trade-off between sparsity and performance is launched: are
Vision Transformers also prone to sparse double descent? Can we find a way to
avoid such a phenomenon? Our work tackles the occurrence of sparse double
descent on ViTs. Despite some works that have shown that traditional
architectures, like Resnet, are condemned to the sparse double descent
phenomenon, for ViTs we observe that an optimally-tuned $\ell_2$ regularization
relieves such a phenomenon. However, everything comes at a cost: optimal lambda
will sacrifice the potential compression of the ViT.

$6^kn^{O(1)}$ and Connected Dominating Set in time $5^kn^{O(1)}$. Moreover,
under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH) these results were showed
to be tight. However, they leave open several important benchmark problems,
whose complexity relative to treewidth had been settled by Cygan et al. [SODA
2011 &amp; TALG 2018]. Among which is the Steiner Tree problem. As a key
obstruction they point out the exponential gap between the rank of certain
compatibility matrices, which is often used for algorithms, and the largest
triangular submatrix therein, which is essential for current lower bound
methods. Concretely, for Steiner Tree the $GF(2)$-rank is $4^k$, while no
triangular submatrix larger than $3^k$ was known. This yields time
$4^kn^{O(1)}$, while the obtainable impossibility of time
$(3-\varepsilon)^kn^{O(1)}$ under SETH was already known relative to pathwidth.
<br />We close this gap by showing that Steiner Tree can be solved in time
$3^kn^{O(1)}$ given a $k$-clique-expression. Hence, for all parameters between
cutwidth and clique-width it has the same tight complexity. We first show that
there is a ``representative submatrix'' of GF(2)-rank $3^k$ (ruling out larger
triangular submatrices). At first glance, this only allows to count (modulo 2)
the number of representations of valid solutions, but not the number of
solutions (even if a unique solution exists). We show how to overcome this
problem by isolating a unique representative of a unique solution, if one
exists. We believe that our approach will be instrumental for settling further
open problems in this research program.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes enhancements to the RICE-N simulation and multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework to improve the realism of international
climate policy negotiations. Acknowledging the framework's value, we highlight
the necessity of significant enhancements to address the diverse array of
factors in modeling climate negotiations. Building upon our previous work on
the "Conditional Commitments Mechanism" (CCF mechanism) we discuss ways to
bridge the gap between simulation and reality. We suggest the inclusion of a
recommender or planner agent to enhance coordination, address the Real2Sim gap
by incorporating social factors and non-party stakeholder sub-agents, and
propose enhancements to the underlying Reinforcement Learning solution
algorithm. These proposed improvements aim to advance the evaluation and
formulation of negotiation protocols for more effective international climate

<p class="mathjax">The Paris Agreement, considered a significant milestone in climate
negotiations, has faced challenges in effectively addressing climate change due
to the unconditional nature of most Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
This has resulted in a prevalence of free-riding behavior among major polluters
and a lack of concrete conditionality in NDCs. To address this issue, we
propose the implementation of a decentralized, bottom-up approach called the
Conditional Commitment Mechanism. This mechanism, inspired by the National
Popular Vote Interstate Compact, offers flexibility and incentives for early
adopters, aiming to formalize conditional cooperation in international climate
policy. In this paper, we provide an overview of the mechanism, its performance
in the AI4ClimateCooperation challenge, and discuss potential real-world
implementation aspects. Prior knowledge of the climate mitigation collective
action problem, basic economic principles, and game theory concepts are
assumed.

<p class="mathjax">The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly and so the need of ensuring
protection against cybersecurity attacks to IoT devices. In this scenario,
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a crucial role and data-driven IDSs
based on machine learning (ML) have recently attracted more and more interest
by the research community. While conventional ML-based IDSs are based on a
centralized architecture where IoT devices share their data with a central
server for model training, we propose a novel approach that is based on
federated learning (FL). However, conventional FL is ineffective in the
considered scenario, due to the high statistical heterogeneity of data
collected by IoT devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose a three-tier
FL-based architecture where IoT devices are clustered together based on their
statistical properties. Clustering decisions are taken by means of a novel
entropy-based strategy, which helps improve model training performance. We
tested our solution on the CIC-ToN-IoT dataset: our clustering strategy
increases intrusion detection performance with respect to a conventional FL
approach up to +17% in terms of F1-score, along with a significant reduction of
the number of training rounds.

endpoints of the domain and enables the complete convergence of the costate
variables associated with the Hamilton boundary-value problem. This is achieved
through the inclusion of an \emph{exceptional sample} to the roots of the
Legendre-Lobatto polynomial, thus promoting the associated differentiation
matrix to be full-rank. We study the location of the new sample such that the
differentiation matrix is the most robust to perturbations and we prove that
this location is also the choice that mitigates the Runge phenomenon associated
with polynomial interpolation. Two benchmark problems are successfully
implemented in support of our theoretical findings. The new method is observed
to converge exponentially with the number of discretization points used.

<p class="mathjax">Object pushing presents a key non-prehensile manipulation problem that is
illustrative of more complex robotic manipulation tasks. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated impressive learning
capabilities using visual input, a lack of tactile sensing limits their
capability for fine and reliable control during manipulation. Here we propose a
deep RL approach to object pushing using tactile sensing without visual input,
namely tactile pushing. We present a goal-conditioned formulation that allows
both model-free and model-based RL to obtain accurate policies for pushing an
object to a goal. To achieve real-world performance, we adopt a sim-to-real
approach. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to train on a single
object and a limited sample of goals to produce precise and reliable policies
that can generalize to a variety of unseen objects and pushing scenarios
without domain randomization. We experiment with the trained agents in harsh
pushing conditions, and show that with significantly more training samples, a
model-free policy can outperform a model-based planner, generating shorter and
more reliable pushing trajectories despite large disturbances. The simplicity
of our training environment and effective real-world performance highlights the
value of rich tactile information for fine manipulation. Code and videos are

<p class="mathjax">The recent video grounding works attempt to introduce vanilla contrastive
learning into video grounding. However, we claim that this naive solution is
suboptimal. Contrastive learning requires two key properties: (1)
\emph{alignment} of features of similar samples, and (2) \emph{uniformity} of
the induced distribution of the normalized features on the hypersphere. Due to
two annoying issues in video grounding: (1) the co-existence of some visual
entities in both ground truth and other moments, \ie semantic overlapping; (2)
only a few moments in the video are annotated, \ie sparse annotation dilemma,
vanilla contrastive learning is unable to model the correlations between
temporally distant moments and learned inconsistent video representations. Both
characteristics lead to vanilla contrastive learning being unsuitable for video
grounding. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic and Game Localization (G2L), a
semantically aligned and uniform video grounding framework via geodesic and
game theory. We quantify the correlations among moments leveraging the geodesic
distance that guides the model to learn the correct cross-modal
representations. Furthermore, from the novel perspective of game theory, we
propose semantic Shapley interaction based on geodesic distance sampling to
learn fine-grained semantic alignment in similar moments. Experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Fully-unsupervised Person and Vehicle Re-Identification have received
increasing attention due to their broad applicability in surveillance,
forensics, event understanding, and smart cities, without requiring any manual
annotation. However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets that
have just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the use
of costly techniques in time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, to
improve clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects the
best clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in a
large-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles a
more realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scale
unlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling to
reduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhood
relationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, which
has a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity from
O(n^2) to O(kn) with k &lt;&lt; n. To avoid the pre-selection of specific
hyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novel
scheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, to
leverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisy
labeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by different
models, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon the
permutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need for
any hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodology
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in the
challenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficient
Re-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-based
learning approach.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of standards for deterministic network behavior, synthesizing
network designs under delay constraints becomes the natural next task to
tackle. Network Calculus (NC) has become a key method for validating industrial
networks, as it computes formally verified end-to-end delay bounds. However,
analyses from the NC framework have been designed to bound the delay of one
flow at a time. Attempts to use classical analyses to derive a network
configuration have shown that this approach is poorly suited to practical use
cases. Consider finding a delay-optimal routing configuration: one model had to
be created for each routing alternative, then each flow delay had to be
bounded, and then the bounds had to be compared to the given constraints. To
overcome this three-step process, we introduce Differential Network Calculus.
We extend NC to allow the differentiation of delay bounds w.r.t. to a wide
range of network parameters - such as flow paths or priority. This opens up NC
to a class of efficient nonlinear optimization techniques that exploit the
gradient of the delay bound. Our numerical evaluation on the routing and
priority assignment problem shows that our novel method can synthesize flow
paths and priorities in a matter of seconds, outperforming existing methods by
several orders of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and
remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit
factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its
autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to
have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the
reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure
on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the
distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Previous researchers
have calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new
combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit
factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for
$p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For
any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the
$p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$.
The previously obtained formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with
a short calculation, and we demonstrate that our techniques go beyond this by
also deriving an exact formula for the skewness.

<p class="mathjax">Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined
and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more
general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically
designed for them. The term General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems
(GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility
of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any
intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an
aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might
still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the
forefront of AI research.
<br />This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new
definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS
according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between
closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and
ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in
domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or
proactive acknowledgment of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy
of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of
AI techniques to improve another AI or foundation models. As a prime example,
we delve into generative AI, aligning them with the terms and concepts
presented in the taxonomy. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our
aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are
tackling general-purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, we
discuss the current state of GPAIS, its challenges and prospects, implications
for our society, and the need for responsible and trustworthy AI systems and
regulation, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS.

<p class="mathjax">Stream processing has become a critical component in the architecture of
modern applications. With the exponential growth of data generation from
sources such as the Internet of Things, business intelligence, and
telecommunications, real-time processing of unbounded data streams has become a
necessity. DSP systems provide a solution to this challenge, offering high
horizontal scalability, fault-tolerant execution, and the ability to process
data streams from multiple sources in a single DSP job. Often enough though,
data streams need to be enriched with extra information for correct processing,
which introduces additional dependencies and potential bottlenecks.
<br />In this paper, we present an in-depth evaluation of data enrichment methods
for DSP systems and identify the different use cases for stream processing in
modern systems. Using a representative DSP system and conducting the evaluation
in a realistic cloud environment, we found that outsourcing enrichment data to
the DSP system can improve performance for specific use cases. However, this
increased resource consumption highlights the need for stream processing
solutions specifically designed for the performance-intensive workloads of
cloud-based applications.

<p class="mathjax">The study and development of innovative solutions for the advanced
visualisation, representation and analysis of medical images offer different
research directions. Current practice in medical imaging consists in combining
real-time US with imaging modalities that allow internal anatomy acquisitions,
such as CT, MRI, PET or similar. Application of image-fusion approaches can be
found in tracking surgical tools and/or needles, in real-time during
interventions. Thus, this work proposes a fusion imaging system for the
registration of CT and MRI images with real-time US acquisition leveraging a 3D
camera sensor. The main focus of the work is the portability of the system and
its applicability to different anatomical districts.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce and study the cumulative information generating function, which
provides a unifying mathematical tool suitable to deal with classical and
fractional entropies based on the cumulative distribution function and on the
survival function. Specifically, after establishing its main properties and
some bounds, we show that it is a variability measure itself that extends the
Gini mean semi-difference. We also provide (i) an extension of such a measure,
based on distortion functions, and (ii) a weighted version based on a mixture
distribution. Furthermore, we explore some connections with the reliability of
$k$-out-of-$n$ systems and with stress-strength models for multi-component
systems. Also, we address the problem of extending the cumulative information
generating function to higher dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">We take as a case study the spread of Germanic syntactic features into
Romance dialects of North-Eastern Italy, which occurred after the immigration
of German people in the Tyrol during the High Middle Ages.
<br />An interactive map is produced using tools of what is called Geographic Data
Science. A smooth two-dimensional surface $\mathcal{G}$ expresses locally which
fraction of territory uses a given German language feature: it is obtained by
interpolating a discrete function that says if at any surveyed locality that
feature is used or not.\newline
<br />This surface $\mathcal{G}$ is thought of as the value at the present time of
a function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions (here
said \emph{tidal} mode), which is subjected in a very natural way to the same
equation, suitably contextualized, used in physics for a number of
phenomenological facts like the heat diffusion. It is shown that solutions of
this equation, evaluated at the present time, fit well with the data as
interpolated by $\mathcal{G}$, thus providing convincing pictures of
diffusion-convection of the linguistic features of the case study, albeit
simplifications and approximations.\newline
<br />Very importantly, it is shown that Schmidt's 'waves' can be counted among the
solutions of the diffusion equation: superimposing Schmidt 'waves' to a 'tidal
flooding' can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events.

<p class="mathjax">A proof-labeling scheme (PLS) for a boolean predicate $\Pi$ on labeled graphs
is a mechanism used for certifying the legality with respect to $\Pi$ of global
network states in a distributed manner. In a PLS, a certificate is assigned to
each processing node of the network, and the nodes are in charge of checking
that the collection of certificates forms a global proof that the system is in
a correct state, by exchanging the certificates once, between neighbors only.
The main measure of complexity is the size of the certificates. Many PLSs have
been designed for certifying specific predicates, including cycle-freeness,
minimum-weight spanning tree, planarity, etc.
<br />In 2021, a breakthrough has been obtained, as a meta-theorem stating that a
large set of properties have compact PLSs in a large class of networks. Namely,
for every $\mathrm{MSO}_2$ property $\Pi$ on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS
for $\Pi$ with $O(\log n)$-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded
tree-depth. This result has been extended to the larger class of graphs with
bounded {tree-width}, using certificates on $O(\log^2 n)$ bits.
<br />We extend this result even further, to the larger class of graphs with
bounded clique-width, which, as opposed to the other two aforementioned
classes, includes dense graphs. We show that, for every $\mathrm{MSO}_1$
property $\Pi$ on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for $\Pi$ with $O(\log^2
n)$ bit certificates for all graphs of bounded clique-width.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality
industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive
technologies, have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those
systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and
persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality
recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which
can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and
context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into
recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences,
extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized
recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of
persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive
impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such
as social proof, scarcity and personalization, recommender systems can
effectively influence user decision-making and encourage desired actions, such
as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the
efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present a pilot experi-ment
with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. We aim to study the
impact of integrating ChatGPT and persua-sive techniques on user engagement,
satisfaction, and conversion rates. The preliminary results demonstrate the
potential of these technologies in enhancing the overall guest experience and
business performance. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel
hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between LLMs and
persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest
satisfaction and hotel revenue.

<p class="mathjax">We contribute to the knowledge of linear codes from special polynomials and
functions, which have been studied intensively in the past few years. Such
codes have several applications in secret sharing, authentication codes,
association schemes and strongly regular graphs.
<br />This is the first work in which we study the dual codes in the framework of
the two generic constructions; in particular, we propose a Gram-Schmidt
(complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$) process to compute them explicitly. The
originality of this contribution is in the study of the existence or not of
defining sets $D'$, which can be used as ingredients to construct the dual code
$\mathcal{C}'$ for a given code $\mathcal{C}$ in the context of the second
generic construction. We also determine a necessary condition expressed by
employing the Walsh transform for a codeword of $\mathcal{C}$ to belong in the
dual. This achievement was done in general and when the involved functions are
weakly regularly bent. We shall give a novel description of the Hull code in
the framework of the two generic constructions. Our primary interest is
constructing linear codes of fixed Hull dimension and determining the (Hamming)
weight of the codewords in their duals.

<p class="mathjax">Recent tropical cyclones, e.g., Hurricane Harvey (2017), have lead to
significant rainfall and resulting runoff with accompanying flooding. When the
runoff interacts with storm surge, the resulting floods can be greatly
amplified and lead to effects that cannot be modeled by simple superposition of
its distinctive sources. In an effort to develop accurate numerical simulations
of runoff, surge, and compounding floods, we develop a local discontinuous
Galerkin method for modified shallow water equations. In this modification,
nonzero sources to the continuity equation are included to incorporate rainfall
into the model using parametric rainfall models from literature as well as
hindcast data. The discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization is accompanied
with a strong stability preserving explicit Runge Kutta time integrator. Hence,
temporal stability is ensured through the CFL condition and we exploit the
embarrassingly parallel nature of the developed method using MPI
parallelization. We demonstrate the capabilities of the developed method though
a sequence of physically relevant numerical tests, including small scale test
cases based on laboratory measurements and large scale experiments with
Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico. The results highlight the conservation
properties and robustness of the developed method and show the potential of
compound flood modeling using our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The optimal dispatch of energy storage systems (ESSs) presents formidable
challenges due to the uncertainty introduced by fluctuations in dynamic prices,
demand consumption, and renewable-based energy generation. By exploiting the
generalization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) algorithms can learn good-quality control models that adaptively
respond to distribution networks' stochastic nature. However, current DRL
algorithms lack the capabilities to enforce operational constraints strictly,
often even providing unfeasible control actions. To address this issue, we
propose a DRL framework that effectively handles continuous action spaces while
strictly enforcing the environments and action space operational constraints
during online operation. Firstly, the proposed framework trains an action-value
function modeled using DNNs. Subsequently, this action-value function is
formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation enabling the
consideration of the environment's operational constraints. Comprehensive
numerical simulations show the superior performance of the proposed MIP-DRL
framework, effectively enforcing all constraints while delivering high-quality
dispatch decisions when compared with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and the
optimal solution obtained with a perfect forecast of the stochastic variables.

<p class="mathjax">When faced with a large number of product reviews, it is not clear that a
human can remember all of them and weight opinions representatively to write a
good reference summary. We propose an automatic metric to test the prevalence
of the opinions that a summary expresses, based on counting the number of
reviews that are consistent with each statement in the summary, while
discrediting trivial or redundant statements. To formulate this opinion
prevalence metric, we consider several existing methods to score the factual
consistency of a summary statement with respect to each individual source
review. On a corpus of Amazon product reviews, we gather multiple human
judgments of the opinion consistency, to determine which automatic metric best
expresses consistency in product reviews. Using the resulting opinion
prevalence metric, we show that a human authored summary has only slightly
better opinion prevalence than randomly selected extracts from the source
reviews, and previous extractive and abstractive unsupervised opinion
summarization methods perform worse than humans. We demonstrate room for
improvement with a greedy construction of extractive summaries with twice the
opinion prevalence achieved by humans. Finally, we show that preprocessing
source reviews by simplification can raise the opinion prevalence achieved by
existing abstractive opinion summarization systems to the level of human
performance.

Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Maxent Classifier, Sklearn
Classifier, Sklearn Classifier MultinomialNB, and other conjoint learning
algorithms, according to recent research, are very effective. In the project
will use Five Python and R libraries NLTK, TextBlob, Vader, Transformers (GPT
and BERT pretrained), and Tidytext will be used in the study to apply sentiment
analysis techniques. Four machine learning models Tree of Decisions (DT),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
will also be used. To evaluate how well libraries for SA operate in the social
network environment, comparative study was also carried out. The measures to
assess the best algorithms in this experiment, which used a single data set for
each method, were precision, recall, and F1 score. We conclude that the BERT

<p class="mathjax">Experimental data can aid in gaining insights about a system operation, as
well as determining critical aspects of a modelling or simulation process. In
this paper, we analyze the data acquired from an extensive experimentation
process in a serverless Function as a Service system (based on the open source
Apache Openwhisk) that has been deployed across 3 available cloud/edge
locations with different system setups. Thus, they can be used to model
distribution of functions through multi-location aware scheduling mechanisms.
The experiments include different traffic arrival rates, different setups for
the FaaS system, as well as different configurations for the hardware and
platform used. We analyse the acquired data for the three FaaS system setups
and discuss their differences presenting interesting conclusions with relation
to transient effects of the system, such as the effect on wait and execution
time. We also demonstrate interesting trade-offs with relation to system setup
and indicate a number of factors that can affect system performance and should
be taken under consideration in modelling attempts of such systems.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning is of increasing importance in the field of robot
control and simulation plays a~key role in this process. In the unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs, drones), there is also an increase in the number of published
scientific papers involving this approach. In this work, an autonomous drone
control system was prepared to fly forward (according to its coordinates
system) and pass the trees encountered in the forest based on the data from a
rotating LiDAR sensor. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, an
example of reinforcement learning (RL), was used to prepare it. A custom
simulator in the Python language was developed for this purpose. The Gazebo
environment, integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS), was also used to
test the resulting control algorithm. Finally, the prepared solution was
implemented in the Nvidia Jetson Nano eGPU and verified in the real tests
scenarios. During them, the drone successfully completed the set task and was
able to repeatably avoid trees and fly through the forest.

<p class="mathjax">Safety is critical to broadening the application of reinforcement learning
(RL). Often, we train RL agents in a controlled environment, such as a
laboratory, before deploying them in the real world. However, the real-world
target task might be unknown prior to deployment. Reward-free RL trains an
agent without the reward to adapt quickly once the reward is revealed. We
consider the constrained reward-free setting, where an agent (the guide) learns
to explore safely without the reward signal. This agent is trained in a
controlled environment, which allows unsafe interactions and still provides the
safety signal. After the target task is revealed, safety violations are not
allowed anymore. Thus, the guide is leveraged to compose a safe behaviour
policy. Drawing from transfer learning, we also regularize a target policy (the
student) towards the guide while the student is unreliable and gradually
eliminate the influence of the guide as training progresses. The empirical
analysis shows that this method can achieve safe transfer learning and helps
the student solve the target task faster.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a case study on the design, administration,
post-processing, and evaluation of surveys on large language models (LLMs). It
comprises two components: (1) A statistical method for eliciting beliefs
encoded in LLMs. We introduce statistical measures and evaluation metrics that
quantify the probability of an LLM "making a choice", the associated
uncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method to
study what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguous
cases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale survey
comprising 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I tell a white
lie?") and 687 low-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I stop for a
pedestrian on the road?"). Each scenario includes a description, two possible
actions, and auxiliary labels indicating violated rules (e.g., "do not kill").
We administer the survey to 28 open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a)
in unambiguous scenarios, most models "choose" actions that align with
commonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Some
models are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because their
responses are sensitive to the question-wording. (c) Some models reflect clear
preferences in ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, closed-source models tend to
agree with each other.

<p class="mathjax">While imitation learning methods have seen a resurgent interest for robotic
manipulation, the well-known problem of compounding errors continues to afflict
behavioral cloning (BC). Waypoints can help address this problem by reducing
the horizon of the learning problem for BC, and thus, the errors compounded
over time. However, waypoint labeling is underspecified, and requires
additional human supervision. Can we generate waypoints automatically without
any additional human supervision? Our key insight is that if a trajectory
segment can be approximated by linear motion, the endpoints can be used as
waypoints. We propose Automatic Waypoint Extraction (AWE) for imitation
learning, a preprocessing module to decompose a demonstration into a minimal
set of waypoints which when interpolated linearly can approximate the
trajectory up to a specified error threshold. AWE can be combined with any BC
algorithm, and we find that AWE can increase the success rate of
state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 25% in simulation and by 4-28% on
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, reducing the decision making horizon by
up to a factor of 10. Videos and code are available at

<p class="mathjax">Text-conditioned image editing has emerged as a powerful tool for editing
images. However, in many situations, language can be ambiguous and ineffective
in describing specific image edits. When faced with such challenges, visual
prompts can be a more informative and intuitive way to convey ideas. We present
a method for image editing via visual prompting. Given pairs of example that
represent the "before" and "after" images of an edit, our goal is to learn a
text-based editing direction that can be used to perform the same edit on new
images. We leverage the rich, pretrained editing capabilities of text-to-image
diffusion models by inverting visual prompts into editing instructions. Our
results show that with just one example pair, we can achieve competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Neuromorphic visual sensors are artificial retinas that output sequences of
asynchronous events when brightness changes occur in the scene. These sensors
offer many advantages including very high temporal resolution, no motion blur
and smart data compression ideal for real-time processing. In this study, we
introduce an event-based dataset on fine-grained manipulation actions and
perform an experimental study on the use of transformers for action prediction
with events. There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics and
human-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as early
as possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning,
enabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network uses
events to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference.
The model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence over
time and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, the
attention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of the
spatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that the
Transformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-based
approaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actions
lie in very subtle cues. Finally, we release the new event dataset, which is
the first in the literature for manipulation action recognition. Code will be
available at https://github.com/DaniDeniz/EventVisionTransformer.

<p class="mathjax">Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text,
imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI)
systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can
potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to
care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate
MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses
14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and
dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and
summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM
Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI
system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes
and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and
genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance
competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks,
often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of
zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer
learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further
probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist
evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe
encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246
retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for
Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of
cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed
to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a
milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in integrating diverse
expert models to tackle intricate language and vision tasks. Despite their
significance in advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated
Content (AIGC), their potential in intelligent audio content creation remains
unexplored. In this work, we tackle the problem of creating audio content with
storylines encompassing speech, music, and sound effects, guided by text
instructions. We present WavJourney, a system that leverages LLMs to connect
various audio models for audio content generation. Given a text description of
an auditory scene, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate a structured
script dedicated to audio storytelling. The audio script incorporates diverse
audio elements, organized based on their spatio-temporal relationships. As a
conceptual representation of audio, the audio script provides an interactive
and interpretable rationale for human engagement. Afterward, the audio script
is fed into a script compiler, converting it into a computer program. Each line
of the program calls a task-specific audio generation model or computational
operation function (e.g., concatenate, mix). The computer program is then
executed to obtain an explainable solution for audio generation. We demonstrate
the practicality of WavJourney across diverse real-world scenarios, including
science fiction, education, and radio play. The explainable and interactive
design of WavJourney fosters human-machine co-creation in multi-round
dialogues, enhancing creative control and adaptability in audio production.
WavJourney audiolizes the human imagination, opening up new avenues for
creativity in multimedia content creation.

<p class="mathjax">We propose MAMo, a novel memory and attention frame-work for monocular video
depth estimation. MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depth
estimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to take
advantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo,
we augment model with memory which aids the depth prediction as the model
streams through the video. Specifically, the memory stores learned visual and
displacement tokens of the previous time instances. This allows the depth
network to cross-reference relevant features from the past when predicting
depth on the current frame. We introduce a novel scheme to continuously update
the memory, optimizing it to keep tokens that correspond with both the past and
the present visual information. We adopt attention-based approach to process
memory features where we first learn the spatio-temporal relation among the
resultant visual and displacement memory tokens using self-attention module.
Further, the output features of self-attention are aggregated with the current
visual features through cross-attention. The cross-attended features are
finally given to a decoder to predict depth on the current frame. Through
extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-Depth V2, and
DDAD, we show that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth estimation
networks and sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Notably, our MAMo video
depth estimation provides higher accuracy with lower latency, when omparing to
SOTA cost-volume-based video depth models.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) models for tabular data problems are receiving
increasingly more attention, while the algorithms based on gradient-boosted
decision trees (GBDT) remain a strong go-to solution. Following the recent
trends in other domains, such as natural language processing and computer
vision, several retrieval-augmented tabular DL models have been recently
proposed. For a given target object, a retrieval-based model retrieves other
relevant objects, such as the nearest neighbors, from the available (training)
data and uses their features or even labels to make a better prediction.
However, we show that the existing retrieval-based tabular DL solutions provide
only minor, if any, benefits over the properly tuned simple retrieval-free
baselines. Thus, it remains unclear whether the retrieval-based approach is a
worthy direction for tabular DL.
<br />In this work, we give a strong positive answer to this question. We start by
incrementally augmenting a simple feed-forward architecture with an
attention-like retrieval component similar to those of many (tabular)
retrieval-based models. Then, we highlight several details of the attention
mechanism that turn out to have a massive impact on the performance on tabular
data problems, but that were not explored in prior work. As a result, we design
TabR -- a simple retrieval-based tabular DL model which, on a set of public
benchmarks, demonstrates the best average performance among tabular DL models,
becomes the new state-of-the-art on several datasets, and even outperforms GBDT
models on the recently proposed ``GBDT-friendly'' benchmark (see the first
figure).

<p class="mathjax">Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging methods are capable of reconstructing
complex scenes that are not visible to an observer using indirect illumination.
However, they assume only third-bounce illumination, so they are currently
limited to single-corner configurations, and present limited visibility when
imaging surfaces at certain orientations. To reason about and tackle these
limitations, we make the key observation that planar diffuse surfaces behave
specularly at wavelengths used in the computational wave-based NLOS imaging
domain. We call such surfaces virtual mirrors. We leverage this observation to
expand the capabilities of NLOS imaging using illumination beyond the third
bounce, addressing two problems: imaging single-corner objects at limited
visibility angles, and imaging objects hidden behind two corners. To image
objects at limited visibility angles, we first analyze the reflections of the
known illuminated point on surfaces of the scene as an estimator of the
position and orientation of objects with limited visibility. We then image
those limited visibility objects by computationally building secondary
apertures at other surfaces that observe the target object from a direct
visibility perspective. Beyond single-corner NLOS imaging, we exploit the
specular behavior of virtual mirrors to image objects hidden behind a second
corner by imaging the space behind such virtual mirrors, where the mirror image
of objects hidden around two corners is formed. No specular surfaces were
involved in the making of this paper.

(NLTS), providing a fermionic counterpart to the NLTS theorem. Distinctly from
the qubit case, we define trivial states via finite-depth $\textit{fermionic}$
quantum circuits. We furthermore allow free access to Gaussian fermionic
operations, provided they involve at most $O(n)$ ancillary fermions. The
desired fermionic Hamiltonian can be constructed using any qubit Hamiltonian
which itself has the NLTS property via well-spread distributions over

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of inferring sparse time-varying Markov random fields
(MRFs) with different discrete and temporal regularizations on the parameters.
Due to the intractability of discrete regularization, most approaches for
solving this problem rely on the so-called maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)
with relaxed regularization, which neither results in ideal statistical
properties nor scale to the dimensions encountered in realistic settings. In
this paper, we address these challenges by departing from the MLE paradigm and
resorting to a new class of constrained optimization problems with exact,
discrete regularization to promote sparsity in the estimated parameters.
Despite the nonconvex and discrete nature of our formulation, we show that it
can be solved efficiently and parametrically for all sparsity levels. More
specifically, we show that the entire solution path of the time-varying MRF for
all sparsity levels can be obtained in $\mathcal{O}(pT^3)$, where $T$ is the
number of time steps and $p$ is the number of unknown parameters at any given
time. The efficient and parametric characterization of the solution path
renders our approach highly suitable for cross-validation, where parameter
estimation is required for varying regularization values. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, we show that our proposed approach achieves provably
small estimation error for different classes of time-varying MRFs, namely
Gaussian and discrete MRFs, with as few as one sample per time. Utilizing our
algorithm, we can recover the complete solution path for instances of
time-varying MRFs featuring over 30 million variables in less than 12 minutes
on a standard laptop computer. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new approach to non-parametric density estimation, that is based
on regularizing a Sobolev norm of the density. This method is provably
different from Kernel Density Estimation, and makes the bias of the model clear
and interpretable. While there is no closed analytic form for the associated
kernel, we show that one can approximate it using sampling. The optimization
problem needed to determine the density is non-convex, and standard gradient
methods do not perform well. However, we show that with an appropriate
initialization and using natural gradients, one can obtain well performing
solutions. Finally, while the approach provides unnormalized densities, which
prevents the use of log-likelihood for cross validation, we show that one can
instead adapt Fisher Divergence based Score Matching methods for this task. We
evaluate the resulting method on the comprehensive recent Anomaly Detection
benchmark suite, ADBench, and find that it ranks second best, among more than
15 algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">We consider estimation of parameters defined as linear functionals of
solutions to linear inverse problems. Any such parameter admits a doubly robust
representation that depends on the solution to a dual linear inverse problem,
where the dual solution can be thought as a generalization of the inverse
propensity function. We provide the first source condition double robust
inference method that ensures asymptotic normality around the parameter of
interest as long as either the primal or the dual inverse problem is
sufficiently well-posed, without knowledge of which inverse problem is the more
well-posed one. Our result is enabled by novel guarantees for iterated Tikhonov

<p class="mathjax">Preserving training dynamics across batch sizes is an important tool for
practical machine learning as it enables the trade-off between batch size and
wall-clock time. This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for
example, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate
linearly with the batch size. Another important tool for practical machine
learning is the model Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a model copy
that does not receive gradient information, but instead follows its target
model with some momentum. This model EMA can improve the robustness and
generalization properties of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling,
and provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works
have treated the model EMA separately from optimization, leading to different
training dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work,
we provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model EMAs and
demonstrate its validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data
modalities. We also show the rule's validity where the model EMA contributes to
the optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based
pseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes. For SSL, we
enable training of BYOL up to batch size 24,576 without sacrificing
performance, optimally a 6$\times$ wall-clock time reduction.

<p class="mathjax">Causal inference studies whether the presence of a variable influences an
observed outcome. As measured by quantities such as the "average treatment
effect," this paradigm is employed across numerous biological fields, from
vaccine and drug development to policy interventions. Unfortunately, the
majority of these methods are often limited to univariate outcomes. Our work
generalizes causal estimands to outcomes with any number of dimensions or any
measurable space, and formulates traditional causal estimands for nominal
variables as causal discrepancy tests. We propose a simple technique for
adjusting universally consistent conditional independence tests and prove that
these tests are universally consistent causal discrepancy tests. Numerical
experiments illustrate that our method, Causal CDcorr, leads to improvements in
both finite sample validity and power when compared to existing strategies. Our
methods are all open source and available at github.com/ebridge2/cdcorr.

<p class="mathjax">Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) aims to remove interference signals while
leaving near-end speech least distorted. As the indistinguishable patterns
between near-end speech and interference signals, near-end speech can't be
separated completely, causing speech distortion and interference signals
residual. We observe that besides target positive information, e.g.,
ground-truth speech and features, the target negative information, such as
interference signals and features, helps make pattern of target speech and
interference signals more discriminative. Therefore, we present a novel AEC
model encoder-decoder architecture with the guidance of negative information
termed as CMNet. A collaboration module (CM) is designed to establish the
correlation between the target positive and negative information in a learnable
manner via three blocks: target positive, target negative, and interactive

<p class="mathjax">We consider the contextual bandit problem where at each time, the agent only
has access to a noisy version of the context and the error variance (or an
estimator of this variance). This setting is motivated by a wide range of
applications where the true context for decision-making is unobserved, and only
a prediction of the context by a potentially complex machine learning algorithm
is available. When the context error is non-diminishing, classical bandit
algorithms fail to achieve sublinear regret. We propose the first online
algorithm in this setting with sublinear regret compared to the appropriate
benchmark. The key idea is to extend the measurement error model in classical
statistics to the online decision-making setting, which is nontrivial due to
the policy being dependent on the noisy context observations.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decades, hemodynamics simulators have steadily evolved and have
become tools of choice for studying cardiovascular systems in-silico. While
such tools are routinely used to simulate whole-body hemodynamics from
physiological parameters, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping
waveforms back to plausible physiological parameters remains both promising and
challenging. Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast
this inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative
approaches, SBI provides \textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of
interest, providing a \textit{multi-dimensional} representation of uncertainty
for \textit{individual} measurements. We showcase this ability by performing an
in-silico uncertainty analysis of five biomarkers of clinical interest
comparing several measurement modalities. Beyond the corroboration of known
facts, such as the feasibility of estimating heart rate, our study highlights
the potential of estimating new biomarkers from standard-of-care measurements.
SBI reveals practically relevant findings that cannot be captured by standard
sensitivity analyses, such as the existence of sub-populations for which
parameter estimation exhibits distinct uncertainty regimes. Finally, we study
the gap between in-vivo and in-silico with the MIMIC-III waveform database and
critically discuss how cardiovascular simulations can inform real-world data
analysis.

systems of difference equations, is constructed and used to examine the
geometric and algebraic properties of various systems. Exactness of the
bicomplex gives a coordinate-free setting for finite difference variational

<p class="mathjax">A sound field synthesis method enhancing perceptual quality is proposed.
Sound field synthesis using multiple loudspeakers enables spatial audio
reproduction with a broad listening area; however, synthesis errors at high
frequencies called spatial aliasing artifacts are unavoidable. To minimize
these artifacts, we propose a method based on the combination of pressure and
amplitude matching. On the basis of the human's auditory properties,
synthesizing the amplitude distribution will be sufficient for horizontal sound
localization. Furthermore, a flat amplitude response should be synthesized as
much as possible to avoid coloration. Therefore, we apply amplitude matching,
which is a method to synthesize the desired amplitude distribution with
arbitrary phase distribution, for high frequencies and conventional pressure
matching for low frequencies. Experimental results of numerical simulations and
listening tests using a practical system indicated that the perceptual quality
of the sound field synthesized by the proposed method was improved from that
synthesized by pressure matching.

<p class="mathjax">Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs
from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set
$V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the
incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known
to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this
paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial
vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar
result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these
graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and
cographs, which are C-I graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Obtaining manual annotations to train deep learning (DL) models for
auto-segmentation is often time-consuming. Uncertainty-based Bayesian active
learning (BAL) is a widely-adopted method to reduce annotation efforts. Based
on BAL, this study introduces a hybrid representation-enhanced sampling
strategy that integrates density and diversity criteria to save manual
annotation costs by efficiently selecting the most informative samples.
<br />Methods: The experiments are performed on two lower extremity (LE) datasets
of MRI and CT images by a BAL framework based on Bayesian U-net. Our method
selects uncertain samples with high density and diversity for manual revision,
optimizing for maximal similarity to unlabeled instances and minimal similarity
to existing training data. We assess the accuracy and efficiency using Dice and
a proposed metric called reduced annotation cost (RAC), respectively. We
further evaluate the impact of various acquisition rules on BAL performance and
design an ablation study for effectiveness estimation.
<br />Results: The proposed method showed superiority or non-inferiority to other
methods on both datasets across two acquisition rules, and quantitative results
reveal the pros and cons of the acquisition rules. Our ablation study in
volume-wise acquisition shows that the combination of density and diversity
criteria outperforms solely using either of them in musculoskeletal
segmentation.
<br />Conclusion: Our sampling method is proven efficient in reducing annotation
costs in image segmentation tasks. The combination of the proposed method and
our BAL framework provides a semi-automatic way for efficient annotation of
medical image datasets.

studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons ($H$),
boats ($B$) and stars ($S$) were soon exhibited and many physicists published
on what they later called $HBS$ tilings, but no article or book combines all we
know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and
properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in
three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet
this set yields exactly the strict $HBS$ tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated
with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance.
Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models can be parameterised in terms of either a score or an energy
function. The energy parameterisation has better theoretical properties, mainly
that it enables an extended sampling procedure with a Metropolis--Hastings
correction step, based on the change in total energy in the proposed samples.
However, it seems to yield slightly worse performance, and more importantly,
due to the widespread popularity of score-based diffusion, there are limited
availability of off-the-shelf pre-trained energy-based ones. This limitation
undermines the purpose of model composition, which aims to combine pre-trained
models to sample from new distributions. Our proposal, however, suggests
retaining the score parameterization and instead computing the energy-based
acceptance probability through line integration of the score function. This
allows us to re-use existing diffusion models and still combine the reverse
process with various Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We evaluate our
method on a 2D experiment and find that it achieve similar or arguably better
performance than the energy parameterisation.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce higher-dimensional cubical sliding puzzles that are inspired by
the classical 15 Puzzle from the 1880s. In our puzzles, on a $d$-dimensional
cube, a labeled token can be slid from one vertex to another if it is
topologically free to move on lower-dimensional faces. We analyze the
solvability of these puzzles by studying how the puzzle graph changes with the
number of labeled tokens vs empty vertices. We give characterizations of the
different regimes ranging from being completely stuck (and thus all puzzles
unsolvable) to having only one giant component where almost all puzzles can be
solved. For the Cube, the Tesseract, and the Penteract ($5$-dimensional cube)
we have implemented an algorithm to completely analyze their solvability and we
provide specific puzzles for which we know the minimum number of moves needed
to solve them.

<p class="mathjax">Conflict analysis has been successfully generalized from Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) solving to mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers, but
although MIP solvers operate with general linear inequalities, the conflict
analysis in MIP has been limited to reasoning with the more restricted class of
clausal constraint. This is in contrast to how conflict analysis is performed
in so-called pseudo-Boolean solving, where solvers can reason directly with 0-1
integer linear inequalities rather than with clausal constraints extracted from
such inequalities. In this work, we investigate how pseudo-Boolean conflict
analysis can be integrated in MIP solving, focusing on 0-1 integer linear
programs (0-1 ILPs). Phrased in MIP terminology, conflict analysis can be
understood as a sequence of linear combinations and cuts. We leverage this
perspective to design a new conflict analysis algorithm based on mixed integer
rounding (MIR) cuts, which theoretically dominates the state-of-the-art
division-based method in pseudo-Boolean solving. We also report results from a
first proof-of-concept implementation of different pseudo-Boolean conflict
analysis methods in the open-source MIP solver SCIP. When evaluated on a large
and diverse set of 0-1 ILP instances from MIPLIB 2017, our new MIR-based
conflict analysis outperforms both previous pseudo-Boolean methods and the
clause-based method used in MIP. Our conclusion is that pseudo-Boolean conflict
analysis in MIP is a promising research direction that merits further study,
and that it might also make sense to investigate the use of such conflict
analysis to generate stronger no-goods in constraint programming.

<p class="mathjax">It is known that the generating function associated with the enumeration of
non-backtracking walks on finite graphs is a rational matrix-valued function of
the parameter; such function is also closely related to graph-theoretical
results such as Ihara's theorem and the zeta function on graphs. In [P.
Grindrod, D. J. Higham, V. Noferini, The deformed graph Laplacian and its
application to network centrality analysis, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 39(1),
310--341, 2018], the radius of convergence of the generating function was
studied for simple (i.e., undirected, unweighted and with no loops) graphs, and
shown to depend on the number of cycles in the graph. In this paper, we use
technologies from the theory of polynomial and rational matrices to greatly
extend these results by studying the radius of convergence of the corresponding
generating function for general, possibly directed and/or weighted, graphs. We
give an analogous characterization of the radius of convergence for directed
unweighted graphs, showing that it depends on the number of cycles in the
undirectization of the graph. For weighted graphs, we provide for the first
time an exact formula for the radius of convergence, improving a previous
result that exhibited a lower bound. Finally, we consider also
backtracking-downweighted walks on unweighted digraphs, and we prove a version
of Ihara's theorem in that case.

<p class="mathjax">The existence of universal quantum computers has been theoretically well
established. However, building up a real quantum computer system not only
relies on the theory of universality, but also needs methods to satisfy
requirements on other features, such as programmability, modularity,
scalability, etc. To this end, we study the recently proposed model of quantum
von Neumann architecture, by putting it in a practical and broader setting,
namely, the hierarchical design of a computer system. We analyze the structures
of quantum CPU and quantum control unit, and draw their connections with
computational advantages. We also point out that a recent demonstration of our
model would require less than 20 qubits.

<p class="mathjax">Histological whole slide images (WSIs) can be usually compromised by
artifacts, such as tissue folding and bubbles, which will increase the
examination difficulty for both pathologists and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)
systems. Existing approaches to restoring artifact images are confined to
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where the restoration process is
formulated as an image-to-image transfer. Those methods are prone to suffer
from mode collapse and unexpected mistransfer in the stain style, leading to
unsatisfied and unrealistic restored images. Innovatively, we make the first
attempt at a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for histological artifact
restoration, namely ArtiFusion.Specifically, ArtiFusion formulates the artifact
region restoration as a gradual denoising process, and its training relies
solely on artifact-free images to simplify the training complexity.Furthermore,
to capture local-global correlations in the regional artifact restoration, a
novel Swin-Transformer denoising architecture is designed, along with a time
token scheme. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtiFusion as a pre-processing method for histology analysis, which can
successfully preserve the tissue structures and stain style in artifact-free
regions during the restoration. Code is available at
https://github.com/zhenqi-he/ArtiFusion.

<p class="mathjax">As the world progresses in technology and health, awareness of disease by
revealing asymptomatic signs improves. It is important to detect and treat
tumors in early stage as it can be life-threatening. Computer-aided
technologies are used to overcome lingering limitations facing disease
diagnosis, while brain tumor segmentation remains a difficult process,
especially when multi-modality data is involved. This is mainly attributed to
ineffective training due to lack of data and corresponding labelling. This work
investigates the feasibility of employing deep-fake image generation for
effective brain tumor segmentation. To this end, a Generative Adversarial
Network was used for image-to-image translation for increasing dataset size,
followed by image segmentation using a U-Net-based convolutional neural network
trained with deepfake images. Performance of the proposed approach is compared
with ground truth of four publicly available datasets. Results show improved
performance in terms of image segmentation quality metrics, and could
potentially assist when training with limited data.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a synthesis method for robust, regret optimal control.
The plant is modeled in discrete-time by an uncertain linear time-invariant
(LTI) system. An optimal non-causal controller is constructed using the nominal
plant model and given full knowledge of the disturbance. Robust regret is
defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is
shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a
robust H-infinity performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize
a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of
robust regret. The approach is demonstrated via two examples.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing has the potential to surpass the capabilities of current
classical computers when solving complex problems. Combinatorial optimization
has emerged as one of the key target areas for quantum computers as problems
found in this field play a critical role in many different industrial
application sectors (e.g., enhancing manufacturing operations or improving
decision processes). Currently, there are different types of high-performance
optimization software (e.g., ILOG CPLEX and Gurobi) that support engineers and
scientists in solving optimization problems using classical computers. In order
to utilize quantum resources, users require domain-specific knowledge of
quantum algorithms, SDKs and libraries, which can be a limiting factor for any
practitioner who wants to integrate this technology into their workflows. Our
goal is to add software infrastructure to a classical optimization package so
that application developers can interface with quantum platforms readily when
setting up their workflows. This paper presents a tool for the seamless
utilization of quantum resources through a classical interface. Our approach
consists of a Python library extension that provides a backend to facilitate
access to multiple quantum providers. Our pipeline enables optimization
software developers to experiment with quantum resources selectively and assess
performance improvements of hybrid quantum-classical optimization solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Financial contagion has been widely recognized as a fundamental risk to the
financial system. Particularly potent is price-mediated contagion, wherein
forced liquidations by firms depress asset prices and propagate financial
stress, enabling crises to proliferate across a broad spectrum of seemingly
unrelated entities. Price impacts are currently modeled via exogenous inverse
demand functions. However, in real-world scenarios, only the initial shocks and
the final equilibrium asset prices are typically observable, leaving actual
asset liquidations largely obscured. This missing data presents significant
limitations to calibrating the existing models. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel dual neural network structure that operates in two sequential
stages: the first neural network maps initial shocks to predicted asset
liquidations, and the second network utilizes these liquidations to derive
resultant equilibrium prices. This data-driven approach can capture both linear
and non-linear forms without pre-specifying an analytical structure;
furthermore, it functions effectively even in the absence of observable
liquidation data. Experiments with simulated datasets demonstrate that our
model can accurately predict equilibrium asset prices based solely on initial
shocks, while revealing a strong alignment between predicted and true
liquidations. Our explainable framework contributes to the understanding and
modeling of price-mediated contagion and provides valuable insights for
financial authorities to construct effective stress tests and regulatory
policies.
