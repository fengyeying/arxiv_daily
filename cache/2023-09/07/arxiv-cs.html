<p class="mathjax">In this work is considered a diusion problem, referred to as the Ventcel
problem, involving a second order term on the domain boundary (the
Laplace-Beltrami operator). A variational formulation of the Ventcel problem is
studied, leading to a nite element discretization. The focus is on the
construction of high order curved meshes for the discretization of the physical
domain and on the denition of the lift operator, which is aimed to transform a
function dened on the mesh domain into a function dened on the physical one.
This lift is dened in a way as to satisfy adapted properties on the boundary,
relatively to the trace operator. Error estimations are computed and expressed
both in terms of nite element approximation error and of geometrical error,
respectively associated to the nite element degree k $\ge$ 1 and to the mesh
order r $\ge$ 1. The numerical experiments we led allow us to validate the
results obtained and proved on the a priori error estimates depending on the
two parameters k and r.

<p class="mathjax">A phase field model for fluid-driven dynamic crack propagation in poroelastic
media is proposed. Therefore, classical Biot poroelasticity theory is applied
in the porous medium while arbitrary crack growth is naturally captured by the
phase field model. We also account for the transition of the fluid property
from the intact medium to the fully broken one by employing indicator
functions. We employ a staggered scheme and implement our approach into the
software package COMSOL Multiphysics. Our approach is first verified through
three classical benchmark problems which are compared to analytical solutions
for dynamic consolidation and pressure distribution in a single crack and in a
specimen with two sets of joints. Subsequently, we present several 2D and 3D
examples of dynamic crack branching and their interaction with pre-existing
natural fractures. All presented examples demonstrate the capability of the
proposed approach of handling dynamic crack propagation, branching and
coalescence of fluid-driven fracture.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, non-linear Equal Width-Wave (EW) equation will be
numerically solved . For this aim, the non-linear term in the equation is
firstly linearized by Rubin-Graves type approach. After that, to reduce the
equation into a solvable discretized linear algebraic equation system which is
the essential part of this study, the Crank-Nicolson type approximation and
cubic Hermite collocation method are respectively applied to obtain the
integration in the temporal and spatial domain directions. To be able to
illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed method, six test model
problems that is single solitary wave, the interaction of two solitary waves,
the interaction of three solitary waves, the Maxwellian initial condition,
undular bore and finally soliton collision will be taken into consideration and
solved. Since only the single solitary wave has an analytical solution among
these solitary waves, the error norms Linf and L2 are computed and compared to
a few of the previous works available in the literature. Furthermore, the
widely used three invariants I1, I2 and I3 of the proposed problems during the
simulations are computed and presented. Beside those, the relative changes in
those invariants are presented. Also, a comparison of the error norms Linf and
L2 and these invariants obviously shows that the proposed scheme produces
better and compatible results than most of the previous works using the same
parameters. Finally, von Neumann analysis has shown that the present scheme is
unconditionally stable.

<p class="mathjax">We examine the problem of Bragg-edge elastic strain tomography from energy
resolved neutron transmission imaging. A new approach is developed for
two-dimensional plane-stress and plane-strain systems whereby elastic strain
can be reconstructed from its Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT) as two parts of
a Helmholtz decomposition based on the concept of an Airy stress potential. The
solenoidal component of this decomposition is reconstructed using an inversion
formula based on a tensor filtered back projection algorithm whereas the
potential part can be recovered using either Hooke's law or a finite element
model of the elastic system. The technique is demonstrated for two-dimensional
plane-stress systems in both simulation, and on real experimental data. We also
demonstrate that application of the standard scalar filtered back projection
algorithm to the LRT in these systems recovers the trace of the solenoidal
component of strain and we provide physical meaning for this quantity in the
case of 2D plane-stress and plane-strain systems.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce new generalized barycentric coordinates (coined
as {\em moment coordinates}) on nonconvex quadrilaterals and convex hexahedra
with planar faces. This work draws on recent advances in constructing
interpolants to describe the motion of the Filippov sliding vector field in
nonsmooth dynamical systems, in which nonnegative solutions of signed matrices
based on (partial) distances are studied. For a finite element with $n$
vertices (nodes) in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the constant and linear reproducing
conditions are supplemented with additional linear moment equations to set up a
linear system of equations of full rank $n$, whose solution results in the
nonnegative shape functions. On a simple (convex or nonconvex) quadrilateral,
moment coordinates using signed distances are identical to mean value
coordinates. For signed weights that are based on the product of distances to
edges that are incident to a vertex and their edge lengths, we recover
Wachspress coordinates on a convex quadrilateral. Moment coordinates are also
constructed on a convex hexahedra with planar faces. We present proofs in
support of the construction and plots of the shape functions that affirm its
properties.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of sparse matrix computation highly depends on the matching
of the matrix format with the underlying structure of the data being computed
on. Different sparse matrix formats are suitable for different structures of
data. Therefore, the first challenge is identifying the matrix structure before
the computation to match it with an appropriate data format. The second
challenge is to avoid reading the entire dataset before classifying it. This
can be done by identifying the matrix structure through samples and their
features. Yet, it is possible that global features cannot be determined from a
sampling set and must instead be inferred from local features. To address these
challenges, we develop a framework that generates sparse matrix structure
classifiers using graph convolutional networks. The framework can also be
extended to other matrix structures using user-provided generators. The
approach achieves 97% classification accuracy on a set of representative sparse
matrix shapes.

<p class="mathjax">Wave propagation problems are typically formulated as partial differential
equations (PDEs) on unbounded domains to be solved. The classical approach to
solving such problems involves truncating them to problems on bounded domains
by designing the artificial boundary conditions or perfectly matched layers,
which typically require significant effort, and the presence of nonlinearity in
the equation makes such designs even more challenging. Emerging deep
learning-based methods for solving PDEs, with the physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) method as a representative, still face significant challenges
when directly used to solve PDEs on unbounded domains. Calculations performed
in a bounded domain of interest without imposing boundary constraints can lead
to a lack of unique solutions thus causing the failure of PINNs. In light of
this, this paper proposes a novel and effective operator learning-based method
for solving PDEs on unbounded domains. The key idea behind this method is to
generate high-quality training data. Specifically, we construct a family of
approximate analytical solutions to the target PDE based on its initial
condition and source term. Then, using these constructed data comprising exact
solutions, initial conditions, and source terms, we train an operator learning
model called MIONet, which is capable of handling multiple inputs, to learn the
mapping from the initial condition and source term to the PDE solution on a
bounded domain of interest. Finally, we utilize the generalization ability of
this model to predict the solution of the target PDE. The effectiveness of this
method is exemplified by solving the wave equation and the Schrodinger equation
defined on unbounded domains. More importantly, the proposed method can deal
with nonlinear problems, which has been demonstrated by solving Burger's
equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.

<p class="mathjax">Truss structures at macro-scale are common in a number of engineering
applications and are now being increasingly used at the micro-scale to
construct metamaterials. In analyzing the properties of a given truss
structure, it is often necessary to understand how stress waves propagate
through the system and/or its dynamic modes under time dependent loading so as
to allow for maximally efficient use of space and material. This can be a
computationally challenging task for particularly large or complex structures,
with current methods requiring fine spatial discretization or evaluations of
sizable matrices. Here we present a spectral method to compute the dynamics of
trusses inspired by results from fluid flow networks. Our model accounts for
the full dynamics of linearly elastic truss elements via a network Laplacian; a
matrix object which couples the motions of the structure joints. We show that
this method is equivalent to the continuum limit of linear finite element
methods as well as capable of reproducing natural frequencies and modes
determined by more complex and computationally costlier methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a study on the prediction of outcomes in matches of the
electronic game League of Legends (LoL) using machine learning techniques. With
the aim of exploring the ability to predict real-time results, considering
different variables and stages of the match, we highlight the use of
unpublished data as a fundamental part of this process. With the increasing
popularity of LoL and the emergence of tournaments, betting related to the game
has also emerged, making the investigation in this area even more relevant. A
variety of models were evaluated and the results were encouraging. A model
based on LightGBM showed the best performance, achieving an average accuracy of
81.62\% in intermediate stages of the match when the percentage of elapsed time
was between 60\% and 80\%. On the other hand, the Logistic Regression and
Gradient Boosting models proved to be more effective in early stages of the
game, with promising results. This study contributes to the field of machine
learning applied to electronic games, providing valuable insights into
real-time prediction in League of Legends. The results obtained may be relevant
for both players seeking to improve their strategies and the betting industry
related to the game.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an in-depth analysis of various self-supervision methods
for isolated sign language recognition (ISLR). We consider four recently
introduced transformer-based approaches to self-supervised learning from
videos, and four pre-training data regimes, and study all the combinations on
the WLASL2000 dataset. Our findings reveal that MaskFeat achieves performance
superior to pose-based and supervised video models, with a top-1 accuracy of
79.02% on gloss-based WLASL2000. Furthermore, we analyze these models' ability
to produce representations of ASL signs using linear probing on diverse
phonological features. This study underscores the value of architecture and
pre-training task choices in ISLR. Specifically, our results on WLASL2000
highlight the power of masked reconstruction pre-training, and our linear
probing results demonstrate the importance of hierarchical vision transformers
for sign language representation.

<p class="mathjax">Satellite imagery generation and super-resolution are pivotal tasks in remote
sensing, demanding high-quality, detailed images for accurate analysis and
decision-making. In this paper, we propose an innovative and lightweight
approach that employs two-stage diffusion models to gradually generate
high-resolution Satellite images purely based on text prompts. Our innovative
pipeline comprises two interconnected diffusion models: a Low-Resolution
Generation Diffusion Model (LR-GDM) that generates low-resolution images from
text and a Super-Resolution Diffusion Model (SRDM) conditionally produced. The
LR-GDM effectively synthesizes low-resolution by (computing the correlations of
the text embedding and the image embedding in a shared latent space), capturing
the essential content and layout of the desired scenes. Subsequently, the SRDM
takes the generated low-resolution image and its corresponding text prompts and
efficiently produces the high-resolution counterparts, infusing fine-grained
spatial details and enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments are conducted on the
commonly used dataset, Remote Sensing Image Captioning Dataset (RSICD). Our
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
(SoTA) models in generating satellite images with realistic geographical
features, weather conditions, and land structures while achieving remarkable
super-resolution results for increased spatial precision.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an improved Intelligent driving model (Sigmoid-IDM) to
address the problems of excessive acceleration in traffic oscillation and
following failure in free flow. The Sigmoid-IDM uses a Sigmoid function to
enhance the start-following characteristics, improve the output strategy of the
spacing term, and stabilize the steady-state velocity in free flow. Moreover,
the model asymmetry is improved by means of introducing cautious following
distance, driving caution factor, and segmentation function. The
anti-interference ability of the Sigmoid-IDM is demonstrated by local stability
and string stability analyses.

<p class="mathjax">Mapping two modalities, speech and text, into a shared representation space,
is a research topic of using text-only data to improve end-to-end automatic
speech recognition (ASR) performance in new domains. However, the length of
speech representation and text representation is inconsistent. Although the
previous method up-samples the text representation to align with acoustic
modality, it may not match the expected actual duration. In this paper, we
proposed novel representations match strategy through down-sampling acoustic
representation to align with text modality. By introducing a continuous
integrate-and-fire (CIF) module generating acoustic representations consistent
with token length, our ASR model can learn unified representations from both
modalities better, allowing for domain adaptation using text-only data of the
target domain. Experiment results of new domain data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">We study illicit account detection on transaction networks of
cryptocurrencies that are increasi_testngly important in online financial
markets. The surge of illicit activities on cryptocurrencies has resulted in
billions of losses from normal users. Existing solutions either rely on tedious
feature engineering to get handcrafted features, or are inadequate to fully
utilize the rich semantics of cryptocurrency transaction data, and
consequently, yield sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we formulate the
illicit account detection problem as a classification task over directed
multigraphs with edge attributes, and present DIAM, a novel multi-graph neural
network model to effectively detect illicit accounts on large transaction
networks. First, DIAM includes an Edge2Seq module that automatically learns
effective node representations preserving intrinsic transaction patterns of
parallel edges, by considering both edge attributes and directed edge sequence
dependencies. Then utilizing the multigraph topology, DIAM employs a new
Multigraph Discrepancy (MGD) module with a well-designed message passing
mechanism to capture the discrepant features between normal and illicit nodes,
supported by an attention mechanism. Assembling all techniques, DIAM is trained
in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments, comparing against 14 existing
solutions on 4 large cryptocurrency datasets of Bitcoin and Ethereum,
demonstrate that DIAM consistently achieves the best performance to accurately
detect illicit accounts, while being efficient. For instance, on a Bitcoin
dataset with 20 million nodes and 203 million edges, DIAM achieves F1 score
96.55%, significantly higher than the F1 score 83.92% of the best competitor.

<p class="mathjax">Matrix/array analysis of networks can provide significant insight into their
behavior and aid in their operation and protection. Prior work has demonstrated
the analytic, performance, and compression capabilities of GraphBLAS
(graphblas.org) hypersparse matrices and D4M (d4m.mit.edu) associative arrays
(a mathematical superset of matrices). Obtaining the benefits of these
capabilities requires integrating them into operational systems, which comes
with its own unique challenges. This paper describes two examples of real-time
operational implementations. First, is an operational GraphBLAS implementation
that constructs anonymized hypersparse matrices on a high-bandwidth network
tap. Second, is an operational D4M implementation that analyzes daily cloud
gateway logs. The architectures of these implementations are presented.
Detailed measurements of the resources and the performance are collected and
analyzed. The implementations are capable of meeting their operational
requirements using modest computational resources (a couple of processing
cores). GraphBLAS is well-suited for low-level analysis of high-bandwidth
connections with relatively structured network data. D4M is well-suited for
higher-level analysis of more unstructured data. This work demonstrates that
these technologies can be implemented in operational settings.

<p class="mathjax">3D printing or additive manufacturing is a revolutionary technology that
enables the creation of physical objects from digital models. However, the
quality and accuracy of 3D printing depend on the correctness and efficiency of
the G-code, a low-level numerical control programming language that instructs
3D printers how to move and extrude material. Debugging G-code is a challenging
task that requires a syntactic and semantic understanding of the G-code format
and the geometry of the part to be printed. In this paper, we present the first
extensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art foundational large language models
(LLMs) for comprehending and debugging G-code files for 3D printing. We design
effective prompts to enable pre-trained LLMs to understand and manipulate
G-code and test their performance on various aspects of G-code debugging and
manipulation, including detection and correction of common errors and the
ability to perform geometric transformations. We analyze their strengths and
weaknesses for understanding complete G-code files. We also discuss the
implications and limitations of using LLMs for G-code comprehension.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Racial and ethnic minority groups and individuals facing social
disadvantages, which often stem from their social determinants of health
(SDoH), bear a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its
complications. It is therefore crucial to implement effective social risk
management strategies at the point of care. Objective: To develop an EHR-based
machine learning (ML) analytical pipeline to identify the unmet social needs
associated with hospitalization risk in patients with T2D. Methods: We
identified 10,192 T2D patients from the EHR data (from 2012 to 2022) from the
University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository, including contextual
SDoH (e.g., neighborhood deprivation) and individual-level SDoH (e.g., housing
stability). We developed an electronic health records (EHR)-based machine
learning (ML) analytic pipeline, namely individualized polysocial risk score
(iPsRS), to identify high social risk associated with hospitalizations in T2D
patients, along with explainable AI (XAI) techniques and fairness assessment
and optimization. Results: Our iPsRS achieved a C statistic of 0.72 in
predicting 1-year hospitalization after fairness optimization across
racial-ethnic groups. The iPsRS showed excellent utility for capturing
individuals at high hospitalization risk; the actual 1-year hospitalization
rate in the top 5% of iPsRS was ~13 times as high as the bottom decile.
Conclusion: Our ML pipeline iPsRS can fairly and accurately screen for patients
who have increased social risk leading to hospitalization in T2D patients.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the development of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)
systems has been nothing short of remarkable. As these systems continue to
evolve, they are being utilized in increasingly complex and unstructured
environments, such as autonomous driving, aerial robotics, and natural language
processing. As a consequence, programming their behaviors manually or defining
their behavior through reward functions (as done in reinforcement learning
(RL)) has become exceedingly difficult. This is because such environments
require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, making it challenging to
specify an optimal set of rules or reward signals that can account for all
possible situations. In such environments, learning from an expert's behavior
through imitation is often more appealing. This is where imitation learning
(IL) comes into play - a process where desired behavior is learned by imitating
an expert's behavior, which is provided through demonstrations.
<br />This paper aims to provide an introduction to IL and an overview of its
underlying assumptions and approaches. It also offers a detailed description of
recent advances and emerging areas of research in the field. Additionally, the
paper discusses how researchers have addressed common challenges associated
with IL and provides potential directions for future research. Overall, the
goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive guide to the growing field of
IL in robotics and AI.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic communication is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the
landscape of future AI-driven communication systems. Its challenge of
extracting semantic information from the original complex content and
regenerating semantically consistent data at the receiver, possibly being
robust to channel corruptions, can be addressed with deep generative models.
This ICASSP special session overview paper discloses the semantic communication
challenges from the machine learning perspective and unveils how deep
generative models will significantly enhance semantic communication frameworks
in dealing with real-world complex data, extracting and exploiting semantic
information, and being robust to channel corruptions. Alongside establishing
this emerging field, this paper charts novel research pathways for the next
generative semantic communication frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning's proliferation in critical fields such as healthcare,
banking, and criminal justice has motivated the creation of tools which ensure
trust and transparency in ML models. One such tool is Actionable Recourse (AR)
for negatively impacted users. AR describes recommendations of cost-efficient
changes to a user's actionable features to help them obtain favorable outcomes.
Existing approaches for providing recourse optimize for properties such as
proximity, sparsity, validity, and distance-based costs. However, an
often-overlooked but crucial requirement for actionability is a consideration
of User Preference to guide the recourse generation process. In this work, we
attempt to capture user preferences via soft constraints in three simple forms:
i) scoring continuous features, ii) bounding feature values and iii) ranking
categorical features. Finally, we propose a gradient-based approach to identify
User Preferred Actionable Recourse (UP-AR). We carried out extensive
experiments to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Learning(DL) and Machine Learning(ML) applications are rapidly
increasing in recent days. Massive amounts of data are being generated over the
internet which can derive meaningful results by the use of ML and DL
algorithms. Hardware resources and open-source libraries have made it easy to
implement these algorithms. Tensorflow and Pytorch are one of the leading
frameworks for implementing ML projects. By using those frameworks, we can
trace the operations executed on both GPU and CPU to analyze the resource
allocations and consumption. This paper presents the time and memory allocation
of CPU and GPU while training deep neural networks using Pytorch. This paper
analysis shows that GPU has a lower running time as compared to CPU for deep
neural networks. For a simpler network, there are not many significant
improvements in GPU over the CPU.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of learning observation models for robot state
estimation with incremental non-differentiable optimizers in the loop.
Convergence to the correct belief over the robot state is heavily dependent on
a proper tuning of observation models which serve as input to the optimizer. We
propose a gradient-based learning method which converges much quicker to model
estimates that lead to solutions of much better quality compared to an existing
state-of-the-art method as measured by the tracking accuracy over unseen robot

<p class="mathjax">The skeleton of a digital image is a compact representation of its topology,
geometry, and scale. It has utility in many computer vision applications, such
as image description, segmentation, and registration. However, skeletonization
has only seen limited use in contemporary deep learning solutions. Most
existing skeletonization algorithms are not differentiable, making it
impossible to integrate them with gradient-based optimization. Compatible
algorithms based on morphological operations and neural networks have been
proposed, but their results often deviate from the geometry and topology of the
true medial axis. This work introduces the first three-dimensional
skeletonization algorithm that is both compatible with gradient-based
optimization and preserves an object's topology. Our method is exclusively
based on matrix additions and multiplications, convolutional operations, basic
non-linear functions, and sampling from a uniform probability distribution,
allowing it to be easily implemented in any major deep learning library. In
benchmarking experiments, we prove the advantages of our skeletonization
algorithm compared to non-differentiable, morphological, and
neural-network-based baselines. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our
algorithm by integrating it with two medical image processing applications that
use gradient-based optimization: deep-learning-based blood vessel segmentation,
and multimodal registration of the mandible in computed tomography and magnetic
resonance images.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work has connected adversarial attack methods and algorithmic recourse
methods: both seek minimal changes to an input instance which alter a model's
classification decision. It has been shown that traditional adversarial
training, which seeks to minimize a classifier's susceptibility to malicious
perturbations, increases the cost of generated recourse; with larger
adversarial training radii correlating with higher recourse costs. From the
perspective of algorithmic recourse, however, the appropriate adversarial
training radius has always been unknown. Another recent line of work has
motivated adversarial training with adaptive training radii to address the
issue of instance-wise variable adversarial vulnerability, showing success in
domains with unknown attack radii. This work studies the effects of adaptive
adversarial training on algorithmic recourse costs. We establish that the
improvements in model robustness induced by adaptive adversarial training show
little effect on algorithmic recourse costs, providing a potential avenue for
affordable robustness in domains where recoursability is critical.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models learn to reverse the progressive noising of a data
distribution to create a generative model. However, the desired continuous
nature of the noising process can be at odds with discrete data. To deal with
this tension between continuous and discrete objects, we propose a method of
performing diffusion on the probability simplex. Using the probability simplex
naturally creates an interpretation where points correspond to categorical
probability distributions. Our method uses the softmax function applied to an
Ornstein-Unlenbeck Process, a well-known stochastic differential equation. We
find that our methodology also naturally extends to include diffusion on the
unit cube which has applications for bounded image generation.

<p class="mathjax">In the last decade, the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) has become a central
aspect of the research community as a novel litmus test. Consequently, the WSC
has spurred research interest because it can be seen as the means to understand
human behavior. In this regard, the development of new techniques has made
possible the usage of Winograd schemas in various fields, such as the design of
novel forms of CAPTCHAs.
<br />Work from the literature that established a baseline for human adult
performance on the WSC has shown that not all schemas are the same, meaning
that they could potentially be categorized according to their perceived
hardness for humans. In this regard, this \textit{hardness-metric} could be
used in future challenges or in the WSC CAPTCHA service to differentiate
between Winograd schemas.
<br />Recent work of ours has shown that this could be achieved via the design of
an automated system that is able to output the hardness-indexes of Winograd
schemas, albeit with limitations regarding the number of schemas it could be
applied on. This paper adds to previous research by presenting a new system
that is based on Machine Learning (ML), able to output the hardness of any
Winograd schema faster and more accurately than any other previously used
method. Our developed system, which works within two different approaches,
namely the random forest and deep learning (LSTM-based), is ready to be used as
an extension of any other system that aims to differentiate between Winograd
schemas, according to their perceived hardness for humans. At the same time,
along with our developed system we extend previous work by presenting the
results of a large-scale experiment that shows how human performance varies
across Winograd schemas.

<p class="mathjax">Integrated photonics based on silicon photonics platform is driving several
application domains, from enabling ultra-fast chip-scale communication in
high-performance computing systems to energy-efficient optical computation in
artificial intelligence (AI) hardware accelerators. Integrating silicon
photonics into a system necessitates the adoption of interfaces between the
photonic and the electronic subsystems, which are required for buffering data
and optical-to-electrical and electrical-to-optical conversions. Consequently,
this can lead to new and inevitable security breaches that cannot be fully
addressed using hardware security solutions proposed for purely electronic
systems. This paper explores different types of attacks profiting from such
breaches in integrated photonic neural network accelerators. We show the impact
of these attacks on the system performance (i.e., power and phase
distributions, which impact accuracy) and possible solutions to counter such
attacks.

<p class="mathjax">In the past decade, many vulnerabilities were discovered in
microarchitectures which yielded attack vectors and motivated the study of
countermeasures. Further, architectural and physical imperfections in DRAMs led
to the discovery of Rowhammer attacks which give an adversary power to
introduce bit flips in a victim's memory space. Numerous studies analyzed
Rowhammer and proposed techniques to prevent it altogether or to mitigate its
effects.
<br />In this work, we push the boundary and show how Rowhammer can be further
exploited to inject faults into stack variables and even register values in a
victim's process. We achieve this by targeting the register value that is
stored in the process's stack, which subsequently is flushed out into the
memory, where it becomes vulnerable to Rowhammer. When the faulty value is
restored into the register, it will end up used in subsequent iterations. The
register value can be stored in the stack via latent function calls in the
source or by actively triggering signal handlers. We demonstrate the power of
the findings by applying the techniques to bypass SUDO and SSH authentication.
We further outline how MySQL and other cryptographic libraries can be targeted
with the new attack vector. There are a number of challenges this work
overcomes with extensive experimentation before coming together to yield an
end-to-end attack on an OpenSSL digital signature: achieving co-location with
stack and register variables, with synchronization provided via a blocking
window. We show that stack and registers are no longer safe from the Rowhammer
attack.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic manipulation tasks, such as object rearrangement, play a crucial role
in enabling robots to interact with complex and arbitrary environments.
Existing work focuses primarily on single-level rearrangement planning and,
even if multiple levels exist, dependency relations among substructures are
geometrically simpler, like tower stacking. We propose Structural Concept
Learning (SCL), a deep learning approach that leverages graph attention
networks to perform multi-level object rearrangement planning for scenes with
structural dependency hierarchies. It is trained on a self-generated simulation
data set with intuitive structures, works for unseen scenes with an arbitrary
number of objects and higher complexity of structures, infers independent

<p class="mathjax">The growing popularity of language models has sparked interest in
conversational recommender systems (CRS) within both industry and research
circles. However, concerns regarding biases in these systems have emerged.
While individual components of CRS have been subject to bias studies, a
literature gap remains in understanding specific biases unique to CRS and how
these biases may be amplified or reduced when integrated into complex CRS
models. In this paper, we provide a concise review of biases in CRS by
surveying recent literature. We examine the presence of biases throughout the
system's pipeline and consider the challenges that arise from combining
multiple models. Our study investigates biases in classic recommender systems
and their relevance to CRS. Moreover, we address specific biases in CRS,
considering variations with and without natural language understanding
capabilities, along with biases related to dialogue systems and language
models. Through our findings, we highlight the necessity of adopting a holistic
perspective when dealing with biases in complex CRS models.

<p class="mathjax">When evaluated in dynamic, open-world situations, neural networks struggle to
detect unseen classes. This issue complicates the deployment of continual
learners in realistic environments where agents are not explicitly informed
when novel categories are encountered. A common family of techniques for
detecting novelty relies on thresholds of similarity between observed data
points and the data used for training. However, these methods often require
manually specifying (ahead of time) the value of these thresholds, and are
therefore incapable of adapting to the nature of the data. We propose a new
method for automatically selecting these thresholds utilizing a linear search
and leave-one-out cross-validation on the ID classes. We demonstrate that this
novel method for selecting thresholds results in improved total accuracy on
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

<p class="mathjax">Behavioral testing in NLP allows fine-grained evaluation of systems by
examining their linguistic capabilities through the analysis of input-output
behavior. Unfortunately, existing work on behavioral testing in Machine
Translation (MT) is currently restricted to largely handcrafted tests covering
a limited range of capabilities and languages. To address this limitation, we
propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a diverse set of source
sentences tailored to test the behavior of MT models in a range of situations.
We can then verify whether the MT model exhibits the expected behavior through
matching candidate sets that are also generated using LLMs. Our approach aims
to make behavioral testing of MT systems practical while requiring only minimal
human effort. In our experiments, we apply our proposed evaluation framework to
assess multiple available MT systems, revealing that while in general
pass-rates follow the trends observable from traditional accuracy-based
metrics, our method was able to uncover several important differences and
potential bugs that go unnoticed when relying only on accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised pretraining has been observed to be effective at improving
feature representations for transfer learning, leveraging large amounts of
unlabelled data. This review summarizes recent research into its usage in
X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound imaging,
concentrating on studies that compare self-supervised pretraining to fully
supervised learning for diagnostic tasks such as classification and
segmentation. The most pertinent finding is that self-supervised pretraining
generally improves downstream task performance compared to full supervision,
most prominently when unlabelled examples greatly outnumber labelled examples.
Based on the aggregate evidence, recommendations are provided for practitioners
considering using self-supervised learning. Motivated by limitations identified
in current research, directions and practices for future study are suggested,
such as integrating clinical knowledge with theoretically justified
self-supervised learning methods, evaluating on public datasets, growing the
modest body of evidence for ultrasound, and characterizing the impact of
self-supervised pretraining on generalization.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with transformed data
have been applied to various applications such as privacy-preserving learning,
access control, and adversarial defenses. However, the use of transformed data
decreases the performance of models. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a
novel method for fine-tuning models with transformed images under the use of
the vision transformer (ViT). The proposed domain adaptation method does not
cause the accuracy degradation of models, and it is carried out on the basis of
the embedding structure of ViT. In experiments, we confirmed that the proposed
method prevents accuracy degradation even when using encrypted images with the
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM, k-Medoids) is a popular clustering
technique to use with arbitrary distance functions or similarities, where each
cluster is represented by its most central object, called the medoid or the
discrete median. In operations research, this family of problems is also known
as facility location problem (FLP). FastPAM recently introduced a speedup for
large k to make it applicable for larger problems, but the method still has a
runtime quadratic in N. In this chapter, we discuss a sparse and asymmetric
variant of this problem, to be used for example on graph data such as road
networks. By exploiting sparsity, we can avoid the quadratic runtime and memory
requirements, and make this method scalable to even larger problems, as long as
we are able to build a small enough graph of sufficient connectivity to perform
local optimization. Furthermore, we consider asymmetric cases, where the set of
medoids is not identical to the set of points to be covered (or in the
interpretation of facility location, where the possible facility locations are
not identical to the consumer locations). Because of sparsity, it may be
impossible to cover all points with just k medoids for too small k, which would
render the problem unsolvable, and this breaks common heuristics for finding a
good starting condition. We, hence, consider determining k as a part of the
optimization problem and propose to first construct a greedy initial solution
with a larger k, then to optimize the problem by alternating between PAM-style
"swap" operations where the result is improved by replacing medoids with better
alternatives and "remove" operations to reduce the number of k until neither
allows further improving the result quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of
this method on a problem from electrical engineering, with the input graph
derived from cartographic data.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to improved
performance on tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.
Consequently, these models are now well-positioned to reason about the physical
world, particularly within domains such as robotic manipulation. However,
current VLMs are limited in their understanding of the physical concepts (e.g.,
material, fragility) of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for
robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reasoning
about such objects. To address this limitation, we propose PhysObjects, an
object-centric dataset of 36.9K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical
concept annotations of common household objects. We demonstrate that
fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects improves its understanding of physical object
concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance.
We incorporate this physically-grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a
large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning
performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts,
compared to baselines that do not leverage physically-grounded VLMs. We
additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically-grounded VLM on a real
robot, where it improves task success rates. We release our dataset and provide
further details and visualizations of our results at
https://iliad.stanford.edu/pg-vlm/.

<p class="mathjax">Objectives: Approximately 30% of non-metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma
(ASCC) patients will experience recurrence after chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and
currently available clinical variables are poor predictors of treatment
response. We aimed to develop a model leveraging information extracted from
radiation pretreatment planning CT to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) in
ASCC patients after CRT. Methods: Radiomics features were extracted from
planning CT images of 96 ASCC patients. Following pre-feature selection, the
optimal feature set was selected via step-forward feature selection with a
multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The RFS prediction was generated
from a radiomics-clinical combined model based on an optimal feature set with
five repeats of five-fold cross validation. The risk stratification ability of
the proposed model was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Shape-
and texture-based radiomics features significantly predicted RFS. Compared to a
clinical-only model, radiomics-clinical combined model achieves better
performance in the testing cohort with higher C-index (0.80 vs 0.73) and AUC
(0.84 vs 0.79 for 1-year RFS, 0.84 vs 0.78 for 2-year RFS, and 0.86 vs 0.83 for
3-year RFS), leading to distinctive high- and low-risk of recurrence groups
(p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: A treatment planning CT based radiomics and clinical
combined model had improved prognostic performance in predicting RFS for ASCC
patients treated with CRT as compared to a model using clinical features only.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses the challenge of developing a localization system for an
uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV) operating autonomously in unstructured outdoor
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The goal is to
enable accurate mapping and long-range navigation with practical applications
in domains such as autonomous construction, military engineering missions, and
exploration of non-Earth planets. The proposed system - Terrain-Referenced
Assured Engineer Localization System (TRAELS) - integrates pose estimates
produced by two complementary terrain referenced navigation (TRN) methods with
wheel odometry and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements using an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Unlike simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) systems that require loop closures, the described approach maintains
accuracy over long distances and one-way missions without the need to revisit
previous positions. Evaluation of TRAELS is performed across a range of
environments. In regions where a combination of distinctive geometric and
ground surface features are present, the developed TRN methods are leveraged by
TRAELS to consistently achieve an absolute trajectory error of less than 3.0 m.
The approach is also shown to be capable of recovering from large accumulated
drift when traversing feature-sparse areas, which is essential in ensuring
robust performance of the system across a wide variety of challenging
GNSS-denied environments. Overall, the effectiveness of the system in providing
precise localization and mapping capabilities in challenging GNSS-denied
environments is demonstrated and an analysis is performed leading to insights
for improving TRN approaches for UGVs.

<p class="mathjax">Learning causal effects from data is a fundamental and well-studied problem
across science, especially when the cause-effect relationship is static in
nature. However, causal effect is less explored when there are dynamical
dependencies, i.e., when dependencies exist between entities across time.
Identifying dynamic causal effects from time-series observations is
computationally expensive when compared to the static scenario. We demonstrate
that the computational complexity of recovering the causation structure for the
vector auto-regressive (VAR) model is $O(Tn^3N^2)$, where $n$ is the number of
nodes, $T$ is the number of samples, and $N$ is the largest time-lag in the
dependency between entities. We report a method, with a reduced complexity of
$O(Tn^3 \log N)$, to recover the causation structure to obtain frequency-domain
(FD) representations of time-series. Since FFT accumulates all the time
dependencies on every frequency, causal inference can be performed efficiently
by considering the state variables as random variables at any given frequency.
We additionally show that, for systems with interactions that are LTI,
do-calculus machinery can be realized in the FD resulting in versions of the
classical single-door (with cycles), front and backdoor criteria. We
demonstrate, for a large class of problems, graph reconstruction using
multivariate Wiener projections results in a significant computational
advantage with $O(n)$ complexity over reconstruction algorithms such as the PC
algorithm which has $O(n^q)$ complexity, where $q$ is the maximum neighborhood
size. This advantage accrues due to some remarkable properties of the phase
response of the frequency-dependent Wiener coefficients which is not present in
any time-domain approach.

<p class="mathjax">It has always been a severe loss for any establishment when an experienced
hand retires or moves to another firm. The specific details of what his
job/position entails will always make the work more efficient. To curtail such
losses, it is possible to implement a system that takes input from a new
employee regarding the challenges he/she is facing and match it to a previous
occurrence where someone else held his/her chair. This system could be made
possible with input through the ages from the array of individuals who managed
that particular job and processing this data through a neural network that
recognizes the pattern. The paper is based on data collected from traditional
wooden dhow builders and some of the modern day unconventional shipyards. Since
the requirements for successful implementation in such scenarios seems too
steep at the moment, an alternate approach has been suggested by implementation
through the design processes across multiple shipyards. The process entails the
traditional value passed down through generations regarding a particular
profession and analysis has been done regarding how this knowledge/experience
can be captured and preserved for future generations to work upon. A series of
tools including SharePoint, MATLAB, and some similar software working in tandem
can be used for the design of the same. This research will provide valuable
insight as to how information sharing can be applied through generations for
effective application of production capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">A novel, learning-based method for in situ estimation of soil properties
using a physics-infused neural network (PINN) is presented. The network is
trained to produce estimates of soil cohesion, angle of internal friction,
soil-tool friction, soil failure angle, and residual depth of cut which are
then passed through an earthmoving model based on the fundamental equation of
earthmoving (FEE) to produce an estimated force. The network ingests a short
history of kinematic observations along with past control commands and predicts
interaction forces accurately with average error of less than 2kN, 13% of the
measured force. To validate the approach, an earthmoving simulation of a bladed
vehicle is developed using Vortex Studio, enabling comparison of the estimated
parameters to pseudo-ground-truth values which is challenging in real-world
experiments. The proposed approach is shown to enable accurate estimation of
interaction forces and produces meaningful parameter estimates even when the
model and the environmental physics deviate substantially.

<p class="mathjax">Pathology detection and delineation enables the automatic interpretation of
medical scans such as chest X-rays while providing a high level of
explainability to support radiologists in making informed decisions. However,
annotating pathology bounding boxes is a time-consuming task such that large
public datasets for this purpose are scarce. Current approaches thus use weakly
supervised object detection to learn the (rough) localization of pathologies
from image-level annotations, which is however limited in performance due to
the lack of bounding box supervision. We therefore propose anatomy-driven
pathology detection (ADPD), which uses easy-to-annotate bounding boxes of
anatomical regions as proxies for pathologies. We study two training
approaches: supervised training using anatomy-level pathology labels and
multiple instance learning (MIL) with image-level pathology labels. Our results
show that our anatomy-level training approach outperforms weakly supervised
methods and fully supervised detection with limited training samples, and our
MIL approach is competitive with both baseline approaches, therefore
demonstrating the potential of our approach.

current prices, trade volumes, and potential future values, have been subjects
of numerous studies. The complex interaction of the variables related to tokens
makes analyzing them challenging. Employing social networks, a powerful tool
for modeling connections within groups or communities, can provide valuable
guidance. This study mainly focuses on creating and examining networks related
to two major decentralized exchanges: Uniswap Version 2 and SushiSwap. We
discovered that the distribution of links to nodes follow a power law making
them scale-free networks. Additionally, during our analysis, we made an
intresting discovery: the centrality of tokens in exchange graphs provide
valuable insights into their value and significance in the world of
cryptocurrencies. By observing changes in centrality over time, we uncovered
noteworthy events in the cryptocurrency domain, that shows the potential of
this networks for extracting information about the exchanges.

<p class="mathjax">Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting 50 million
individuals worldwide and 1.2 million Americans. There exist millions of
pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, a condition in which seizures
fail to come under control. The occurrence of seizures can result in physical
injury, disorientation, unconsciousness, and additional symptoms that could
impede children's ability to participate in everyday tasks. Predicting seizures
can help parents and healthcare providers take precautions, prevent risky
situations, and mentally prepare children to minimize anxiety and nervousness
associated with the uncertainty of a seizure. This research proposes a novel
and comprehensive framework to predict seizures in pediatric patients by
evaluating machine learning algorithms on unimodal neuroimaging data consisting
of electroencephalogram signals. The bandpass filtering and independent
component analysis proved to be effective in reducing the noise and artifacts
from the dataset. Various machine learning algorithms' performance is evaluated
on important metrics such as accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1
score and MCC. The results show that the deep learning algorithms are more
successful in predicting seizures than logistic Regression, and k nearest
neighbors. The recurrent neural network (RNN) gave the highest precision and F1
Score, long short-term memory (LSTM) outperformed RNN in accuracy and
convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the highest Specificity. This
research has significant implications for healthcare providers in proactively
managing seizure occurrence in pediatric patients, potentially transforming
clinical practices, and improving pediatric care.

<p class="mathjax">Volumetric design, also called massing design, is the first and critical step
in professional building design which is sequential in nature. As the
volumetric design process is complex, the underlying sequential design process
encodes valuable information for designers. Many efforts have been made to
automatically generate reasonable volumetric designs, but the quality of the
generated design solutions varies, and evaluating a design solution requires
either a prohibitively comprehensive set of metrics or expensive human
expertise. While previous approaches focused on learning only the final design
instead of sequential design tasks, we propose to encode the design knowledge
from a collection of expert or high-performing design sequences and extract
useful representations using transformer-based models. Later we propose to
utilize the learned representations for crucial downstream applications such as
design preference evaluation and procedural design generation. We develop the
preference model by estimating the density of the learned representations
whereas we train an autoregressive transformer model for sequential design
generation. We demonstrate our ideas by leveraging a novel dataset of thousands
of sequential volumetric designs. Our preference model can compare two
arbitrarily given design sequences and is almost 90% accurate in evaluation
against random design sequences. Our autoregressive model is also capable of
autocompleting a volumetric design sequence from a partial design sequence.

<p class="mathjax">Ensemble transform Kalman filtering (ETKF) data assimilation is often used to
combine available observations with numerical simulations to obtain
statistically accurate and reliable state representations in dynamical systems.
However, it is well known that the commonly used Gaussian distribution
assumption introduces biases for state variables that admit discontinuous
profiles, which are prevalent in nonlinear partial differential equations. This
investigation designs a new structurally informed non-Gaussian prior that
exploits statistical information from the simulated state variables. In
particular, we construct a new weighting matrix based on the second moment of
the gradient information of the state variable to replace the prior covariance
matrix used for model/data compromise in the ETKF data assimilation framework.
We further adapt our weighting matrix to include information in discontinuity
regions via a clustering technique. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that
this new approach yields more accurate estimates than those obtained using ETKF
on shallow water equations, even when ETKF is enhanced with inflation and
localization techniques.

<p class="mathjax">We present CM3Leon (pronounced "Chameleon"), a retrieval-augmented,
token-based, decoder-only multi-modal language model capable of generating and
infilling both text and images. CM3Leon uses the CM3 multi-modal architecture
but additionally shows the extreme benefits of scaling up and tuning on more
diverse instruction-style data. It is the first multi-modal model trained with
a recipe adapted from text-only language models, including a large-scale
retrieval-augmented pre-training stage and a second multi-task supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) stage. It is also a general-purpose model that can do both
text-to-image and image-to-text generation, allowing us to introduce
self-contained contrastive decoding methods that produce high-quality outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this recipe is highly effective for
multi-modal models. CM3Leon achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation with 5x less training compute than comparable methods
(zero-shot MS-COCO FID of 4.88). After SFT, CM3Leon can also demonstrate
unprecedented levels of controllability in tasks ranging from language-guided
image editing to image-controlled generation and segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of algorithmic economics, voting systems are evaluated and
compared by examining the properties or axioms they satisfy. While this pursuit
has yielded valuable insights, it has also led to seminal impossibility results
such as Arrow's and Gibbard-Satterthwaite's Impossibility Theorems, which pose
challenges in designing ideal voting systems. Enter the domain of quantum
computing: recent advancements have introduced the concept of quantum voting
systems, which have many potential applications including in security and
blockchain. Building on recent works that bypass Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
using quantum voting systems, our research extends Quantum Condorcet Voting
(QCV) to counter the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem in a quantum
setting. To show this, we introduce a quantum-specific notion of truthfulness,
extend ideas like incentive compatibility and the purpose of onto to the
quantum domain, and introduce new tools to map social welfare functions to
social choice functions in this domain.

produce a neural network feature extractor applicable to multiple
classification tasks in B-mode lung ultrasound analysis. When fine-tuning on
three lung ultrasound tasks, pretrained models resulted in an improvement of
the average across-task area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) by 0.032
and 0.061 on local and external test sets respectively. Compact nonlinear
classifiers trained on features outputted by a single pretrained model did not
improve performance across all tasks; however, they did reduce inference time
by 49% compared to serial execution of separate fine-tuned models. When
training using 1% of the available labels, pretrained models consistently
outperformed fully supervised models, with a maximum observed test AUC increase
of 0.396 for the task of view classification. Overall, the results indicate
that self-supervised pretraining is useful for producing initial weights for
lung ultrasound classifiers.

<p class="mathjax">Weather forecasting plays a vital role in numerous sectors, but accurately
capturing the complex dynamics of weather systems remains a challenge for
traditional statistical models. Apart from Auto Regressive time forecasting
models like ARIMA, deep learning techniques (Vanilla ANNs, LSTM and GRU
networks), have shown promise in improving forecasting accuracy by capturing
temporal dependencies. This paper explores the application of metaheuristic
algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to automate the search for optimal
hyperparameters in these model architectures. Metaheuristic algorithms excel in
global optimization, offering robustness, versatility, and scalability in
handling non-linear problems. We present a comparative analysis of different
model architectures integrated with metaheuristic optimization, evaluating
their performance in weather forecasting based on metrics such as Mean Squared
Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results demonstrate
the potential of metaheuristic algorithms in enhancing weather forecasting
accuracy \&amp; helps in determining the optimal set of hyper-parameters for each
model. The paper underscores the importance of harnessing advanced optimization
techniques to select the most suitable metaheuristic algorithm for the given
weather forecasting task.

identical machines, subject to compatibility constraints, where two jobs are
compatible if they can be processed simultaneously in a same batch. These

Furthermore, computational experiments are carried out to measure the

<p class="mathjax">Unknown unknowns are operational scenarios in a cyber-physical system that
are not accounted for in the design and test phase. As such under
unknown-unknown scenarios, the operational behavior of the CPS is not
guaranteed to meet requirements such as safety and efficacy specified using
Signal Temporal Logic (STL) on the output trajectories. We propose a novel
framework for analyzing the stochastic conformance of operational output
characteristics of safety-critical cyber-physical systems that can discover
unknown-unknown scenarios and evaluate potential safety hazards. We propose
dynamics-induced hybrid recurrent neural networks (DiH-RNN) to mine a
physics-guided surrogate model (PGSM) which is used to check the model
conformance using STL on the model coefficients. We demonstrate the detection
of operational changes in an Artificial Pancreas(AP) due to unknown insulin

<p class="mathjax">Due to the steady rise in population demographics and longevity, emergency
department visits are increasing across North America. As more patients visit
the emergency department, traditional clinical workflows become overloaded and
inefficient, leading to prolonged wait-times and reduced healthcare quality.
One of such workflows is the triage medical directive, impeded by limited human
workload, inaccurate diagnoses and invasive over-testing. To address this
issue, we propose TriNet: a machine learning model for medical directives that
automates first-line screening at triage for conditions requiring downstream
testing for diagnosis confirmation. To verify screening potential, TriNet was
trained on hospital triage data and achieved high positive predictive values in
detecting pneumonia (0.86) and urinary tract infection (0.93). These models
outperform current clinical benchmarks, indicating that machine-learning
medical directives can offer cost-free, non-invasive screening with high
specificity for common conditions, reducing the risk of over-testing while
increasing emergency department efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Developing efficient solutions for inference problems in intelligent sensor
networks is crucial for the next generation of location, tracking, and mapping
services. This paper develops a scalable distributed probabilistic inference
algorithm that applies to continuous variables, intractable posteriors and
large-scale real-time data in sensor networks. In a centralized setting,
variational inference is a fundamental technique for performing approximate
Bayesian estimation, in which an intractable posterior density is approximated
with a parametric density. Our key contribution lies in the derivation of a
separable lower bound on the centralized estimation objective, which enables
distributed variational inference with one-hop communication in a sensor
network. Our distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) consists of a weighted
sum of observation likelihood and divergence to prior densities, and its gap to
the measurement evidence is due to consensus and modeling errors. To solve
binary classification and regression problems while handling streaming data, we
design an online distributed algorithm that maximizes DELBO, and specialize it
to Gaussian variational densities with non-linear likelihoods. The resulting
distributed Gaussian variational inference (DGVI) efficiently inverts a
$1$-rank correction to the covariance matrix. Finally, we derive a diagonalized
version for online distributed inference in high-dimensional models, and apply
it to multi-robot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.

<p class="mathjax">The Linear Parameter Varying Dynamical System (LPV-DS) is a promising
framework for learning stable time-invariant motion policies in robot control.
By employing statistical modeling and semi-definite optimization, LPV-DS
encodes complex motions via non-linear DS, ensuring the robustness and
stability of the system. However, the current LPV-DS scheme faces challenges in
accurately interpreting trajectory data while maintaining model efficiency and
computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the
Directionality-aware Mixture Model (DAMM), a new statistical model that
leverages Riemannian metric on $d$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, and
efficiently incorporates non-Euclidean directional information with position.
Additionally, we introduce a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo method that
combines the Gibbs Sampling and the Split/Merge Proposal, facilitating parallel
computation and enabling faster inference for near real-time learning
performance. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that the
improved LPV-DS framework with DAMM is capable of producing
physically-meaningful representations of the trajectory data and improved
performance of the generated DS while showcasing significantly enhanced
learning speed compared to its previous iterations.

<p class="mathjax">In many real-world scenarios, distribution shifts exist in the streaming data
across time steps. Many complex sequential data can be effectively divided into
distinct regimes that exhibit persistent dynamics. Discovering the shifted
behaviors and the evolving patterns underlying the streaming data are important
to understand the dynamic system. Existing methods typically train one robust
model to work for the evolving data of distinct distributions or sequentially
adapt the model utilizing explicitly given regime boundaries. However, there
are two challenges: (1) shifts in data streams could happen drastically and
abruptly without precursors. Boundaries of distribution shifts are usually
unavailable, and (2) training a shared model for all domains could fail to
capture varying patterns. This paper aims to solve the problem of sequential
data modeling in the presence of sudden distribution shifts that occur without
any precursors. Specifically, we design a Bayesian framework, dubbed as T-SaS,
with a discrete distribution-modeling variable to capture abrupt shifts of
data. Then, we design a model that enable adaptation with dynamic network
selection conditioned on that discrete variable. The proposed method learns
specific model parameters for each distribution by learning which neurons
should be activated in the full network. A dynamic masking strategy is adopted
here to support inter-distribution transfer through the overlapping of a set of
sparse networks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is
superior in both accurately detecting shift boundaries to get segments of
varying distributions and effectively adapting to downstream forecast or
classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Music source separation (MSS) aims to separate a music recording into
multiple musically distinct stems, such as vocals, bass, drums, and more.
Recently, deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used, but the improvement is
still limited. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-domain approach
based on a Band-Split RoPE Transformer (called BS-RoFormer). BS-RoFormer
replies on a band-split module to project the input complex spectrogram into
subband-level representations, and then arranges a stack of hierarchical
Transformers to model the inner-band as well as inter-band sequences for
multi-band mask estimation. To facilitate training the model for MSS, we
propose to use the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). The BS-RoFormer system
trained on MUSDB18HQ and 500 extra songs ranked the first place in the MSS
track of Sound Demixing Challenge (SDX23). Benchmarking a smaller version of
BS-RoFormer on MUSDB18HQ, we achieve state-of-the-art result without extra
training data, with 9.80 dB of average SDR.

must split a finite divisible resource (such as money or time) among a set of
competing projects. Our goal is twofold: We seek truthful mechanisms that
provide fairness guarantees to the projects. For the first objective, we focus
on the class of moving phantom mechanisms [Freeman et al., 2021], which are --
to this day -- essentially the only known truthful mechanisms in this setting.
For project fairness, we consider the mean division as a fair baseline, and
bound the maximum difference between the funding received by any project and
this baseline. We propose a novel and simple moving phantom mechanism that
provides optimal project fairness guarantees. As a corollary of our results, we
show that our new mechanism minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance to the mean (a
measure suggested by Caragiannis et al. [2022]) for three projects and gives
the first non-trivial bounds on this quantity for more than three projects.

<p class="mathjax">Increases in wildfire activity and the resulting impacts have prompted the
development of high-resolution wildfire behavior models for forecasting fire
spread. Recent progress in using satellites to detect fire locations further
provides the opportunity to use measurements to improve fire spread forecasts
from numerical models through data assimilation. This work develops a method
for inferring the history of a wildfire from satellite measurements, providing
the necessary information to initialize coupled atmosphere-wildfire models from
a measured wildfire state in a physics-informed approach. The fire arrival
time, which is the time the fire reaches a given spatial location, acts as a
succinct representation of the history of a wildfire. In this work, a
conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (cWGAN), trained with
WRF-SFIRE simulations, is used to infer the fire arrival time from satellite
active fire data. The cWGAN is used to produce samples of likely fire arrival
times from the conditional distribution of arrival times given satellite active
fire detections. Samples produced by the cWGAN are further used to assess the
uncertainty of predictions. The cWGAN is tested on four California wildfires
occurring between 2020 and 2022, and predictions for fire extent are compared
against high resolution airborne infrared measurements. Further, the predicted
ignition times are compared with reported ignition times. An average Sorensen's
coefficient of 0.81 for the fire perimeters and an average ignition time error
of 32 minutes suggest that the method is highly accurate.

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformer (ViT) and its variants have swept through visual learning
leaderboards and offer state-of-the-art accuracy in tasks such as image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation by attending to
different parts of the visual input and capturing long-range spatial
dependencies. However, these models are large and computation-heavy. For
instance, the recently proposed ViT-B model has 86M parameters making it
impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, their
deployment on mobile and edge scenarios is limited. In our work, we aim to take
a step toward bringing vision transformers to the edge by utilizing popular
model compression techniques such as distillation, pruning, and quantization.
<br />Our chosen application environment is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that
is battery-powered and memory-constrained, carrying a single-board computer on
the scale of an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with 4GB of RAM. On the other hand, the UAV
requires high accuracy close to that of state-of-the-art ViTs to ensure safe
object avoidance in autonomous navigation, or correct localization of humans in
search-and-rescue. Inference latency should also be minimized given the
application requirements. Hence, our target is to enable rapid inference of a
vision transformer on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB) with minimal accuracy loss.
This allows us to deploy ViTs on resource-constrained devices, opening up new
possibilities in surveillance, environmental monitoring, etc. Our
implementation is made available at https://github.com/chensy7/efficient-vit.

<p class="mathjax">The paper presents the algorithm for clustering a dataset by grouping the
optimal, from the point of view of the BIC criterion, number of Gaussian
clusters into the optimal, from the point of view of their statistical
separability, superclusters.
<br />The algorithm consists of three stages: representation of the dataset as a
mixture of Gaussian distributions - clusters, which number is determined based
on the minimum of the BIC criterion; using the Mahalanobis distance, to
estimate the distances between the clusters and cluster sizes; combining the
resulting clusters into superclusters using the DBSCAN method by finding its
hyperparameter (maximum distance) providing maximum value of introduced matrix
quality criterion at maximum number of superclusters. The matrix quality
criterion corresponds to the proportion of statistically significant separated
superclusters among all found superclusters.
<br />The algorithm has only one hyperparameter - statistical significance level,
and automatically detects optimal number and shape of superclusters based of
statistical hypothesis testing approach. The algorithm demonstrates a good
results on test datasets in noise and noiseless situations. An essential
advantage of the algorithm is its ability to predict correct supercluster for
new data based on already trained clusterer and perform soft (fuzzy)
clustering. The disadvantages of the algorithm are: its low speed and
stochastic nature of the final clustering. It requires a sufficiently large
dataset for clustering, which is typical for many statistical methods.

<p class="mathjax">Reward design is a fundamental, yet challenging aspect of practical
reinforcement learning (RL). For simple tasks, researchers typically handcraft
the reward function, e.g., using a linear combination of several reward
factors. However, such reward engineering is subject to approximation bias,
incurs large tuning cost, and often cannot provide the granularity required for
complex tasks. To avoid these difficulties, researchers have turned to
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
function from human preferences between pairs of trajectory sequences. By
leveraging preference-based reward modeling, RLHF learns complex rewards that
are well aligned with human preferences, allowing RL to tackle increasingly
difficult problems. Unfortunately, the applicability of RLHF is limited due to
the high cost and difficulty of obtaining human preference data. In light of
this cost, we investigate learning reward functions for complex tasks with less
human effort; simply by ranking the importance of the reward factors. More
specifically, we propose a new RL framework -- HERON, which compares
trajectories using a hierarchical decision tree induced by the given ranking.
These comparisons are used to train a preference-based reward model, which is
then used for policy learning. We find that our framework can not only train
high performing agents on a variety of difficult tasks, but also provide
additional benefits such as improved sample efficiency and robustness. Our code
is available at https://github.com/abukharin3/HERON.

<p class="mathjax">$k$-defective cliques relax cliques by allowing up-to $k$ missing edges from
being a complete graph. This relaxation enables us to find larger near-cliques
and has applications in link prediction, cluster detection, social network
analysis and transportation science. The problem of finding the largest
$k$-defective clique has been recently studied with several algorithms being
proposed in the literature. However, the currently fastest algorithm KDBB does
not improve its time complexity from being the trivial $O(2^n)$, and also,
KDBB's practical performance is still not satisfactory. In this paper, we
advance the state of the art for exact maximum $k$-defective clique
computation, in terms of both time complexity and practical performance.
Moreover, we separate the techniques required for achieving the time complexity
from others purely used for practical performance consideration; this design
choice may facilitate the research community to further improve the practical
efficiency while not sacrificing the worst case time complexity. In specific,
we first develop a general framework kDC that beats the trivial time complexity
of $O(2^n)$ and achieves a better time complexity than all existing algorithms.
The time complexity of kDC is solely achieved by non-fully-adjacent-first
branching rule, excess-removal reduction rule and high-degree reduction rule.
Then, to make kDC practically efficient, we further propose a new upper bound,
two reduction rules, and an algorithm for efficiently computing a large initial
solution. Extensive empirical studies on three benchmark graph collections with
$290$ graphs in total demonstrate that kDC outperforms the currently fastest
algorithm KDBB by several orders of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made great strides in pushing the
state-of-the-art in several challenging domains. Recent studies reveal that
they are prone to making overconfident predictions. This greatly reduces the
overall trust in model predictions, especially in safety-critical applications.
Early work in improving model calibration employs post-processing techniques
which rely on limited parameters and require a hold-out set. Some recent
train-time calibration methods, which involve all model parameters, can
outperform the postprocessing methods. To this end, we propose a new train-time
calibration method, which features a simple, plug-and-play auxiliary loss known
as multi-class alignment of predictive mean confidence and predictive certainty
(MACC). It is based on the observation that a model miscalibration is directly
related to its predictive certainty, so a higher gap between the mean
confidence and certainty amounts to a poor calibration both for in-distribution
and out-of-distribution predictions. Armed with this insight, our proposed loss
explicitly encourages a confident (or underconfident) model to also provide a
low (or high) spread in the presoftmax distribution. Extensive experiments on
ten challenging datasets, covering in-domain, out-domain, non-visual
recognition and medical image classification scenarios, show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance for both in-domain and
out-domain predictions. Our code and models will be publicly released.

<p class="mathjax">Open-source software (OSS) supply chain enlarges the attack surface, which
makes package registries attractive targets for attacks. Recently, package
registries NPM and PyPI have been flooded with malicious packages. The
effectiveness of existing malicious NPM and PyPI package detection approaches
is hindered by two challenges. The first challenge is how to leverage the
knowledge of malicious packages from different ecosystems in a unified way such
that multi-lingual malicious package detection can be feasible. The second
challenge is how to model malicious behavior in a sequential way such that
maliciousness can be precisely captured. To address the two challenges, we
propose and implement Cerebro to detect malicious packages in NPM and PyPI. We
curate a feature set based on a high-level abstraction of malicious behavior to
enable multi-lingual knowledge fusing. We organize extracted features into a
behavior sequence to model sequential malicious behavior. We fine-tune the BERT
model to understand the semantics of malicious behavior. Extensive evaluation
has demonstrated the effectiveness of Cerebro over the state-of-the-art as well
as the practically acceptable efficiency. Cerebro has successfully detected 306
and 196 new malicious packages in PyPI and NPM, and received 385 thank letters
from the official PyPI and NPM teams.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have become successful, but their
performance remains poor when translating on new domains with a limited number
of data. In this paper, we present a novel approach Epi-Curriculum to address
low-resource domain adaptation (DA), which contains a new episodic training
framework along with denoised curriculum learning. Our episodic training
framework enhances the model's robustness to domain shift by episodically
exposing the encoder/decoder to an inexperienced decoder/encoder. The denoised
curriculum learning filters the noised data and further improves the model's
adaptability by gradually guiding the learning process from easy to more
difficult tasks. Experiments on English-German and English-Romanian translation
show that: (i) Epi-Curriculum improves both model's robustness and adaptability
in seen and unseen domains; (ii) Our episodic training framework enhances the
encoder and decoder's robustness to domain shift.

<p class="mathjax">Hard Disk Drive (HDD) failures in datacenters are costly - from catastrophic
data loss to a question of goodwill, stakeholders want to avoid it like the
plague. An important tool in proactively monitoring against HDD failure is
timely estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). To this end, the
Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology employed within HDDs
(S.M.A.R.T.) provide critical logs for long-term maintenance of the security
and dependability of these essential data storage devices. Data-driven
predictive models in the past have used these S.M.A.R.T. logs and CNN/RNN based
architectures heavily. However, they have suffered significantly in providing a
confidence interval around the predicted RUL values as well as in processing
very long sequences of logs. In addition, some of these approaches, such as
those based on LSTMs, are inherently slow to train and have tedious feature
engineering overheads. To overcome these challenges, in this work we propose a
novel transformer architecture - a Temporal-fusion Bi-encoder Self-attention
Transformer (TFBEST) for predicting failures in hard-drives. It is an
encoder-decoder based deep learning technique that enhances the context gained
from understanding health statistics sequences and predicts a sequence of the
number of days remaining before a disk potentially fails. In this paper, we
also provide a novel confidence margin statistic that can help manufacturers
replace a hard-drive within a time frame. Experiments on Seagate HDD data show
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art RUL prediction
methods during testing over the exhaustive 10-year data from Backblaze
(2013-present). Although validated on HDD failure prediction, the TFBEST
architecture is well-suited for other prognostics applications and may be
adapted for allied regression problems.

<p class="mathjax">Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capability is envisioned as one
key feature for future cellular networks. Classical half-duplex (HD) radar
sensing is conducted in a "first-emit-then-listen" manner. One challenge to
realize HD ISAC lies in the discrepancy of the two systems' time scheduling for
transmitting and receiving. This difficulty can be overcome by full-duplex (FD)
transceivers. Besides, ISAC generally has to comprise its communication rate
due to realizing sensing functionality. This loss can be compensated by the
emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology. This paper
considers the joint design of beamforming, power allocation and signal
processing in a FD uplink communication system aided by RIS, which is a highly
nonconvex problem. To resolve this challenge, via leveraging the
cutting-the-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition
(PDD) methods, we develop an iterative solution that optimizes all variables
via using convex optimization techniques. Besides, by wisely exploiting
alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and optimality analysis, we
further develop a low complexity solution that updates all variables
analytically and runs highly efficiently. Numerical results are provided to
verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms and
demonstrate the significant performance boosting by employing RIS in the FD
ISAC system.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the controllability backbone problem in dynamical networks
defined over graphs. The main idea of the controllability backbone is to
identify a small subset of edges in a given network such that any subnetwork
containing those edges/links has at least the same network controllability as
the original network while assuming the same set of input/leader vertices. We
consider the strong structural controllability (SSC) in our work, which is
useful but computationally challenging. Thus, we utilize two lower bounds on
the network's SSC based on the zero forcing notion and graph distances. We
provide algorithms to compute controllability backbones while preserving these
lower bounds. We thoroughly analyze the proposed algorithms and compute the
number of edges in the controllability backbones. Finally, we compare and
numerically evaluate our methods on random graphs.

<p class="mathjax">The fast growth of inverter-based resources such as wind plants and solar
farms will largely replace and reduce conventional synchronous generators in
the future renewable energy-dominated power grid. Such transition will make the
system operation and control much more complicated; and one key challenge is
the low inertia issue that has been widely recognized. However, locational
post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to
accommodate significant inertia reduction has not been fully investigated in
the literature. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based
RoCoF-constrained unit commitment (CNN-RCUC) model to guarantee RoCoF stability
following the worst generator outage event while ensuring operational
efficiency. A generic CNN based predictor is first trained to track the highest
locational RoCoF based on a high-fidelity simulation dataset. The RoCoF
predictor is then formulated as MILP constraints into the unit commitment
model. Case studies are carried out on the IEEE 24-bus system, and simulation
results obtained with PSS/E indicate that the proposed method can ensure
locational post-contingency RoCoF stability without conservativeness.

<p class="mathjax">In standard supervised machine learning, it is necessary to provide a label
for every input in the data. While raw data in many application domains is
easily obtainable on the Internet, manual labelling of this data is
prohibitively expensive. To circumvent this issue, contrastive learning methods
produce low-dimensional vector representations (also called features) of
high-dimensional inputs on large unlabelled datasets. This is done by training
with a contrastive loss function, which enforces that similar inputs have high
inner product and dissimilar inputs have low inner product in the feature
space. Rather than annotating each input individually, it suffices to define a
means of sampling pairs of similar and dissimilar inputs. Contrastive features
can then be fed as inputs to supervised learning systems on much smaller
labelled datasets to obtain high accuracy on end tasks of interest.
<br />The goal of this thesis is to provide an overview of the current theoretical
understanding of contrastive learning, specifically as it pertains to the
minimizers of contrastive loss functions and their relationship to prior
methods for learning features from unlabelled data. We highlight popular
contrastive loss functions whose minimizers implicitly approximate a positive
semidefinite (PSD) kernel. The latter is a well-studied object in functional
analysis and learning theory that formalizes a notion of similarity between
elements of a space. PSD kernels provide an implicit definition of features
through the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

<p class="mathjax">The prevalent use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains has
drawn attention to the issue of "hallucination," which refers to instances
where LLMs generate factually inaccurate or ungrounded information. Existing
techniques for hallucination detection in language assistants rely on intricate
fuzzy, specific free-language-based chain of thought (CoT) techniques or
parameter-based methods that suffer from interpretability issues. Additionally,
the methods that identify hallucinations post-generation could not prevent
their occurrence and suffer from inconsistent performance due to the influence
of the instruction format and model style. In this paper, we introduce a novel
pre-detection self-evaluation technique, referred to as {\method}, which
focuses on evaluating the model's familiarity with the concepts present in the
input instruction and withholding the generation of response in case of
unfamiliar concepts. This approach emulates the human ability to refrain from
responding to unfamiliar topics, thus reducing hallucinations. We validate
{\method} across four different large language models, demonstrating
consistently superior performance compared to existing techniques. Our findings
propose a significant shift towards preemptive strategies for hallucination
mitigation in LLM assistants, promising improvements in reliability,
applicability, and interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose two efficient fully-discrete schemes for Q-tensor
flow of liquid crystals by using the first- and second-order stabilized
exponential scalar auxiliary variable (sESAV) approach in time and the finite
difference method for spatial discretization. The modified discrete energy
dissipation laws are unconditionally satisfied for both two constructed
schemes. A particular feature is that, for two-dimensional (2D) and a kind of
three-dimensional (3D) Q-tensor flows, the unconditional
maximum-bound-principle (MBP) preservation of the constructed first-order
scheme is successfully established, and the proposed second-order scheme
preserves the discrete MBP property with a mild restriction on the time-step
sizes. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the corresponding error estimates for
the fully-discrete second-order schemes by using the built-in stability
results. Finally, various numerical examples validating the theoretical
results, such as the orientation of liquid crystal in 2D and 3D, are presented
for the constructed schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Subsethood, which is to measure the degree of set inclusion relation, is
predominant in fuzzy set theory. This paper introduces some basic concepts of
spatial granules, coarse-fine relation, and operations like meet, join,
quotient meet and quotient join. All the atomic granules can be hierarchized by
set-inclusion relation and all the granules can be hierarchized by coarse-fine
relation. Viewing an information system from the micro and the macro
perspectives, we can get a micro knowledge space and a micro knowledge space,
from which a rough set model and a spatial rough granule model are respectively
obtained. The classical rough set model is the special case of the rough set
model induced from the micro knowledge space, while the spatial rough granule
model will be play a pivotal role in the problem-solving of structures. We
discuss twelve axioms of monotone increasing subsethood and twelve
corresponding axioms of monotone decreasing supsethood, and generalize
subsethood and supsethood to conditional granularity and conditional fineness
respectively. We develop five conditional granularity measures and five
conditional fineness measures and prove that each conditional granularity or
fineness measure satisfies its corresponding twelve axioms although its
subsethood or supsethood measure only hold one of the two boundary conditions.
We further define five conditional granularity entropies and five conditional
fineness entropies respectively, and each entropy only satisfies part of the
boundary conditions but all the ten monotone conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Object tracking is an important functionality of edge video analytic systems
and services. Multi-object tracking (MOT) detects the moving objects and tracks
their locations frame by frame as real scenes are being captured into a video.
However, it is well known that real time object tracking on the edge poses
critical technical challenges, especially with edge devices of heterogeneous
computing resources. This paper examines the performance issues and
edge-specific optimization opportunities for object tracking. We will show that
even the well trained and optimized MOT model may still suffer from random
frame dropping problems when edge devices have insufficient computation
resources. We present several edge specific performance optimization
strategies, collectively coined as EMO, to speed up the real time object
tracking, ranging from window-based optimization to similarity based
optimization. Extensive experiments on popular MOT benchmarks demonstrate that
our EMO approach is competitive with respect to the representative methods for
on-device object tracking techniques in terms of run-time performance and
tracking accuracy. EMO is released on Github at

<p class="mathjax">Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control algorithm with strong
stability and robustness guarantees. Despite its popularity in robotics and
industrial applications, the main challenge in deploying MPC is its high
computation cost, stemming from the need to solve an optimisation problem at
each control interval. There are several methods to reduce this cost. This
survey focusses on approaches where a neural network is used to approximate an
existing controller. Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods
for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons
are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which
the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is
applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises
existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising
research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation
framework. The main conclusions are that (1) new benchmarking tools are needed
to help prove the generalisability and scalability of approximation frameworks,
(2) future breakthroughs most likely lie in the development of ties between
control and learning, and (3) the potential and applicability of recently
developed neural architectures and tools remains unexplored in this field.

<p class="mathjax">We study the budget allocation problem in online marketing campaigns that
utilize previously collected offline data. We first discuss the long-term
effect of optimizing marketing budget allocation decisions in the offline
setting. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel game-theoretic offline
value-based reinforcement learning method using mixed policies. The proposed
method reduces the need to store infinitely many policies in previous methods
to only constantly many policies, which achieves nearly optimal policy
efficiency, making it practical and favorable for industrial usage. We further
show that this method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy, which
cannot be achieved by previous value-based reinforcement learning methods for
marketing budget allocation. Our experiments on a large-scale marketing
campaign with tens-of-millions users and more than one billion budget verify
the theoretical results and show that the proposed method outperforms various
baseline methods. The proposed method has been successfully deployed to serve
all the traffic of this marketing campaign.

<p class="mathjax">Retrosynthesis is the process of determining the set of reactant molecules
that can react to form a desired product. Semi-template-based retrosynthesis
methods, which imitate the reverse logic of synthesis reactions, first predict
the reaction centers in the products, and then complete the resulting synthons
back into reactants. These methods enable necessary interpretability and high
practical utility to inform synthesis planning. We develop a new offline-online
reinforcement learning method RLSynC for synthon completion in
semi-template-based methods. RLSynC assigns one agent to each synthon, all of
which complete the synthons by conducting actions step by step in a
synchronized fashion. RLSynC learns the policy from both offline training
episodes and online interactions which allow RLSynC to explore new reaction
spaces. RLSynC uses a forward synthesis model to evaluate the likelihood of the
predicted reactants in synthesizing a product, and thus guides the action
search. We compare RLSynC with the state-of-the-art retrosynthesis methods. Our
experimental results demonstrate that RLSynC can outperform these methods with
improvement as high as 14.9% on synthon completion, and 14.0% on
retrosynthesis, highlighting its potential in synthesis planning.

<p class="mathjax">We study the fundamental problem of the construction of optimal randomization
in Differential Privacy. Depending on the clipping strategy or additional
properties of the processing function, the corresponding sensitivity set
theoretically determines the necessary randomization to produce the required
security parameters. Towards the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff, finding the
minimal perturbation for properly-selected sensitivity sets stands as a central
problem in DP research. In practice, l_2/l_1-norm clippings with
Gaussian/Laplace noise mechanisms are among the most common setups. However,
they also suffer from the curse of dimensionality. For more generic clipping
strategies, the understanding of the optimal noise for a high-dimensional
sensitivity set remains limited.
<br />In this paper, we revisit the geometry of high-dimensional sensitivity sets
and present a series of results to characterize the non-asymptotically optimal
Gaussian noise for R\'enyi DP (RDP). Our results are both negative and
positive: on one hand, we show the curse of dimensionality is tight for a broad
class of sensitivity sets satisfying certain symmetry properties; but if,
fortunately, the representation of the sensitivity set is asymmetric on some
group of orthogonal bases, we show the optimal noise bounds need not be
explicitly dependent on either dimension or rank. We also revisit sampling in
the high-dimensional scenario, which is the key for both privacy amplification
and computation efficiency in large-scale data processing. We propose a novel
method, termed twice sampling, which implements both sample-wise and
coordinate-wise sampling, to enable Gaussian noises to fit the sensitivity
geometry more closely. With closed-form RDP analysis, we prove twice sampling
produces asymptotic improvement of the privacy amplification given an
additional infinity-norm restriction, especially for small sampling rate.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) being developed these days rely on various sensor
technologies to sense and perceive the world around them. The sensor outputs
are subsequently used by the Automated Driving System (ADS) onboard the vehicle
to make decisions that affect its trajectory and how it interacts with the
physical world. The main sensor technologies being utilized for sensing and
perception (S&amp;P) are LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), camera, RADAR (Radio
Detection and Ranging), and ultrasound. Different environmental parameters
would have different effects on the performance of each sensor, thereby
affecting the S&amp;P and decision-making (DM) of an AV. In this publication, we
explore the effects of different environmental parameters on LiDARs and
cameras, leading us to conduct a study to better understand the impact of
several of these parameters on LiDAR performance. From the experiments
undertaken, the goal is to identify some of the weaknesses and challenges that
a LiDAR may face when an AV is using it. This informs AV regulators in
Singapore of the effects of different environmental parameters on AV sensors so
that they can determine testing standards and specifications which will assess
the adequacy of LiDAR systems installed for local AV operations more robustly.
Our approach adopts the LiDAR test methodology first developed in the Urban
Mobility Grand Challenge (UMGC-L010) White Paper on LiDAR performance against
selected Automotive Paints.

<p class="mathjax">We present new learning dynamics combining (independent) log-linear learning
and value iteration for stochastic games within the auxiliary stage game
framework. The dynamics presented provably attain the efficient equilibrium
(also known as optimal equilibrium) in identical-interest stochastic games,
beyond the recent concentration of progress on provable convergence to some
(possibly inefficient) equilibrium. The dynamics are also independent in the
sense that agents take actions consistent with their local viewpoint to a
reasonable extent rather than seeking equilibrium. These aspects can be of
practical interest in the control applications of intelligent and autonomous
systems. The key challenges are the convergence to an inefficient equilibrium
and the non-stationarity of the environment from a single agent's viewpoint due
to the adaptation of others. The log-linear update plays an important role in
addressing the former. We address the latter through the play-in-episodes
scheme in which the agents update their Q-function estimates only at the end of
the episodes.

<p class="mathjax">Recent Transformer-based visual tracking models have showcased superior
performance. Nevertheless, prior works have been resource-intensive, requiring
prolonged GPU training hours and incurring high GFLOPs during inference due to
inefficient training methods and convolution-based target heads. This intensive
resource use renders them unsuitable for real-world applications. In this
paper, we present DETRack, a streamlined end-to-end visual object tracking
framework. Our framework utilizes an efficient encoder-decoder structure where
the deformable transformer decoder acting as a target head, achieves higher
sparsity than traditional convolution heads, resulting in decreased GFLOPs. For
training, we introduce a novel one-to-many label assignment and an auxiliary
denoising technique, significantly accelerating model's convergence.
Comprehensive experiments affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed method. For instance, DETRack achieves 72.9% AO on challenging GOT-10k
benchmarks using only 20% of the training epochs required by the baseline, and
runs with lower GFLOPs than all the transformer-based trackers.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel paradigm that simplifies the visualization and analysis
of data that have a spatially/temporally varying frame of reference. The
primary application driver is tokamak fusion plasma, where science variables
(e.g., density and temperature) are interpolated in a complex magnetic
field-line-following coordinate system. We also see a similar challenge in
rotational fluid mechanics, cosmology, and Lagrangian ocean analysis; such
physics implies a deforming spacetime and induces high complexity in volume
rendering, isosurfacing, and feature tracking, among various visualization
tasks. Without loss of generality, this paper proposes an algorithm to build a
simplicial complex -- a tetrahedral mesh, for the deforming 3D spacetime
derived from two 2D triangular meshes representing consecutive timesteps.
Without introducing new nodes, the resulting mesh fills the gap between 2D
meshes with tetrahedral cells while satisfying given constraints on how nodes
connect between the two input meshes. In the algorithm we first divide the
spacetime into smaller partitions to reduce complexity based on the input
geometries and constraints. We then independently search for a feasible
tessellation of each partition taking nonconvexity into consideration. We
demonstrate multiple use cases for a simplified visualization analysis scheme
with a synthetic case and fusion plasma applications.

<p class="mathjax">Vector processing has become commonplace in today's CPU microarchitectures.
Vector instructions improve performance and energy which is crucial for
resource-constraint mobile devices. The research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark suite to study the benefits of vector processing for
mobile devices. This paper presents Swan-an extensive vector processing
benchmark suite for mobile applications. Swan consists of a diverse set of
data-parallel workloads from four commonly used mobile applications: operating
system, web browser, audio/video messaging application, and PDF rendering
engine. Using Swan benchmark suite, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
performance, power, and energy consumption of vectorized workloads, and show
that: (a) Vectorized kernels increase the pressure on cache hierarchy due to
the higher rate of memory requests. (b) Vector processing is more beneficial
for workloads with lower precision operations and higher cache hit rates. (c)
Limited Instruction-Level Parallelism and strided memory accesses to
multi-dimensional data structures prevent vector processing benefits from
scaling with more SIMD functional units and wider registers. (d) Despite lower
computation throughput than domain-specific accelerators, such as GPU, vector
processing outperforms these accelerators for kernels with lower operation
counts. Finally, we show five common computation patterns in mobile
data-parallel workloads that dominate the execution time.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies have verified that equivariant methods can significantly
improve the data efficiency, generalizability, and robustness in robot
learning. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion-based generative modeling has recently
gained significant attention as a promising approach for robotic manipulation
learning from demonstrations with stochastic behaviors. In this paper, we
present Diffusion-EDFs, a novel approach that incorporates spatial
roto-translation equivariance, i.e., SE(3)-equivariance to diffusion generative
modeling. By integrating SE(3)-equivariance into our model architectures, we
demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits remarkable data efficiency,
requiring only 5 to 10 task demonstrations for effective end-to-end training.
Furthermore, our approach showcases superior generalizability compared to
previous diffusion-based manipulation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent metasurface has recently emerged as a promising technology that
enables the customization of wireless environments by harnessing large numbers
of inexpensive configurable scattering elements. However, prior studies have
predominantly focused on single-layer metasurfaces, which have limitations in
terms of the number of beam patterns they can steer accurately due to practical
hardware restrictions. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel stacked
intelligent metasurface (SIM) design. Specifically, we investigate the
integration of SIM into the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input
single-output (MISO) communication system, where a SIM, consisting of a
multilayer metasurface structure, is deployed at the base station (BS) to
facilitate transmit beamforming in the electromagnetic wave domain. This
eliminates the need for conventional digital beamforming and high-resolution
digital-to-analog converters at the BS. To this end, we formulate an
optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of all user equipments
by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the
wave-based beamforming at the SIM, subject to both the transmit power budget
and discrete phase shift constraints. Furthermore, we propose a computationally
efficient algorithm for solving this joint optimization problem and elaborate
on the potential benefits of employing SIM in wireless networks. Finally, the
numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-enabled
wave-based beamforming design and evaluate the performance improvement achieved
by the proposed algorithm compared to various benchmark schemes. It is
demonstrated that considering the same number of transmit antennas, the
proposed SIM-based system achieves about 200\% improvement in terms of sum rate
compared to conventional MISO systems.

is grounding words and phrases to image regions. However, observing this
grounding in contemporary models is complex, even if it is generally expected
to take place if the task is addressed in a way that is conductive to
generalization. We propose a framework to jointly study task performance and
phrase grounding, and propose three benchmarks to study the relation between

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays social media is the primary platform for people to obtain news and
share information. Combating online fake news has become an urgent task to
reduce the damage it causes to society. Existing methods typically improve
their fake news detection performances by utilizing textual auxiliary
information (such as relevant retweets and comments) or simple structural
information (i.e., graph construction). However, these methods face two
challenges. First, an increasing number of users tend to directly forward the
source news without adding comments, resulting in a lack of textual auxiliary
information. Second, simple graphs are unable to extract complex relations
beyond pairwise association in a social context. Given that real-world social
networks are intricate and involve high-order relations, we argue that
exploring beyond pairwise relations between news and users is crucial for fake
news detection. Therefore, we propose constructing an attributed hypergraph to
represent non-textual and high-order relations for user participation in news
spreading. We also introduce a hypergraph neural network-based method called
Hy-DeFake to overcome the challenges. Our proposed method captures semantic
information from news content, credibility information from involved users, and
high-order correlations between news and users to learn distinctive embeddings
for fake news detection. The superiority of Hy-DeFake is demonstrated through
experiments conducted on four widely-used datasets, and it is compared against
six baselines using four evaluation metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Histology analysis of the tumor micro-environment integrated with genomic
assays is the gold standard for most cancers in modern medicine. This paper
proposes a Gene-induced Multimodal Pre-training (GiMP) framework, which jointly
incorporates genomics and Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for classification tasks.
Our work aims at dealing with the main challenges of multi-modality image-omic
classification w.r.t. (1) the patient-level feature extraction difficulties
from gigapixel WSIs and tens of thousands of genes, and (2) effective fusion
considering high-order relevance modeling. Concretely, we first propose a group
multi-head self-attention gene encoder to capture global structured features in
gene expression cohorts. We design a masked patch modeling paradigm (MPM) to
capture the latent pathological characteristics of different tissues. The mask
strategy is randomly masking a fixed-length contiguous subsequence of patch
embeddings of a WSI. Finally, we combine the classification tokens of paired
modalities and propose a triplet learning module to learn high-order relevance
and discriminative patient-level information.After pre-training, a simple
fine-tuning can be adopted to obtain the classification results. Experimental
results on the TCGA dataset show the superiority of our network architectures
and our pre-training framework, achieving 99.47% in accuracy for image-omic
classification. The code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) released for public use incorporate guardrails
to ensure their output is safe, often referred to as "model alignment." An
aligned language model should decline a user's request to produce harmful
content. However, such safety measures are vulnerable to adversarial prompts,
which contain maliciously designed token sequences to circumvent the model's
safety guards and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we
introduce erase-and-check, the first framework to defend against adversarial
prompts with verifiable safety guarantees. We erase tokens individually and
inspect the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our procedure labels
the input prompt as harmful if any subsequences or the input prompt are
detected as harmful by the filter. This guarantees that any adversarial
modification of a harmful prompt up to a certain size is also labeled harmful.
We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, which appends an
adversarial sequence at the end of the prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where
the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and
iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary
positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Empirical
results demonstrate that our technique obtains strong certified safety
guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good performance on safe
prompts. For example, against adversarial suffixes of length 20, it certifiably
detects 93% of the harmful prompts and labels 94% of the safe prompts as safe
using the open source language model Llama 2 as the safety filter.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on massive corpora exhibit remarkable
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, however, the attention given to
non-English languages has been limited in this field of research. To address
this gap and assess the proficiency of language models in the Korean language

history, and general knowledge. Our evaluation of language models on this
benchmark highlights the potential advantages of employing Large
Language-Specific Models(LLSMs) over a comprehensive, universal model like

<p class="mathjax">Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of
security attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly
implemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make
them susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT
forensics is thus needed for investigating and mitigating such attacks. While
many works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have
focused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper
reviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields.
Future prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also
highlighted. As demonstrated in the literature, most IoT devices are vulnerable
to attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users
could get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical
infrastructure. To fulfil the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be
used to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is
highly scalable and adaptable. Utilizing a blockchain-based authentication
mechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security
protection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to
develop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for
detecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should
consider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data
to develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate
academics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby
advancing the IoT field.

<p class="mathjax">The $k$-means is a popular clustering objective, although it is inherently
non-robust and sensitive to outliers. Its popular seeding or initialization
called $k$-means++ uses $D^{2}$ sampling and comes with a provable $O(\log k)$
approximation guarantee \cite{AV2007}. However, in the presence of adversarial
noise or outliers, $D^{2}$ sampling is more likely to pick centers from distant
outliers instead of inlier clusters, and therefore its approximation guarantees
\textit{w.r.t.} $k$-means solution on inliers, does not hold.
<br />Assuming that the outliers constitute a constant fraction of the given data,
we propose a simple variant in the $D^2$ sampling distribution, which makes it
robust to the outliers. Our algorithm runs in $O(ndk)$ time, outputs $O(k)$
clusters, discards marginally more points than the optimal number of outliers,
and comes with a provable $O(1)$ approximation guarantee.
<br />Our algorithm can also be modified to output exactly $k$ clusters instead of
$O(k)$ clusters, while keeping its running time linear in $n$ and $d$. This is
an improvement over previous results for robust $k$-means based on LP
relaxation and rounding \cite{Charikar}, \cite{KrishnaswamyLS18} and
\textit{robust $k$-means++} \cite{DeshpandeKP20}. Our empirical results show
the advantage of our algorithm over $k$-means++~\cite{AV2007}, uniform random
seeding, greedy sampling for $k$ means~\cite{tkmeanspp}, and robust
$k$-means++~\cite{DeshpandeKP20}, on standard real-world and synthetic data
sets used in previous work. Our proposal is easily amenable to scalable,
faster, parallel implementations of $k$-means++ \cite{Bahmani,BachemL017} and
is of independent interest for coreset constructions in the presence of
outliers \cite{feldman2007ptas,langberg2010universal,feldman2011unified}.

<p class="mathjax">Symmetry, a fundamental concept to understand our environment, often
oversimplifies reality from a mathematical perspective. Humans are a prime
example, deviating from perfect symmetry in terms of appearance and cognitive
biases (e.g. having a dominant hand). Nevertheless, our brain can easily
overcome these imperfections and efficiently adapt to symmetrical tasks. The
driving motivation behind this work lies in capturing this ability through
reinforcement learning. To this end, we introduce Adaptive Symmetry Learning
(ASL) $\unicode{x2013}$ a model-minimization actor-critic extension that
addresses incomplete or inexact symmetry descriptions by adapting itself during
the learning process. ASL consists of a symmetry fitting component and a
modular loss function that enforces a common symmetric relation across all
states while adapting to the learned policy. The performance of ASL is compared
to existing symmetry-enhanced methods in a case study involving a four-legged
ant model for multidirectional locomotion tasks. The results demonstrate that
ASL is capable of recovering from large perturbations and generalizing
knowledge to hidden symmetric states. It achieves comparable or better
performance than alternative methods in most scenarios, making it a valuable
approach for leveraging model symmetry while compensating for inherent
perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) enables the development of computer models that are
capable of learning, visualizing, optimizing, refining, and predicting data. In
recent years, DL has been applied in a range of fields, including audio-visual
data processing, agriculture, transportation prediction, natural language,
biomedicine, disaster management, bioinformatics, drug design, genomics, face
recognition, and ecology. To explore the current state of deep learning, it is
necessary to investigate the latest developments and applications of deep
learning in these disciplines. However, the literature is lacking in exploring
the applications of deep learning in all potential sectors. This paper thus
extensively investigates the potential applications of deep learning across all
major fields of study as well as the associated benefits and challenges. As
evidenced in the literature, DL exhibits accuracy in prediction and analysis,
makes it a powerful computational tool, and has the ability to articulate
itself and optimize, making it effective in processing data with no prior
training. Given its independence from training data, deep learning necessitates
massive amounts of data for effective analysis and processing, much like data
volume. To handle the challenge of compiling huge amounts of medical,
scientific, healthcare, and environmental data for use in deep learning, gated
architectures like LSTMs and GRUs can be utilized. For multimodal learning,
shared neurons in the neural network for all activities and specialized neurons
for particular tasks are necessary.

<p class="mathjax">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder affecting
approximately one billion people world-wide. The current gold standard for
diagnosing OSA, Polysomnography (PSG), involves an overnight hospital stay with
multiple attached sensors, leading to potential inaccuracies due to the
first-night effect. To address this, we present SlAction, a non-intrusive OSA
detection system for daily sleep environments using infrared videos.
Recognizing that sleep videos exhibit minimal motion, this work investigates
the fundamental question: "Are respiratory events adequately reflected in human
motions during sleep?" Analyzing the largest sleep video dataset of 5,098
hours, we establish correlations between OSA events and human motions during
sleep. Our approach uses a low frame rate (2.5 FPS), a large size (60 seconds)
and step (30 seconds) for sliding window analysis to capture slow and long-term
motions related to OSA. Furthermore, we utilize a lightweight deep neural
network for resource-constrained devices, ensuring all video streams are
processed locally without compromising privacy. Evaluations show that SlAction
achieves an average F1 score of 87.6% in detecting OSA across various
environments. Implementing SlAction on NVIDIA Jetson Nano enables real-time
inference (~3 seconds for a 60-second video clip), highlighting its potential
for early detection and personalized treatment of OSA.

<p class="mathjax">Recent mainstream masked distillation methods function by reconstructing
selectively masked areas of a student network from the feature map of its
teacher counterpart. In these methods, the masked regions need to be properly
selected, such that reconstructed features encode sufficient discrimination and
representation capability like the teacher feature. However, previous masked
distillation methods only focus on spatial masking, making the resulting masked
areas biased towards spatial importance without encoding informative channel
clues. In this study, we devise a Dual Masked Knowledge Distillation (DMKD)
framework which can capture both spatially important and channel-wise
informative clues for comprehensive masked feature reconstruction. More
specifically, we employ dual attention mechanism for guiding the respective
masking branches, leading to reconstructed feature encoding dual significance.
Furthermore, fusing the reconstructed features is achieved by self-adjustable
weighting strategy for effective feature distillation. Our experiments on
object detection task demonstrate that the student networks achieve performance
gains of 4.1% and 4.3% with the help of our method when RetinaNet and Cascade
Mask R-CNN are respectively used as the teacher networks, while outperforming
the other state-of-the-art distillation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Gestures serve as a fundamental and significant mode of non-verbal
communication among humans. Deictic gestures (such as pointing towards an
object), in particular, offer valuable means of efficiently expressing intent
in situations where language is inaccessible, restricted, or highly
specialized. As a result, it is essential for robots to comprehend gestures in
order to infer human intentions and establish more effective coordination with
them. Prior work often rely on a rigid hand-coded library of gestures along
with their meanings. However, interpretation of gestures is often
context-dependent, requiring more flexibility and common-sense reasoning. In
this work, we propose a framework, GIRAF, for more flexibly interpreting
gesture and language instructions by leveraging the power of large language
models. Our framework is able to accurately infer human intent and
contextualize the meaning of their gestures for more effective human-robot
collaboration. We instantiate the framework for interpreting deictic gestures
in table-top manipulation tasks and demonstrate that it is both effective and
preferred by users, achieving 70% higher success rates than the baseline. We
further demonstrate GIRAF's ability on reasoning about diverse types of
gestures by curating a GestureInstruct dataset consisting of 36 different task
scenarios. GIRAF achieved 81% success rate on finding the correct plan for
tasks in GestureInstruct. Website: https://tinyurl.com/giraf23

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) with linear temporal logic (LTL) objectives can
allow robots to carry out symbolic event plans in unknown environments. Most
existing methods assume that the event detector can accurately map
environmental states to symbolic events; however, uncertainty is inevitable for
real-world event detectors. Such uncertainty in an event detector generates
multiple branching possibilities on LTL instructions, confusing action
decisions. Moreover, the queries to the uncertain event detector, necessary for
the task's progress, may increase the uncertainty further. To cope with those
issues, we propose an RL framework, Learning Action and Query over Belief LTL
(LAQBL), to learn an agent that can consider the diversity of LTL instructions
due to uncertain event detection while avoiding task failure due to the
unnecessary event-detection query. Our framework simultaneously learns 1) an
embedding of belief LTL, which is multiple branching possibilities on LTL
instructions using a graph neural network, 2) an action policy, and 3) a query
policy which decides whether or not to query for the event detector.
Simulations in a 2D grid world and image-input robotic inspection environments
show that our method successfully learns actions to follow LTL instructions
even with uncertain event detectors.

<p class="mathjax">Ontologies are traditionally expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL),
that provides a syntax for expressing taxonomies with axioms regulating class
membership. The semantics of OWL, based on Description Logic (DL), allows for
the use of automated reasoning to check the consistency of ontologies, perform
classification, and to answer DL queries. However, the open world assumption of
OWL, along with limitations in its expressiveness, makes OWL less suitable for
modelling rules and regulations, used in public administration. In such cases,
it is desirable to have closed world semantics and a rule-based engine to check
compliance with regulations. In this paper we describe and discuss data model
management using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), for concept modelling
of concrete requirements in regulation documents within the public sector. We
show how complex regulations, often containing a number of alternative
requirements, can be expressed as constraints, and the utility of SHACL engines
in verification of instance data against the SHACL model. We discuss benefits
of modelling with SHACL, compared to OWL, and demonstrate the maintainability
of the SHACL model by domain experts without prior knowledge of ontology
management.

<p class="mathjax">Offensive language detection has been well studied in many languages, but it
is lagging behind in low-resource languages, such as Hebrew. In this paper, we
present a new offensive language corpus in Hebrew. A total of 15,881 tweets
were retrieved from Twitter. Each was labeled with one or more of five classes
(abusive, hate, violence, pornographic, or none offensive) by Arabic-Hebrew
bilingual speakers. The annotation process was challenging as each annotator is
expected to be familiar with the Israeli culture, politics, and practices to
understand the context of each tweet. We fine-tuned two Hebrew BERT models,
HeBERT and AlephBERT, using our proposed dataset and another published dataset.
We observed that our data boosts HeBERT performance by 2% when combined with
D_OLaH. Fine-tuning AlephBERT on our data and testing on D_OLaH yields 69%
accuracy, while fine-tuning on D_OLaH and testing on our data yields 57%
accuracy, which may be an indication to the generalizability our data offers.

<p class="mathjax">Hypothetical induction is recognized as the main reasoning type when
scientists make observations about the world and try to propose hypotheses to
explain those observations. Past research on hypothetical induction has a
limited setting that (1) the observation annotations of the dataset are not raw
web corpus but are manually selected sentences (resulting in a close-domain
setting); and (2) the ground truth hypotheses annotations are mostly
commonsense knowledge, making the task less challenging. In this work, we
propose the first NLP dataset for social science academic hypotheses discovery,
consisting of 50 recent papers published in top social science journals. Raw
web corpora that are necessary for developing hypotheses in the published
papers are also collected in the dataset, with the final goal of creating a
system that automatically generates valid, novel, and helpful (to human
researchers) hypotheses, given only a pile of raw web corpora. The new dataset
can tackle the previous problems because it requires to (1) use raw web corpora
as observations; and (2) propose hypotheses even new to humanity. A
multi-module framework is developed for the task, as well as three different
feedback mechanisms that empirically show performance gain over the base
framework. Finally, our framework exhibits high performance in terms of both
GPT-4 based evaluation and social science expert evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT has gained significant interest due to its impressive performance,
but people are increasingly concerned about its potential risks, particularly
around the detection of AI-generated content (AIGC), which is often difficult
for untrained humans to identify. Current datasets utilized for detecting
ChatGPT-generated text primarily center around question-answering, yet they
tend to disregard tasks that possess semantic-invariant properties, such as
summarization, translation, and paraphrasing. Our primary studies demonstrate
that detecting model-generated text on semantic-invariant tasks is more
difficult. To fill this gap, we introduce a more extensive and comprehensive
dataset that considers more types of tasks than previous work, including
semantic-invariant tasks. In addition, the model after a large number of task
instruction fine-tuning shows a strong powerful performance. Owing to its
previous success, we further instruct fine-tuning Tk-instruct and built a more
powerful detection system. Experimental results show that our proposed detector
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art RoBERTa-based detector.

<p class="mathjax">In this draft, fault diagnosis in nonlinear dynamic systems is addressed. The
objective of this work is to establish a framework, in which not only
model-based but also data-driven and machine learning based fault diagnosis
strategies can be uniformly handled. Instead of the well-established
input-output and the associated state space models, stable image and kernel
representations are adopted in our work as the basic process model forms. Based
on it, the nominal system dynamics can then be modelled as a lower-dimensional
manifold embedded in the process data space. To achieve a reliable fault
detection as a classification problem, projection technique is a capable tool.
For nonlinear dynamic systems, we propose to construct projection systems in
the well-established framework of Hamiltonian systems and by means of the
normalised image and kernel representations. For nonlinear dynamic systems,
process data form a non-Euclidean space. Consequently, the norm-based distance
defined in Hilbert space is not suitable to measure the distance from a data
vector to the manifold of the nominal dynamics. To deal with this issue, we
propose to use a Bregman divergence, a measure of difference between two points
in a space, as a solution. Moreover, for our purpose of achieving a
performance-oriented fault detection, the Bregman divergences adopted in our
work are defined by Hamiltonian functions. This scheme not only enables to
realise the performance-oriented fault detection, but also uncovers the
information geometric aspect of our work. The last part of our work is devoted
to the kernel representation based fault detection and uncertainty estimation
that can be equivalently used for fault estimation. It is demonstrated that the
projection onto the manifold of uncertainty data, together with the
correspondingly defined Bregman divergence, is also capable for fault
detection.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the boundedness of the Disturbance Observer (DO) for
linear discrete-time systems. In contrast to previous studies that focus on
analyzing and/or designing observer gains, our analysis and synthesis approach
is based on a set-membership viewpoint. From this viewpoint, a necessary and
sufficient existence condition of bounded DOs is first established, which can
be easily verified. Furthermore, a set-membership filter-based DO is developed,
and its completeness is proved; thus, our proposed DO is bounded if and only if
bounded DOs exist. We also prove that the proposed DO has the capability to
achieve the worst-case optimality, which can provide a benchmark for the design
of DOs. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the
effectiveness of the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Neural based approaches to automatic evaluation of subjective responses have
shown superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional rule-based
and feature engineering oriented solutions. However, it remains unclear whether
the suggested neural solutions are sufficient replacements of human raters as
we find recent works do not properly account for rubric items that are
essential for automated essay scoring during model training and validation. In
this paper, we propose a series of data augmentation operations that train and
test an automated scoring model to learn features and functions overlooked by
previous works while still achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Automated Student Assessment Prize dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate segmentation of clustered microcalcifications in mammography is
crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Despite exhibiting
expert-level accuracy, recent deep learning advancements in medical image
segmentation provide insufficient contribution to practical applications, due
to the domain shift resulting from differences in patient postures, individual
gland density, and imaging modalities of mammography etc. In this paper, a
novel framework named MLN-net, which can accurately segment multi-source images
using only single source images, is proposed for clustered microcalcification
segmentation. We first propose a source domain image augmentation method to
generate multi-source images, leading to improved generalization. And a
structure of multiple layer normalization (LN) layers is used to construct the
segmentation network, which can be found efficient for clustered
microcalcification segmentation in different domains. Additionally, a branch
selection strategy is designed for measuring the similarity of the source
domain data and the target domain data. To validate the proposed MLN-net,
extensive analyses including ablation experiments are performed, comparison of
12 baseline methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
MLN-net in segmenting clustered microcalcifications from different domains and
the its segmentation accuracy surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code will be
available at https://github.com/yezanting/MLN-NET-VERSON1.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of autonomous mobile robots, safe navigation through unpaved
outdoor environments remains a challenging task. Due to the high-dimensional
nature of sensor data, extracting relevant information becomes a complex
problem, which hinders adequate perception and path planning. Previous works
have shown promising performances in extracting global features from full-sized
images. However, they often face challenges in capturing essential local
information. In this paper, we propose Crop-LSTM, which iteratively takes
cropped image patches around the current robot's position and predicts the
future position, orientation, and bumpiness. Our method performs local feature
extraction by paying attention to corresponding image patches along the
predicted robot trajectory in the 2D image plane. This enables more accurate
predictions of the robot's future trajectory. With our wheeled mobile robot
platform Raicart, we demonstrated the effectiveness of Crop-LSTM for point-goal
navigation in an unpaved outdoor environment. Our method enabled safe and
robust navigation using RGBD images in challenging unpaved outdoor terrains.

<p class="mathjax">Deterministic synchronous systems consisting of two finite automata running
in opposite directions on a shared read-only input are studied with respect to
their ability to perform reversible computations, which means that the automata
are also backward deterministic and, thus, are able to uniquely step the
computation back and forth. We study the computational capacity of such devices
and obtain on the one hand that there are regular languages that cannot be
accepted by such systems. On the other hand, such systems can accept even
non-semilinear languages. Since the systems communicate by sending messages, we
consider also systems where the number of messages sent during a computation is
restricted. We obtain a finite hierarchy with respect to the allowed amount of
communication inside the reversible classes and separations to general, not
necessarily reversible, classes. Finally, we study closure properties and
decidability questions and obtain that the questions of emptiness, finiteness,
inclusion, and equivalence are not semidecidable if a superlogarithmic amount
of communication is allowed.

represented by Boolean and alternating finite automata. We get tight upper
bounds m+n and m+n+1 for union, intersection, and difference, 2^m+n and 2^m+n+1

<p class="mathjax">Time series classification (TSC) has emerged as a critical task in various
domains, and deep neural models have shown superior performance in TSC tasks.
However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where subtle
perturbations can significantly impact the prediction results. Existing
adversarial methods often suffer from over-parameterization or random logit
perturbation, hindering their effectiveness. Additionally, increasing the
attack success rate (ASR) typically involves generating more noise, making the
attack more easily detectable. To address these limitations, we propose SWAP, a
novel attacking method for TSC models. SWAP focuses on enhancing the confidence
of the second-ranked logits while minimizing the manipulation of other logits.
This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
target logit distribution and the predictive logit distribution. Experimental
results demonstrate that SWAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an
ASR exceeding 50% and an 18% increase compared to existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">We present a system for non-prehensile manipulation that require a
significant number of contact mode transitions and the use of environmental
contacts to successfully manipulate an object to a target location. Our method
is based on deep reinforcement learning which, unlike state-of-the-art planning
algorithms, does not require apriori knowledge of the physical parameters of
the object or environment such as friction coefficients or centers of mass. The
planning time is reduced to the simple feed-forward prediction time on a neural
network. We propose a computational structure, action space design, and
curriculum learning scheme that facilitates efficient exploration and
sim-to-real transfer. In challenging real-world non-prehensile manipulation
tasks, we show that our method can generalize over different objects, and
succeed even for novel objects not seen during training. Project website:

<p class="mathjax">Graph-controlled insertion-deletion (GCID) systems are regulated extensions
of insertion-deletion systems. Such a system has several components and each
component contains some insertion-deletion rules. The components are the
vertices of a directed control graph. A rule is applied to a string in a
component and the resultant string is moved to the target component specified
in the rule. The language of the system is the set of all terminal strings
collected in the final component. We impose the restriction in the structure of
the underlying graph to be a star structure where there is a central, control
component which acts like a master and transmits a string (after applying one
of its rules) to one of the components specified in the (applied) rule. A
component which receives the string can process the obtained string with any
applicable rule available in it and sends back the resultant string only to the
center component. With this restriction, we obtain computational completeness
for some descriptional complexity measures

<p class="mathjax">Reversible computing is a new paradigm that has emerged recently and extends
the traditional forwards-only computing mode with the ability to execute in
backwards, so that computation can run in reverse as easily as in forward. Two
approaches to developing transition system (automaton-like) semantics for event
structure models are distinguished in the literature. In the first case, states
are considered as configurations (sets of already executed events), and
transitions between states are built by starting from the initial configuration
and repeatedly adding executable events. In the second approach, states are
understood as residuals (model fragments that have not yet been executed), and
transitions are constructed by starting from the given event structure as the
initial state and deleting already executed (and conflicting) parts thereof
during execution. The present paper focuses on an investigation of how the two
approaches are interrelated for the model of prime event structures extended
with cause-respecting reversibility. The bisimilarity of the resulting
transition systems is proved, taking into account step semantics of the model
under consideration.

<p class="mathjax">The study of the operational complexity of minimal pumping constants started
in [J. DASSOW and I. JECKER. Operational complexity and pumping lemmas. Acta
Inform., 59:337-355, 2022], where an almost complete picture of the operational
complexity of minimal pumping constants for two different variants of pumping
lemmata from the literature was given. We continue this research by considering
a pumping lemma for regular languages that allows pumping of sub-words at any
position of the considered word, if the sub-word is long enough [S. J. SAVITCH.
Abstract Machines and Grammars. 1982]. First we improve on the simultaneous
regulation of minimal pumping constants induced by different pumping lemmata
including Savitch's pumping lemma. In this way we are able to simultaneously
regulate four different minimal pumping constants. This is a novel result in
the field of descriptional complexity. Moreover, for Savitch's pumping lemma we
are able to completely classify the range of the minimal pumping constant for
the operations Kleene star, reversal, complement, prefix- and suffix-closure,
union, set-subtraction, concatenation, intersection, and symmetric difference.
In this way, we also solve some of the open problems from the paper that
initiated the study of the operational complexity of minimal pumping constants
mentioned above.

<p class="mathjax">Pumping lemmata are the main tool to prove that a certain language does not
belong to a class of languages like the recognizable languages or the
context-free languages. Essentially two pumping lemmata exist for the
recognizable weighted languages: the classical one for the Boolean semiring
(i.e., the unweighted case), which can be generalized to zero-sum free
semirings, and the one for fields. A joint generalization of these two pumping
lemmata is provided that applies to all Artinian semirings, over which all
finitely generated semimodules have a finite bound on the length of chains of
strictly increasing subsemimodules. Since Artinian rings are exactly those that
satisfy the Descending Chain Condition, the Artinian semirings include all
fields and naturally also all finite semirings (like the Boolean semiring). The
new pumping lemma thus covers most previously known pumping lemmata for
recognizable weighted languages.

<p class="mathjax">Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata with translucent letters
were introduced by Nagy and Otto more than a decade ago as Cooperative
Distributed systems of a kind of stateless restarting automata with window size
one. These finite state machines have a surprisingly large expressive power:
all commutative semi-linear languages and all rational trace languages can be
accepted by them including various not context-free languages. While the
nondeterministic variant defines a language class with nice closure properties,
the deterministic variant is weaker, however it contains all regular languages,
some non-regular context-free languages, as the Dyck language, and also some
languages that are not even context-free. In all those models for each state,
the letters of the alphabet could be in one of the following categories: the
automaton cannot see the letter (it is translucent), there is a transition
defined on the letter (maybe more than one transitions in nondeterministic
case) or none of the above categories (the automaton gets stuck by seeing this
letter at the given state and this computation is not accepting).
<br />State-deterministic automata are recent models, where the next state of the
computation determined by the structure of the automata and it is independent
of the processed letters. In this paper our aim is twofold, on the one hand, we
investigate state-deterministic finite automata with translucent letters. These
automata are specially restricted deterministic finite automata with
translucent letters.
<br />In the other novel model we present, it is allowed that for a state the set
of translucent letters and the set of letters for which transition is defined
are not disjoint. One can interpret this fact that the automaton has a
nondeterministic choice for each occurrence of such letters to see them (and
then erase and make the transition) or not to see that occurrence at that time.
Based on these semi-translucent letters, the expressive power of the automata
increases, i.e., in this way a proper generalization of the previous models is
obtained.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the equational theory of Kleene algebra terms with variable
complements -- (language) complement where it applies only to variables --
w.r.t. languages. While the equational theory w.r.t. languages coincides with
the language equivalence (under the standard language valuation) for Kleene
algebra terms, this coincidence is broken if we extend the terms with
complements. In this paper, we prove the decidability of some fragments of the
equational theory: the universality problem is coNP-complete, and the
inequational theory t &lt;= s is coNP-complete when t does not contain
Kleene-star. To this end, we introduce words-to-letters valuations; they are
sufficient valuations for the equational theory and ease us in investigating
the equational theory w.r.t. languages. Additionally, we prove that for words
with variable complements, the equational theory coincides with the word
equivalence.

<p class="mathjax">The HOM-problem, which asks whether the image of a regular tree language
under a tree homomorphism is again regular, is known to be decidable by [Godoy,
Gim\'enez, Ramos, \`Alvarez: The HOM problem is decidable. STOC (2010)].
Research on the weighted version of this problem, however, is still in its
infancy since it requires customized investigations. In this paper we address
the weighted HOM-problem and strive to keep the underlying semiring as general
as possible. In return, we restrict the input: We require the tree homomorphism
h to be tetris-free, a condition weaker than injectivity, and for the given
weighted tree automaton, we propose an ambiguity notion with respect to h.
These assumptions suffice to ensure decidability of the thus restricted
HOM-problem for all zero-sum free semirings by allowing us to reduce it to the
(decidable) unweighted case.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved significant
developments in a variety of graph analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN's
superior performance will suffer from serious damage when the collected node
features or structure relationships are partially missing owning to numerous
unpredictable factors. Recently emerged graph completion learning (GCL) has
received increasing attention, which aims to reconstruct the missing node
features or structure relationships under the guidance of a specifically
supervised task. Although these proposed GCL methods have made great success,
they still exist the following problems: the reliance on labels, the bias of
the reconstructed node features and structure relationships. Besides, the
generalization ability of the existing GCL still faces a huge challenge when
both collected node features and structure relationships are partially missing
at the same time. To solve the above issues, we propose a more general GCL
framework with the aid of self-supervised learning for improving the task
performance of the existing GNN variants on graphs with features and structure
missing, termed unsupervised GCL (UGCL). Specifically, to avoid the mismatch
between missing node features and structure during the message-passing process
of GNN, we separate the feature reconstruction and structure reconstruction and
design its personalized model in turn. Then, a dual contrastive loss on the
structure level and feature level is introduced to maximize the mutual
information of node representations from feature reconstructing and structure
reconstructing paths for providing more supervision signals. Finally, the
reconstructed node features and structure can be applied to the downstream node
classification task. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, three GNN
variants and five missing rates demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">Single-tape nondeterministic Turing machines that are allowed to replace the
symbol in each tape cell only when it is scanned for the first time are also
known as 1-limited automata. These devices characterize, exactly as finite
automata, the class of regular languages. However, they can be extremely more
succinct. Indeed, in the worst case the size gap from 1-limited automata to
one-way deterministic finite automata is double exponential.
<br />Here we introduce two restricted versions of 1-limited automata, once-marking
1-limited automata and always-marking 1-limited automata, and study their
descriptional complexity. We prove that once-marking 1-limited automata still
exhibit a double exponential size gap to one-way deterministic finite automata.
However, their deterministic restriction is polynomially related in size to
two-way deterministic finite automata, in contrast to deterministic 1-limited
automata, whose equivalent two-way deterministic finite automata in the worst
case are exponentially larger. For always-marking 1-limited automata, we prove
that the size gap to one-way deterministic finite automata is only a single
exponential. The gap remains exponential even in the case the given machine is
deterministic.
<br />We obtain other size relationships between different variants of these
machines and finite automata and we present some problems that deserve
investigation.

long case-based and induction-based proofs of correctness can be replaced by
simply constructing a regular expression (or finite automaton) specifying the

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a general framework for measuring acoustic properties such as
liner time-invariant (LTI) response, signal-dependent time-invariant (SDTI)
component, and random and time-varying (RTV) component simultaneously using
structured periodic test signals. The framework also enables music pieces and
other sound materials as test signals by "safeguarding" them by adding slight
deterministic "noise." Measurement using swept-sin, MLS (Maxim Length
Sequence), and their variants are special cases of the proposed framework. We
implemented interactive and real-time measuring tools based on this framework
and made them open-source. Furthermore, we applied this framework to assess
pitch extractors objectively.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the leading approaches
for machine learning on graph-structured data. Despite their great success,
critical computational challenges such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and
limited expressive power continue to impact the performance of GNNs. In this
study, inspired from the time-reversal principle commonly utilized in classical
and quantum physics, we reverse the time direction of the graph heat equation.
The resulted reversing process yields a class of high pass filtering functions
that enhance the sharpness of graph node features. Leveraging this concept, we
introduce the Multi-Scaled Heat Kernel based GNN (MHKG) by amalgamating diverse
filtering functions' effects on node features. To explore more flexible
filtering conditions, we further generalize MHKG into a model termed G-MHKG and
thoroughly show the roles of each element in controlling over-smoothing,
over-squashing and expressive power. Notably, we illustrate that all
aforementioned issues can be characterized and analyzed via the properties of
the filtering functions, and uncover a trade-off between over-smoothing and
over-squashing: enhancing node feature sharpness will make model suffer more
from over-squashing, and vice versa. Furthermore, we manipulate the time again
to show how G-MHKG can handle both two issues under mild conditions. Our
conclusive experiments highlight the effectiveness of proposed models. It
surpasses several GNN baseline models in performance across graph datasets
characterized by both homophily and heterophily.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential optimization strategy that is
increasingly employed in a wide range of areas including materials design. In
real world applications, acquiring high-fidelity (HF) data through physical
experiments or HF simulations is the major cost component of BO. To alleviate
this bottleneck, multi-fidelity (MF) methods are used to forgo the sole
reliance on the expensive HF data and reduce the sampling costs by querying
inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) sources whose data are correlated with HF
samples. However, existing multi-fidelity BO (MFBO) methods operate under the
following two assumptions that rarely hold in practical applications: (1) LF
sources provide data that are well correlated with the HF data on a global
scale, and (2) a single random process can model the noise in the fused data.
These assumptions dramatically reduce the performance of MFBO when LF sources
are only locally correlated with the HF source or when the noise variance
varies across the data sources. In this paper, we dispense with these incorrect
assumptions by proposing an MF emulation method that (1) learns a noise model
for each data source, and (2) enables MFBO to leverage highly biased LF sources
which are only locally correlated with the HF source. We illustrate the
performance of our method through analytical examples and engineering problems
on materials design.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive results in code
generation. However, existing decoding strategies are designed for Natural
Language (NL) generation, overlooking the differences between NL and
programming languages (PL). Due to this oversight, a better decoding strategy
for code generation remains an open question. In this paper, we conduct the
first systematic study to explore a decoding strategy specialized in code
generation. With an analysis of loss distributions of code tokens, we find that
code tokens can be divided into two categories: challenging tokens that are
difficult to predict and confident tokens that can be easily inferred. Among
them, the challenging tokens mainly appear at the beginning of a code block.
Inspired by the above findings, we propose a simple yet effective method:
Adaptive Temperature (AdapT) sampling, which dynamically adjusts the
temperature coefficient when decoding different tokens. We apply a larger
temperature when sampling for challenging tokens, allowing LLMs to explore
diverse choices. We employ a smaller temperature for confident tokens avoiding
the influence of tail randomness noises. We apply AdapT sampling to LLMs with
different sizes and conduct evaluations on two popular datasets. Results show
that AdapT sampling significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decoding
strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has explored the utilization of pre-trained text-image
discriminative models, such as CLIP, to tackle the challenges associated with
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. However, it is worth noting that the
alignment process based on contrastive learning employed by these models may
unintentionally result in the loss of crucial localization information and
object completeness, which are essential for achieving accurate semantic
segmentation. More recently, there has been an emerging interest in extending
the application of diffusion models beyond text-to-image generation tasks,
particularly in the domain of semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize
diffusion models either for generating annotated data or for extracting
features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves training
segmentation models by generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or
incorporating additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the
potential of generative text-to-image conditional diffusion models as highly
efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel
training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. Specifically, by feeding an input
image and candidate classes into an off-the-shelf pre-trained conditional
latent diffusion model, the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising
U-Net are directly used as segmentation scores, which are further refined and
completed by the followed self-attention maps. Additionally, we carefully
design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further
enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new approach to 3D reconstruction from sequences of images
acquired by monocular endoscopes. It is based on two key insights. First,
endoluminal cavities are watertight, a property naturally enforced by modeling
them in terms of a signed distance function. Second, the scene illumination is
variable. It comes from the endoscope's light sources and decays with the
inverse of the squared distance to the surface. To exploit these insights, we
build on NeuS, a neural implicit surface reconstruction technique with an
outstanding capability to learn appearance and a SDF surface model from
multiple views, but currently limited to scenes with static illumination. To
remove this limitation and exploit the relation between pixel brightness and
depth, we modify the NeuS architecture to explicitly account for it and
introduce a calibrated photometric model of the endoscope's camera and light
source. Our method is the first one to produce watertight reconstructions of
whole colon sections. We demonstrate excellent accuracy on phantom imagery.
Remarkably, the watertight prior combined with illumination decline, allows to
complete the reconstruction of unseen portions of the surface with acceptable
accuracy, paving the way to automatic quality assessment of cancer screening
explorations, measuring the global percentage of observed mucosa.

<p class="mathjax">Integrating contact-awareness into a soft snake robot and efficiently
controlling its locomotion in response to contact information present
significant challenges. This paper aims to solve contact-aware locomotion
problem of a soft snake robot through developing bio-inspired contact-aware
locomotion controllers. To provide effective contact information for the
controllers, we develop a scale covered sensor structure mimicking natural
snakes' \textit{scale sensilla}. In the design of control framework, our core
contribution is the development of a novel sensory feedback mechanism of the
Matsuoka central pattern generator (CPG) network. This mechanism allows the
Matsuoka CPG system to work like a "spine cord" in the whole contact-aware
control scheme, which simultaneously takes the stimuli including tonic input
signals from the "brain" (a goal-tracking locomotion controller) and sensory
feedback signals from the "reflex arc" (the contact reactive controller), and
generate rhythmic signals to effectively actuate the soft snake robot to
slither through densely allocated obstacles. In the design of the "reflex arc",
we develop two types of reactive controllers -- 1) a reinforcement learning
(RL) sensor regulator that learns to manipulate the sensory feedback inputs of
the CPG system, and 2) a local reflexive sensor-CPG network that directly
connects sensor readings and the CPG's feedback inputs in a special topology.
These two reactive controllers respectively facilitate two different
contact-aware locomotion control schemes. The two control schemes are tested
and evaluated in the soft snake robot, showing promising performance in the
contact-aware locomotion tasks. The experimental results also further verify
the benefit of Matsuoka CPG system in bio-inspired robot controller design.

<p class="mathjax">As the size of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow, model
compression without sacrificing accuracy has become a crucial challenge for
deployment. While some quantization methods, such as GPTQ, have made progress
in achieving acceptable 4-bit weight-only quantization, attempts at lower bit
quantization often result in severe performance degradation. In this paper, we
introduce a technique called norm tweaking, which can be used as a plugin in
current PTQ methods to achieve high precision while being cost-efficient. Our
approach is inspired by the observation that rectifying the quantized
activation distribution to match its float counterpart can readily restore
accuracy for LLMs. To achieve this, we carefully design a tweaking strategy
that includes calibration data generation and channel-wise distance constraint
to update the weights of normalization layers for better generalization. We
conduct extensive experiments on various datasets using several open-sourced
LLMs. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both weight-only
quantization and joint quantization of weights and activations, surpassing
existing PTQ methods. On GLM-130B and OPT-66B, our method even achieves the
same level of accuracy at 2-bit quantization as their float ones. Our simple
and effective approach makes it more practical for real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses a critical challenge in cybersecurity: the gap between
vulnerability information represented by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs) and the resulting cyberattack actions. CVEs provide insights into
vulnerabilities, but often lack details on potential threat actions (tactics,
techniques, and procedures, or TTPs) within the ATT&amp;CK framework. This gap
hinders accurate CVE categorization and proactive countermeasure initiation.
The paper introduces the TTPpredictor tool, which uses innovative techniques to
analyze CVE descriptions and infer plausible TTP attacks resulting from CVE
exploitation. TTPpredictor overcomes challenges posed by limited labeled data
and semantic disparities between CVE and TTP descriptions. It initially
extracts threat actions from unstructured cyber threat reports using Semantic
Role Labeling (SRL) techniques. These actions, along with their contextual
attributes, are correlated with MITRE's attack functionality classes. This
automated correlation facilitates the creation of labeled data, essential for
categorizing novel threat actions into threat functionality classes and TTPs.
The paper presents an empirical assessment, demonstrating TTPpredictor's
effectiveness with accuracy rates of approximately 98% and F1-scores ranging
from 95% to 98% in precise CVE classification to ATT&amp;CK techniques.
TTPpredictor outperforms state-of-the-art language model tools like ChatGPT.
Overall, this paper offers a robust solution for linking CVEs to potential
attack techniques, enhancing cybersecurity practitioners' ability to
proactively identify and mitigate threats.

and a decoder). The encoder shares so-called latent representation, rather than
raw data, for model training. In mobile-edge computing, network functions (such
as traffic forecasting) can be trained via split learning where an encoder
resides in a user equipment (UE) and a decoder resides in the edge network.
Based on the data processing inequality and the information bottleneck (IB)
theory, we present a new framework and training mechanism to enable a dynamic
balancing of the transmission resource consumption with the informativeness of
the shared latent representations, which directly impacts the predictive
performance. The proposed training mechanism offers an encoder-decoder neural
network architecture featuring multiple modes of complexity-relevance
tradeoffs, enabling tunable performance. The adaptability can accommodate
varying real-time network conditions and application requirements, potentially
reducing operational expenditure and enhancing network agility. As a proof of
concept, we apply the training mechanism to a millimeter-wave (mmWave)-enabled
throughput prediction problem. We also offer new insights and highlight some
challenges related to recurrent neural networks from the perspective of the IB
theory. Interestingly, we find a compression phenomenon across the temporal
domain of the sequential model, in addition to the compression phase that
occurs with the number of training epochs.

<p class="mathjax">The estimation of non-Gaussian measurement noise models is a significant
challenge across various fields. In practical applications, it often faces
challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational
complexity. This paper proposes a threshold-based Kalman filtering approach for
online estimation of noise parameters in non-Gaussian measurement noise models.
This method uses a certain amount of sample data to infer the variance
threshold of observation parameters and employs variational Bayesian estimation
to obtain corresponding noise variance estimates, enabling subsequent
iterations of the Kalman filtering algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of this algorithm through simulation experiments, demonstrating its
accurate and effective estimation of state and noise parameters.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of latent variable disentanglement is to infer the multiple
informative latent representations that lie behind a data generation process
and is a key factor in controllable data generation. In this paper, we propose
a deep neural network-based self-supervised learning method to infer the
disentangled rhythmic and harmonic representations behind music audio
generation. We train a variational autoencoder that generates an audio
mel-spectrogram from two latent features representing the rhythmic and harmonic
content. In the training phase, the variational autoencoder is trained to
reconstruct the input mel-spectrogram given its pitch-shifted version. At each
forward computation in the training phase, a vector rotation operation is
applied to one of the latent features, assuming that the dimensions of the
feature vectors are related to pitch intervals. Therefore, in the trained
variational autoencoder, the rotated latent feature represents the
pitch-related information of the mel-spectrogram, and the unrotated latent
feature represents the pitch-invariant information, i.e., the rhythmic content.
The proposed method was evaluated using a predictor-based disentanglement
metric on the learned features. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application to
the automatic generation of music remixes.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring noise pollution in urban areas in a more systematic manner has
been gaining traction as a theme among the research community, especially with
the rise of smart cities and the IoT. However, although it affects our everyday
life in a profound way, monitoring indoor noise levels inside workplaces and
public buildings has so far grabbed less of our attention. In this work, we
report on noise levels data produced by an IoT infrastructure installed inside
5 school buildings in Greece. Our results indicate that such data can help to
produce a more accurate picture of the conditions that students and educators
experience every day, and also provide useful insights in terms of health risks

continuous-time stochastic dynamic systems over sensor networks where each
agent can only communicate with its local neighbors. A distributed least
squares (LS) algorithm based on diffusion strategy is proposed such that the
sensors can cooperatively estimate the unknown time-invariant parameter vector
from continuous-time noisy signals. By using the martingal estimation theory
and Ito formula, we provide upper bounds for the estimation error of the
proposed distributed LS algorithm, and further obtain the convergence results
under a cooperative excitation condition. Compared with the existing results,
our results are established without using the boundedness or persistent

examples to show that multiple sensors can cooperatively accomplish the
estimation task even if any individual can not.

<p class="mathjax">Drones have been widely utilized in various fields, but the number of drones
being used illegally and for hazardous purposes has increased recently. To
prevent those illegal drones, in this work, we propose a novel framework for
reconstructing 3D trajectories of drones using a single camera. By leveraging
calibrated cameras, we exploit the relationship between 2D and 3D spaces. We
automatically track the drones in 2D images using the drone tracker and
estimate their 2D rotations. By combining the estimated 2D drone positions with
their actual length information and camera parameters, we geometrically infer
the 3D trajectories of the drones. To address the lack of public drone
datasets, we also create synthetic 2D and 3D drone datasets. The experimental
results show that the proposed methods accurately reconstruct drone
trajectories in 3D space, and demonstrate the potential of our framework for
single camera-based surveillance systems.

<p class="mathjax">Microservices have been recognized for over a decade. They reshaped system
design enabling decentralization and independence of development teams working
on particular microservices. While loosely coupled microservices are desired,
it is inevitable for dependencies to arise. However, these dependencies often
go unnoticed by development teams. As the system evolves, making changes to one
microservice may trigger a ripple effect, necessitating adjustments in
dependent microservices and increasing maintenance and operational efforts.
Tracking different types of dependencies across microservices becomes crucial
in anticipating the consequences of development team changes. This paper
introduces the Endpoint Dependency Matrix (EDM) and Data Dependency Matrix
(DDM) as tools to address this challenge. We present an automated approach for
tracking these dependencies and demonstrate their extraction through a case
study.

<p class="mathjax">Thermodynamic equations of state (EOS) are essential for many industries as
well as in academia. Even leaving aside the expensive and extensive measurement
campaigns required for the data acquisition, the development of EOS is an
intensely time-consuming process, which does often still heavily rely on expert
knowledge and iterative fine-tuning. To improve upon and accelerate the EOS
development process, we introduce thermodynamics-informed symbolic regression
(TiSR), a symbolic regression (SR) tool aimed at thermodynamic EOS modeling.
TiSR is already a capable SR tool, which was used in the research of
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10765-023-03197-z. It aims to combine an SR base with
the extensions required to work with often strongly scattered experimental
data, different residual pre- and post-processing options, and additional
features required to consider thermodynamic EOS development. Although TiSR is
not ready for end users yet, this paper is intended to report on its current
state, showcase the progress, and discuss (distant and not so distant) future
directions. TiSR is available at https://github.com/scoop-group/TiSR and can be

container canyon, considering two types of container stacking and two different
Transmitter (TX) locations, using a narrowband channel sounder equipped with a
rotating horn antenna. The measurements are used to evaluate the azimuthal

show a low path loss compared to free space, as well as a high angular spread

<p class="mathjax">Most seismic risk assessment methods focus on estimating the damages to the
built environment and the consequent socioeconomic losses without fully taking
into account the social aspect of risk. Yet, human behaviour is a key element
in predicting the human impact of an earthquake, therefore, it is important to
include it in quantitative risk assessment studies. In this study, an
interdisciplinary approach simulating pedestrians' evacuation during
earthquakes at the city scale is developed using an agent-based model. The
model integrates the seismic hazard, the physical vulnerability as well as
individuals' behaviours and mobility. The simulator is applied to the case of
Beirut, Lebanon. Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has
generated several Mw&gt;7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the
countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is
due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of
mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and
the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies. Beirut as
the main residential, economic and institutional hub of Lebanon is densely
populated. To accommodate the growing need for urban development, constructions
have almost taken over all of the green areas of the city; squares and gardens
are disappearing to give place to skyscrapers. However, open spaces are safe
places to shelter, away from debris, and therefore play an essential role in
earthquake evacuation. Despite the massive urbanization, there are a few open
spaces but locked gates and other types of anthropogenic barriers often limit
their access. To simulate this complex context, pedestrians' evacuation
simulations are run in a highly realistic spatial environment implemented in
GAMA [1]. Previous data concerning soil and buildings in Beirut [2, 3] are
complemented by new geographic data extracted from high-resolution Pleiades
satellite images. The seismic loading is defined as a peak ground acceleration
of 0.3g, as stated in Lebanese seismic regulations. Building damages are
estimated using an artificial neural network trained to predict the mean damage
[4] based on the seismic loading as well as the soil and building vibrational
properties [5]. Moreover, the quantity and the footprint of the generated
debris around each building are also estimated and included in the model. We
simulate how topography, buildings, debris, and access to open spaces, affect
individuals' mobility. Two city configurations are implemented: 1. Open spaces
are accessible without any barriers; 2. Access to some open spaces is blocked.
The first simulation results show that while 52% of the population is able to
arrive to an open space within 5 minutes after an earthquake, this number is
reduced to 39% when one of the open spaces is locked. These results show that
the presence of accessible open spaces in a city and their proximity to the
residential buildings is a crucial factor for ensuring people's safety when an
earthquake occurs.

<p class="mathjax">The use of behavioural data in insurance is loaded with promises and
unresolved issues. This paper explores the related opportunities and challenges
analysing the use of telematics data in third-party liability motor insurance.
Behavioural data are used not only to refine the risk profile of policyholders,
but also to implement innovative coaching strategies, feeding back to the
drivers the aggregated information obtained from the data. The purpose is to
encourage an improvement in their driving style. Our research explores the
effectiveness of coaching on the basis of an empirical investigation of the
dataset of a company selling telematics motor insurance policies. The results
of our quantitative analysis show that this effectiveness crucially depends on
the propensity of policyholders to engage with the telematics app. We observe
engagement as an additional kind of behaviour, producing second-order
behavioural data that can also be recorded and strategically used by insurance
companies. The conclusions discuss potential advantages and risks connected
with this extended interpretation of behavioural data.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the Reinforcement Learning problem of controlling an unknown
dynamical system to maximise the long-term average reward along a single
trajectory. Most of the literature considers system interactions that occur in
discrete time and discrete state-action spaces. Although this standpoint is
suitable for games, it is often inadequate for mechanical or digital systems in
which interactions occur at a high frequency, if not in continuous time, and
whose state spaces are large if not inherently continuous. Perhaps the only
exception is the Linear Quadratic framework for which results exist both in
discrete and continuous time. However, its ability to handle continuous states
comes with the drawback of a rigid dynamic and reward structure. This work aims
to overcome these shortcomings by modelling interaction times with a Poisson
clock of frequency $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which captures arbitrary time scales:
from discrete ($\varepsilon=1$) to continuous time ($\varepsilon\downarrow0$).
In addition, we consider a generic reward function and model the state dynamics
according to a jump process with an arbitrary transition kernel on
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the celebrated optimism protocol applies when the
sub-tasks (learning and planning) can be performed effectively. We tackle
learning within the eluder dimension framework and propose an approximate
planning method based on a diffusive limit approximation of the jump process.
Overall, our algorithm enjoys a regret of order
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{1/2} T+\sqrt{T})$. As the frequency of
interactions blows up, the approximation error $\varepsilon^{1/2} T$ vanishes,
showing that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ is attainable in near-continuous
time.

<p class="mathjax">Graph representations are the generalization of geometric graph drawings from
the plane to higher dimensions. A method introduced by Tutte to optimize
properties of graph drawings is to minimize their energy. We explore this
minimization for spherical graph representations, where the vertices lie on a
unit sphere such that the origin is their barycentre. We present a primal and
dual semidefinite program which can be used to find such a spherical graph
representation minimizing the energy. We denote the optimal value of this
program by $\rho(G)$ for a given graph $G$. The value turns out to be related
to the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$, which we
denote by $\lambda_2$. We show that for $G$ regular, $\rho(G) \leq
\frac{\lambda_{2}}{2} \cdot v(G)$, and that equality holds if and only if the
$\lambda_{2}$ eigenspace contains a spherical 1-design. Moreover, if $G$ is a
random $d$-regular graph, $\rho(G)=\left(\sqrt{(d-1)} +o(1)\right)\cdot v(G)$,
asymptotically almost surely.

<p class="mathjax">The design process of centrifugal compressors requires applying an
optimization process which is computationally expensive due to complex
analytical equations underlying the compressor's dynamical equations. Although
the regression surrogate models could drastically reduce the computational cost
of such a process, the major challenge is the scarcity of data for training the
surrogate model. Aiming to strategically exploit the labeled samples, we
propose the Active-CompDesign framework in which we combine a
thermodynamics-based compressor model (i.e., our internal software for
compressor design) and Gaussian Process-based surrogate model within a
deployable Active Learning (AL) setting. We first conduct experiments in an
offline setting and further, extend it to an online AL framework where a
real-time interaction with the thermodynamics-based compressor's model allows
the deployment in production. ActiveCompDesign shows a significant performance
improvement in surrogate modeling by leveraging on uncertainty-based query
function of samples within the AL framework with respect to the random
selection of data points. Moreover, our framework in production has reduced the
total computational time of compressor's design optimization to around 46%
faster than relying on the internal thermodynamics-based simulator, achieving
the same performance.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning classifiers are crucial in the age of artificial intelligence.
The device-edge-based collaborative inference has been widely adopted as an
efficient framework for promoting its applications in IoT and 5G/6G networks.
However, it suffers from accuracy degradation under non-i.i.d. data
distribution and privacy disclosure. For accuracy degradation, direct use of
transfer learning and split learning is high cost and privacy issues remain.
For privacy disclosure, cryptography-based approaches lead to a huge overhead.
Other lightweight methods assume that the ground truth is non-sensitive and can
be exposed. But for many applications, the ground truth is the user's crucial
privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a framework of
Roulette, which is a task-oriented semantic privacy-preserving collaborative
inference framework for deep learning classifiers. More than input data, we
treat the ground truth of the data as private information. We develop a novel
paradigm of split learning where the back-end DNN is frozen and the front-end
DNN is retrained to be both a feature extractor and an encryptor. Moreover, we
provide a differential privacy guarantee and analyze the hardness of ground
truth inference attacks. To validate the proposed Roulette, we conduct
extensive performance evaluations using realistic datasets, which demonstrate
that Roulette can effectively defend against various attacks and meanwhile
achieve good model accuracy. In a situation where the non-i.i.d. is very
severe, Roulette improves the inference accuracy by 21\% averaged over
benchmarks, while making the accuracy of discrimination attacks almost
equivalent to random guessing.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, utilizing deep neural networks to build the opendomain dialogue
models has become a hot topic. However, the responses generated by these models
suffer from many problems such as responses not being contextualized and tend
to generate generic responses that lack information content, damaging the
user's experience seriously. Therefore, many studies try introducing more
information into the dialogue models to make the generated responses more vivid
and informative. Unlike them, this paper improves the quality of generated
responses by learning the implicit pattern information between contexts and
responses in the training samples. In this paper, we first build an open-domain
dialogue model based on the pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2). And then,
an improved scheduled sampling method is proposed for pre-trained models, by
which the responses can be used to guide the response generation in the
training phase while avoiding the exposure bias problem. More importantly, we
design a response-aware mechanism for mining the implicit pattern information
between contexts and responses so that the generated replies are more diverse
and approximate to human replies. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model (RAD)
on the Persona-Chat and DailyDialog datasets; and the experimental results show
that our model outperforms the baselines on most automatic and manual metrics.

beam with maximal ratio combining coefficients for a generic multi-antenna
receiver. In particular, in case the channel is a linear combination of plane
waves, we show that such a beam can be decomposed in a linear combination of
beams pointed in the direction of each plane wave, and we compute how many
directions can be effectively utilized. This highlights that such beam is
better exploiting the spatial diversity provided by the channel, and therefore
it is expected to be more robust to disruptions. Moreover, we compute the
achieved Signal-to-Noise-Ratio for a wideband receiver, showing that it is not
significantly worse than for other methods. Finally, we provide some insights
on the robustness of the method by simulating the impact of the blockage of one

<p class="mathjax">In this work, a Cole-Hopf transformation based fourth-order
multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for d-dimensional
coupled Burgers' equations is developed. We first adopt the Cole-Hopf
transformation where an intermediate variable \theta is introduced to eliminate
the nonlinear convection terms in the Burgers' equations on the velocity
u=(u_1,u_2,...,u_d). In this case, a diffusion equation on the variable \theta
can be obtained, and particularly, the velocity u in the coupled Burgers'
equations is determined by the variable \theta and its gradient term
\nabla\theta. Then we develop a general MRT-LB model with the natural moments
for the d-dimensional transformed diffusion equation and present the
corresponding macroscopic finite-difference scheme. At the diffusive scaling,
the fourth-order modified equation of the developed MRT-LB model is derived
through the Maxwell iteration method. With the aid of the free parameters in
the MRT-LB model, we find that not only the consistent fourth-order modified
equation can be obtained, but also the gradient term $\nabla\theta$ can be
calculated locally by the non-equilibrium distribution function with a
fourth-order accuracy, this indicates that theoretically, the MRT-LB model for
$d$-dimensional coupled Burgers' equations can achieve a fourth-order accuracy
in space. Finally, some simulations are conducted to test the MRT-LB model, and
the numerical results show that the proposed MRT-LB model has a fourth-order
convergence rate, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">While many FSCIL studies have been undertaken, achieving satisfactory
performance, especially during incremental sessions, has remained challenging.
One prominent challenge is that the encoder, trained with an ample base session
training set, often underperforms in incremental sessions. In this study, we
introduce a novel training framework for FSCIL, capitalizing on the
generalizability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to
unseen classes. We achieve this by formulating image-object-specific (IOS)
classifiers for the input images. Here, an IOS classifier refers to one that
targets specific attributes (like wings or wheels) of class objects rather than
the image's background. To create these IOS classifiers, we encode a bias
prompt into the classifiers using our specially designed module, which
harnesses key-prompt pairs to pinpoint the IOS features of classes in each
session. From an FSCIL standpoint, our framework is structured to retain
previous knowledge and swiftly adapt to new sessions without forgetting or
overfitting. This considers the updatability of modules in each session and
some tricks empirically found for fast convergence. Our approach consistently
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across
the miniImageNet, CIFAR100, and CUB200 datasets. Further, we provide additional
experiments to validate our learned model's ability to achieve IOS classifiers.
We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of each module within
the architecture.

<p class="mathjax">Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoders have been intensively
studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than
real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the
optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature
space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial
network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal
projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we
propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders
adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through
our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of
GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sony/bigvsan.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a reduced-dimensional smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation for quasi-static and dynamic analyses of plate
and shell structures undergoing finite deformation and large rotation. By
exploiting Uflyand-Mindlin plate theory, the present surface-particle
formulation is able to resolve the thin structures by using only one layer of
particles at the mid-surface. To resolve the geometric non-linearity and
capture finite deformation and large rotation, two reduced-dimensional
linear-reproducing correction matrices are introduced, and weighted
non-singularity conversions between the rotation angle and pseudo normal are
formulated. A new non-isotropic Kelvin-Voigt damping is proposed especially for
the both thin and moderately thick plate and shell structures to increase the
numerical stability. In addition, a shear-scaled momentum-conserving hourglass
control algorithm with an adaptive limiter is introduced to suppress the
mismatches between the particle position and pseudo normal and those estimated
with the deformation gradient. A comprehensive set of test problems, for which
the analytical or numerical results from literature or those of the
volume-particle SPH model are available for quantitative and qualitative
comparison, are examined to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the
present method.

sequences is introduced in this paper. It is theoretically proved the existence
of such sequences, and the number of such sequences is derived. These sequences
guarantee that all neighboring codes are different while retaining the
uniqueness of subsequences, which is a significant characteristic of original
de Bruijn sequences in coding and matching. At last, the adjacency-hopping de
Bruijn sequences are applied to structured light coding, and a color fringe
pattern coded by such a sequence is presented. In summary, the proposed
sequences demonstrate significant advantages in structured light coding by
virtue of the uniqueness of subsequences and the adjacency-hopping
characteristic, and show potential for extension to other fields with similar
requirements of non-repetitive coding and efficient matching.

<p class="mathjax">Model-based sequential approaches to discrete "black-box" optimization,
including Bayesian optimization techniques, often access the same points
multiple times for a given objective function in interest, resulting in many
steps to find the global optimum. Here, we numerically study the effect of a
postprocessing method on Bayesian optimization that strictly prohibits
duplicated samples in the dataset. We find the postprocessing method
significantly reduces the number of sequential steps to find the global
optimum, especially when the acquisition function is of maximum a posterior
estimation. Our results provide a simple but general strategy to solve the slow
convergence of Bayesian optimization for high-dimensional problems.

<p class="mathjax">Typical technique in knowledge distillation (KD) is regularizing the learning
of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

<p class="mathjax">Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs) are commonly found in the real world, such as
social networks and citation networks, and consist of nodes represented by
textual descriptions. Currently, mainstream machine learning methods on TAGs
involve a two-stage modeling approach: (1) unsupervised node feature extraction
with pre-trained language models (PLMs); and (2) supervised learning using
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we observe that these representations,
which have undergone large-scale pre-training, do not significantly improve
performance with a limited amount of training samples. The main issue is that
existing methods have not effectively integrated information from the graph and
downstream tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
called G-Prompt, which combines a graph adapter and task-specific prompts to
extract node features. First, G-Prompt introduces a learnable GNN layer
(\emph{i.e.,} adaptor) at the end of PLMs, which is fine-tuned to better
capture the masked tokens considering graph neighborhood information. After the
adapter is trained, G-Prompt incorporates task-specific prompts to obtain
\emph{interpretable} node representations for the downstream task. Our
experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on few-shot node classification. More
importantly, in zero-shot settings, the G-Prompt embeddings can not only
provide better task interpretability than vanilla PLMs but also achieve
comparable performance with fully-supervised baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Log data store event execution patterns that correspond to underlying
workflows of systems or applications. While most logs are informative, log data
also include artifacts that indicate failures or incidents. Accordingly, log
data are often used to evaluate anomaly detection techniques that aim to
automatically disclose unexpected or otherwise relevant system behavior
patterns. Recently, detection approaches leveraging deep learning have
increasingly focused on anomalies that manifest as changes of sequential
patterns within otherwise normal event traces. Several publicly available data
sets, such as HDFS, BGL, Thunderbird, OpenStack, and Hadoop, have since become
standards for evaluating these anomaly detection techniques, however, the
appropriateness of these data sets has not been closely investigated in the
past. In this paper we therefore analyze six publicly available log data sets
with focus on the manifestations of anomalies and simple techniques for their
detection. Our findings suggest that most anomalies are not directly related to
sequential manifestations and that advanced detection techniques are not
required to achieve high detection rates on these data sets.

<p class="mathjax">With neural networks growing deeper and feature maps growing larger, limited
communication bandwidth with external memory (or DRAM) and power constraints
become a bottleneck in implementing network inference on mobile and edge
devices. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end differentiable bandwidth
efficient neural inference method with the activation compressed by neural data
compression method. Specifically, we propose a transform-quantization-entropy
coding pipeline for activation compression with symmetric exponential Golomb
coding and a data-dependent Gaussian entropy model for arithmetic coding.
Optimized with existing model quantization methods, low-level task of image
compression can achieve up to 19x bandwidth reduction with 6.21x energy saving.

<p class="mathjax">Digital educational technologies offer the potential to customize students'
experiences and learn what works for which students, enhancing the technology
as more students interact with it. We consider whether and when attempting to
discover how to personalize has a cost, such as if the adaptation to personal
information can delay the adoption of policies that benefit all students. We
explore these issues in the context of using multi-armed bandit (MAB)
algorithms to learn a policy for what version of an educational technology to
present to each student, varying the relation between student characteristics
and outcomes and also whether the algorithm is aware of these characteristics.
Through simulations, we demonstrate that the inclusion of student
characteristics for personalization can be beneficial when those
characteristics are needed to learn the optimal action. In other scenarios,
this inclusion decreases performance of the bandit algorithm. Moreover,
including unneeded student characteristics can systematically disadvantage
students with less common values for these characteristics. Our simulations do
however suggest that real-time personalization will be helpful in particular
real-world scenarios, and we illustrate this through case studies using
existing experimental results in ASSISTments. Overall, our simulations show
that adaptive personalization in educational technologies can be a double-edged
sword: real-time adaptation improves student experiences in some contexts, but
the slower adaptation and potentially discriminatory results mean that a more
personalized model is not always beneficial.

<p class="mathjax">Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) aims to estimate the aesthetics of images.
Depending on the content of an image, diverse criteria need to be selected to
assess its aesthetics. Existing works utilize pre-trained vision backbones
based on content knowledge to learn image aesthetics. However, training those
backbones is time-consuming and suffers from attention dispersion. Inspired by
learnable queries in vision-language alignment, we propose the Image Aesthetics
Assessment via Learnable Queries (IAA-LQ) approach. It adapts learnable queries
to extract aesthetic features from pre-trained image features obtained from a
frozen image encoder. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the
advantages of IAA-LQ, beating the best state-of-the-art method by 2.2% and 2.1%
in terms of SRCC and PLCC, respectively.

so-called radial basis function method and more specifically,
quasi-interpolation. From the various available approaches to the latter, we
form new quasi-Lagrange functions when the orders of the singularities of the
radial function's Fourier transforms at zero do not match the parity of the
dimension of the space, and therefore new expansions and coefficients are
needed to overcome this problem. We develop explicit constructions of infinite
Fourier expansions that provide these coefficients and make an extensive
comparison of the approximation qualities and - with a particular focus -
polynomial precision and uniform approximation order of the various formulae.
One of the interesting observations concerns the link between algebraic
conditions of expansion coefficients and analytic properties of localness and
convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Neural temporal point processes(TPPs) have shown promise for modeling
continuous-time event sequences. However, capturing the interactions between
events is challenging yet critical for performing inference tasks like
forecasting on event sequence data. Existing TPP models have focused on
parameterizing the conditional distribution of future events but struggle to
model event interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Neural Relational Inference (NRI) to learn a relation graph that
infers interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics patterns from
observational data. Our approach, the Contrastive Relational Inference-based
Hawkes Process (CRIHP), reasons about event interactions under a variational
inference framework. It utilizes intensity-based learning to search for
prototype paths to contrast relationship constraints. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in
capturing event interactions for event sequence modeling tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has proven extremely useful in a large
variety of application domains. However, even successful DRL-based software can
exhibit highly undesirable behavior. This is due to DRL training being based on
maximizing a reward function, which typically captures general trends but
cannot precisely capture, or rule out, certain behaviors of the system. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework aimed at drastically reducing the
undesirable behavior of DRL-based software, while maintaining its excellent
performance. In addition, our framework can assist in providing engineers with
a comprehensible characterization of such undesirable behavior. Under the hood,
our approach is based on extracting decision tree classifiers from erroneous
state-action pairs, and then integrating these trees into the DRL training
loop, penalizing the system whenever it performs an error. We provide a
proof-of-concept implementation of our approach, and use it to evaluate the
technique on three significant case studies. We find that our approach can
extend existing frameworks in a straightforward manner, and incurs only a
slight overhead in training time. Further, it incurs only a very slight hit to
performance, or even in some cases - improves it, while significantly reducing
the frequency of undesirable behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Online Continual Learning (OCL) addresses the problem of training neural
networks on a continuous data stream where multiple classification tasks emerge
in sequence. In contrast to offline Continual Learning, data can be seen only
once in OCL. In this context, replay-based strategies have achieved impressive
results and most state-of-the-art approaches are heavily depending on them.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been extensively used in offline
Continual Learning, it remains under-exploited in OCL, despite its potential.
In this paper, we theoretically analyze the challenges in applying KD to OCL.
We introduce a direct yet effective methodology for applying Momentum Knowledge
Distillation (MKD) to many flagship OCL methods and demonstrate its
capabilities to enhance existing approaches. In addition to improving existing
state-of-the-arts accuracy by more than $10\%$ points on ImageNet100, we shed
light on MKD internal mechanics and impacts during training in OCL. We argue
that similar to replay, MKD should be considered a central component of OCL.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamics model learning deals with the task of inferring unknown dynamics
from measurement data and predicting the future behavior of the system. A
typical approach to address this problem is to train recurrent models. However,
predictions with these models are often not physically meaningful. Further,
they suffer from deteriorated behavior over time due to accumulating errors.
Often, simulators building on first principles are available being physically
meaningful by design. However, modeling simplifications typically cause
inaccuracies in these models. Consequently, hybrid modeling is an emerging
trend that aims to combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose a
new approach to hybrid modeling, where we inform the latent states of a learned
model via a black-box simulator. This allows to control the predictions via the
simulator preventing them from accumulating errors. This is especially
challenging since, in contrast to previous approaches, access to the
simulator's latent states is not available. We tackle the task by leveraging
observers, a well-known concept from control theory, inferring unknown latent
states from observations and dynamics over time. In our learning-based setting,
we jointly learn the dynamics and an observer that infers the latent states via
the simulator. Thus, the simulator constantly corrects the latent states,
compensating for modeling mismatch caused by learning. To maintain flexibility,
we train an RNN-based residuum for the latent states that cannot be informed by
the simulator.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal image registration is a crucial pre-processing step in many
medical applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the complex
intensity relationships between different imaging modalities, which can result
in large discrepancy in image appearance. The success of multi-modal image
registration, whether it is conventional or learning based, is predicated upon
the choice of an appropriate distance (or similarity) measure. Particularly,
deep learning registration algorithms lack in accuracy or even fail completely
when attempting to register data from an "unseen" modality. In this work, we
present Modality Agnostic Distance (MAD), a deep image distance}] measure that
utilises random convolutions to learn the inherent geometry of the images while
being robust to large appearance changes. Random convolutions are
geometry-preserving modules which we use to simulate an infinite number of
synthetic modalities alleviating the need for aligned paired data during
training. We can therefore train MAD on a mono-modal dataset and successfully
apply it to a multi-modal dataset. We demonstrate that not only can MAD
affinely register multi-modal images successfully, but it has also a larger
capture range than traditional measures such as Mutual Information and
Normalised Gradient Fields.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023]
introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it to be the most efficient machine
teaching model satisfying the benchmark for collusion-avoidance set by Goldman
and Mathias. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\cal{C}$ assigns a
(teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \in \cal{C}$. A teaching
map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of
their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the
maximum size of a $T(C)$, $C \in \cal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension
NCTD$(\cal{C})$ of $\cal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\cal{C}$.
NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\cal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may
only use positive examples.
<br />We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\mathcal{B}(G)$
consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision
problem {\sc B-NCTD$^+$} for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite,
and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails,
{\sc B-NCTD$^+$} does not admit an algorithm running in time
$2^{2^{o(vc)}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a
kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number of $G$.
These are extremely rare results: it is only the second (fourth, resp.) problem
in NP to admit a double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc (treewidth,
resp.), and only one of very few problems to admit an ETH-based conditional
lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. We complement these lower
bounds with matching upper bounds. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and
trees of cycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size
proportional to its VC-dimension. For Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an
approximate NCTM$^+$ for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size 2.

<p class="mathjax">The Nystr\"om method offers an effective way to obtain low-rank approximation
of SPD matrices, and has been recently extended and analyzed to nonsymmetric
matrices (leading to the generalized Nystr\"om method). It is a randomized,
single-pass, streamable, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to the
randomized SVD, and it facilitates the computation of several matrix low-rank
factorizations.
<br />In this paper, we take these advancements a step further by introducing a
higher-order variant of Nystr\"om's methodology tailored to approximating
low-rank tensors in the Tucker format: the multilinear Nystr\"om technique. We
show that, by introducing appropriate small modifications in the formulation of
the higher-order method, strong stability properties can be obtained. This
algorithm retains the key attributes of the generalized Nystr\"om method,
positioning it as a viable substitute for the randomized higher-order SVD
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new class of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving
nonlinear conservation laws on unstructured Voronoi meshes that use a
nonconforming Virtual Element basis defined within each polygonal control
volume. The basis functions are evaluated as an L2 projection of the virtual
basis which remains unknown, along the lines of the Virtual Element Method
(VEM). Contrarily to the VEM approach, the new basis functions lead to a
nonconforming representation of the solution with discontinuous data across the
element boundaries, as typically employed in DG discretizations. To improve the
condition number of the resulting mass matrix, an orthogonalization of the full
basis is proposed. The discretization in time is carried out following the ADER
(Arbitrary order DERivative Riemann problem) methodology, which yields one-step
fully discrete schemes that make use of a coupled space-time representation of
the numerical solution. The space-time basis functions are constructed as a
tensor product of the virtual basis in space and a one-dimensional Lagrange
nodal basis in time. The resulting space-time stiffness matrix is stabilized by
an extension of the dof-dof stabilization technique adopted in the VEM
framework, hence allowing an element-local space-time Galerkin finite element
predictor to be evaluated. The novel methods are referred to as VEM-DG schemes,
and they are arbitrarily high order accurate in space and time. The new VEM-DG
algorithms are rigorously validated against a series of benchmarks in the
context of compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results
are verified with respect to literature reference solutions and compared in
terms of accuracy and computational efficiency to those obtained using a
standard modal DG scheme with Taylor basis functions. An analysis of the
condition number of the mass and space-time stiffness matrix is also forwarded.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability,
showcasing their capacity to excel in tasks for which they were not explicitly
trained. However, despite their impressive natural language processing (NLP)
capabilities, effective alignment of LLMs remains a crucial challenge when
deploying them for specific clinical applications. The ability to generate
responses with factually accurate content and to engage in non-trivial
reasoning steps are crucial for the LLMs to be eligible for applications in
clinical medicine. Employing a combination of techniques including
instruction-tuning and in-prompt strategies like few-shot and chain of thought
prompting has significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs. Our proposed
alignment strategy for medical question-answering, known as
'expand-guess-refine', offers a parameter and data-efficient solution. A
preliminary analysis of this method demonstrated outstanding performance,
achieving a score of 70.63% on a subset of questions sourced from the USMLE

choice without a language-specific training dataset. We exploit a generic
translation dataset, manually translated, along with two instances of the same

language, and the second fine-tuned over the target language to mimic the
first. This technique is known as Knowledge Distillation. The model has been
evaluated over machine translated Stanford NLI test dataset, machine translated
Multi-Genre NLI test dataset, and manually translated RTE3-ITA test dataset. We
also test the proposed architecture over different tasks to empirically
demonstrate the generality of the NLI task. The model has been evaluated over
the native Italian ABSITA dataset, on the tasks of Sentiment Analysis,
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Recognition. We emphasise the
generality and exploitability of the Knowledge Distillation technique that
outperforms other methodologies based on machine translation, even though the

<p class="mathjax">Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become an essential component of software,
accelerating development and reducing maintenance costs. However, breaking
changes often occur during the upgrades of TPLs and prevent client programs
from moving forward. Semantic versioning (SemVer) has been applied to
standardize the versions of releases according to compatibility, but not all
releases follow SemVer compliance. Lots of work focuses on SemVer compliance in
ecosystems such as Java and JavaScript beyond Golang (Go for short). Due to the
lack of tools to detect breaking changes and dataset for Go, developers of TPLs
do not know if breaking changes occur and affect client programs, and
developers of client programs may hesitate to upgrade dependencies in terms of
breaking changes.
<br />To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study in the
Go ecosystem to study SemVer compliance in terms of breaking changes and their
impact. In detail, we purpose GoSVI (Go Semantic Versioning Insight) to detect
breaking changes and analyze their impact by resolving identifiers in client
programs and comparing their types with breaking changes. Moreover, we collect
the first large-scale Go dataset with a dependency graph from GitHub, including
124K TPLs and 532K client programs. Based on the dataset, our results show that
86.3% of library upgrades follow SemVer compliance and 28.6% of no-major
upgrades introduce breaking changes. Furthermore, the tendency to comply with
SemVer has improved over time from 63.7% in 2018/09 to 92.2% in 2023/03.
Finally, we find 33.3% of downstream client programs may be affected by
breaking changes. These findings provide developers and users of TPLs with
valuable insights to help make decisions related to SemVer.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of learning a function respecting a symmetry from
among a class of symmetries. We develop a unified framework that enables
symmetry discovery across a broad range of subgroups including locally
symmetric, dihedral and cyclic subgroups. At the core of the framework is a
novel architecture composed of linear and tensor-valued functions that
expresses functions invariant to these subgroups in a principled manner. The
structure of the architecture enables us to leverage multi-armed bandit
algorithms and gradient descent to efficiently optimize over the linear and the
tensor-valued functions, respectively, and to infer the symmetry that is
ultimately learnt. We also discuss the necessity of the tensor-valued functions
in the architecture. Experiments on image-digit sum and polynomial regression
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Social media processing is a fundamental task in natural language processing
with numerous applications. As Vietnamese social media and information science
have grown rapidly, the necessity of information-based mining on Vietnamese
social media has become crucial. However, state-of-the-art research faces
several significant drawbacks, including imbalanced data and noisy data on
social media platforms. Imbalanced and noisy are two essential issues that need
to be addressed in Vietnamese social media texts. Graph Convolutional Networks
can address the problems of imbalanced and noisy data in text classification on
social media by taking advantage of the graph structure of the data. This study
presents a novel approach based on contextualized language model (PhoBERT) and
graph-based method (Graph Convolutional Networks). In particular, the proposed
approach, ViCGCN, jointly trained the power of Contextualized embeddings with
the ability of Graph Convolutional Networks, GCN, to capture more syntactic and
semantic dependencies to address those drawbacks. Extensive experiments on
various Vietnamese benchmark datasets were conducted to verify our approach.
The observation shows that applying GCN to BERTology models as the final layer
significantly improves performance. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that
ViCGCN outperforms 13 powerful baseline models, including BERTology models,
fusion BERTology and GCN models, other baselines, and SOTA on three benchmark
social media datasets. Our proposed ViCGCN approach demonstrates a significant
improvement of up to 6.21%, 4.61%, and 2.63% over the best Contextualized
Language Models, including multilingual and monolingual, on three benchmark
datasets, UIT-VSMEC, UIT-ViCTSD, and UIT-VSFC, respectively. Additionally, our
integrated model ViCGCN achieves the best performance compared to other
BERTology integrated with GCN models.

<p class="mathjax">Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in visual object tracking often
require extensive computational resources and vast amounts of training data,
leading to a risk of overfitting. This study introduces a more efficient
training strategy to mitigate overfitting and reduce computational
requirements. We balance the training process with a mix of negative and
positive samples from the outset, named as Joint learning with Negative samples
(JN). Negative samples refer to scenarios where the object from the template is
not present in the search region, which helps to prevent the model from simply
memorizing the target, and instead encourages it to use the template for object
location. To handle the negative samples effectively, we adopt a
distribution-based head, which modeling the bounding box as distribution of
distances to express uncertainty about the target's location in the presence of
negative samples, offering an efficient way to manage the mixed sample
training. Furthermore, our approach introduces a target-indicating token. It
encapsulates the target's precise location within the template image. This
method provides exact boundary details with negligible computational cost but
improving performance. Our model, JN-256, exhibits superior performance on
challenging benchmarks, achieving 75.8% AO on GOT-10k and 84.1% AUC on
TrackingNet. Notably, JN-256 outperforms previous SOTA trackers that utilize
larger models and higher input resolutions, even though it is trained with only
half the number of data sampled used in those works.

<p class="mathjax">Energy prediction in buildings plays a crucial role in effective energy
management. Precise predictions are essential for achieving optimal energy
consumption and distribution within the grid. This paper introduces a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to forecast building energy consumption
using historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. The
LSTM model provides accurate short, medium, and long-term energy predictions
for residential and commercial buildings compared to existing prediction
models. We compare our LSTM model with established prediction methods,
including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. Encouragingly,
the proposed LSTM model emerges as the superior performer across all metrics.
It demonstrates exceptional prediction accuracy, boasting the highest R2 score
of 0.97 and the most favorable mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.007. An
additional advantage of our developed model is its capacity to achieve
efficient energy consumption forecasts even when trained on a limited dataset.
We address concerns about overfitting (variance) and underfitting (bias)
through rigorous training and evaluation on real-world data. In summary, our
research contributes to energy prediction by offering a robust LSTM model that
outperforms alternative methods and operates with remarkable efficiency,
generalizability, and reliability.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of hate speech has been formulated as a standalone application of
NLP and different approaches have been adopted for identifying the target
groups, obtaining raw data, defining the labeling process, choosing the
detection algorithm, and evaluating the performance in the desired setting.
However, unlike other downstream tasks, hate speech suffers from the lack of
large-sized, carefully curated, generalizable datasets owing to the highly
subjective nature of the task. In this paper, we first analyze the issues
surrounding hate speech detection through a data-centric lens. We then outline
a holistic framework to encapsulate the data creation pipeline across seven
broad dimensions by taking the specific example of hate speech towards sexual
minorities. We posit that practitioners would benefit from following this
framework as a form of best practice when creating hate speech datasets in the
future.

<p class="mathjax">Geographical location is a crucial element of humanitarian response,
outlining vulnerable populations, ongoing events, and available resources.
Latest developments in Natural Language Processing may help in extracting vital
information from the deluge of reports and documents produced by the
humanitarian sector. However, the performance and biases of existing
state-of-the-art information extraction tools are unknown. In this work, we
develop annotated resources to fine-tune the popular Named Entity Recognition
(NER) tools Spacy and roBERTa to perform geotagging of humanitarian texts. We
then propose a geocoding method FeatureRank which links the candidate locations
to the GeoNames database. We find that not only does the humanitarian-domain
data improves the performance of the classifiers (up to F1 = 0.92), but it also
alleviates some of the bias of the existing tools, which erroneously favor
locations in the Western countries. Thus, we conclude that more resources from
non-Western documents are necessary to ensure that off-the-shelf NER systems
are suitable for the deployment in the humanitarian sector.

<p class="mathjax">Code-mixing and script-mixing are prevalent across online social networks and
multilingual societies. However, a user's preference toward code-mixing depends
on the socioeconomic status, demographics of the user, and the local context,
which existing generative models mostly ignore while generating code-mixed
texts. In this work, we make a pioneering attempt to develop a persona-aware
generative model to generate texts resembling real-life code-mixed texts of
individuals. We propose a Persona-aware Generative Model for Code-mixed
Generation, PARADOX, a novel Transformer-based encoder-decoder model that
encodes an utterance conditioned on a user's persona and generates code-mixed
texts without monolingual reference data. We propose an alignment module that
re-calibrates the generated sequence to resemble real-life code-mixed texts.
PARADOX generates code-mixed texts that are semantically more meaningful and
linguistically more valid. To evaluate the personification capabilities of
PARADOX, we propose four new metrics -- CM BLEU, CM Rouge-1, CM Rouge-L and CM
KS. On average, PARADOX achieves 1.6 points better CM BLEU, 47% better
perplexity and 32% better semantic coherence than the non-persona-based
counterparts.

lower-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data. In addition to
visualisation purposes, these embeddings can be used for downstream processing,
including batch effect normalisation, clustering, community detection or

Our encoder model, called GroupEnc, uses a 'group loss' function to create

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel approach to computing vector road maps from
satellite remotely sensed images, building upon a well-defined Patched Line
Segment (PaLiS) representation for road graphs that holds geometric
significance. Unlike prevailing methods that derive road vector representations
from satellite images using binary masks or keypoints, our method employs line
segments. These segments not only convey road locations but also capture their
orientations, making them a robust choice for representation. More precisely,
given an input image, we divide it into non-overlapping patches and predict a
suitable line segment within each patch. This strategy enables us to capture
spatial and structural cues from these patch-based line segments, simplifying
the process of constructing the road network graph without the necessity of
additional neural networks for connectivity. In our experiments, we demonstrate
how an effective representation of a road graph significantly enhances the
performance of vector road mapping on established benchmarks, without requiring
extensive modifications to the neural network architecture. Furthermore, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 6 GPU hours of training,
leading to a substantial 32-fold reduction in training costs in terms of GPU
hours.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential across various downstream tasks. LLM-integrated frameworks, which
serve as the essential infrastructure, have given rise to many LLM-integrated
web apps. However, some of these frameworks suffer from Remote Code Execution
(RCE) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on apps'
servers remotely via prompt injections. Despite the severity of these
vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a systematic
investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to detect
vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-world
scenarios.
<br />To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies, including 1) a static
analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source code of the framework to
detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a prompt-based automated testing
approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-integrated web apps. We discovered
13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks, including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1
arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the
framework developers, resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing
51 apps, we found vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE
and 1 to SQL injection. We responsibly reported all 17 issues to the
corresponding developers and received acknowledgments. Furthermore, we amplify
the attack impact beyond achieving RCE by allowing attackers to exploit other
app users (e.g. app responses hijacking, user API key leakage) without direct
interaction between the attacker and the victim. Lastly, we propose some
mitigating strategies for improving the security awareness of both framework
and app developers, helping them to mitigate these risks effectively.

<p class="mathjax">The online optimization of gasoline blending benefits refinery economies.
However, the nonlinear blending mechanism, the oil property fluctuations, and
the blending model mismatch bring difficulties to the optimization. To solve
the above issues, this paper proposes a novel online optimization method based
on deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL). The Markov decision process
(MDP) expression are given considering a practical gasoline blending system.
Then, the environment simulator of gasoline blending process is established
based on the MDP expression and the one-year measurement data of a real-world
refinery. The soft actor-critic (SAC) DRL algorithm is applied to improve the
DRL agent policy by using the data obtained from the interaction between DRL
agent and environment simulator. Compared with a traditional method, the
proposed method has better economic performance. Meanwhile, it is more robust
under property fluctuations and component oil switching. Furthermore, the
proposed method maintains performance by automatically adapting to system
drift.

<p class="mathjax">Leakages in drinking water distribution networks pose significant challenges
to water utilities, leading to infrastructure failure, operational disruptions,
environmental hazards, property damage, and economic losses. The timely
identification and accurate localisation of such leakages is paramount for
utilities to mitigate these unwanted effects. However, implementation of
algorithms for leakage detection is limited in practice by requirements of
either hydraulic models or large amounts of training data. Physics-informed
machine learning can utilise hydraulic information thereby circumventing both
limitations. In this work, we present a physics-informed machine learning
algorithm that analyses pressure data and therefrom estimates unknown irregular
water demands via a fully connected neural network, ultimately leveraging the
Bernoulli equation and effectively linearising the leakage detection problem.
Our algorithm is tested on data from the L-Town benchmark network, and results
indicate a good capability for estimating most irregular demands, with R2
larger than 0.8. Identification results for leakages under the presence of
irregular demands could be improved by a factor of 5.3 for abrupt leaks and a
factor of 3.0 for incipient leaks when compared the results disregarding
irregular demands.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
machine learning, addressing data privacy concerns. However, existing FL
platforms and frameworks often present challenges for software engineers in
terms of complexity, limited customization options, and scalability
limitations. In this paper, we introduce EdgeFL, an edge-only lightweight
decentralized FL framework, designed to overcome the limitations of centralized
aggregation and scalability in FL deployments. By adopting an edge-only model
training and aggregation approach, EdgeFL eliminates the need for a central
server, enabling seamless scalability across diverse use cases. With a
straightforward integration process requiring just four lines of code (LOC),
software engineers can easily incorporate FL functionalities into their AI
products. Furthermore, EdgeFL offers the flexibility to customize aggregation
functions, empowering engineers to adapt them to specific needs. Based on the
results, we demonstrate that EdgeFL achieves superior performance compared to
existing FL platforms/frameworks. Our results show that EdgeFL reduces weights
update latency and enables faster model evolution, enhancing the efficiency of
edge devices. Moreover, EdgeFL exhibits improved classification accuracy
compared to traditional centralized FL approaches. By leveraging EdgeFL,
software engineers can harness the benefits of federated learning while
overcoming the challenges associated with existing FL platforms/frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">We present a solution for locating the source, or maximum, of an unknown
scalar field using a swarm of mobile robots. Unlike relying on the traditional
gradient information, the swarm determines an ascending direction to approach
the source with arbitrary precision. The ascending direction is calculated from
measurements of the field strength at the robot locations and their relative
positions concerning the centroid. Rather than focusing on individual robots,
we focus the analysis on the density of robots per unit area to guarantee a
more resilient swarm, i.e., the functionality remains even if individuals go
missing or are misplaced during the mission. We reinforce the robustness of the
algorithm by providing sufficient conditions for the swarm shape so that the
ascending direction is almost parallel to the gradient. The swarm can respond
to an unexpected environment by morphing its shape and exploiting the existence
of multiple ascending directions. Finally, we validate our approach numerically
with hundreds of robots. The fact that a large number of robots always
calculate an ascending direction compensates for the loss of individuals and
mitigates issues arising from the actuator and sensor noises.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation in unknown 3D environments is a key issue for
intelligent transportation, while still being an open problem. Conventionally,
navigation risk has been focused on mitigating collisions with obstacles,
neglecting the varying degrees of harm that collisions can cause. In this
context, we propose a new risk-aware navigation framework, whose purpose is to
directly handle interactions with the environment, including those involving
minor collisions. We introduce a physically interpretable risk function that
quantifies the maximum potential energy that the robot wheels absorb as a
result of a collision. By considering this physical risk in navigation, our
approach significantly broadens the spectrum of situations that the robot can
undertake, such as speed bumps or small road curbs. Using this framework, we
are able to plan safe trajectories that not only ensure safety but also
actively address the risks arising from interactions with the environment.

<p class="mathjax">Studying Human-Robot Interaction over time can provide insights into what
really happens when a robot becomes part of people's everyday lives. "In the
Wild" studies inform the design of social robots, such as for the service
industry, to enable them to remain engaging and useful beyond the novelty
effect and initial adoption. This paper presents an "In the Wild" experiment
where we explored the evolution of interaction between users and a
Robo-Barista. We show that perceived trust and prior attitudes are both
important factors associated with the usefulness, adaptability and likeability
of the Robo-Barista. A combination of interaction features and user attributes
are used to predict user satisfaction. Qualitative insights illuminated users'
Robo-Barista experience and contribute to a number of lessons learned for
future long-term studies.

<p class="mathjax">Industry 4.0 has brought to attention the need for a connected, flexible, and
autonomous production environment. The New Radio (NR)-sidelink, which was
introduced by the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) in Release 16,
can be particularly helpful for factories that need to facilitate cooperative
and close-range communication. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are important
for material handling and carriage within these environments, and using
NR-sidelink communication can further enhance their performance. An efficient
resource allocation mechanism is required to ensure reliable communication and
avoid interference between AGVs and other wireless systems in the factory using
NR-sidelink. This work evaluates the 3GPP standardized resource allocation
algorithm for NR-sidelink for a use case of cooperative carrying AGVs. We
suggest further improvements that are tailored to the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of an indoor factory communication scenario with cooperative
AGVs.The use of NR-sidelink communication has the potential to help meet the
QoS requirements for different Industry 4.0 use cases. This work can be a
foundation for further improvements in NR-sidelink in 3GPP Release 18 and
beyond.

<p class="mathjax">Overlay management is the cornerstone of building robust and dependable
Peer-to-Peer systems. A key component for building such overlays is the
peer-sampling service, a mechanism that continuously supplies each node with a
set of up-to-date peers randomly selected across all alive nodes. Arguably, the
most pernicious malicious action against such mechanisms is the provision of
arbitrarily created links that point at malicious nodes. This paper proposes
SecureCyclon, a peer-sampling protocol that deterministically eliminates the
ability of malicious nodes to overrepresent themselves in Peer-to-Peer
overlays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first protocol to offer
this property, as previous works were able to only bound the proportion of
excessive links to malicious nodes, without completely eliminating them.
SecureCyclon redefines the concept of node descriptors from just being
containers of information that enable communication with specific nodes, to
being communication certificates that traverse the network and enable nodes to
provably discover malicious nodes. We evaluate our solution with the conduction
of extended simulations, and we demonstrate that it provides resilience even at
the extreme condition of 40% malicious node participation.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation relies heavily on large-scale deep learning
models, such as UNet-based architectures. However, the real-world utility of
such models is limited by their high computational requirements, which makes
them impractical for resource-constrained environments such as primary care
facilities and conflict zones. Furthermore, shifts in the imaging domain can
render these models ineffective and even compromise patient safety if such
errors go undetected. To address these challenges, we propose M3D-NCA, a novel
methodology that leverages Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) segmentation for 3D
medical images using n-level patchification. Moreover, we exploit the variance
in M3D-NCA to develop a novel quality metric which can automatically detect
errors in the segmentation process of NCAs. M3D-NCA outperforms the two
magnitudes larger UNet models in hippocampus and prostate segmentation by 2%
Dice and can be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB RAM). This highlights the
potential of M3D-NCA as an effective and efficient alternative for medical
image segmentation in resource-constrained environments.

<p class="mathjax">Legal case retrieval plays an important role for legal practitioners to
effectively retrieve relevant cases given a query case. Most existing neural
legal case retrieval models directly encode the whole legal text of a case to
generate a case representation, which is then utilised to conduct a nearest
neighbour search for retrieval. Although these straightforward methods have
achieved improvement over conventional statistical methods in retrieval
accuracy, two significant challenges are identified in this paper: (1) Legal
feature alignment: the usage of the whole case text as the input will generally
incorporate redundant and noisy information because, from the legal
perspective, the determining factor of relevant cases is the alignment of key
legal features instead of whole text matching; (2) Legal context preservation:
furthermore, since the existing text encoding models usually have an input
length limit shorter than the case, the whole case text needs to be truncated
or divided into paragraphs, which leads to the loss of the global context of
legal information. In this paper, a novel legal case retrieval framework,
PromptCase, is proposed to tackle these challenges. Firstly, legal facts and
legal issues are identified and formally defined as the key features
facilitating legal case retrieval based on a thorough study of the definition
of relevant cases from a legal perspective. Secondly, with the determining
legal features, a prompt-based encoding scheme is designed to conduct an
effective encoding with language models. Extensive zero-shot experiments have
been conducted on two benchmark datasets in legal case retrieval, which
demonstrate the superior retrieval effectiveness of the proposed PromptCase.
The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/PromptCase.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles are exposed to various weather during operation, which is
likely to trigger the performance limitations of the perception system, leading
to the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) problems. To efficiently
generate data for testing the performance of visual perception algorithms under
various weather conditions, a hierarchical-level rain image generative model,
rain conditional CycleGAN (RCCycleGAN), is constructed. RCCycleGAN is based on
the generative adversarial network (GAN) and can generate images of light,
medium, and heavy rain. Different rain intensities are introduced as labels in
conditional GAN (CGAN). Meanwhile, the model structure is optimized and the
training strategy is adjusted to alleviate the problem of mode collapse. In
addition, natural rain images of different intensities are collected and
processed for model training and validation. Compared with the two baseline
models, CycleGAN and DerainCycleGAN, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
RCCycleGAN on the test dataset is improved by 2.58 dB and 0.74 dB, and the
structural similarity (SSIM) is improved by 18% and 8%, respectively. The
ablation experiments are also carried out to validate the effectiveness of the
model tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstructing both objects and hands in 3D from a single RGB image is
complex. Existing methods rely on manually defined hand-object constraints in
Euclidean space, leading to suboptimal feature learning. Compared with
Euclidean space, hyperbolic space better preserves the geometric properties of
meshes thanks to its exponentially-growing space distance, which amplifies the
differences between the features based on similarity. In this work, we propose
the first precise hand-object reconstruction method in hyperbolic space, namely
Dynamic Hyperbolic Attention Network (DHANet), which leverages intrinsic
properties of hyperbolic space to learn representative features. Our method
that projects mesh and image features into a unified hyperbolic space includes
two modules, ie. dynamic hyperbolic graph convolution and image-attention
hyperbolic graph convolution. With these two modules, our method learns mesh
features with rich geometry-image multi-modal information and models better
hand-object interaction. Our method provides a promising alternative for fine
hand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Data charts are prevalent across various fields due to their efficacy in
conveying complex data relationships. However, static charts may sometimes
struggle to engage readers and efficiently present intricate information,
potentially resulting in limited understanding. We introduce "Live Charts," a
new format of presentation that decomposes complex information within a chart
and explains the information pieces sequentially through rich animations and
accompanying audio narration. We propose an automated approach to revive static
charts into Live Charts. Our method integrates GNN-based techniques to analyze
the chart components and extract data from charts. Then we adopt large natural
language models to generate appropriate animated visuals along with a
voice-over to produce Live Charts from static ones. We conducted a thorough
evaluation of our approach, which involved the model performance, use cases, a
crowd-sourced user study, and expert interviews. The results demonstrate Live
Charts offer a multi-sensory experience where readers can follow the
information and understand the data insights better. We analyze the benefits
and drawbacks of Live Charts over static charts as a new information
consumption experience.

<p class="mathjax">The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is known to suffer from the phenomenon of
\textit{posterior collapse}, where the latent representations generated by the
model become independent of the inputs. This leads to degenerated
representations of the input, which is attributed to the limitations of the
VAE's objective function. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this
issue, the Contrastive Regularization for Variational Autoencoders (CR-VAE).
The core of our approach is to augment the original VAE with a contrastive
objective that maximizes the mutual information between the representations of
similar visual inputs. This strategy ensures that the information flow between
the input and its latent representation is maximized, effectively avoiding
posterior collapse. We evaluate our method on a series of visual datasets and
demonstrate, that CR-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preventing
posterior collapse.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread proliferation of deep learning applications has triggered the
need to accelerate them directly in hardware. General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) kernels are elemental deep-learning constructs and they inherently map
onto Systolic Arrays (SAs). SAs are regular structures that are well-suited for
accelerating matrix multiplications. Typical SAs use a pipelined array of
Processing Elements (PEs), which communicate with local connections and
pre-orchestrated data movements. In this work, we show that the physical layout
of SAs should be asymmetric to minimize wirelength and improve energy
efficiency. The floorplan of the SA adjusts better to the asymmetric widths of
the horizontal and vertical data buses and their switching activity profiles.
It is demonstrated that such physically asymmetric SAs reduce interconnect
power by 9.1% when executing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) layers, as compared to SAs of the same size but with a square (i.e.,
symmetric) layout. The savings in interconnect power translate, in turn, to
2.1% overall power savings.

<p class="mathjax">The tracking of various fish species plays a profoundly significant role in
understanding the behavior of individual fish and their groups. Present
tracking methods suffer from issues of low accuracy or poor robustness. In
order to address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel tracking approach,
named FishMOT (Fish Multiple Object Tracking). This method combines object
detection techniques with the IoU matching algorithm, thereby achieving
efficient, precise, and robust fish detection and tracking. Diverging from
other approaches, this method eliminates the need for multiple feature
extractions and identity assignments for each individual, instead directly
utilizing the output results of the detector for tracking, thereby
significantly reducing computational time and storage space. Furthermore, this
method imposes minimal requirements on factors such as video quality and
variations in individual appearance. As long as the detector can accurately
locate and identify fish, effective tracking can be achieved. This approach
enhances robustness and generalizability. Moreover, the algorithm employed in
this method addresses the issue of missed detections without relying on complex
feature matching or graph optimization algorithms. This contributes to improved
accuracy and reliability. Experimental trials were conducted in the open-source
video dataset provided by idtracker.ai, and comparisons were made with
state-of-the-art detector-based multi-object tracking methods. Additionally,
comparisons were made with idtracker.ai and TRex, two tools that demonstrate
exceptional performance in the field of animal tracking. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches in
various evaluation metrics, exhibiting faster speed and lower memory
requirements. The source codes and pre-trained models are available at:

<p class="mathjax">Humans excel at robust bipedal walking in complex natural environments. In
each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle
dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground
conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system
resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control
problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer
simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization
target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or
reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular
motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating
for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently
achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the
generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required
extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often
results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,
especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional
musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without
sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach
to studying human walking in complex natural environments.

<p class="mathjax">Online health communities (OHCs) are forums where patients with similar
conditions communicate their experiences and provide moral support. Social
support in OHCs plays a crucial role in easing and rehabilitating patients.
However, many time-sensitive questions from patients often remain unanswered
due to the multitude of threads and the random nature of patient visits in
OHCs. To address this issue, it is imperative to propose a recommender system
that assists solution seekers in finding appropriate problem helpers.
Nevertheless, developing a recommendation algorithm to enhance social support
in OHCs remains an under-explored area. Traditional recommender systems cannot
be directly adapted due to the following obstacles. First, unlike user-item
links in traditional recommender systems, it is hard to model the social
support behind helper-seeker links in OHCs since they are formed based on
various heterogeneous reasons. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the
impact of historical activities in characterizing patients. Third, it is
significantly challenging to ensure that the recommended helpers possess
sufficient expertise to assist the seekers. To tackle the aforementioned
challenges, we develop a Monotonically regularIzed diseNTangled Variational
Autoencoders (MINT) model to strengthen social support in OHCs.

<p class="mathjax">Social Robots in human environments need to be able to reason about their
physical surroundings while interacting with people. Furthermore, human
proxemics behaviours around robots can indicate how people perceive the robots
and can inform robot personality and interaction design. Here, we introduce
Charlie, a situated robot receptionist that can interact with people using
verbal and non-verbal communication in a dynamic environment, where users might
enter or leave the scene at any time. The robot receptionist is stationary and
cannot navigate. Therefore, people have full control over their personal space
as they are the ones approaching the robot. We investigated the influence of
different apparent robot personalities on the proxemics behaviours of the
humans. The results indicate that different types of robot personalities,
specifically introversion and extroversion, can influence human proxemics
behaviours. Participants maintained shorter distances with the introvert robot
receptionist, compared to the extrovert robot. Interestingly, we observed that
human-robot proxemics were not the same as typical human-human interpersonal
distances, as defined in the literature. We therefore propose new proxemics
zones for human-robot interaction.

<p class="mathjax">The Ultra Weak Variational Formulation (UWVF) is a special Trefftz
discontinuous Galerkin method, here applied to the time-harmonic Maxwell's
equations. The method uses superpositions of plane waves to represent solutions
element by element on a finite element mesh. We discuss the use of our parallel
UWVF implementation called ParMax, and concentrate on methods for obtaining
high order solutions in the presence of scatterers with piecewise smooth
boundaries. In particular, we show how curved surface triangles can be
incorporated in the UWVF. This requires quadrature to assemble the system
matrices. We also show how to implement a total field and scattered field
approach, together with the transmission conditions across an interface to
handle resistive sheets. We note also that a wide variety of element shapes can
be used, that the elements can be large compared to the wavelength of the
radiation, and that a matrix free version is easy to implement (although
computationally costly). Our contributions are illustrated by several numerical
examples showing that curved elements can improve the efficiency of the UWVF,
and that the method accurately handles resistive screens as well as PEC and
penetrable scatterers. Using large curved elements and the matrix free
approach, we are able to simulate scattering from an aircraft at X-band
frequencies. The innovations here demonstrate the applicability of the UWVF for
industrial examples.

<p class="mathjax">Verona is a concurrent object-oriented programming language that organises
all the objects in a program into a forest of isolated regions. Memory is
managed locally for each region, so programmers can control a program's memory
use by adjusting objects' partition into regions, and by setting each region's
memory management strategy. A thread can only mutate (allocate, deallocate)
objects within one active region -- its "window of mutability". Memory
management costs are localised to the active region, ensuring overheads can be
predicted and controlled. Moving the mutability window between regions is
explicit, so code can be executed wherever it is required, yet programs remain
in control of memory use. An ownership type system based on reference
capabilities enforces region isolation, controlling aliasing within and between
regions, yet supporting objects moving between regions and threads. Data
accesses never need expensive atomic operations, and are always thread-safe.

method is rigorous proved, where $N$ denotes the number of time intervals, $p$
is the degree of polynomial approximation on each time subinterval, $h$ is the
maximum space step, $r\ge1$, $m$ is the order of finite element space, and
$\varepsilon&gt;0$ can be arbitrarily small. Numerical simulations verify the
theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty-based deep learning models have attracted a great deal of
interest for their ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions.
Evidential deep learning stands out achieving remarkable performance in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data with a single deterministic neural
network. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose the integration of an
evidential deep learning method into a continual learning framework in order to
perform simultaneously incremental object classification and OOD detection.
Moreover, we analyze the ability of vacuity and dissonance to differentiate
between in-distribution data belonging to old classes and OOD data. The
proposed method, called CEDL, is evaluated on CIFAR-100 considering two
settings consisting of 5 and 10 tasks, respectively. From the obtained results,
we could appreciate that the proposed method, in addition to provide comparable
results in object classification with respect to the baseline, largely
outperforms OOD detection compared to several posthoc methods on three
evaluation metrics: AUROC, AUPR and FPR95.

<p class="mathjax">We explore multi-log grasping using reinforcement learning and virtual visual
servoing for automated forwarding. Automation of forest processes is a major
challenge, and many techniques regarding robot control pose different
challenges due to the unstructured and harsh outdoor environment. Grasping
multiple logs involves problems of dynamics and path planning, where the
interaction between the grapple, logs, terrain, and obstacles requires visual
information. To address these challenges, we separate image segmentation from
crane control and utilize a virtual camera to provide an image stream from 3D
reconstructed data. We use Cartesian control to simplify domain transfer. Since
log piles are static, visual servoing using a 3D reconstruction of the pile and
its surroundings is equivalent to using real camera data until the point of
grasping. This relaxes the limit on computational resources and time for the
challenge of image segmentation, and allows for collecting data in situations
where the log piles are not occluded. The disadvantage is the lack of
information during grasping. We demonstrate that this problem is manageable and
present an agent that is 95% successful in picking one or several logs from
challenging piles of 2--5 logs.

<p class="mathjax">3D dense captioning requires a model to translate its understanding of an
input 3D scene into several captions associated with different object regions.
Existing methods adopt a sophisticated "detect-then-describe" pipeline, which
builds explicit relation modules upon a 3D detector with numerous hand-crafted
components. While these methods have achieved initial success, the cascade
pipeline tends to accumulate errors because of duplicated and inaccurate box
estimations and messy 3D scenes. In this paper, we first propose Vote2Cap-DETR,
a simple-yet-effective transformer framework that decouples the decoding
process of caption generation and object localization through parallel
decoding. Moreover, we argue that object localization and description
generation require different levels of scene understanding, which could be
challenging for a shared set of queries to capture. To this end, we propose an
advanced version, Vote2Cap-DETR++, which decouples the queries into
localization and caption queries to capture task-specific features.
Additionally, we introduce the iterative spatial refinement strategy to vote
queries for faster convergence and better localization performance. We also
insert additional spatial information to the caption head for more accurate
descriptions. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments on two commonly
used datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D, demonstrate Vote2Cap-DETR and
Vote2Cap-DETR++ surpass conventional "detect-then-describe" methods by a large
margin. Codes will be made available at
https://github.com/ch3cook-fdu/Vote2Cap-DETR.

<p class="mathjax">A recent empirical observation of activation sparsity in MLP layers offers an
opportunity to drastically reduce computation costs for free. Despite several
works attributing it to training dynamics, the theoretical explanation of
activation sparsity's emergence is restricted to shallow networks, small
training steps well as modified training, even though the sparsity has been
found in deep models trained by vanilla protocols for large steps. To fill the
three gaps, we propose the notion of gradient sparsity as the source of
activation sparsity and a theoretical explanation based on it that explains
gradient sparsity and then activation sparsity as necessary steps to
adversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is
approximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models. The theory
applies to standardly trained LayerNorm-ed pure MLPs, and further to
Transformers or other architectures if noises are added to weights during
training. To eliminate other sources of flatness when arguing sparsities'
necessity, we discover the phenomenon of spectral concentration, i.e., the
ratio between the largest and the smallest non-zero singular values of weight
matrices is small. We utilize random matrix theory (RMT) as a powerful
theoretical tool to analyze stochastic gradient noises and discuss the
emergence of spectral concentration. With these insights, we propose two
plug-and-play modules for both training from scratch and sparsity finetuning,
as well as one radical modification that only applies to from-scratch training.
Another under-testing module for both sparsity and flatness is also immediate
from our theories. Validational experiments are conducted to verify our
explanation. Experiments for productivity demonstrate modifications'
improvement in sparsity, indicating further theoretical cost reduction in both
training and inference.

<p class="mathjax">Solana has quickly emerged as a popular platform for building decentralized
applications (DApps), such as marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A
key reason for its success are Solana's low transaction fees and high
performance, which is achieved in part due to its stateless programming model.
Although the literature features extensive tooling support for smart contract
security, current solutions are largely tailored for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. Unfortunately, the very stateless nature of Solana's execution
environment introduces novel attack patterns specific to Solana requiring a
rethinking for building vulnerability analysis methods.
<br />In this paper, we address this gap and propose FuzzDelSol, the first
binary-only coverage-guided fuzzing architecture for Solana smart contracts.
FuzzDelSol faithfully models runtime specifics such as smart contract
interactions. Moreover, since source code is not available for the large
majority of Solana contracts, FuzzDelSol operates on the contract's binary
code. Hence, due to the lack of semantic information, we carefully extracted
low-level program and state information to develop a diverse set of bug oracles
covering all major bug classes in Solana. Our extensive evaluation on 6049
smart contracts shows that FuzzDelSol's bug oracles find bugs with a high
precision and recall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
evaluation of the security landscape on the Solana mainnet.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel method for 3D object reconstruction from a sparse set of
views captured from a 360-degree calibrated camera rig. We represent the object
surface through a hybrid model that uses both an MLP-based neural
representation and a triangle mesh. A key contribution in our work is a novel
object-centric sampling scheme of the neural representation, where rays are
shared among all views. This efficiently concentrates and reduces the number of
samples used to update the neural model at each iteration. This sampling scheme
relies on the mesh representation to ensure also that samples are
well-distributed along its normals. The rendering is then performed efficiently
by a differentiable renderer. We demonstrate that this sampling scheme results
in a more effective training of the neural representation, does not require the
additional supervision of segmentation masks, yields state of the art 3D
reconstructions, and works with sparse views on the Google's Scanned Objects,
Tank and Temples and MVMC Car datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The edge computing paradigm helps handle the Internet of Things (IoT)
generated data in proximity to its source. Challenges occur in transferring,
storing, and processing this rapidly growing amount of data on
resource-constrained edge devices. Symbolic Representation (SR) algorithms are
promising solutions to reduce the data size by converting actual raw data into
symbols. Also, they allow data analytics (e.g., anomaly detection and trend
prediction) directly on symbols, benefiting large classes of edge applications.
However, existing SR algorithms are centralized in design and work offline with
batch data, which is infeasible for real-time cases. We propose SymED -
Symbolic Edge Data representation method, i.e., an online, adaptive, and
distributed approach for symbolic representation of data on edge. SymED is
based on the Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Aggregation (ABBA), where we assume
low-powered IoT devices do initial data compression (senders) and the more
robust edge devices do the symbolic conversion (receivers). We evaluate SymED
by measuring compression performance, reconstruction accuracy through Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) distance, and computational latency. The results show that
SymED is able to (i) reduce the raw data with an average compression rate of
9.5%; (ii) keep a low reconstruction error of 13.25 in the DTW space; (iii)
simultaneously provide real-time adaptability for online streaming IoT data at
typical latencies of 42ms per symbol, reducing the overall network traffic.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world Super-Resolution (real-SR) methods focus on dealing with diverse
real-world images and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The
key idea is to use a complex and high-order degradation model to mimic
real-world degradations. Although they have achieved impressive results in
various scenarios, they are faced with the obstacle of evaluation. Currently,
these methods are only assessed by their average performance on a small set of
degradation cases randomly selected from a large space, which fails to provide
a comprehensive understanding of their overall performance and often yields
biased results. To overcome the limitation in evaluation, we propose SEAL, a
framework for systematic evaluation of real-SR. In particular, we cluster the
extensive degradation space to create a set of representative degradation
cases, which serves as a comprehensive test set. Next, we propose a
coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol to measure the distributed and relative
performance of real-SR methods on the test set. The protocol incorporates two
new metrics: acceptance rate (AR) and relative performance ratio (RPR), derived
from an acceptance line and an excellence line. Under SEAL, we benchmark
existing real-SR methods, obtain new observations and insights into their
performance, and develop a new strong baseline. We consider SEAL as the first
step towards creating an unbiased and comprehensive evaluation platform, which
can promote the development of real-SR.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graph embeddings are dense numerical representations of entities in
a knowledge graph (KG). While the majority of approaches concentrate only on
relational information, i.e., relations between entities, fewer approaches
exist which also take information about literal values (e.g., textual
descriptions or numerical information) into account. Those which exist are
typically tailored towards a particular modality of literal and a particular
embedding method. In this paper, we propose a set of universal preprocessing
operators which can be used to transform KGs with literals for numerical,
temporal, textual, and image information, so that the transformed KGs can be
embedded with any method. The results on the kgbench dataset with three

<p class="mathjax">The objective of the multi-condition human motion synthesis task is to
incorporate diverse conditional inputs, encompassing various forms like text,
music, speech, and more. This endows the task with the capability to adapt
across multiple scenarios, ranging from text-to-motion and music-to-dance,
among others. While existing research has primarily focused on single
conditions, the multi-condition human motion generation remains underexplored.
In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing MCM, a novel paradigm
for motion synthesis that spans multiple scenarios under diverse conditions.
The MCM framework is able to integrate with any DDPM-like diffusion model to
accommodate multi-conditional information input while preserving its generative
capabilities. Specifically, MCM employs two-branch architecture consisting of a
main branch and a control branch. The control branch shares the same structure
as the main branch and is initialized with the parameters of the main branch,
effectively maintaining the generation ability of the main branch and
supporting multi-condition input. We also introduce a Transformer-based
diffusion model MWNet (DDPM-like) as our main branch that can capture the
spatial complexity and inter-joint correlations in motion sequences through a
channel-dimension self-attention module. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate
that our approach achieves SoTA results in both text-to-motion and competitive
results in music-to-dance tasks, comparable to task-specific methods.
Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows that MCM not only streamlines the

<p class="mathjax">With Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) potentially leading to fatal
complications in patients due to the formation of cysts in the kidneys, early
detection of PKD is crucial for effective management of the condition. However,
the various patient-specific factors that play a role in the diagnosis make it
an intricate puzzle for clinicians to solve. Therefore, in this study, we aim
to utilize a deep learning-based approach for early disease detection. The
devised neural network can achieve accurate and robust predictions for possible
PKD in patients by analyzing patient gene expressions.

<p class="mathjax">Partially spoofed audio detection is a challenging task, lying in the need to
accurately locate the authenticity of audio at the frame level. To address this
issue, we propose a fine-grained partially spoofed audio detection method,
namely Temporal Deepfake Location (TDL), which can effectively capture
information of both features and locations. Specifically, our approach involves
two novel parts: embedding similarity module and temporal convolution
operation. To enhance the identification between the real and fake features,
the embedding similarity module is designed to generate an embedding space that
can separate the real frames from fake frames. To effectively concentrate on
the position information, temporal convolution operation is proposed to
calculate the frame-specific similarities among neighboring frames, and
dynamically select informative neighbors to convolution. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperform baseline models in ASVspoof2019 Partial Spoof
dataset and demonstrate superior performance even in the crossdataset scenario.
The code is released online.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper the Micro-Macro Parareal algorithm was adapted to PDEs. The
parallel-in-time approach requires two meshes of different spatial resolution
in order to compute approximations in an iterative way to a predefined
reference solution. When fast convergence in few iterations can be accomplished
the algorithm is able to generate wall-time reduction in comparison to the
serial computation. We chose the laminar flow around a cylinder benchmark on
2-dimensional domain which was simulated with the open-source software
OpenFoam. The numerical experiments presented in this work aim to approximate
states local in time and space and the diagnostic lift coefficient. The
Reynolds number is gradually increased from 100 to 1,000, before the transition
to turbulent flows sets in. After the results are presented the convergence
behavior is discussed with respect to the Reynolds number and the applied
interpolation schemes.

<p class="mathjax">The upper mid-band -- roughly from 7 to 24 GHz -- has attracted considerable
recent interest for new cellular services. This frequency range has vastly more
spectrum than the highly congested bands below 7 GHz while offering more
favorable propagation and coverage than the millimeter wave (mmWave)
frequencies. Realizing the full potential of these bands, however, will require
fundamental changes to the design of cellular systems. Most importantly,
spectrum will likely need to be shared with incumbents including communication
satellites, military RADAR, and radio astronomy. Also, due to the wide
bandwidth, directional nature of transmission, and intermittent occupancy of
incumbents, cellular systems will need to be agile to sense and intelligently
use large spatial and bandwidth degrees of freedom. This paper attempts to
provide an initial assessment of the feasibility and potential gains of
wideband cellular systems operating in the upper mid-band. The study includes:
(1) a system study to assess potential gains of multi-band systems in a
representative dense urban environment; (2) propagation calculations to assess
potential cross interference between satellites and terrestrial cellular
services; and (3) design and evaluation of a compact multi-band antenna array
structure. Leveraging these preliminary results, we identify potential future
research directions to realize next-generation systems in these frequencies.

<p class="mathjax">The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are pivotal information for
proactive cybersecurity measures, including service patching, security
hardening, and more. However, CVEs typically offer low-level, product-oriented
descriptions of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, often lacking
the essential attack semantic information required for comprehensive weakness
characterization and threat impact estimation. This critical insight is
essential for CVE prioritization and the identification of potential
countermeasures, particularly when dealing with a large number of CVEs. Current
industry practices involve manual evaluation of CVEs to assess their attack
severities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and mapping
them to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for potential mitigation
identification. Unfortunately, this manual analysis presents a major bottleneck
in the vulnerability analysis process, leading to slowdowns in proactive
cybersecurity efforts and the potential for inaccuracies due to human errors.
In this research, we introduce our novel predictive model and tool (called
CVEDrill) which revolutionizes CVE analysis and threat prioritization. CVEDrill
accurately estimates the CVSS vector for precise threat mitigation and priority
ranking and seamlessly automates the classification of CVEs into the
appropriate CWE hierarchy classes. By harnessing CVEDrill, organizations can
now implement cybersecurity countermeasure mitigation with unparalleled
accuracy and timeliness, surpassing in this domain the capabilities of
state-of-the-art tools like ChaptGPT.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work demonstrated the existence of Boolean functions for which Shapley
values provide misleading information about the relative importance of features
in rule-based explanations. Such misleading information was broadly categorized
into a number of possible issues. Each of those issues relates with features
being relevant or irrelevant for a prediction, and all are significant
regarding the inadequacy of Shapley values for rule-based explainability. This
earlier work devised a brute-force approach to identify Boolean functions,
defined on small numbers of features, and also associated instances, which
displayed such inadequacy-revealing issues, and so served as evidence to the
inadequacy of Shapley values for rule-based explainability. However, an
outstanding question is how frequently such inadequacy-revealing issues can
occur for Boolean functions with arbitrary large numbers of features. It is
plain that a brute-force approach would be unlikely to provide insights on how
to tackle this question. This paper answers the above question by proving that,
for any number of features, there exist Boolean functions that exhibit one or
more inadequacy-revealing issues, thereby contributing decisive arguments
against the use of Shapley values as the theoretical underpinning of
feature-attribution methods in explainability.

<p class="mathjax">In the past couple of decades, significant research efforts are devoted to
the prediction of software bugs. However, most existing work in this domain
treats all bugs the same, which is not the case in practice. It is important
for a defect prediction method to estimate the severity of the identified bugs
so that the higher-severity ones get immediate attention. In this study, we
investigate source code metrics, source code representation using large
language models (LLMs), and their combination in predicting bug severity labels
of two prominent datasets. We leverage several source metrics at method-level
granularity to train eight different machine-learning models. Our results
suggest that Decision Tree and Random Forest models outperform other models
regarding our several evaluation metrics. We then use the pre-trained CodeBERT
LLM to study the source code representations' effectiveness in predicting bug
severity. CodeBERT finetuning improves the bug severity prediction results
significantly in the range of 29%-140% for several evaluation metrics, compared
to the best classic prediction model on source code metric. Finally, we
integrate source code metrics into CodeBERT as an additional input, using our
two proposed architectures, which both enhance the CodeBERT model
effectiveness.

applications as it helps identify when a model encounters inputs that are
outside the training distribution. Most industrial pipelines rely on

This paper investigates the performance of those models on the task of
out-of-domain detection. Our experiments demonstrate that pre-trained
transformers models achieve higher detection performance out of the box.
Furthermore, we show that pre-trained ViT and CNNs can be combined with

<p class="mathjax">In surgical computer vision applications, obtaining labeled training data is
challenging due to data-privacy concerns and the need for expert annotation.
Unpaired image-to-image translation techniques have been explored to
automatically generate large annotated datasets by translating synthetic images
to the realistic domain. However, preserving the structure and semantic
consistency between the input and translated images presents significant
challenges, mainly when there is a distributional mismatch in the semantic
characteristics of the domains. This study empirically investigates unpaired
image translation methods for generating suitable data in surgical
applications, explicitly focusing on semantic consistency. We extensively
evaluate various state-of-the-art image translation models on two challenging
surgical datasets and downstream semantic segmentation tasks. We find that a
simple combination of structural-similarity loss and contrastive learning
yields the most promising results. Quantitatively, we show that the data
generated with this approach yields higher semantic consistency and can be used
more effectively as training data.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown unparalleled achievements in numerous
applications, reflecting their proficiency in managing vast data sets. Yet,
their static structure limits their adaptability in ever-changing environments.
This research presents a new algorithm that allows the convolutional layer of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to dynamically evolve based on data input,
while still being seamlessly integrated into existing DNNs. Instead of a rigid
architecture, our approach iteratively introduces kernels to the convolutional
layer, gauging its real-time response to varying data. This process is refined
by evaluating the layer's capacity to discern image features, guiding its
growth. Remarkably, our unsupervised method has outstripped its supervised
counterparts across diverse datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100. It also showcases enhanced adaptability in transfer learning
scenarios. By introducing a data-driven model scalability strategy, we are
filling a void in deep learning, leading to more flexible and efficient DNNs
suited for dynamic settings.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving has long grappled with the need for precise absolute
localization, making full autonomy elusive and raising the capital entry
barriers for startups. This study delves into the feasibility of local
trajectory planning for level-2+ (L2+) semi-autonomous vehicles without the
dependence on accurate absolute localization. Instead, we emphasize the
estimation of the pose change between consecutive planning frames from motion
sensors and integration of relative locations of traffic objects to the local
planning problem under the ego car's local coordinate system, therefore
eliminating the need for an absolute localization. Without the availability of
absolute localization for correction, the measurement errors of speed and yaw
rate greatly affect the estimation accuracy of the relative pose change between
frames. We proved that the feasibility/stability of the continuous planning
problem under such motion sensor errors can be guaranteed at certain defined
conditions. This was achieved by formulating it as a Lyapunov-stability
analysis problem. Moreover, a simulation pipeline was developed to further
validate the proposed local planning method. Simulations were conducted at two
traffic scenes with different error settings for speed and yaw rate
measurements. The results substantiate the proposed framework's functionality
even under relatively inferior sensor errors. We also experiment the stability
limits of the planned results under abnormally larger motion sensor errors. The
results provide a good match to the previous theoretical analysis. Our findings
suggested that precise absolute localization may not be the sole path to
achieving reliable trajectory planning, eliminating the necessity for
high-accuracy dual-antenna GPS as well as the high-fidelity maps for SLAM
localization.

<p class="mathjax">Numerous companies have started offering services based on large language
models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, which inevitably raises privacy concerns as
users' prompts are exposed to the model provider. Previous research on secure
reasoning using multi-party computation (MPC) has proven to be impractical for
LLM applications due to its time-consuming and communication-intensive nature.
While lightweight anonymization techniques can protect private information in
prompts through substitution or masking, they fail to recover sensitive data
replaced in the LLM-generated results. In this paper, we expand the application
scenarios of anonymization techniques by training a small local model to
de-anonymize the LLM's returned results with minimal computational overhead. We
introduce the HaS framework, where "H(ide)" and "S(eek)" represent its two core
processes: hiding private entities for anonymization and seeking private
entities for de-anonymization, respectively. To quantitatively assess HaS's
privacy protection performance, we propose both black-box and white-box
adversarial models. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to evaluate HaS's
usability in translation and classification tasks. The experimental findings
demonstrate that the HaS framework achieves an optimal balance between privacy
protection and utility.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the performance of reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided spatial shift keying (SSK) wireless communication systems
in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, we
analyze the average bit error probability (ABEP) of two RIS-SSK systems
respectively based on intelligent reflection and blind reflection of RIS. For
the intelligent RIS-SSK scheme, we first derive the conditional pairwise error
probability of the composite channel through maximum likelihood (ML) detection.
Subsequently, we derive the probability density function of the combined
channel. Due to the intricacies of the composite channel formulation, an exact
closed-form ABEP expression is unattainable through direct derivation. To this
end, we resort to employing the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method to
estimate the results. In addition, we employ the Q-function approximation to
derive the non-exact closed-form expression when CSI imperfections are present.
For the blind RIS-SSK scheme, we derive both closed-form ABEP expression and
asymptotic ABEP expression with imperfect CSI by adopting the ML detector. To
offer deeper insights, we explore the impact of discrete reflection phase
shifts on the performance of the RIS-SSK system. Lastly, we extensively
validate all the analytical derivations using Monte Carlo simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Many areas of machine learning and science involve large linear algebra
problems, such as eigendecompositions, solving linear systems, computing matrix
exponentials, and trace estimation. The matrices involved often have Kronecker,
convolutional, block diagonal, sum, or product structure. In this paper, we
propose a simple but general framework for large-scale linear algebra problems
in machine learning, named CoLA (Compositional Linear Algebra). By combining a
linear operator abstraction with compositional dispatch rules, CoLA
automatically constructs memory and runtime efficient numerical algorithms.
Moreover, CoLA provides memory efficient automatic differentiation, low
precision computation, and GPU acceleration in both JAX and PyTorch, while also
accommodating new objects, operations, and rules in downstream packages via
multiple dispatch. CoLA can accelerate many algebraic operations, while making
it easy to prototype matrix structures and algorithms, providing an appealing
drop-in tool for virtually any computational effort that requires linear
algebra. We showcase its efficacy across a broad range of applications,
including partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, equivariant model
construction, and unsupervised learning.

<p class="mathjax">Image restoration aims to recover the high-quality images from their degraded
observations. Since most existing methods have been dedicated into single
degradation removal, they may not yield optimal results on other types of
degradations, which do not satisfy the applications in real world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a novel data ingredient-oriented approach that leverages
prompt-based learning to enable a single model to efficiently tackle multiple
image degradation tasks. Specifically, we utilize a encoder to capture features
and introduce prompts with degradation-specific information to guide the
decoder in adaptively recovering images affected by various degradations. In
order to model the local invariant properties and non-local information for
high-quality image restoration, we combined CNNs operations and Transformers.
Simultaneously, we made several key designs in the Transformer blocks
(multi-head rearranged attention with prompts and simple-gate feed-forward
network) to reduce computational requirements and selectively determines what
information should be persevered to facilitate efficient recovery of
potentially sharp images. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature fusion
mechanism further explores the multi-scale information to improve the
aggregated features. The resulting tightly interlinked hierarchy architecture,
named as CAPTNet, despite being designed to handle different types of
degradations, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs
competitively to the task-specific algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Influencer marketing involves a wide range of strategies in which brands
collaborate with popular content creators (i.e., influencers) to leverage their
reach, trust, and impact on their audience to promote and endorse products or
services. Because followers of influencers are more likely to buy a product
after receiving an authentic product endorsement rather than an explicit direct
product promotion, the line between personal opinions and commercial content
promotion is frequently blurred. This makes automatic detection of regulatory
compliance breaches related to influencer advertising (e.g., misleading
advertising or hidden sponsorships) particularly difficult. In this work, we
(1) introduce a new Twitter (now X) dataset consisting of 15,998 influencer
posts mapped into commercial and non-commercial categories for assisting in the
automatic detection of commercial influencer content; (2) experiment with an
extensive set of predictive models that combine text and visual information
showing that our proposed cross-attention approach outperforms state-of-the-art
multimodal models; and (3) conduct a thorough analysis of strengths and
limitations of our models. We show that multimodal modeling is useful for
identifying commercial posts, reducing the amount of false positives, and
capturing relevant context that aids in the discovery of undisclosed commercial
posts.

<p class="mathjax">Similar to the revolution of open source code sharing, Artificial
Intelligence (AI) model sharing is gaining increased popularity. However, the
fast adaptation in the industry, lack of awareness, and ability to exploit the
models make them significant attack vectors. By embedding malware in neurons,
the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the neural
network's performance. The covert attack will use the Least Significant Bits
(LSB) weight attack since LSB has a minimal effect on the model accuracy, and
as a result, the user will not notice it. Since there are endless ways to hide
the attacks, we focus on a zero-trust prevention strategy based on AI model
attack disarm and reconstruction. We proposed three types of model
steganography weight disarm defense mechanisms. The first two are based on
random bit substitution noise, and the other on model weight quantization. We
demonstrate a 100\% prevention rate while the methods introduce a minimal
decrease in model accuracy based on Qint8 and K-LRBP methods, which is an
essential factor for improving AI security.

<p class="mathjax">On-line handwritten character segmentation is often associated with
handwriting recognition and even though recognition models include mechanisms
to locate relevant positions during the recognition process, it is typically
insufficient to produce a precise segmentation. Decoupling the segmentation
from the recognition unlocks the potential to further utilize the result of the
recognition. We specifically focus on the scenario where the transcription is
known beforehand, in which case the character segmentation becomes an
assignment problem between sampling points of the stylus trajectory and
characters in the text. Inspired by the $k$-means clustering algorithm, we view
it from the perspective of cluster assignment and present a Transformer-based
architecture where each cluster is formed based on a learned character query in
the Transformer decoder block. In order to assess the quality of our approach,
we create character segmentation ground truths for two popular on-line
handwriting datasets, IAM-OnDB and HANDS-VNOnDB, and evaluate multiple methods
on them, demonstrating that our approach achieves the overall best results.

theoretic analysis and experiments, our algorithm for injectivity can save much

<p class="mathjax">At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, fears grew that making vaccination
a political (instead of public health) issue may impact the efficacy of this
life-saving intervention, spurring the spread of vaccine-hesitant content. In
this study, we examine whether there is a relationship between the political
interest of social media users and their exposure to vaccine-hesitant content
on Twitter. We focus on 17 European countries using a multilingual,
longitudinal dataset of tweets spanning the period before COVID, up to the
vaccine roll-out. We find that, in most countries, users' exposure to
vaccine-hesitant content is the highest in the early months of the pandemic,
around the time of greatest scientific uncertainty. Further, users who follow
politicians from right-wing parties, and those associated with authoritarian or
anti-EU stances are more likely to be exposed to vaccine-hesitant content,
whereas those following left-wing politicians, more pro-EU or liberal parties,
are less likely to encounter it. Somewhat surprisingly, politicians did not
play an outsized role in the vaccine debates of their countries, receiving a
similar number of retweets as other similarly popular users. This systematic,
multi-country, longitudinal investigation of the connection of politics with
vaccine hesitancy has important implications for public health policy and
communication.

<p class="mathjax">Data is a critical asset in AI, as high-quality datasets can significantly
improve the performance of machine learning models. In safety-critical domains
such as autonomous vehicles, offline deep reinforcement learning (offline DRL)
is frequently used to train models on pre-collected datasets, as opposed to
training these models by interacting with the real-world environment as the
online DRL. To support the development of these models, many institutions make
datasets publicly available with opensource licenses, but these datasets are at
risk of potential misuse or infringement. Injecting watermarks to the dataset
may protect the intellectual property of the data, but it cannot handle
datasets that have already been published and is infeasible to be altered
afterward. Other existing solutions, such as dataset inference and membership
inference, do not work well in the offline DRL scenario due to the diverse
model behavior characteristics and offline setting constraints. In this paper,
we advocate a new paradigm by leveraging the fact that cumulative rewards can
act as a unique identifier that distinguishes DRL models trained on a specific
dataset. To this end, we propose ORL-AUDITOR, which is the first
trajectory-level dataset auditing mechanism for offline RL scenarios. Our
experiments on multiple offline DRL models and tasks reveal the efficacy of
ORL-AUDITOR, with auditing accuracy over 95% and false positive rates less than
2.88%. We also provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of
ORL-AUDITOR by studying various parameter settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the auditing capability of ORL-AUDITOR on open-source datasets from Google and
DeepMind, highlighting its effectiveness in auditing published datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are the best
algorithms so far for solving large-scale incomplete information games.
Building upon CFR, this paper proposes a new algorithm named Pure CFR (PCFR)
for achieving better performance. PCFR can be seen as a combination of CFR and
Fictitious Play (FP), inheriting the concept of counterfactual regret (value)
from CFR, and using the best response strategy instead of the regret matching
strategy for the next iteration. Our theoretical proof that PCFR can achieve
Blackwell approachability enables PCFR's ability to combine with any CFR
variant including Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). The resultant Pure MCCFR (PMCCFR)
can significantly reduce time and space complexity. Particularly, the
convergence speed of PMCCFR is at least three times more than that of MCCFR. In
addition, since PMCCFR does not pass through the path of strictly dominated
strategies, we developed a new warm-start algorithm inspired by the strictly
dominated strategies elimination method. Consequently, the PMCCFR with new warm
start algorithm can converge by two orders of magnitude faster than the CFR+
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new, efficient procedure to establish Markov equivalence between
directed graphs that may or may not contain cycles under the
\textit{d}-separation criterion. It is based on the Cyclic Equivalence Theorem
(CET) in the seminal works on cyclic models by Thomas Richardson in the mid
'90s, but now rephrased from an ancestral perspective. The resulting
characterization leads to a procedure for establishing Markov equivalence
between graphs that no longer requires tests for d-separation, leading to a
significantly reduced algorithmic complexity. The conceptually simplified
characterization may help to reinvigorate theoretical research towards sound
and complete cyclic discovery in the presence of latent confounders. This
version includes a correction to rule (iv) in Theorem 1, and the subsequent
adjustment in part 2 of Algorithm 2.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, many people frequently have to search for new accommodation
options. Searching for a suitable apartment is a time-consuming process,
especially because visiting them is often mandatory to assess the truthfulness
of the advertisements found on the Web. While this process could be alleviated
by visiting the apartments in the metaverse, the Web-based recommendation
platforms are not suitable for the task. To address this shortcoming, in this
paper, we define a new problem called text-to-apartment recommendation, which
requires ranking the apartments based on their relevance to a textual query
expressing the user's interests. To tackle this problem, we introduce FArMARe,
a multi-task approach that supports cross-modal contrastive training with a
furniture-aware objective. Since public datasets related to indoor scenes do
not contain detailed descriptions of the furniture, we collect and annotate a
dataset comprising more than 6000 apartments. A thorough experimentation with
three different methods and two raw feature extraction procedures reveals the
effectiveness of FArMARe in dealing with the problem at hand.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we develop the numerical inverse scattering transform (NIST)
for solving the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation. The key
technique involves formulating a Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) that is
associated with the initial value problem and solving it numerically. Before
solving the RHP, two essential operations need to be carried out. Firstly,
high-precision numerical calculations are performed on the scattering data.
Secondly, the RHP is deformed using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent
method. The DNLS equation has a continuous spectrum consisting of the real and
imaginary axes and features three saddle points, which introduces complexity
not encountered in previous NIST approaches. In our numerical inverse
scattering method, we divide the $(x,t)$-plane into three regions and propose
specific deformations for each region. These strategies not only help reduce
computational costs but also minimize errors in the calculations. Unlike
traditional numerical methods, the NIST does not rely on time-stepping to
compute the solution. Instead, it directly solves the associated
Riemann-Hilbert problem. This unique characteristic of the NIST eliminates
convergence issues typically encountered in other numerical approaches and
proves to be more effective, especially for long-time simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has been successfully applied to various fields of
scientific computing in recent years. In this work, we propose a sparse radial
basis function neural network method to solve elliptic partial differential
equations (PDEs) with multiscale coefficients. Inspired by the deep mixed
residual method, we rewrite the second-order problem into a first-order system
and employ multiple radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to
approximate unknown functions in the system. To aviod the overfitting due to
the simplicity of RBFNN, an additional regularization is introduced in the loss
function. Thus the loss function contains two parts: the $L_2$ loss for the
residual of the first-order system and boundary conditions, and the $\ell_1$
regularization term for the weights of radial basis functions (RBFs). An
algorithm for optimizing the specific loss function is introduced to accelerate
the training process. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are
demonstrated through a collection of multiscale problems with scale separation,
discontinuity and multiple scales from one to three dimensions. Notably, the
$\ell_1$ regularization can achieve the goal of representing the solution by
fewer RBFs. As a consequence, the total number of RBFs scales like
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-n\tau})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the smallest scale,
$n$ is the dimensionality, and $\tau$ is typically smaller than $1$. It is
worth mentioning that the proposed method not only has the numerical
convergence and thus provides a reliable numerical solution in three dimensions
when a classical method is typically not affordable, but also outperforms most
other available machine learning methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Object detectors are at the heart of many semi- and fully autonomous decision
systems and are poised to become even more indispensable. They are, however,
still lacking in accessibility and can sometimes produce unreliable
predictions. Especially concerning in this regard are the -- essentially
hand-crafted -- non-maximum suppression algorithms that lead to an obfuscated
prediction process and biased confidence estimates. We show that we can
eliminate classic NMS-style post-processing by using IoU-aware calibration.
IoU-aware calibration is a conditional Beta calibration; this makes it
parallelizable with no hyper-parameters. Instead of arbitrary cutoffs or
discounts, it implicitly accounts for the likelihood of each detection being a
duplicate and adjusts the confidence score accordingly, resulting in
empirically based precision estimates for each detection. Our extensive
experiments on diverse detection architectures show that the proposed IoU-aware
calibration can successfully model duplicate detections and improve
calibration. Compared to the standard sequential NMS and calibration approach,
our joint modeling can deliver performance gains over the best NMS-based
alternative while producing consistently better-calibrated confidence
predictions with less complexity. The
\hyperlink{https://github.com/Blueblue4/IoU-AwareCalibration}{code} for all our
experiments is publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge to ensuring the rapid transition of robotic systems from the
industrial sector to more ubiquitous applications is the development of
algorithms that can guarantee safe operation while in close proximity to
humans. Motion planning and control methods, for instance, must be able to
certify safety while operating in real-time in arbitrary environments and in
the presence of model uncertainty. This paper proposes Wrench Analysis for
Inertial Transport using Reachability (WAITR), a certifiably safe motion
planning and control framework for serial link manipulators that manipulate
unsecured objects in arbitrary environments. WAITR uses reachability analysis
to construct over-approximations of the contact wrench applied to unsecured
objects, which captures uncertainty in the manipulator dynamics, the object
dynamics, and contact parameters such as the coefficient of friction. An
optimization problem formulation is presented that can be solved in real-time
to generate provably-safe motions for manipulating the unsecured objects. This
paper illustrates that WAITR outperforms state of the art methods in a variety
of simulation experiments and demonstrates its performance in the real-world.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic state estimation, as opposed to kinematic state estimation, seeks to
estimate not only the orientation of a rigid body but also its angular
velocity, through Euler's equations of rotational motion. This paper
demonstrates that the dynamic state estimation problem can be reformulated as
estimating a probability distribution on a Lie group defined on phase space
(the product space of rotation and angular momentum). The propagation equations
are derived non-parametrically for the mean and covariance of the distribution.
It is also shown that the equations can be approximately solved by ignoring the
third and higher moments of the probability distribution. Numerical experiments
show that the distribution constructed from the propagated mean and covariance
fits the sample data better than an extended Kalman filter.

<p class="mathjax">Automated detection of defects in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing
using Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) and Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)
machines can help improve operational efficiency and significantly reduce the
need for manual intervention. In this paper, using SPI-extracted features of 6
million pins, we demonstrate a data-centric approach to train Machine Learning
(ML) models to detect PCB defects at three stages of PCB manufacturing. The 6
million PCB pins correspond to 2 million components that belong to 15,387 PCBs.
Using a base extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) ML model, we iterate on the
data pre-processing step to improve detection performance. Combining pin-level
SPI features using component and PCB IDs, we developed training instances also
at the component and PCB level. This allows the ML model to capture any
inter-pin, inter-component, or spatial effects that may not be apparent at the
pin level. Models are trained at the pin, component, and PCB levels, and the
detection results from the different models are combined to identify defective
components.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are versatile and
can solve different tasks due to their emergent ability and generalizability.
However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which
would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works,
additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved
knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of
lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules:
1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2)
would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized
for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver
(KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge
bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design
a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision
sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot
manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and
therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct
experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and
found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large
margin.

<p class="mathjax">Reward models (RMs) are crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences for improving interaction quality. However, the real world is
pluralistic, which leads to diversified human preferences based on different
religions, politics, cultures, etc. Moreover, each individual can have their
own unique preferences on various topics. Neglecting the diversity of human
preferences, current LLM training processes only use a general reward model,
which is below satisfaction for customized or personalized application
scenarios. To explore customized preference learning, we collect a
domain-specific preference (DSP) dataset, which collects preferred responses to
each given query from four practical domains. Besides, from the perspective of
data efficiency, we proposed a three-stage customized RM learning scheme, whose
effectiveness is empirically verified on both general preference datasets and
our DSP set. Furthermore, we test multiple training and data strategies on the
three learning stages, and have found several ways to better preserve the
general preferring ability while training the customized RMs, especially
general preference enrichment and customized preference imitation learning. The
DSP dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Linear95/DSP.

<p class="mathjax">The most prevalent smart card-based payment method, EMV, currently offers no
privacy to its users. Transaction details and the card number are sent in
cleartext, enabling the profiling and tracking of cardholders. Since public
awareness of privacy issues is growing and legislation, such as GDPR, is
emerging, we believe it is necessary to investigate the possibility of making
payments anonymous and unlinkable without compromising essential security
guarantees and functional properties of EMV. This paper draws attention to
trade-offs between functional and privacy requirements in the design of such a
protocol. We present the UTX protocol - an enhanced payment protocol satisfying
such requirements, and we formally certify key security and privacy properties
using techniques based on the applied pi-calculus.

<p class="mathjax">Human dexterity is a hallmark of motor control. Our hands can rapidly
synthesize new behaviors despite the complexity (multi-articular and
multi-joints, with 23 joints controlled by more than 40 muscles) of
musculoskeletal sensory-motor circuits. In this work, we take inspiration from
how human dexterity builds on a diversity of prior experiences, instead of
being acquired through a single task. Motivated by this observation, we set out
to develop agents that can build upon their previous experience to quickly
acquire new (previously unattainable) behaviors. Specifically, our approach
leverages multi-task learning to implicitly capture task-agnostic behavioral
priors (MyoDex) for human-like dexterity, using a physiologically realistic
human hand model - MyoHand. We demonstrate MyoDex's effectiveness in few-shot
generalization as well as positive transfer to a large repertoire of unseen
dexterous manipulation tasks. Agents leveraging MyoDex can solve approximately
3x more tasks, and 4x faster in comparison to a distillation baseline. While
prior work has synthesized single musculoskeletal control behaviors, MyoDex is
the first generalizable manipulation prior that catalyzes the learning of
dexterous physiological control across a large variety of contact-rich
behaviors. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our paradigms beyond
musculoskeletal control towards the acquisition of dexterity in 24 DoF Adroit

<p class="mathjax">With the widespread adoption of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in
low-voltage distribution systems, opportunities for energy trading among peers
have emerged. In particular, the advent of distributed ledgers and blockchain
technologies has catalyzed the application of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) economic
concepts in decentralized, small-scale energy trading. This paper focuses on
the critical physical layer aspects of transactions within the context of P2P
energy trading, with a specific emphasis on addressing network constraints. Key
challenges include maintaining margins for over/under voltage, voltage balance,
and preventing congestion, all of which must be upheld during P2P energy
exchanges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical approach
tailored to distribution networks. Furthermore, we introduce the Block Double
Auction (BDA) mechanism as the P2P market mechanism for determining the
acceptance or rejection of P2P transactions. The effectiveness of our proposed
method is validated using the IEEE 33-node distribution test system,
demonstrating its robust capabilities.

$\phi(x)=\sqrt{c^{2d}+||x||^{2d}}$, where $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $c\in
\mathbb{R}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, is presented to increase the accuracy of
quasi-interpolation further. With the restriction to Euclidean spaces of odd
dimensionality, the generalization can be used to generate a quasi-Lagrange
operator that reproduces all polynomials of degree $2d-1$. In contrast to the
classical multiquadric, the convergence rate of the quasi-interpolation
operator can be significantly improved by a factor $h^{2d-n-1}$, where $h&gt;0$
represents the grid spacing. Among other things, we compute the generalized
Fourier transform of this new multiquadric function. Finally, an infinite

<p class="mathjax">In this work, a novel data-driven methodology for designing polar codes for
channels with and without memory is proposed. The methodology is suitable for
the case where the channel is given as a "black-box" and the designer has
access to the channel for generating observations of its inputs and outputs,
but does not have access to the explicit channel model. The proposed method
leverages the structure of the successive cancellation (SC) decoder to devise a
neural SC (NSC) decoder. The NSC decoder uses neural networks (NNs) to replace
the core elements of the original SC decoder, the check-node, the bit-node and
the soft decision. Along with the NSC, we devise additional NN that embeds the
channel outputs into the input space of the SC decoder. The proposed method is
supported by theoretical guarantees that include the consistency of the NSC.
Also, the NSC has computational complexity that does not grow with the channel
memory size. This sets its main advantage over successive cancellation trellis
(SCT) decoder for finite state channels (FSCs) that has complexity of
$O(|\mathcal{S}|^3 N\log N)$, where $|\mathcal{S}|$ denotes the number of
channel states. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on
memoryless channels and on channels with memory. The empirical results are
compared with the optimal polar decoder, given by the SC and SCT decoders. We
further show that our algorithms are applicable for the case where there SC and
SCT decoders are not applicable.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we formulate optimization problems to perform optimal
transmission switching (OTS) in order to operate power transmission grids most
efficiently. In any given electrical network, several of the transmission lines
are generally equipped with switches, circuit breakers, and/or reclosers. The
conventional practice is to operate the grid using a static or fixed
configuration. However, it may be beneficial to dynamically reconfigure the
grid through switching actions in order to respond to real-time demand and
supply conditions. This has the potential to help reduce costs and improve
efficiency. Furthermore, such OTS may be more crucial in future power grids
with much higher penetrations of renewable energy sources, which introduce more
variability and intermittency in generation. Similarly, OTS can potentially
help mitigate the effects of unpredictable demand fluctuations (e.g. due to
extreme weather). We explored and compared several different formulations for
the OTS problems in terms of computational performance and optimality. I also
applied them to small transmission test case networks as a proof of concept to
see what the effects of applying OTS are.

<p class="mathjax">Coverage path planning (CPP) is a critical problem in robotics, where the
goal is to find an efficient path that covers every point in an area of
interest. This work addresses the power-constrained CPP problem with recharge
for battery-limited unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this problem, a notable
challenge emerges from integrating recharge journeys into the overall coverage
strategy, highlighting the intricate task of making strategic, long-term
decisions. We propose a novel proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach with map-based observations, utilizing
action masking and discount factor scheduling to optimize coverage trajectories
over the entire mission horizon. We further provide the agent with a position
history to handle emergent state loops caused by the recharge capability. Our
approach outperforms a baseline heuristic, generalizes to different target
zones and maps, with limited generalization to unseen maps. We offer valuable
insights into DRL algorithm design for long-horizon problems and provide a
publicly available software framework for the CPP problem.

<p class="mathjax">Neural fields, a category of neural networks trained to represent
high-frequency signals, have gained significant attention in recent years due
to their impressive performance in modeling complex 3D data, especially large
neural signed distance (SDFs) or radiance fields (NeRFs) via a single
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). However, despite the power and simplicity of
representing signals with an MLP, these methods still face challenges when
modeling large and complex temporal signals due to the limited capacity of
MLPs. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to address this
limitation by incorporating temporal residual layers into neural fields, dubbed
ResFields, a novel class of networks specifically designed to effectively
represent complex temporal signals. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
properties of ResFields and propose a matrix factorization technique to reduce
the number of trainable parameters and enhance generalization capabilities.
Importantly, our formulation seamlessly integrates with existing techniques and
consistently improves results across various challenging tasks: 2D video
approximation, dynamic shape modeling via temporal SDFs, and dynamic NeRF
reconstruction. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of ResFields by
showcasing its effectiveness in capturing dynamic 3D scenes from sparse sensory
inputs of a lightweight capture system.

<p class="mathjax">Given a set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $S$ of $m$ disks in the plane, the
disk coverage problem asks for a smallest subset of disks that together cover
all points of $P$. The problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we consider a
line-separable unit-disk version of the problem where all disks have the same
radius and their centers are separated from the points of $P$ by a line $\ell$.
We present an $m^{2/3}n^{2/3}2^{O(\log^*(m+n))} + O((n+m)\log (n+m))$ time
algorithm for the problem. This improves the previously best result of $O(nm+
n\log n)$ time. Our techniques also solve the line-constrained version of the
problem, where centers of all disks of $S$ are located on a line $\ell$ while
points of $P$ can be anywhere in the plane. Our algorithm runs in $O(m\sqrt{n}
+ (n+m)\log(n+m))$ time, which improves the previously best result of
$O(nm\log(m+n))$ time. In addition, our results lead to an algorithm of
$n^{10/3}2^{O(\log^*n)}$ time for a half-plane coverage problem (given $n$
half-planes and $n$ points, find a smallest subset of half-planes covering all
points); this improves the previously best algorithm of $O(n^4\log n)$ time.
Further, if all half-planes are lower ones, our algorithm runs in
$n^{4/3}2^{O(\log^*n)}$ time while the previously best algorithm takes
$O(n^2\log n)$ time.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid proliferation of AI-generated text online is profoundly reshaping
the information landscape. Among various types of AI-generated text,
AI-generated news presents a significant threat as it can be a prominent source
of misinformation online. While several recent efforts have focused on
detecting AI-generated text in general, these methods require enhanced
reliability, given concerns about their vulnerability to simple adversarial
attacks. Furthermore, due to the eccentricities of news writing, applying these
detection methods for AI-generated news can produce false positives,
potentially damaging the reputation of news organizations. To address these
challenges, we leverage the expertise of an interdisciplinary team to develop a
framework, J-Guard, capable of steering existing supervised AI text detectors
for detecting AI-generated news while boosting adversarial robustness. By
incorporating stylistic cues inspired by the unique journalistic attributes,
J-Guard effectively distinguishes between real-world journalism and
AI-generated news articles. Our experiments on news articles generated by a
vast array of AI models, including ChatGPT (GPT3.5), demonstrate the
effectiveness of J-Guard in enhancing detection capabilities while maintaining
an average performance decrease of as low as 7% when faced with adversarial
attacks.

<p class="mathjax">The calibration and training of a neural network is a complex and
time-consuming procedure that requires significant computational resources to
achieve satisfactory results. Key obstacles are a large number of
hyperparameters to select and the onset of overfitting in the face of a small
amount of data. In this framework, we propose an innovative training strategy
for feed-forward architectures - called split-boost - that improves performance
and automatically includes a regularizing behaviour without modeling it
explicitly. Such a novel approach ultimately allows us to avoid explicitly
modeling the regularization term, decreasing the total number of
hyperparameters and speeding up the tuning phase. The proposed strategy is
tested on a real-world (anonymized) dataset within a benchmark medical
insurance design problem.

<p class="mathjax">Containerized services deployed within various computing systems, such as
edge and cloud, desire live migration support to enable user mobility,
elasticity, and load balancing. To enable such a ubiquitous and efficient
service migration, a live migration solution needs to handle circumstances
where users have various authority levels (full control, limited control, or no
control) over the underlying computing systems. Supporting the live migration
at these levels serves as the cornerstone of interoperability, and can unlock
several use cases across various forms of distributed systems. As such, in this
study, we develop a ubiquitous migration solution (called UMS) that, for a
given containerized service, can automatically identify the feasible migration
approach, and then seamlessly perform the migration across autonomous computing
systems. UMS does not interfere with the way the orchestrator handles
containers and can coordinate the migration without the orchestrator
involvement. Moreover, UMS is orchestrator-agnostic, i.e., it can be plugged
into any underlying orchestrator platform. UMS is equipped with novel methods
that can coordinate and perform the live migration at the orchestrator,
container, and service levels. Experimental results show that for
single-process containers, the service-level approach, and for multi-process
containers with small (&lt; 128 MiB) memory footprint, the container-level
migration approach lead to the lowest migration overhead and service downtime.
To demonstrate the potential of UMS in realizing interoperability and
multi-cloud scenarios, we examined it to perform live service migration across
heterogeneous orchestrators, and between Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud

<p class="mathjax">While recommender systems have significantly benefited from implicit
feedback, they have often missed the nuances of multi-behavior interactions
between users and items. Historically, these systems either amalgamated all
behaviors, such as \textit{impression} (formerly \textit{view}),
\textit{add-to-cart}, and \textit{buy}, under a singular 'interaction' label,
or prioritized only the target behavior, often the \textit{buy} action,
discarding valuable auxiliary signals. Although recent advancements tried
addressing this simplification, they primarily gravitated towards optimizing
the target behavior alone, battling with data scarcity. Additionally, they
tended to bypass the nuanced hierarchy intrinsic to behaviors. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{M}ulti-behavior
\textbf{G}raph Attention \textbf{N}etwork (HMGN). This pioneering framework
leverages attention mechanisms to discern information from both inter and
intra-behaviors while employing a multi-task Hierarchical Bayesian Personalized
Ranking (HBPR) for optimization. Recognizing the need for scalability, our
approach integrates a specialized multi-behavior sub-graph sampling technique.
Moreover, the adaptability of HMGN allows for the seamless inclusion of
knowledge metadata and time-series data. Empirical results attest to our
model's prowess, registering a notable performance boost of up to 64\% in
NDCG@100 metrics over conventional graph neural network methods.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-grained classification often requires recognizing specific object parts,
such as beak shape and wing patterns for birds. Encouraging a fine-grained
classification model to first detect such parts and then using them to infer
the class could help us gauge whether the model is indeed looking at the right
details better than with interpretability methods that provide a single
attribution map. We propose PDiscoNet to discover object parts by using only
image-level class labels along with priors encouraging the parts to be:
discriminative, compact, distinct from each other, equivariant to rigid
transforms, and active in at least some of the images. In addition to using the
appropriate losses to encode these priors, we propose to use part-dropout,
where full part feature vectors are dropped at once to prevent a single part
from dominating in the classification, and part feature vector modulation,
which makes the information coming from each part distinct from the perspective
of the classifier. Our results on CUB, CelebA, and PartImageNet show that the
proposed method provides substantially better part discovery performance than
previous methods while not requiring any additional hyper-parameter tuning and
without penalizing the classification performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/robertdvdk/part_detection.

<p class="mathjax">Decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
machine translation (MT), albeit with performance slightly lagging behind
traditional encoder-decoder Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems. However,
LLMs offer a unique advantage: the ability to control the properties of the
output through prompts. In this study, we harness this flexibility to explore
LLaMa's capability to produce gender-specific translations for languages with
grammatical gender. Our results indicate that LLaMa can generate
gender-specific translations with competitive accuracy and gender bias
mitigation when compared to NLLB, a state-of-the-art multilingual NMT system.
Furthermore, our experiments reveal that LLaMa's translations are robust,
showing significant performance drops when evaluated against opposite-gender
references in gender-ambiguous datasets but maintaining consistency in less
ambiguous contexts. This research provides insights into the potential and
challenges of using LLMs for gender-specific translations and highlights the
importance of in-context learning to elicit new tasks in LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">In this article we analyze the error produced by the removal of an arbitrary
knot from a spline function. When a knot has multiplicity greater than one,
this implies a reduction of its multiplicity by one unit. In particular, we
deduce a very simple formula to compute the error in terms of some neighboring
knots and a few control points of the considered spline. Furthermore, we show
precisely how this error is related to the jump of a derivative of the spline
at the knot. We then use the developed theory to propose efficient and very
low-cost local error indicators and adaptive coarsening algorithms. Finally, we
present some numerical experiments to illustrate their performance and show
some applications.

<p class="mathjax">Significant strides have been made using large vision-language models, like
Stable Diffusion (SD), for a variety of downstream tasks, including image
editing, image correspondence, and 3D shape generation. Inspired by these
advancements, we explore leveraging these extensive vision-language models for
segmenting images at any desired granularity using as few as one annotated
sample by proposing SLiMe. SLiMe frames this problem as an optimization task.
Specifically, given a single training image and its segmentation mask, we first
extract attention maps, including our novel "weighted accumulated
self-attention map" from the SD prior. Then, using the extracted attention
maps, the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion are optimized such that, each of
them, learn about a single segmented region from the training image. These
learned embeddings then highlight the segmented region in the attention maps,
which in turn can then be used to derive the segmentation map. This enables
SLiMe to segment any real-world image during inference with the granularity of
the segmented region in the training image, using just one example. Moreover,
leveraging additional training data when available, i.e. few-shot, improves the
performance of SLiMe. We carried out a knowledge-rich set of experiments
examining various design factors and showed that SLiMe outperforms other
existing one-shot and few-shot segmentation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained an increasing amount of popularity
due to their superior capability in learning node embeddings for various graph
inference tasks, but training them can raise privacy concerns. To address this,
we propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes,
enabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing
the existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on
links and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph
topology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on
the accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the
inferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then
propose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different
privacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy
budgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high,
while the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively
higher privacy budgets. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid variant that combines
both strategies and is able to perform better across different privacy budgets.
Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in
terms of accuracy under varying privacy budgets.

models. Our approach, My Art My Choice (MAMC), aims to empower content owners
by protecting their copyrighted materials from being utilized by diffusion
models in an adversarial fashion. MAMC learns to generate adversarially
perturbed "protected" versions of images which can in turn "break" diffusion
models. The perturbation amount is decided by the artist to balance distortion
vs. protection of the content. MAMC is designed with a simple UNet-based
generator, attacking black box diffusion models, combining several losses to
create adversarial twins of the original artwork. We experiment on three
datasets for various image-to-image tasks, with different user control values.
Both protected image and diffusion output results are evaluated in visual,
noise, structure, pixel, and generative spaces to validate our claims. We
believe that MAMC is a crucial step for preserving ownership information for AI
generated content in a flawless, based-on-need, and human-centric way.

<p class="mathjax">We prove that every poset with bounded cliquewidth and with sufficiently
large dimension contains the standard example of dimension $k$ as a subposet.
This applies in particular to posets whose cover graphs have bounded treewidth,
as the cliquewidth of a poset is bounded in terms of the treewidth of the cover
graph. For the latter posets, we prove a stronger statement: every such poset
with sufficiently large dimension contains the Kelly example of dimension $k$
as a subposet. Using this result, we obtain a full characterization of the
minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ such that posets with cover graphs in
$\mathcal{C}$ have bounded dimension: they are exactly the classes excluding
the cover graph of some Kelly example. Finally, we consider a variant of poset
dimension called Boolean dimension, and we prove that posets with bounded
cliquewidth have bounded Boolean dimension.
<br />The proofs rely on Colcombet's deterministic version of Simon's factorization
theorem, which is a fundamental tool in formal language and automata theory,
and which we believe deserves a wider recognition in structural and algorithmic
graph theory.

<p class="mathjax">In the intricate architecture of the mammalian central nervous system,
neurons form populations. Axonal bundles communicate between these clusters
using spike trains as their medium. However, these neuron populations' precise
encoding and operations have yet to be discovered. In our analysis, the
starting point is a state-of-the-art mechanistic model of a generic neuron
endowed with plasticity. From this simple framework emerges a profound
mathematical construct: The representation and manipulation of information can
be precisely characterized by an algebra of finite convex cones. Furthermore,
these neuron populations are not merely passive transmitters. They act as
operators within this algebraic structure, mirroring the functionality of a
low-level programming language. When these populations interconnect, they
embody succinct yet potent algebraic expressions. These networks allow them to
implement many operations, such as specialization, generalization, novelty
detection, dimensionality reduction, inverse modeling, prediction, and
associative memory. In broader terms, this work illuminates the potential of
matrix embeddings in advancing our understanding in fields like cognitive
science and AI. These embeddings enhance the capacity for concept processing
and hierarchical description over their vector counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection in medical imaging is a challenging task in contexts where
abnormalities are not annotated. This problem can be addressed through
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods, which identify features that do
not match with a reference model of normal profiles. Artificial neural networks
have been extensively used for UAD but they do not generally achieve an optimal
trade-o$\hookleftarrow$ between accuracy and computational demand. As an
alternative, we investigate mixtures of probability distributions whose
versatility has been widely recognized for a variety of data and tasks, while
not requiring excessive design e$\hookleftarrow$ort or tuning. Their
expressivity makes them good candidates to account for complex multivariate
reference models. Their much smaller number of parameters makes them more
amenable to interpretation and e cient learning. However, standard estimation
procedures, such as the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, do not scale well
to large data volumes as they require high memory usage. To address this issue,
we propose to incrementally compute inferential quantities. This online
approach is illustrated on the challenging detection of subtle abnormalities in
MR brain scans for the follow-up of newly diagnosed Parkinsonian patients. The
identified structural abnormalities are consistent with the disease
progression, as accounted by the Hoehn and Yahr scale.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents for the first time successful results of active flow
control with multiple independently controlled zero-net-mass-flux synthetic
jets. The jets are placed on a three-dimensional cylinder along its span with
the aim of reducing the drag coefficient. The method is based on a
deep-reinforcement-learning framework that couples a
computational-fluid-dynamics solver with an agent using the
proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. We implement a multi-agent
reinforcement-learning framework which offers numerous advantages: it exploits
local invariants, makes the control adaptable to different geometries,
facilitates transfer learning and cross-application of agents and results in
significant training speedup. In this contribution we report significant drag
reduction after applying the DRL-based control in three different
configurations of the problem.

<p class="mathjax">Spoken language evolves constrained by the economy of speech, which depends
on factors such as the structure of the human mouth. This gives rise to local
phonetic correlations in spoken words. Here we demonstrate that these local
correlations facilitate the learning of spoken words by reducing their
information content. We do this by constructing a locally-connected
tensor-network model, inspired by similar variational models used for many-body
physics, which exploits these local phonetic correlations to facilitate the
learning of spoken words. The model is therefore a minimal model of phonetic
memory, where "learning to pronounce" and "learning a word" are one and the
same. A consequence of which is the learned ability to produce new words which
are phonetically reasonable for the target language; as well as providing a
hierarchy of the most likely errors that could be produced during the action of
speech. We test our model against Latin and Turkish words. (The code is
available on GitHub.)

<p class="mathjax">Modern deep learning heavily relies on large labeled datasets, which often
comse with high costs in terms of both manual labeling and computational
resources. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have explored the use of
informative subset selection techniques, including coreset selection and active
learning. Specifically, coreset selection involves sampling data with both
input ($\bx$) and output ($\by$), active learning focuses solely on the input
data ($\bx$).
<br />In this study, we present a theoretically optimal solution for addressing
both coreset selection and active learning within the context of linear softmax
regression. Our proposed method, COPS (unCertainty based OPtimal Sub-sampling),
is designed to minimize the expected loss of a model trained on subsampled
data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on explicit calculations of the
inverse covariance matrix, which are not easily applicable to deep learning
scenarios, COPS leverages the model's logits to estimate the sampling ratio.
This sampling ratio is closely associated with model uncertainty and can be
effectively applied to deep learning tasks. Furthermore, we address the
challenge of model sensitivity to misspecification by incorporating a
down-weighting approach for low-density samples, drawing inspiration from
previous works.
<br />To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments using deep neural networks on benchmark datasets. The
results consistently showcase the superior performance of COPS compared to
baseline methods, reaffirming its efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Cinematic audio source separation is a relatively new subtask of audio source
separation, with the aim of extracting the dialogue stem, the music stem, and
the effects stem from their mixture. In this work, we developed a model
generalizing the Bandsplit RNN for any complete or overcomplete partitions of
the frequency axis. Psycho-acoustically motivated frequency scales were used to
inform the band definitions which are now defined with redundancy for more
reliable feature extraction. A loss function motivated by the signal-to-noise
ratio and the sparsity-promoting property of the 1-norm was proposed. We
additionally exploit the information-sharing property of a common-encoder setup
to reduce computational complexity during both training and inference, improve
separation performance for hard-to-generalize classes of sounds, and allow
flexibility during inference time with easily detachable decoders. Our best
model sets the state of the art on the Divide and Remaster dataset with
performance above the ideal ratio mask for the dialogue stem.

<p class="mathjax">Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is likely the earliest and most
flexible clustering method, because it can be used with many distances,
similarities, and various linkage strategies. It is often used when the number
of clusters the data set forms is unknown and some sort of hierarchy in the
data is plausible. Most algorithms for HAC operate on a full distance matrix,
and therefore require quadratic memory. The standard algorithm also has cubic
runtime to produce a full hierarchy. Both memory and runtime are especially
problematic in the context of embedded or otherwise very resource-constrained
systems. In this section, we present how data aggregation with BETULA, a
numerically stable version of the well known BIRCH data aggregation algorithm,
can be used to make HAC viable on systems with constrained resources with only
small losses on clustering quality, and hence allow exploratory data analysis
of very large data sets.

<p class="mathjax">The segmentation of kidney layer structures, including cortex, outer stripe,
inner stripe, and inner medulla within human kidney whole slide images (WSI)
plays an essential role in automated image analysis in renal pathology.
However, the current manual segmentation process proves labor-intensive and
infeasible for handling the extensive digital pathology images encountered at a
large scale. In response, the realm of digital renal pathology has seen the
emergence of deep learning-based methodologies. However, very few, if any, deep
learning based approaches have been applied to kidney layer structure
segmentation. Addressing this gap, this paper assesses the feasibility of
performing deep learning based approaches on kidney layer structure
segmetnation. This study employs the representative convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Transformer segmentation approaches, including Swin-Unet,
Medical-Transformer, TransUNet, U-Net, PSPNet, and DeepLabv3+. We
quantitatively evaluated six prevalent deep learning models on renal cortex
layer segmentation using mice kidney WSIs. The empirical results stemming from
our approach exhibit compelling advancements, as evidenced by a decent Mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) index. The results demonstrate that Transformer
models generally outperform CNN-based models. By enabling a quantitative
evaluation of renal cortical structures, deep learning approaches are promising
to empower these medical professionals to make more informed kidney layer
segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has seen a recent surge in deep
learning-based approaches, which often involve encoding symbolic music (i.e.,
music represented in terms of discrete note events) in an image-like or
language like fashion. However, symbolic music is neither an image nor a
sentence, and research in the symbolic domain lacks a comprehensive overview of
the different available representations. In this paper, we investigate matrix
(piano roll), sequence, and graph representations and their corresponding
neural architectures, in combination with symbolic scores and performances on
three piece-level classification tasks. We also introduce a novel graph
representation for symbolic performances and explore the capability of graph
representations in global classification tasks. Our systematic evaluation shows
advantages and limitations of each input representation. Our results suggest
that the graph representation, as the newest and least explored among the three
approaches, exhibits promising performance, while being more light-weight in
training.

subjects from the COPDGene study. Our algorithm achieved the predictive
accuracy at 52\%, outperforming a previously published method's accuracy of
45\%. In addition, the agreement between the predicted scores of our method and
the visual scores was good, where the previous method obtained only moderate
agreement. Our approach employs a regression training strategy to generate
categorical labels while simultaneously producing high-resolution localized
activation maps for visualizing the network predictions. By leveraging these
dense activation maps, our method possesses the capability to compute the
percentage of emphysema involvement per lung in addition to categorical
severity scores. Furthermore, the proposed method extends its predictive
capabilities beyond centrilobular emphysema to include paraseptal emphysema
subtypes.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we compute numerical approximations of the minimal surfaces,
an essential type of Partial Differential Equation (PDE), in higher dimensions.
Classical methods cannot handle it in this case because of the Curse of
Dimensionality, where the computational cost of these methods increases
exponentially fast in response to higher problem dimensions, far beyond the
computing capacity of any modern supercomputers. Only in the past few years
have machine learning researchers been able to mitigate this problem. The
solution method chosen here is a model known as a Physics-Informed Neural
Network (PINN) which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to solve the minimal
surface PDE. It can be scaled up into higher dimensions and trained relatively
quickly even on a laptop with no GPU. Due to the inability to view the
high-dimension output, our data is presented as snippets of a higher-dimension
shape with enough fixed axes so that it is viewable with 3-D graphs. Not only
will the functionality of this method be tested, but we will also explore
potential limitations in the method's performance.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computers promise exponential speed ups over classical computers for
various tasks. This emerging technology is expected to have its first huge
impact in High Performance Computing (HPC), as it can solve problems beyond the
reach of HPC. To that end, HPC will require quantum accelerators, which will
enable applications to run on both classical and quantum devices, via hybrid
quantum-classical nodes. Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable,
executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use
quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor
performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum
applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the
HPC community.
<br />This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework
for HPC, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic framework called Q-Pragma.
This framework extends the classical programming language C++ heavily used in
HPC via the addition of pragma directives to manage quantum computations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper offers an independent assessment of certain economic effects of
the Iberian Exception (IE) which was introduced in June 2022 by the Spanish and
Portuguese governments. Their stated aim was to reduce wholesale spot
electricity prices (which were rising alarmingly due to tight international gas
markets related to Russia s invasion of Ukraine) and thereby reduce retail
electricity prices for consumers whose prices were linked to that wholesale
market. Another aim was to reduce Spanish inflation, which was linked to a
regulated electricity retail price indexed to the wholesale spot market. Using
hourly data on the wholesale electricity market for the first 100 days of the
IE, the authors question the Spanish Governments estimate of the beneficial
effects of the measure for affected consumers, which included over 10 million
small consumers as well as many large ones. They argue that the estimated
effect of the IE on retail prices depends on the assumed counterfactual.
Although counterfactuals are always difficult to construct, the government s
counterfactual ignores demand elasticity, and this inflates their estimate of
immediate consumer benefits. Alternative counterfactuals that include demand
elasticity reduce the estimated benefits for consumers and may even lead to the
conclusion that the latter would have paid less had the IE not been introduced.
The authors identify several other potential short and long-term effects of the
IE that deserve further study, including increased margins for fossil fired
generators, reduced margins for decarbonized inframarginal plant, heightened
regulatory risk for investors, weakened incentives for efficient consumption,
higher carbon emissions and gas prices and ultimately higher costs for
consumers.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic communication (SemCom) holds promise for reducing network resource
consumption while achieving the communications goal. However, the computational
overheads in jointly training semantic encoders and decoders-and the subsequent
deployment in network devices-are overlooked. Recent advances in Generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) offer a potential solution. The robust learning
abilities of GAI models indicate that semantic decoders can reconstruct source
messages using a limited amount of semantic information, e.g., prompts, without
joint training with the semantic encoder. A notable challenge, however, is the
instability introduced by GAI's diverse generation ability. This instability,
evident in outputs like text-generated images, limits the direct application of
GAI in scenarios demanding accurate message recovery, such as face image
transmission. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a GAI-aided
SemCom system with multi-model prompts for accurate content decoding. Moreover,
in response to security concerns, we introduce the application of covert
communications aided by a friendly jammer. The system jointly optimizes the
diffusion step, jamming, and transmitting power with the aid of the generative
diffusion models, enabling successful and secure transmission of the source
messages.

<p class="mathjax">Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the most prevalent human candidal
infection, estimated to afflict approximately 75% of all women at least once in
their lifetime. It will lead to several symptoms including pruritus, vaginal
soreness, and so on. Automatic whole slide image (WSI) classification is highly
demanded, for the huge burden of disease control and prevention. However, the
WSI-based computer-aided VCC screening method is still vacant due to the scarce
labeled data and unique properties of candida. Candida in WSI is challenging to
be captured by conventional classification models due to its distinctive
elongated shape, the small proportion of their spatial distribution, and the
style gap from WSIs. To make the model focus on the candida easier, we propose
an attention-guided method, which can obtain a robust diagnosis classification
model. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained detection model as prior
instruction to initialize the classification model. Then we design a Skip
Self-Attention module to refine the attention onto the fined-grained features
of candida. Finally, we use a contrastive learning method to alleviate the
overfitting caused by the style gap of WSIs and suppress the attention to false
positive regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and example data are available at
https://github.com/cjdbehumble/MICCAI2023-VVC-Screening.

<p class="mathjax">Large numbers of radiographic images are available in knee radiology
practices which could be used for training of deep learning models for
diagnosis of knee abnormalities. However, those images do not typically contain
readily available labels due to limitations of human annotations. The purpose
of our study was to develop an automated labeling approach that improves the
image classification model to distinguish normal knee images from those with
abnormalities or prior arthroplasty. The automated labeler was trained on a
small set of labeled data to automatically label a much larger set of unlabeled
data, further improving the image classification performance for knee
radiographic diagnosis. We developed our approach using 7,382 patients and
validated it on a separate set of 637 patients. The final image classification
model, trained using both manually labeled and pseudo-labeled data, had the
higher weighted average AUC (WAUC: 0.903) value and higher AUC-ROC values among
all classes (normal AUC-ROC: 0.894; abnormal AUC-ROC: 0.896, arthroplasty
AUC-ROC: 0.990) compared to the baseline model (WAUC=0.857; normal AUC-ROC:
0.842; abnormal AUC-ROC: 0.848, arthroplasty AUC-ROC: 0.987), trained using
only manually labeled data. DeLong tests show that the improvement is
significant on normal (p-value&lt;0.002) and abnormal (p-value&lt;0.001) images. Our
findings demonstrated that the proposed automated labeling approach
significantly improves the performance of image classification for radiographic
knee diagnosis, allowing for facilitating patient care and curation of large
knee datasets.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the computational and statistical aspects of quantile and
pseudo-Huber tensor decomposition. The integrated investigation of
computational and statistical issues of robust tensor decomposition poses
challenges due to the non-smooth loss functions. We propose a projected
sub-gradient descent algorithm for tensor decomposition, equipped with either
the pseudo-Huber loss or the quantile loss. In the presence of both
heavy-tailed noise and Huber's contamination error, we demonstrate that our
algorithm exhibits a so-called phenomenon of two-phase convergence with a
carefully chosen step size schedule. The algorithm converges linearly and
delivers an estimator that is statistically optimal with respect to both the
heavy-tailed noise and arbitrary corruptions. Interestingly, our results
achieve the first minimax optimal rates under Huber's contamination model for
noisy tensor decomposition. Compared with existing literature, quantile tensor
decomposition removes the requirement of specifying a sparsity level in
advance, making it more flexible for practical use. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms in the presence of missing values. Our methods
are subsequently applied to the food balance dataset and the international
trade flow dataset, both of which yield intriguing findings.

<p class="mathjax">While many recent any-to-any voice conversion models succeed in transferring
some target speech's style information to the converted speech, they still lack
the ability to faithfully reproduce the speaking style of the target speaker.
In this work, we propose a novel method to extract rich style information from
target utterances and to efficiently transfer it to source speech content
without requiring text transcriptions or speaker labeling. Our proposed
approach introduces an attention mechanism utilizing a self-supervised learning
(SSL) model to collect the speaking styles of a target speaker each
corresponding to the different phonetic content. The styles are represented
with a set of embeddings called stylebook. In the next step, the stylebook is
attended with the source speech's phonetic content to determine the final
target style for each source content. Finally, content information extracted
from the source speech and content-dependent target style embeddings are fed
into a diffusion-based decoder to generate the converted speech
mel-spectrogram. Experiment results show that our proposed method combined with
a diffusion-based generative model can achieve better speaker similarity in
any-to-any voice conversion tasks when compared to baseline models, while the
increase in computational complexity with longer utterances is suppressed.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present MuLanTTS, the Microsoft end-to-end neural
text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for the Blizzard Challenge 2023. About 50
hours of audiobook corpus for French TTS as hub task and another 2 hours of
speaker adaptation as spoke task are released to build synthesized voices for
different test purposes including sentences, paragraphs, homographs, lists,
etc. Building upon DelightfulTTS, we adopt contextual and emotion encoders to
adapt the audiobook data to enrich beyond sentences for long-form prosody and
dialogue expressiveness. Regarding the recording quality, we also apply denoise
algorithms and long audio processing for both corpora. For the hub task, only
the 50-hour single speaker data is used for building the TTS system, while for

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformer-based methods are advancing the field of medical
artificial intelligence and cancer imaging, including lung cancer applications.
Recently, many researchers have developed vision transformer-based AI methods
for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This scoping review aims to identify
the recent developments on vision transformer-based AI methods for lung cancer
imaging applications. It provides key insights into how vision transformers
complemented the performance of AI and deep learning methods for lung cancer.
Furthermore, the review also identifies the datasets that contributed to
advancing the field. Of the 314 retrieved studies, this review included 34
studies published from 2020 to 2022. The most commonly addressed task in these
studies was the classification of lung cancer types, such as lung squamous cell
carcinoma versus lung adenocarcinoma, and identifying benign versus malignant
pulmonary nodules. Other applications included survival prediction of lung
cancer patients and segmentation of lungs. The studies lacked clear strategies
for clinical transformation. SWIN transformer was a popular choice of the
researchers; however, many other architectures were also reported where vision
transformer was combined with convolutional neural networks or UNet model. It
can be concluded that vision transformer-based models are increasingly in
popularity for developing AI methods for lung cancer applications. However,
their computational complexity and clinical relevance are important factors to
be considered for future research work. This review provides valuable insights
for researchers in the field of AI and healthcare to advance the
state-of-the-art in lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an
interactive dashboard on lung-cancer.onrender.com/.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a generalization of one-way superdense coding to two-way
communication protocols for transmitting classical bits by using entangled
quantum pairs. The proposed protocol caters for provision of entangled pairs,
which is assumed to be given in one-way superdense coding. The proposed
protocol gives a 50% increase in both data rate and energy efficiency compared

the quantum protocol performs better as long as the decoherence time is not

<p class="mathjax">In the last decade, recent successes in deep clustering majorly involved the
Mutual Information (MI) as an unsupervised objective for training neural
networks with increasing regularisations. While the quality of the
regularisations have been largely discussed for improvements, little attention
has been dedicated to the relevance of MI as a clustering objective. In this
paper, we first highlight how the maximisation of MI does not lead to
satisfying clusters. We identified the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the main
reason of this behaviour. Hence, we generalise the mutual information by
changing its core distance, introducing the Generalised Mutual Information
(GEMINI): a set of metrics for unsupervised neural network training. Unlike MI,
some GEMINIs do not require regularisations when training as they are
geometry-aware thanks to distances or kernels in the data space. Finally, we
highlight that GEMINIs can automatically select a relevant number of clusters,
a property that has been little studied in deep discriminative clustering
context where the number of clusters is a priori unknown.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of Age-of-Information (AoI) in UAV-assisted
networks. Our objective is to minimize the expected AoI across devices by
optimizing UAVs' stopping locations and device selection probabilities. To
tackle this problem, we first derive a closed-form expression of the expected
AoI that involves the probabilities of selection of devices. Then, we formulate
the problem as a non-convex minimization subject to quality of service
constraints. Since the problem is challenging to solve, we propose an Ensemble
Deep Neural Network (EDNN) based approach which takes advantage of the dual
formulation of the studied problem. Specifically, the Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) in the ensemble are trained in an unsupervised manner using the
Lagrangian function of the studied problem. Our experiments show that the
proposed EDNN method outperforms traditional DNNs in reducing the expected AoI,
achieving a remarkable reduction of $29.5\%$.

<p class="mathjax">Constructing null models to test the significance of extracted information is
a crucial step in data analysis. In this work, we provide a uniformly
sampleable null model of directed graphs with the same (or similar) number of
simplices in the flag complex, with the restriction of retaining the underlying
undirected graph. We describe an MCMC-based algorithm to sample from this null
model and statistically investigate the mixing behaviour. This is paired with a
high-performance, Rust-based, publicly available implementation. The motivation
comes from topological data analysis of connectomes in neuroscience. In
particular, we answer the fundamental question: are the high Betti numbers
observed in the investigated graphs evidence of an interesting topology, or are
they merely a byproduct of the high numbers of simplices? Indeed, by applying
our new tool on the connectome of C. Elegans and parts of the statistical
reconstructions of the Blue Brain Project, we find that the Betti numbers
observed are considerable statistical outliers with respect to this new null
model. We thus, for the first time, statistically confirm that topological data
analysis in microscale connectome research is extracting statistically
meaningful information.

<p class="mathjax">Based on the signals received across its antennas, a multi-antenna base
station (BS) can apply the classic multiple signal classification (MUSIC)
algorithm for estimating the angle of arrivals (AOAs) of its incident signals.
This method can be leveraged to localize the users if their line-of-sight (LOS)
paths to the BS are available. In this paper, we consider a more challenging
AOA estimation setup in the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where LOS paths do not
exist between the BS and the users, while the users' signals can be transmitted
to the BS merely via their LOS paths to the IRS as well as the LOS path from
the IRS to the BS. Specifically, we treat the IRS as the anchor and are
interested in estimating the AOAs of the incident signals from the users to the
IRS. Note that we have to achieve the above goal based on the signals received
by the BS, because the passive IRS cannot process its received signals.
However, the signals received across different antennas of the BS only contain
AOA information of its incident signals via the LOS path from the IRS to the
BS. To tackle this challenge arising from the spatial-domain received signals,
we propose an innovative approach to create temporal-domain multi-dimension
received signals for estimating the AOAs of the paths from the users to the
IRS. Specifically, via a proper design of the user message pattern and the IRS
reflecting pattern, we manage to show that our designed temporal-domain
multi-dimension signals can be surprisingly expressed as a function of the
virtual steering vectors of the IRS towards the users. This amazing result
implies that the classic MUSIC algorithm can be applied to our designed
temporal-domain multi-dimension signals for accurately estimating the AOAs of
the signals from the users to the IRS.

<p class="mathjax">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathological syndrome
characterized by hepatic steatosis resulting from the exclusion of alcohol and
other identifiable liver-damaging factors. It has emerged as a leading cause of
chronic liver disease worldwide. Currently, the conventional methods for NAFLD
detection are expensive and not suitable for users to perform daily
diagnostics. To address this issue, this study proposes a non-invasive and
interpretable NAFLD diagnostic method, the required user-provided indicators
are only Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Waist Circumference, Hip Circumference,
and tongue image. This method involves merging patients' physiological
indicators with tongue features, which are then input into a fusion network
named SelectorNet. SelectorNet combines attention mechanisms with feature
selection mechanisms, enabling it to autonomously learn the ability to select
important features. The experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 77.22\% using only non-invasive data, and it also
provides compelling interpretability matrices. This study contributes to the
early diagnosis of NAFLD and the intelligent advancement of TCM tongue
diagnosis. The project in this paper is available at:

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates indoor localization methods using radio, vision, and
audio sensors, respectively, in the same environment. The evaluation is based
on state-of-the-art algorithms and uses a real-life dataset. More specifically,
we evaluate a machine learning algorithm for radio-based localization with
massive MIMO technology, an ORB-SLAM3 algorithm for vision-based localization
with an RGB-D camera, and an SFS2 algorithm for audio-based localization with
microphone arrays. Aspects including localization accuracy, reliability,
calibration requirements, and potential system complexity are discussed to
analyze the advantages and limitations of using different sensors for indoor
localization tasks. The results can serve as a guideline and basis for further
development of robust and high-precision multi-sensory localization systems,
e.g., through sensor fusion and context and environment-aware adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">We study the effect of stochastic feeding costs on animal-based commodities
with particular focus on aquaculture. More specifically, we use soybean futures
to infer on the stochastic behaviour of salmon feed, which we assume to follow
a Schwartz-2-factor model. We compare the decision of harvesting salmon using a
decision rule assuming either deterministic or stochastic feeding costs, i.e.
including feeding cost risk. We identify cases, where accounting for stochastic
feeding costs leads to significant improvements as well as cases where
deterministic feeding costs are a good enough proxy. Nevertheless, in all of
these cases, the newly derived rules show superior performance, while the
additional computational costs are negligible. From a methodological point of
view, we demonstrate how to use Deep-Neural-Networks to infer on the decision
boundary that determines harvesting or continuation, improving on more
classical regression-based and curve-fitting methods. To achieve this we use a
deep classifier, which not only improves on previous results but also scales
well for higher dimensional problems, and in addition mitigates effects due to
model uncertainty, which we identify in this article. effects due to model

contained in any larger clique, in three network models: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, inhomogeneous random graphs (also called Chung-Lu graphs), and
geometric inhomogeneous random graphs. For sparse and not-too-dense
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we give linear and polynomial upper bounds on the
number of maximal cliques. For the dense regime, we give super-polynomial and
even exponential lower bounds. Although (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs
are sparse, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for these models. This comes
form the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which
leads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower
bounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (geometric)
inhomogeneous random graphs have only few maximal cliques. We resolve this
contradiction by providing experiments indicating that, even for large
networks, the linear lower-order terms dominate, before the super-polynomial
asymptotic behavior kicks in only for networks of extreme size.

<p class="mathjax">Meta-learning is a framework in which machine learning models train over a
set of datasets in order to produce predictions on new datasets at test time.
Probabilistic meta-learning has received an abundance of attention from the
research community in recent years, but a problem shared by many existing
probabilistic meta-models is that they require a very large number of datasets
in order to produce high-quality predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. In many applications, however, such quantities of data are simply
not available.
<br />In this dissertation we present a significantly more data-efficient approach
to probabilistic meta-learning through per-datapoint amortisation of inference
in Bayesian neural networks, introducing the Amortised Pseudo-Observation
Variational Inference Bayesian Neural Network (APOVI-BNN). First, we show that
the approximate posteriors obtained under our amortised scheme are of similar
or better quality to those obtained through traditional variational inference,
despite the fact that the amortised inference is performed in a single forward
pass. We then discuss how the APOVI-BNN may be viewed as a new member of the
neural process family, motivating the use of neural process training objectives
for potentially better predictive performance on complex problems as a result.
Finally, we assess the predictive performance of the APOVI-BNN against other
probabilistic meta-models in both a one-dimensional regression problem and in a
significantly more complex image completion setting. In both cases, when the
amount of training data is limited, our model is the best in its class.

<p class="mathjax">While physical reservoir computing (PRC) is a promising way to achieve low
power consumption neuromorphic computing, its computational performance is
still insufficient at a practical level. One promising approach to improving
PRC performance is deep reservoir computing (deep-RC), in which the component
reservoirs are multi-layered. However, all of the deep-RC schemes reported so
far have been effective only for simulation reservoirs and limited PRCs, and
there have been no reports of nanodevice implementations. Here, as the first
nanodevice implementation of Deep-RC, we report a demonstration of deep
physical reservoir computing using an ion gating reservoir (IGR), which is a
small and high-performance physical reservoir. While previously reported
Deep-RC scheme did not improve the performance of IGR, our Deep-IGR achieved a
normalized mean squared error of 0.0092 on a second-order nonlinear
autoregressive moving average task, with is the best performance of any
physical reservoir so far reported. More importantly, the device outperformed
full simulation reservoir computing. The dramatic performance improvement of
the IGR with our deep-RC architecture paves the way for high-performance,
large-scale, physical neural network devices.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian inference for neural networks, or Bayesian deep learning, has the
potential to provide well-calibrated predictions with quantified uncertainty
and robustness. However, the main hurdle for Bayesian deep learning is its
computational complexity due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space.
In this work, we propose a novel scheme that addresses this limitation by
constructing a low-dimensional subspace of the neural network
parameters-referred to as an active subspace-by identifying the parameter
directions that have the most significant influence on the output of the neural
network. We demonstrate that the significantly reduced active subspace enables
effective and scalable Bayesian inference via either Monte Carlo (MC) sampling
methods, otherwise computationally intractable, or variational inference.
Empirically, our approach provides reliable predictions with robust uncertainty
estimates for various regression tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Migration's impact spans various social dimensions, including demography,
sustainability, politics, economy and gender disparities. Yet, the
decision-making process behind migrants choosing their destination remains
elusive. Existing models primarily rely on population size and travel distance
to explain flow fluctuations, overlooking significant population
heterogeneities. Paradoxically, migrants often travel long distances and to
smaller destinations if their diaspora is present in those locations. To
address this gap, we propose the diaspora model of migration, incorporating
intensity (the number of people moving to a country) and assortativity (the
destination within the country). Our model considers only the existing diaspora
sizes in the destination country, influencing the probability of migrants
selecting a specific residence. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately
reproduces the observed stable flow and distribution of migration in Austria
(postal code level) and US metropolitan areas, yielding precise estimates of
migrant inflow at various geographic scales. Given the increase in
international migrations due to recent natural and societal crises, this study
enlightens our understanding of migration flow heterogeneities, helping design
more inclusive, integrated cities.

<p class="mathjax">Atmospheric retrievals (AR) of exoplanets typically rely on a combination of
a Bayesian inference technique and a forward simulator to estimate atmospheric
properties from an observed spectrum. A key component in simulating spectra is
the pressure-temperature (PT) profile, which describes the thermal structure of
the atmosphere. Current AR pipelines commonly use ad hoc fitting functions here
that limit the retrieved PT profiles to simple approximations, but still use a
relatively large number of parameters. In this work, we introduce a
conceptually new, data-driven parameterization scheme for physically consistent
PT profiles that does not require explicit assumptions about the functional
form of the PT profiles and uses fewer parameters than existing methods. Our
approach consists of a latent variable model (based on a neural network) that
learns a distribution over functions (PT profiles). Each profile is represented
by a low-dimensional vector that can be used to condition a decoder network
that maps $P$ to $T$. When training and evaluating our method on two publicly
available datasets of self-consistent PT profiles, we find that our method
achieves, on average, better fit quality than existing baseline methods,
despite using fewer parameters. In an AR based on existing literature, our
model (using two parameters) produces a tighter, more accurate posterior for
the PT profile than the five-parameter polynomial baseline, while also speeding
up the retrieval by more than a factor of three. By providing parametric access
to physically consistent PT profiles, and by reducing the number of parameters
required to describe a PT profile (thereby reducing computational cost or
freeing resources for additional parameters of interest), our method can help
improve AR and thus our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and their
habitability.

<p class="mathjax">Annual Reports of publicly listed companies contain vital information about
their financial health which can help assess the potential impact on Stock
price of the firm. These reports are comprehensive in nature, going up to, and
sometimes exceeding, 100 pages. Analysing these reports is cumbersome even for
a single firm, let alone the whole universe of firms that exist. Over the
years, financial experts have become proficient in extracting valuable
information from these documents relatively quickly. However, this requires
years of practice and experience. This paper aims to simplify the process of
assessing Annual Reports of all the firms by leveraging the capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The insights generated by the LLM are compiled in
a Quant styled dataset and augmented by historical stock price data. A Machine
Learning model is then trained with LLM outputs as features. The walkforward
test results show promising outperformance wrt S&amp;P500 returns. This paper
intends to provide a framework for future work in this direction. To facilitate
this, the code has been released as open source.

<p class="mathjax">We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups
from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques,
our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct
sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the
representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful to
identify the Lie group that generates the action. Our algorithm is general for
any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2) and SO(3)
are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and
Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure
theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The
algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 16, as well as real-life
applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, and classical mechanics
systems, achieving very accurate results.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity. However, the
impact of their general availability through ChatGPT on sensitive areas of
everyday life, such as education, remains unclear. Nevertheless, the societal
impact on established educational methods is already being experienced by both
students and educators. Our work focuses on higher physics education and
examines problem solving strategies. In a study, students with a background in
physics were assigned to solve physics exercises, with one group having access
to an internet search engine (N=12) and the other group being allowed to use
ChatGPT (N=27). We evaluated their performance, strategies, and interaction
with the provided tools. Our results showed that nearly half of the solutions
provided with the support of ChatGPT were mistakenly assumed to be correct by
the students, indicating that they overly trusted ChatGPT even in their field
of expertise. Likewise, in 42% of cases, students used copy &amp; paste to query
ChatGPT -- an approach only used in 4% of search engine queries -- highlighting
the stark differences in interaction behavior between the groups and indicating
limited reflection when using ChatGPT. In our work, we demonstrated a need to
(1) guide students on how to interact with LLMs and (2) create awareness of
potential shortcomings for users.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates quantile regression in the presence of non-convex and
non-smooth sparse penalties, such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and
smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD). The non-smooth and non-convex
nature of these problems often leads to convergence difficulties for many
algorithms. While iterative techniques like coordinate descent and local linear
approximation can facilitate convergence, the process is often slow. This
sluggish pace is primarily due to the need to run these approximation
techniques until full convergence at each step, a requirement we term as a
\emph{secondary convergence iteration}. To accelerate the convergence speed, we
employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and introduce a
novel single-loop smoothing ADMM algorithm with an increasing penalty
parameter, named SIAD, specifically tailored for sparse-penalized quantile
regression. We first delve into the convergence properties of the proposed SIAD
algorithm and establish the necessary conditions for convergence.
Theoretically, we confirm a convergence rate of $o\big({k^{-\frac{1}{4}}}\big)$
for the sub-gradient bound of augmented Lagrangian. Subsequently, we provide
numerical results to showcase the effectiveness of the SIAD algorithm. Our
findings highlight that the SIAD method outperforms existing approaches,
providing a faster and more stable solution for sparse-penalized quantile
regression.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Language Models have enabled the protein modeling
community with a powerful tool since protein sequences can be represented as
text. Specifically, by taking advantage of Transformers, sequence-to-property
prediction will be amenable without the need for explicit structural data. In
this work, inspired by recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce PeptideBERT, a protein language model for predicting three key
properties of peptides (hemolysis, solubility, and non-fouling). The
PeptideBert utilizes the ProtBERT pretrained transformer model with 12
attention heads and 12 hidden layers. We then finetuned the pretrained model
for the three downstream tasks. Our model has achieved state of the art (SOTA)
for predicting Hemolysis, which is a task for determining peptide's potential
to induce red blood cell lysis. Our PeptideBert non-fouling model also achieved
remarkable accuracy in predicting peptide's capacity to resist non-specific
interactions. This model, trained predominantly on shorter sequences, benefits
from the dataset where negative examples are largely associated with insoluble
peptides. Codes, models, and data used in this study are freely available at:

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes how to `Free the Qubit' for art, by creating standalone
quantum musical effects and instruments. Previously released quantum simulator
code for an ARM-based Raspberry Pi Pico embedded microcontroller is utilised
here, and several examples are built demonstrating different methods of
utilising embedded resources: The first is a Quantum MIDI processor that
generates additional notes for accompaniment and unique quantum generated
instruments based on the input notes, decoded and passed through a quantum
circuit in an embedded simulator. The second is a Quantum Distortion module
that changes an instrument's raw sound according to a quantum circuit, which is
presented in two forms; a self-contained Quantum Stylophone, and an effect
module plugin called 'QubitCrusher' for the Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1. This paper also
discusses future work and directions for quantum instruments, and provides all
examples as open source. This is, to the author's knowledge, the first example
of embedded Quantum Simulators for Instruments of Music (another QSIM).

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty is a pervasive challenge in decision analysis, and decision
theory recognizes two classes of solutions: probabilistic models and cognitive
heuristics. However, engineers, public planners and other decision-makers
instead use a third class of strategies that could be called RDOT
(Risk-reducing Design and Operations Toolkit). These include incorporating
robustness into designs, contingency planning, and others that do not fall into
the categories of probabilistic models or cognitive heuristics. Moreover,
identical strategies appear in several domains and disciplines, pointing to an
important shared toolkit.
<br />The focus of this paper is to develop a catalog of such strategies and
develop a framework for them. The paper finds more than 90 examples of such
strategies falling into six broad categories and argues that they provide an
efficient response to decision problems that are seemingly intractable due to
high uncertainty. It then proposes a framework to incorporate them into
decision theory using multi-objective optimization.
<br />Overall, RDOT represents an overlooked class of responses to uncertainty.
Because RDOT strategies do not depend on accurate forecasting or estimation,
they could be applied fruitfully to certain decision problems affected by high
uncertainty and make them much more tractable.

<p class="mathjax">This article presents an interactive system for stage acoustics
experimentation including considerations for hearing one's own and others'
instruments. The quality of real-time auralization systems for psychophysical
experiments on music performance depends on the system's calibration and
latency, among other factors (e.g. visuals, simulation methods, haptics, etc).
The presented system focuses on the acoustic considerations for laboratory
implementations. The calibration is implemented as a set of filters accounting
for the microphone-instrument distances and the directivity factors, as well as
the transducers' frequency responses. Moreover, sources of errors are
characterized using both state-of-the-art information and derivations from the
mathematical definition of the calibration filter. In order to compensate for
hardware latency without cropping parts of the simulated impulse responses, the
virtual direct sound of musicians hearing themselves is skipped from the
simulation and addressed by letting the actual direct sound reach the listener
through open headphones. The required latency compensation of the interactive
part (i.e. hearing others) meets the minimum distance requirement between
musicians, which is 2 m for the implemented system. Finally, a proof of concept
is provided that includes objective and subjective experiments, which give
support to the feasibility of the proposed setup.

<p class="mathjax">Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are common types of
neurodegenerative disorders that present overlapping clinical symptoms, making
their differential diagnosis very challenging. Numerous efforts have been done
for the diagnosis of each disease but the problem of multi-class differential
diagnosis has not been actively explored. In recent years, transformer-based
models have demonstrated remarkable success in various computer vision tasks.
However, their use in disease diagnostic is uncommon due to the limited amount
of 3D medical data given the large size of such models. In this paper, we
present a novel 3D transformer-based architecture using a deformable patch
location module to improve the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and Frontotemporal dementia. Moreover, to overcome the problem of data
scarcity, we propose an efficient combination of various data augmentation
techniques, adapted for training transformer-based models on 3D structural
magnetic resonance imaging data. Finally, we propose to combine our
transformer-based model with a traditional machine learning model using brain
structure volumes to better exploit the available data. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the deformable patch
locations can be visualized, revealing the most relevant brain regions used to
establish the diagnosis of each disease.

<p class="mathjax">Terahertz (THz) band is currently envisioned as the key building block to
achieving the future sixth generation (6G) wireless systems. The ultra-wide
bandwidth and very narrow beamwidth of THz systems offer the next order of
magnitude in user densities and multi-functional behavior. However, wide
bandwidth results in a frequency-dependent beampattern causing the beams
generated at different subcarriers split and point to different directions.
Furthermore, mutual coupling degrades the system's performance. This paper
studies the compensation of both beam-split and mutual coupling for
direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation by modeling the beam-split and mutual
coupling as an array imperfection. We propose a subspace-based approach using
multiple signal classification with CalibRated for bEAam-split and Mutual
coupling (CREAM-MUSIC) algorithm for this purpose. Via numerical simulations,
we show the proposed CREAM-MUSIC approach accurately estimates the DoAs in the
presence of beam-split and mutual coupling.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Matcha-TTS, a new encoder-decoder architecture for speedy TTS
acoustic modelling, trained using optimal-transport conditional flow matching
(OT-CFM). This yields an ODE-based decoder capable of high output quality in
fewer synthesis steps than models trained using score matching. Careful design
choices additionally ensure each synthesis step is fast to run. The method is
probabilistic, non-autoregressive, and learns to speak from scratch without
external alignments. Compared to strong pre-trained baseline models, the
Matcha-TTS system has the smallest memory footprint, rivals the speed of the
fastest models on long utterances, and attains the highest mean opinion score
in a listening test. Please see https://shivammehta25.github.io/Matcha-TTS/ for
audio examples, code, and pre-trained models.
