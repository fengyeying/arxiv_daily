<p class="mathjax">In modern communication systems, efficient and reliable information
dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a
significant step forward in achieving more decentralized, efficient, and
collaborative solutions. We propose a Decentralized-POMDP formulation for
information dissemination, empowering each agent to independently decide on
message forwarding. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from
traditional heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach
harnesses Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We
propose two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that
is exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach promises a first step
toward bolstering the resilience of real-world broadcast communication
infrastructures via learned, collaborative information dissemination.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) mainly has two
scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the
continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for
classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For
emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to
learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term
memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to
learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However,
the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the
spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification
performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion
regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN
to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a
novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic
temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show
MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG
emotion regression and classification tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/MASA-TCN.

<p class="mathjax">One approach to explaining the hierarchical levels of understanding within a
machine learning model is the symbolic method of inductive logic programming
(ILP), which is data efficient and capable of learning first-order logic rules
that can entail data behaviour. A differentiable extension to ILP, so-called
differentiable Neural Logic (dNL) networks, are able to learn Boolean functions
as their neural architecture includes symbolic reasoning. We propose an
application of dNL in the field of Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL) to
address dynamic continuous environments. This represents an extension of
previous work in applying dNL-based ILP in RRL settings, as our proposed model
updates the architecture to enable it to solve problems in continuous RL
environments. The goal of this research is to improve upon current ILP methods
for use in RRL by incorporating non-linear continuous predicates, allowing RRL
agents to reason and make decisions in dynamic and continuous environments.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often an integral part of modern decision
support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of active mapping with a continually-learned neural
scene representation, namely Active Neural Mapping. The key lies in actively
finding the target space to be explored with efficient agent movement, thus
minimizing the map uncertainty on-the-fly within a previously unseen
environment. In this paper, we examine the weight space of the
continually-learned neural field, and show empirically that the neural
variability, the prediction robustness against random weight perturbation, can
be directly utilized to measure the instant uncertainty of the neural map.
Together with the continuous geometric information inherited in the neural map,
the agent can be guided to find a traversable path to gradually gain knowledge
of the environment. We present for the first time an active mapping system with
a coordinate-based implicit neural representation for online scene
reconstruction. Experiments in the visually-realistic Gibson and Matterport3D
environment demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Embodied conversational agent (ECA) development is a time-consuming and
costly process that calls for knowledge in a plethora of different and not
necessarily adjacent disciplines. Engaging in activities outside of one's core
research to acquire peripheral skills can impede innovation and potentially
restrict the outcomes within the boundaries of those acquired skills. A
proposal to tackle this challenge is creating collaborative communities of
experts from the contributing disciplines to the field of ECAs that via clearly
defined roles, expectations and communication channels can help extend the
field of ECA research.

<p class="mathjax">Our research aims to unify existing works' diverging opinions on how
architectural components affect the adversarial robustness of CNNs. To
accomplish our goal, we synthesize a suite of three generalizable robust
architectural design principles: (a) optimal range for depth and width
configurations, (b) preferring convolutional over patchify stem stage, and (c)
robust residual block design through adopting squeeze and excitation blocks and
non-parametric smooth activation functions. Through extensive experiments
across a wide spectrum of dataset scales, adversarial training methods, model
parameters, and network design spaces, our principles consistently and markedly
improve AutoAttack accuracy: 1-3 percentage points (pp) on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, and 4-9 pp on ImageNet. The code is publicly available at

been illustrated across a variety of research domains such as natural language
processing, computer vision, and molecular modeling. We extend this paradigm by
utilizing LLMs for material property prediction by introducing our model
Materials Informatics Transformer (MatInFormer). Specifically, we introduce a
novel approach that involves learning the grammar of crystallography through
the tokenization of pertinent space group information. We further illustrate
the adaptability of MatInFormer by incorporating task-specific data pertaining
to Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Through attention visualization, we uncover
the key features that the model prioritizes during property prediction. The
effectiveness of our proposed model is empirically validated across 14 distinct
datasets, hereby underscoring its potential for high throughput screening
through accurate material property prediction.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of agent selection in causal strategic learning under
multiple decision makers and address two key challenges that come with it.
Firstly, while much of prior work focuses on studying a fixed pool of agents
that remains static regardless of their evaluations, we consider the impact of
selection procedure by which agents are not only evaluated, but also selected.
When each decision maker unilaterally selects agents by maximising their own
utility, we show that the optimal selection rule is a trade-off between
selecting the best agents and providing incentives to maximise the agents'
improvement. Furthermore, this optimal selection rule relies on incorrect
predictions of agents' outcomes. Hence, we study the conditions under which a
decision maker's optimal selection rule will not lead to deterioration of
agents' outcome nor cause unjust reduction in agents' selection chance. To that
end, we provide an analytical form of the optimal selection rule and a
mechanism to retrieve the causal parameters from observational data, under
certain assumptions on agents' behaviour. Secondly, when there are multiple
decision makers, the interference between selection rules introduces another
source of biases in estimating the underlying causal parameters. To address
this problem, we provide a cooperative protocol which all decision makers must
collectively adopt to recover the true causal parameters. Lastly, we complement
our theoretical results with simulation studies. Our results highlight not only
the importance of causal modeling as a strategy to mitigate the effect of
gaming, as suggested by previous work, but also the need of a benevolent
regulator to enable it.

<p class="mathjax">Radiology report generation aims to automatically provide clinically
meaningful descriptions of radiology images such as MRI and X-ray. Although
great success has been achieved in natural scene image captioning tasks,
radiology report generation remains challenging and requires prior medical
knowledge. In this paper, we propose PromptRRG, a method that utilizes prompt
learning to activate a pretrained model and incorporate prior knowledge. Since
prompt learning for radiology report generation has not been explored before,
we begin with investigating prompt designs and categorise them based on varying
levels of knowledge: common, domain-specific and disease-enriched prompts.
Additionally, we propose an automatic prompt learning mechanism to alleviate
the burden of manual prompt engineering. This is the first work to
systematically examine the effectiveness of prompt learning for radiology
report generation. Experimental results on the largest radiology report
generation benchmark, MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be available upon the acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-like models for vision tasks have recently proven effective for a
wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection.
Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision
transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not
in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe
whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of
intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be
achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model
architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when
employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose
design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data
distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels,
already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise
finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly
corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our
results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are
simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable. Code
is at \url{https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/CRATE}.

<p class="mathjax">The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine
whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of
the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary
first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place.
Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to
achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown
to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either
limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to
find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that
there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output
behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial
specialization of the parameters. Furthermore, we give a sufficient
observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from
the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be
translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models often rely only on a small set of features even when
there is a rich set of predictive signals in the training data. This makes
models brittle and sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we first
examine vision transformers (ViTs) and find that they tend to extract robust
and spurious features with distinct attention heads. As a result of this
modularity, their performance under distribution shifts can be significantly
improved at test time by pruning heads corresponding to spurious features,
which we demonstrate using an "oracle selection" on validation data. Second, we
propose a method to further enhance the diversity and complementarity of the
learned features by encouraging orthogonality of the attention heads' input
gradients. We observe improved out-of-distribution performance on diagnostic
benchmarks (MNIST-CIFAR, Waterbirds) as a consequence of the enhanced diversity
of features and the pruning of undesirable heads.

<p class="mathjax">Structural columns are the crucial load-carrying components of buildings and
bridges. Early detection of column damage is important for the assessment of
the residual performance and the prevention of system-level collapse. This
research proposes an innovative end-to-end micro aerial vehicles (MAVs)-based
approach to automatically scan and inspect columns. First, an MAV-based
automatic image collection method is proposed. The MAV is programmed to sense
the structural columns and their surrounding environment. During the
navigation, the MAV first detects and approaches the structural columns. Then,
it starts to collect image data at multiple viewpoints around every detected
column. Second, the collected images will be used to assess the damage types
and damage locations. Third, the damage state of the structural column will be
determined by fusing the evaluation outcomes from multiple camera views. In
this study, reinforced concrete (RC) columns are selected to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
MAV-based inspection approach can effectively collect images from multiple
viewing angles, and accurately assess critical RC column damages. The approach
improves the level of autonomy during the inspection. In addition, the
evaluation outcomes are more comprehensive than the existing 2D vision methods.
The concept of the proposed inspection approach can be extended to other
structural columns such as bridge piers.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing complexity and scale of telecommunication networks have led to
a growing interest in automated anomaly detection systems. However, the
classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) has received less attention, resulting in a lack of information about
anomaly characteristics and classification processes. To address this gap, this
paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework
assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing
for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time
series. The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a time series simulator
that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI
behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time
series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected
anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework
performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has
demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained
on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data.

<p class="mathjax">After an earthquake, it is particularly important to provide the necessary
resources on site because a large number of infrastructures need to be repaired
or newly constructed. Due to the complex construction environment after the
disaster, there are potential safety hazards for human labors working in this
environment. With the advancement of robotic technology and artificial
intelligent (AI) algorithms, smart robotic technology is the potential solution
to provide construction resources after an earthquake. In this paper, the
robotic crane with advanced AI algorithms is proposed to provide resources for
infrastructure reconstruction after an earthquake. The proximal policy
optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, is implemented for
3D lift path planning when transporting the construction materials. The state
and reward function are designed in detail for RL model training. Two models
are trained through a loading task in different environments by using PPO
algorithm, one considering the influence of obstacles and the other not
considering obstacles. Then, the two trained models are compared and evaluated
through an unloading task and a loading task in simulation environments. For
each task, two different cases are considered. One is that there is no obstacle
between the initial position where the construction material is lifted and the
target position, and the other is that there are obstacles between the initial
position and the target position. The results show that the model that
considering the obstacles during training can generate proper actions for the
robotic crane to execute so that the crane can automatically transport the
construction materials to the desired location with swing suppression, short
time consumption and collision avoidance.

<p class="mathjax">We present a framework for the multiscale modeling of finite strain
magneto-elasticity based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs). By using a
set of problem specific invariants as input, an energy functional as the output
and by adding several non-trainable expressions to the overall total energy
density functional, the model fulfills multiple physical principles by
construction, e.g., thermodynamic consistency and material symmetry. Three
NN-based models with varying requirements in terms of an extended polyconvexity
condition of the magneto-elastic potential are presented. First, polyconvexity,
which is a global concept, is enforced via input convex neural networks
(ICNNs). Afterwards, we formulate a relaxed local version of the polyconvexity
and fulfill it in a weak sense by adding a tailored loss term. As an
alternative, a loss term to enforce the weaker requirement of strong
ellipticity locally is proposed, which can be favorable to obtain a better
trade-off between compatibility with data and physical constraints. Databases
for training of the models are generated via computational homogenization for
both compressible and quasi-incompressible magneto-active polymers (MAPs).
Thereby, to reduce the computational cost, 2D statistical volume elements and
an invariant-based sampling technique for the pre-selection of relevant states
are used. All models are calibrated by using the database, whereby
interpolation and extrapolation are considered separately. Furthermore, the
performance of the NN models is compared to a conventional model from the
literature. The numerical study suggests that the proposed physics-augmented NN
approach is advantageous over the conventional model for MAPs. Thereby, the two
more flexible NN models in combination with the weakly enforced local
polyconvexity lead to good results, whereas the model based only on ICNNs has
proven to be too restrictive.

<p class="mathjax">Since their inception in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data
across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas.
Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a
Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In
February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global
Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and
Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed,
leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein
GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a
general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation
metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also
delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection
between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence,
while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The
efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated
along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a
detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with
newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed
Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models. Finally, we
reveal several issues as well as future research outlines in this field.

<p class="mathjax">Sharing systems have facilitated the redistribution of underused resources by
providing convenient online marketplaces for individual sellers and buyers.
However, sellers in these systems may not fully disclose the information of
their shared commodities, due to strategic behaviors or privacy concerns.
Sellers' strategic information disclosure significantly affects buyers' user
experiences and systems' reputation. This paper presents the first analytical
study on information disclosure and pricing of competing sellers in sharing
systems. In particular, we propose a two-stage game framework to capture
sellers' strategic behaviors and buyers' decisions. Although the optimization
problem is challenging due to sellers' non-convex and non-monotonic objectives,
we completely characterize the complex market equilibria by decomposing it into
several tractable subproblems. We demonstrate that full disclosure by all
sellers or non-disclosure by all sellers will both lead to intense price
competition. The former all-disclosure case is never an equilibrium even when
all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs, while the
latter non-disclosure case can be an equilibrium under which all sellers get
zero profit. We also reveal several critical factors that affect sellers'
information disclosure. Interestingly, sellers' sharing capacity limitation and
buyers' estimation biases encourage information disclosure as they mitigate
sellers' competition.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the security of text
input fields in web browsers. We find that browsers' coarse-grained permission
model violates two security design principles: least privilege and complete
mediation. We further uncover two vulnerabilities in input fields, including
the alarming discovery of passwords in plaintext within the HTML source code of
the web page. To demonstrate the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities, we
design a proof-of-concept extension, leveraging techniques from static and
dynamic code injection attacks to bypass the web store review process. Our
measurements and case studies reveal that these vulnerabilities are prevalent
across various websites, with sensitive user information, such as passwords,
exposed in the HTML source code of even high-traffic sites like Google and
Cloudflare. We find that a significant percentage (12.5\%) of extensions
possess the necessary permissions to exploit these vulnerabilities and identify
190 extensions that directly access password fields. Finally, we propose two
countermeasures to address these risks: a bolt-on JavaScript package for
immediate adoption by website developers allowing them to protect sensitive
input fields, and a browser-level solution that alerts users when an extension
accesses sensitive input fields. Our research highlights the urgent need for
improved security measures to protect sensitive user information online.

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces an innovative violence detection framework tailored to
the unique requirements of smart airports, where prompt responses to violent
situations are crucial. The proposed framework harnesses the power of ViTPose
for human pose estimation. It employs a CNN - BiLSTM network to analyse spatial
and temporal information within keypoints sequences, enabling the accurate
classification of violent behaviour in real time. Seamlessly integrated within
the SAFE (Situational Awareness for Enhanced Security framework of SAAB, the
solution underwent integrated testing to ensure robust performance in real
world scenarios. The AIRTLab dataset, characterized by its high video quality
and relevance to surveillance scenarios, is utilized in this study to enhance
the model's accuracy and mitigate false positives. As airports face increased
foot traffic in the post pandemic era, implementing AI driven violence
detection systems, such as the one proposed, is paramount for improving
security, expediting response times, and promoting data informed decision
making. The implementation of this framework not only diminishes the
probability of violent events but also assists surveillance teams in
effectively addressing potential threats, ultimately fostering a more secure
and protected aviation sector. Codes are available at:

<p class="mathjax">The Internet and social media have altered how individuals access news in the
age of instantaneous information distribution. While this development has
increased access to information, it has also created a significant problem: the
spread of fake news and information. Fake news is rapidly spreading on digital
platforms, which has a negative impact on the media ecosystem, public opinion,
decision-making, and social cohesion. Natural Language Processing(NLP), which
offers a variety of approaches to identify content as authentic, has emerged as
a potent weapon in the growing war against disinformation. This paper takes an
in-depth look at how NLP technology can be used to detect fake news and reveals
the challenges and opportunities it presents.

redistribution. Our algorithm is provably monotone, total variation

labelled transition systems needed to be upgraded with a successor relation,

<p class="mathjax">Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) surpasses the conventional
frequency-division sensing and communications (FDSAC) in terms of spectrum,
energy, and hardware efficiency, with potential for greater enhancement through
integration of NOMA and signal alignment techniques. Leveraging these
advantages, this paper proposes a multiple-input multiple-output-NOMA-ISAC
framework with signal alignment and thoroughly analyzes its performance for
both downlink and uplink. 1) The downlink ISAC is investigated under three
different precoding designs: sensing-centric (S-C) design,
communications-centric (C-C) design, and Pareto optimal design. 2) For the
uplink case, two scenarios are investigated: S-C design and C-C design, based
on the interference cancellation order of the communication signal and the
sensing signal. In each of these scenarios, key performance metrics including
sensing rate (SR), communication rate (CR), and outage probability are
investigated. For a deeper understanding, the asymptotic performance of the
system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region is also explored, with a
focus on the high-SNR slope and diversity order. Finally, the SR-CR rate
regions achieved by ISAC and FDSAC are studied. Numerical results reveal that
in both downlink and uplink cases, ISAC outperforms FDSAC in terms of sensing
and communications performance and is capable of achieving a broader rate
region, clearly showcasing its superiority over the conventional FDSAC.

<p class="mathjax">A visualization notation is a recurring pattern of symbols used to author
specifications of visualizations, from data transformation to visual mapping.
Programmatic notations use symbols defined by grammars or domain-specific
languages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, Vega-Lite) or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib,
Pandas). Designers and prospective users of grammars and libraries often
evaluate visualization notations by inspecting galleries of examples. While
such collections demonstrate usage and expressiveness, their construction and
evaluation are usually ad hoc, making comparisons of different notations
difficult. More rarely, experts analyze notations via usability heuristics,
such as the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. These analyses, akin
to structured close readings of text, can reveal design deficiencies, but place
a burden on the expert to simultaneously consider many facets of often complex
systems. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a metrics-based approach to
usability evaluation and comparison of notations in which metrics are computed
for a gallery of examples across a suite of notations. While applicable to any
visualization domain, we explore the utility of our approach via a case study
considering statistical graphics that explores 40 visualizations across 9
widely used notations. We facilitate the computation of appropriate metrics and
analysis via a new tool called NotaScope. We gathered feedback via interviews
with authors or maintainers of prominent charting libraries (n=6). We find that
this approach is a promising way to formalize, externalize, and extend
evaluations and comparisons of visualization notations.

<p class="mathjax">We present Catalog Phrase Grounding (CPG), a model that can associate product
textual data (title, brands) into corresponding regions of product images
(isolated product region, brand logo region) for e-commerce vision-language
applications. We use a state-of-the-art modulated multimodal transformer
encoder-decoder architecture unifying object detection and phrase-grounding. We
train the model in self-supervised fashion with 2.3 million image-text pairs
synthesized from an e-commerce site. The self-supervision data is annotated
with high-confidence pseudo-labels generated with a combination of teacher
models: a pre-trained general domain phrase grounding model (e.g. MDETR) and a
specialized logo detection model. This allows CPG, as a student model, to
benefit from transfer knowledge from these base models combining general-domain
knowledge and specialized knowledge. Beyond immediate catalog phrase grounding
tasks, we can benefit from CPG representations by incorporating them as ML
features into downstream catalog applications that require deep semantic
understanding of products. Our experiments on product-brand matching, a
challenging e-commerce application, show that incorporating CPG representations
into the existing production ensemble system leads to on average 5% recall
improvement across all countries globally (with the largest lift of 11% in a
single country) at fixed 95% precision, outperforming other alternatives
including a logo detection teacher model and ResNet50.

<p class="mathjax">Although remote working is increasingly adopted during the pandemic, many are
concerned by the low-efficiency in the remote working. Missing in text-based
communication are non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language,
which hinders the effective communication and negatively impacts the work
outcomes. Prevalent on social media platforms, emojis, as alternative
non-verbal cues, are gaining popularity in the virtual workspaces well. In this
paper, we study how emoji usage influences developer participation and issue
resolution in virtual workspaces. To this end, we collect GitHub issues for a
one-year period and apply causal inference techniques to measure the causal
effect of emojis on the outcome of issues, controlling for confounders such as
issue content, repository, and author information. We find that emojis can
significantly reduce the resolution time of issues and attract more user
participation. We also compare the heterogeneous effect on different types of
issues. These findings deepen our understanding of the developer communities,
and they provide design implications on how to facilitate interactions and
broaden developer participation.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs), typified by OpenAI's GPT series and Meta's
LLaMA variants, have marked a significant advancement in artificial
intelligence. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of
understanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.
This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in
data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.
We delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,
and entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of
LLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational
expense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data
preprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,
coupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,
to improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of
LLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning
12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\% accuracy or F1 score
on 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite
certain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain
and anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles.

<p class="mathjax">Many theories of scientific and technological progress imagine science as an
iterative, developmental process periodically interrupted by innovations which
disrupt and restructure the status quo. Due to the immense societal value
created by these disruptive scientific and technological innovations,
accurately operationalizing this perspective into quantifiable terms represents
a key challenge for researchers seeking to understand the history and
mechanisms underlying scientific and technological progress. Researchers have
recently proposed a number of quantitative measures that seek to quantify the
extent to which works in science and technology are disruptive with respect to
their scientific context. While these disruption measures show promise in their
ability to quantify potentially disruptive works of science and technology,
their definitions are bespoke to the science of science and lack a broader
theoretical framework, obscuring their interrelationships and limiting their
adoption within broader network science paradigms. We propose a mathematical
framework for conceptualizing and measuring disruptive scientific contributions
within citation networks through the lens of network centrality, and formally
relate the CD Index disruption measure and its variants to betweenness
centrality. By reinterpreting disruption through the lens of centrality, we
unify a number of existing citation-based disruption measures while
simultaneously providing natural generalizations which enjoy empirical and
computational efficiencies. We validate these theoretical observations by
computing a variety of disruption measures on real citation data and find that
computing these centrality-based disruption measures over ego networks of
increasing radius results in better discernment of award-winning scientific
innovations relative to conventional disruption metrics which rely on local
citation context alone.

<p class="mathjax">The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act aims to regulate
manipulative and harmful uses of AI, but lacks precise definitions for key
concepts. This paper provides technical recommendations to improve the Act's
conceptual clarity and enforceability. We review psychological models to define
"personality traits," arguing the Act should protect full "psychometric
profiles." We urge expanding "behavior" to include "preferences" since
preferences causally influence and are influenced by behavior. Clear
definitions are provided for "subliminal," "manipulative," and "deceptive"
techniques, considering incentives, intent, and covertness. We distinguish
"exploiting individuals" from "exploiting groups," emphasising different policy
needs. An "informed decision" is defined by four facets: comprehension,
accurate information, no manipulation, and understanding AI's influence. We
caution the Act's therapeutic use exemption given the lack of regulation of
digital therapeutics by the EMA. Overall, the recommendations strengthen
definitions of vague concepts in the EU AI Act, enhancing precise applicability
to regulate harmful AI manipulation.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Model (LLM) inference consists of two distinct phases -
prefill phase which processes the input prompt and decode phase which generates
output tokens autoregressively. While the prefill phase effectively saturates
GPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute
utilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying
prefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using
pipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.
<br />We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs
chunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and
decode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk
and populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill
chunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up
to an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills
allows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill
request, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback. Furthermore, the
uniform compute design of these batches ameliorates the imbalance between
micro-batches, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles.
<br />Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across
models and hardware. For the LLaMA-13B model on A6000 GPU, SARATHI improves
decode throughput by up to 10x, and accelerates end-to-end throughput by up to
1.33x. For LLaMa-33B on A100 GPU, we achieve 1.25x higher end-to-end-throughput
and up to 4.25x higher decode throughput. When used with pipeline parallelism
on GPT-3, SARATHI reduces bubbles by 6.29x, resulting in an end-to-end
throughput improvement of 1.91x.

<p class="mathjax">Improving data systems' performance for join operations has long been an
issue of great importance. More recently, a lot of focus has been devoted to
multi-way join performance and especially on reducing the negative impact of
producing intermediate tuples, which in the end do not make it in the final
result. We contribute a new multi-way join algorithm, coined SieveJoin, which
extends the well-known Bloomjoin algorithm to multi-way joins and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of join query execution efficiency.
SieveJoin's salient novel feature is that it allows the propagation of Bloom
filters in the join path, enabling the system to `stop early' and eliminate
useless intermediate join results. The key design objective of SieveJoin is to
efficiently `learn' the join results, based on Bloom filters, with negligible
memory overheads. We discuss the bottlenecks in delaying multi-way joins, and
how Bloom filters are used to remove the generation of unnecessary intermediate
join results. We provide a detailed experimental evaluation using various
datasets, against a state-of-the-art column-store database and a multi-way
worst-case optimal join algorithm, showcasing SieveJoin's gains in terms of
response time.

ability to handle graph-structured data and the improvement in practical
applications. However, many of these models prioritize high utility
performance, such as accuracy, with a lack of privacy consideration, which is a
major concern in modern society where privacy attacks are rampant. To address
this issue, researchers have started to develop privacy-preserving GNNs.
Despite this progress, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the
attacks and the techniques for preserving privacy in the graph domain. In this
survey, we aim to address this gap by summarizing the attacks on graph data
according to the targeted information, categorizing the privacy preservation
techniques in GNNs, and reviewing the datasets and applications that could be

<p class="mathjax">Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is structured to derive policies from
static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions.
Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence
modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context
using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task
learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's
attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights
across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address
this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a
potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling,
which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return
distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution
within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our
experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions
allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the
transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms
current state-of-the art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The detection of masonry damage is essential for preventing potentially
disastrous outcomes. Manual inspection can, however, take a long time and be
hazardous to human inspectors. Automation of the inspection process using novel
computer vision and machine learning algorithms can be a more efficient and
safe solution to prevent further deterioration of the masonry structures. Most
existing 2D vision-based methods are limited to qualitative damage
classification, 2D localization, and in-plane quantification. In this study, we
present a 3D vision-based methodology for accurate masonry damage detection,
which offers a more robust solution with a greater field of view, depth of
vision, and the ability to detect failures in complex environments. First,
images of the masonry specimens are collected to generate a 3D point cloud.
Second, 3D point clouds processing methods are developed to evaluate the
masonry damage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments on structural masonry components. Our experiments showed the
proposed system can effectively classify damage states and localize and
quantify critical damage features. The result showed the proposed method can
improve the level of autonomy during the inspection of masonry structures.

<p class="mathjax">Safe corridor-based Trajectory Optimization (TO) presents an appealing
approach for collision-free path planning of autonomous robots, offering global
optimality through its convex formulation. The safe corridor is constructed
based on the perceived map, however, the non-ideal perception induces
uncertainty, which is rarely considered in trajectory generation. In this
paper, we propose Distributionally Robust Safe Corridor Constraints (DRSCCs) to
consider the uncertainty of the safe corridor. Then, we integrate DRSCCs into
the trajectory optimization framework using Bernstein basis polynomials.
Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the trajectory optimization problem
incorporating DRSCCs is equivalent to a computationally efficient, convex
quadratic program. Compared to the nominal TO, our method enhances navigation
safety by significantly reducing the infeasible motions in presence of
uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed approach is validated through two robotic
applications, a micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a quadruped robot
Unitree A1.

<p class="mathjax">Community detection is an important content in complex network analysis. The
existing community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on
only using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes
is mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect
multipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the
model-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed
networks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as
betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic
block model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient
of nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is
proposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed
networks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows
the Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered
based on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and
clustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and
attributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is
employed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community
memberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community
detection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing
different network structures, and comparing with the community detection
results of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model
not only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect
various network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to
introducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes.
Overall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Text-based Visual Question Answering (TextVQA) aims at answering questions
about the text in images. Most works in this field focus on designing network
structures or pre-training tasks. All these methods list the OCR texts in
reading order (from left to right and top to bottom) to form a sequence, which
is treated as a natural language ``sentence''. However, they ignore the fact
that most OCR words in the TextVQA task do not have a semantical contextual
relationship. In addition, these approaches use 1-D position embedding to
construct the spatial relation between OCR tokens sequentially, which is not
reasonable. The 1-D position embedding can only represent the left-right
sequence relationship between words in a sentence, but not the complex spatial
position relationship. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method
named Separate and Locate (SaL) that explores text contextual cues and designs
spatial position embedding to construct spatial relations between OCR texts.
Specifically, we propose a Text Semantic Separate (TSS) module that helps the
model recognize whether words have semantic contextual relations. Then, we
introduce a Spatial Circle Position (SCP) module that helps the model better
construct and reason the spatial position relationships between OCR texts. Our
SaL model outperforms the baseline model by 4.44% and 3.96% accuracy on TextVQA
and ST-VQA datasets. Compared with the pre-training state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on 64 million pre-training samples, our method, without any
pre-training tasks, still achieves 2.68% and 2.52% accuracy improvement on
TextVQA and ST-VQA. Our code and models will be released at
https://github.com/fangbufang/SaL.

<p class="mathjax">To handle graphs in which features or connectivities are evolving over time,
a series of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been proposed. Despite
the success of these TGNNs, the previous TGNN evaluations reveal several
limitations regarding four critical issues: 1) inconsistent datasets, 2)
inconsistent evaluation pipelines, 3) lacking workload diversity, and 4)
lacking efficient comparison. Overall, there lacks an empirical study that puts
TGNN models onto the same ground and compares them comprehensively. To this
end, we propose BenchTemp, a general benchmark for evaluating TGNN models on
various workloads. BenchTemp provides a set of benchmark datasets so that
different TGNN models can be fairly compared. Further, BenchTemp engineers a
standard pipeline that unifies the TGNN evaluation. With BenchTemp, we
extensively compare the representative TGNN models on different tasks (e.g.,
link prediction and node classification) and settings (transductive and
inductive), w.r.t. both effectiveness and efficiency metrics. We have made
BenchTemp publicly available at https://github.com/qianghuangwhu/benchtemp.

<p class="mathjax">Object tracking based on the fusion of visible and thermal im-ages, known as
RGB-T tracking, has gained increasing atten-tion from researchers in recent
years. How to achieve a more comprehensive fusion of information from the two
modalities with fewer computational costs has been a problem that re-searchers
have been exploring. Recently, with the rise of prompt learning in computer
vision, we can better transfer knowledge from visual large models to downstream
tasks. Considering the strong complementarity between visible and thermal
modalities, we propose a tracking architecture based on mutual prompt learning
between the two modalities. We also design a lightweight prompter that
incorporates attention mechanisms in two dimensions to transfer information
from one modality to the other with lower computational costs, embedding it
into each layer of the backbone. Extensive ex-periments have demonstrated that
our proposed tracking ar-chitecture is effective and efficient, achieving
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high running speeds.

<p class="mathjax">The equitable distribution of academic data is crucial for ensuring equal
research opportunities, and ultimately further progress. Yet, due to the
complexity of using the API for audio data that corresponds to the Million Song
Dataset along with its misreporting (before 2016) and the discontinuation of
this API (after 2016), access to this data has become restricted to those

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring
into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest
in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on
the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.
A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of
which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.
The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not
robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not
available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based
detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit
distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on
existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the
robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are
harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection
models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by
developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence
guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based
models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel
time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived
from our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the
XBlock-ETH repository

<p class="mathjax">The Tucker decomposition, an extension of singular value decomposition for
higher-order tensors, is a useful tool in analysis and compression of
large-scale scientific data. While it has been studied extensively for static
datasets, there are relatively few works addressing the computation of the
Tucker factorization of streaming data tensors. In this paper we propose a new
streaming Tucker algorithm tailored for scientific data, specifically for the
case of a data tensor whose size increases along a single streaming mode that
can grow indefinitely, which is typical of time-stepping scientific
applications. At any point of this growth, we seek to compute the Tucker
decomposition of the data generated thus far, without requiring storing the
past tensor slices in memory. Our algorithm accomplishes this by starting with
an initial Tucker decomposition and updating its components--the core tensor
and factor matrices--with each new tensor slice as it becomes available, while
satisfying a user-specified threshold of norm error. We present an
implementation within the TuckerMPI software framework, and apply it to
synthetic and combustion simulation datasets. By comparing against the standard
(batch) decomposition algorithm we show that our streaming algorithm provides
significant improvements in memory usage. If the tensor rank stops growing
along the streaming mode, the streaming algorithm also incurs less
computational time compared to the batch algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising
technique to enable versatile applications for future wireless
communications.To realize the huge potential performance gain, accurate channel
state information is a fundamental technical prerequisite. In conventional
massive MIMO, the channel is often modeled by the far-field planar-wavefront
with rich sparsity in the angular domain that facilitates the design of
low-complexity channel estimation. However, this sparsity is not conspicuous in
XL-MIMO systems due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront. To
address the inherent performance loss of the angular-domain channel estimation
schemes, we first propose the polar-domain multiple residual dense network
(P-MRDN) for XL-MIMO systems based on the polar-domain sparsity of the
near-field channel by improving the existing MRDN scheme. Furthermore, a
polar-domain multi-scale residual dense network (P-MSRDN) is designed to
improve the channel estimation accuracy. Finally, simulation results reveal the
superior performance of the proposed schemes compared with existing benchmark
schemes and the minimal influence of the channel sparsity on the proposed
schemes.

<p class="mathjax">We present a method for balancing between the Local and Global Structures
(LGS) in graph embedding, via a tunable parameter. Some embedding methods aim
to capture global structures, while others attempt to preserve local
neighborhoods. Few methods attempt to do both, and it is not always possible to
capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is
where most graph drawing live. The choice of using a local or a global
embedding for visualization depends not only on the task but also on the
structure of the underlying data, which may not be known in advance. For a
given graph, LGS aims to find a good balance between the local and global
structure to preserve. We evaluate the performance of LGS with synthetic and
real-world datasets and our results indicate that it is competitive with the
state-of-the-art methods, using established quality metrics such as stress and

<p class="mathjax">The goal of text spotting is to perform text detection and recognition in an
end-to-end manner. Although the diversity of luminosity and orientation in
scene texts has been widely studied, the font diversity and shape variance of
the same character are ignored in recent works, since most characters in
natural images are rendered in standard fonts. To solve this problem, we
present a Chinese Artistic Dataset, termed as ARText, which contains 33,000
artistic images with rich shape deformation and font diversity. Based on this
database, we develop a deformation robust text spotting method (DR TextSpotter)
to solve the recognition problem of complex deformation of characters in
different fonts. Specifically, we propose a geometric prior module to highlight
the important features based on the unsupervised landmark detection
sub-network. A graph convolution network is further constructed to fuse the
character features and landmark features, and then performs semantic reasoning
to enhance the discrimination for different characters. The experiments are
conducted on ARText and IC19-ReCTS datasets. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding
challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and
complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades,
intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor
sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of
circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that
simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing
based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN
encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where
circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph
basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the
number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical
roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of
public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To
tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an
open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with
carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with
communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can
help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing
corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of
CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent
powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the
way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits.

<p class="mathjax">While large deep neural networks excel at general video analytics tasks, the
significant demand on computing capacity makes them infeasible for real-time
inference on resource-constrained end cam-eras. In this paper, we propose an
edge-assisted framework that continuously updates the lightweight model
deployed on the end cameras to achieve accurate predictions in adverse
environments. This framework consists of three modules, namely, a key frame
extractor, a trigger controller, and a retraining manager. The low-cost key
frame extractor obtains frames that can best represent the current environment.
Those frames are then transmitted and buffered as the retraining data for model
update at the edge server. Once the trigger controller detects a significant
accuracy drop in the selected frames, the retraining manager outputs the
optimal retraining configuration balancing the accuracy and time cost. We
prototype our system on two end devices of different computing capacities with
one edge server. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves accuracy across all tested adverse environment scenarios (up to 24%)
and reduces more than 50% of the retraining time compared to existing
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are restricted from
accessing future context, which results in worse performance compared to the
non-streaming models. To improve the performance of streaming ASR, knowledge
distillation (KD) from the non-streaming to streaming model has been studied,
mainly focusing on aligning the output token probabilities. In this paper, we
propose a layer-to-layer KD from the teacher encoder to the student encoder. To
ensure that features are extracted using the same context, we insert auxiliary
non-streaming branches to the student and perform KD from the non-streaming
teacher layer to the non-streaming auxiliary layer. We design a special KD loss
that leverages the autoregressive predictive coding (APC) mechanism to
encourage the streaming model to predict unseen future contexts. Experimental
results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the word error
rate compared to previous token probability distillation methods.

<p class="mathjax">To enhance on-road environmental perception for autonomous driving, accurate
and real-time analytics on high-resolution video frames generated from on-board
cameras be-comes crucial. In this paper, we design a lightweight object
location method based on class activation mapping (CAM) to rapidly capture the
region of interest (RoI) boxes that contain driving safety related objects from
on-board cameras, which can not only improve the inference accuracy of vision
tasks, but also reduce the amount of transmitted data. Considering the limited
on-board computation resources, the RoI boxes extracted from the raw image are
offloaded to the edge for further processing. Considering both the dynamics of
vehicle-to-edge communications and the limited edge resources, we propose an
adaptive RoI box offloading algorithm to ensure prompt and accurate inference
by adjusting the down-sampling rate of each box. Extensive experimental results
on four high-resolution video streams demonstrate that our approach can
effectively improve the overall accuracy by up to 16% and reduce the
transmission demand by up to 49%, compared with other benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate video analytics in low-light environments, and
propose an end-edge coordinated system with joint video encoding and
enhancement. It adaptively transmits low-light videos from cameras and performs
enhancement and inference tasks at the edge. Firstly, according to our
observations, both encoding and enhancement for low-light videos have a
significant impact on inference accuracy, which directly influences bandwidth
and computation overhead. Secondly, due to the limitation of built-in
computation resources, cameras perform encoding and transmitting frames to the
edge. The edge executes neural enhancement to process low contrast, detail
loss, and color distortion on low-light videos before inference. Finally, an
adaptive controller is designed at the edge to select quantization parameters
and scales of neural enhancement networks, aiming to improve the inference
accuracy and meet the latency requirements. Extensive real-world experiments
demon-strate that, the proposed system can achieve a better trade-off between
communication and computation resources and optimize the inference accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate resource allocation problem in the context of
multiple virtual reality (VR) video flows sharing a certain link, considering
specific deadline of each video frame and the impact of different frames on
video quality. Firstly, we establish a queuing delay bound estimation model,
enabling link node to proactively discard frames that will exceed the deadline.
Secondly, we model the importance of different frames based on viewport feature
of VR video and encoding method. Accordingly, the frames of each flow are
sorted. Then we formulate a problem of minimizing long-term quality loss caused
by frame dropping subject to per-flow quality guarantee and bandwidth
constraints. Since the frequency of frame dropping and network fluctuation are
not on the same time scale, we propose a two-timescale resource allocation
scheme. On the long timescale, a queuing theory based resource allocation
method is proposed to satisfy quality requirement, utilizing frame queuing
delay bound to obtain minimum resource demand for each flow. On the short
timescale, in order to quickly fine-tune allocation results to cope with the
unstable network state, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm,
scheduling available resources based on the importance of frames in each flow.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
efficiently improve quality and fairness of VR video flows under various
network conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Raga is a fundamental melodic concept in Indian Art Music (IAM). It is
characterized by complex patterns. All performances and compositions are based
on the raga framework. Raga and tonic detection have been a long-standing
research problem in the field of Music Information Retrieval. In this paper, we
attempt to detect the raga using a novel feature to extract sequential or
temporal information from an audio sample. We call these Sequential Pitch
Distributions (SPD), which are distributions taken over pitch values between
two given pitch values over time. We also achieve state-of-the-art results on
both Hindustani and Carnatic music raga data sets with an accuracy of 99% and
88.13%, respectively. SPD gives a great boost in accuracy over a standard pitch
distribution. The main goal of this paper, however, is to present an
alternative approach to modeling the temporal aspects of the melody and thereby
deducing the raga.

<p class="mathjax">Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very powerful class of
numerical solvers for partial differential equations using deep neural
networks, and have been successfully applied to many diverse problems. However,
when applying the method to problems involving singularity, e.g., point sources
or geometric singularities, the obtained approximations often have low
accuracy, due to limited regularity of the exact solution. In this work, we
investigate PINNs for solving Poisson equations in polygonal domains with
geometric singularities and mixed boundary conditions. We propose a novel
singularity enriched PINN (SEPINN), by explicitly incorporating the singularity
behavior of the analytic solution, e.g., corner singularity, mixed boundary
condition and edge singularities, into the ansatz space, and present a
convergence analysis of the scheme. We present extensive numerical simulations
in two and three-dimensions to illustrate the efficiency of the method, and
also a comparative study with existing neural network based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents efficient algorithms, designed to leverage SIMD for
performing Montgomery reductions and additions on integers larger than 512
bits. The existing algorithms encounter inefficiencies when parallelized using
SIMD due to extensive dependencies in both operations, particularly noticeable
in costly operations like ARM's SVE. To mitigate this problem, a novel addition
algorithm is introduced that simulates the addition of large integers using a
smaller addition, quickly producing the same set of carries. These carries are
then utilized to perform parallel additions on large integers. For Montgomery
reductions, serial multiplications are replaced with precomputations that can
be effectively calculated using SIMD extensions. Experimental evidence
demonstrates that these proposed algorithms substantially enhance the
performance of state-of-the-art implementations of several post-quantum
cryptography algorithms. Notably, they deliver a 30% speed-up from the latest
CTIDH implementation, an 11% speed-up from the latest CSIDH implementation in
AVX-512 processors, and a 7% speed-up from Microsoft's standard PQCrypto-SIDH

<p class="mathjax">Practitioners interested in using computer vision models lack user-friendly
and open-source software that combines features to label training data, allow
multiple users, train new algorithms, review output, and implement new models.
Labeling training data, such as images, is a key step to developing accurate
object detection algorithms using computer vision. This step is often not
compatible with many cloud-based services for marking or labeling image and
video data due to limited internet bandwidth in many regions of the world.
Desktop tools are useful for groups working in remote locations, but users
often do not have the capability to combine projects developed locally by
multiple collaborators. Furthermore, many tools offer features for labeling
data or using pre-trained models for classification, but few allow researchers
to combine these steps to create and apply custom models. Free, open-source,
and user-friendly software that offers a full suite of features (e.g., ability
to work locally and online, and train custom models) is desirable to field
researchers and conservationists that may have limited coding skills. We
developed Njobvu-AI, a free, open-source tool that can be run on both desktop
and server hardware using Node.js, allowing users to label data, combine
projects for collaboration and review, train custom algorithms, and implement
new computer vision models. The name Njobvu-AI (pronounced N-joh-voo AI),
incorporating the Chichewa word for elephant, is inspired by a wildlife
monitoring program in Malawi that was a primary impetus for the development of
this tool and references similarities between the powerful memory of elephants
and properties of computer vision models.

<p class="mathjax">Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial issue in recommendation
systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However,
existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly,
users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and
modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a
single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario
prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between
different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack
multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable
evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between
models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is
relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these
limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset
based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the
following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items,
providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including
advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from
ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text
and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items
with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200
features, including 200 million users and 6 million items. It is currently the
largest-scale CTR dataset available. Based on AntM$^{2}$C, we construct several
typical CTR tasks and provide comparisons with baseline methods. The dataset
homepage is available at https://www.atecup.cn/home.

<p class="mathjax">As the basic element of graph-structured data, node has been recognized as
the main object of study in graph representation learning. A single node
intuitively has multiple node-centered subgraphs from the whole graph (e.g.,
one person in a social network has multiple social circles based on his
different relationships). We study this intuition under the framework of graph
contrastive learning, and propose a multiple node-centered subgraphs
contrastive representation learning method to learn node representation on
graphs in a self-supervised way. Specifically, we carefully design a series of
node-centered regional subgraphs of the central node. Then, the mutual
information between different subgraphs of the same node is maximized by
contrastive loss. Experiments on various real-world datasets and different
downstream tasks demonstrate that our model has achieved state-of-the-art
results.

<p class="mathjax">Unsignalized intersections are typically considered as one of the most
representative and challenging scenarios for self-driving vehicles. To tackle
autonomous driving problems in such scenarios, this paper proposes a curriculum
proximal policy optimization (CPPO) framework with stage-decaying clipping. By
adjusting the clipping parameter during different stages of training through
proximal policy optimization (PPO), the vehicle can first rapidly search for an
approximate optimal policy or its neighborhood with a large parameter, and then
converges to the optimal policy with a small one. Particularly, the stage-based
curriculum learning technology is incorporated into the proposed framework to
improve the generalization performance and further accelerate the training
process. Moreover, the reward function is specially designed in view of
different curriculum settings. A series of comparative experiments are
conducted in intersection-crossing scenarios with bi-lane carriageways to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed CPPO method. The results show that the
proposed approach demonstrates better adaptiveness to different dynamic and
complex environments, as well as faster training speed over baseline methods.

<p class="mathjax">The split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) is a relaxed variant of
the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) where the restriction that each
customer is visited precisely once is removed. Compared with CVRP, the SDVRP
allows a reduction in the cost of the routes traveled by vehicles. The exact
methods to solve the SDVRP are computationally expensive. Moreover, the
complexity and difficult implementation of the state-of-the-art heuristic
approaches hinder their application in real-life scenarios of the SDVRP. In
this paper, we propose an easily understandable and effective approach to solve
the SDVPR based on an a priori adaptive splitting algorithm (PASA). The idea of
a priori split strategy was first introduced in Chen et al. (2017). In this
approach, the demand of the customers is split into smaller values using a
fixed splitting rule in advance. Consequently, the original SDVRP instance is
converted to a CVRP instance which is solved using an existing CVRP solver.
While the proposed a priori splitting rule in Chen et al. (2017) is fixed for
all customers regardless of their demand and location, we suggest an adaptive
splitting rule that takes into account the distance of the customers to the
depot and their demand values. Our experiments show that PASA can generate
solutions comparable to the state-of-the-art but much faster. Furthermore, our
algorithm outperforms the fixed a priori splitting rule proposed by Chen et al.
(2017).

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops a new vascular respiratory motion compensation algorithm,
Motion-Related Compensation (MRC), to conduct vascular respiratory motion
compensation by extrapolating the correlation between invisible vascular and
visible non-vascular. Robot-assisted vascular intervention can significantly
reduce the radiation exposure of surgeons. In robot-assisted image-guided
intervention, blood vessels are constantly moving/deforming due to respiration,
and they are invisible in the X-ray images unless contrast agents are injected.
The vascular respiratory motion compensation technique predicts 2D vascular
roadmaps in live X-ray images. When blood vessels are visible after contrast
agents injection, vascular respiratory motion compensation is conducted based
on the sparse Lucas-Kanade feature tracker. An MRC model is trained to learn
the correlation between vascular and non-vascular motions. During the
intervention, the invisible blood vessels are predicted with visible tissues
and the trained MRC model. Moreover, a Gaussian-based outlier filter is adopted
for refinement. Experiments on in-vivo data sets show that the proposed method
can yield vascular respiratory motion compensation in 0.032 sec, with an
average error 1.086 mm. Our real-time and accurate vascular respiratory motion
compensation approach contributes to modern vascular intervention and surgical
robots.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile Internet has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles in various aspects.
Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) naturally plays a crucial role in
managing mobile Internet, especially with the explosive growth of mobile apps
using encrypted communication. Despite some existing learning-based ETC methods
showing promising results, three-fold limitations still remain in real-world
network environments, 1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance, 2)
traffic homogeneity caused by component sharing, and 3) training with reliance
on sufficient labeled traffic. None of the existing ETC methods can address all
these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-trAining
Semi-Supervised ETC framework, dubbed PASS. Our key insight is to resample the
original train dataset and perform contrastive pre-training without using
individual app labels directly to avoid label bias issues caused by class
imbalance, while obtaining a robust feature representation to differentiate
overlapping homogeneous traffic by pulling positive traffic pairs closer and
pushing negative pairs away. Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised
optimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss
weighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic
data and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms
state-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public
datasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably
pushing the F1 of Cross-Platform215 with 1.31%, ISCX-17 with 9.12%.
Furthermore, we validate the generality of the contrastive pre-training and
pseudo-label iteration components of PASS, which can adaptively benefit ETC
methods with diverse feature extractors.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the tradeoff between standard accuracy on clean examples
and robustness against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs).
Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the
standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we
propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i)
adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation
(RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples
by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on
clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an
algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD
penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained
and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones
when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these
components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more
effectively than previous AT-based methods do.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained language models like ChatGPT have significantly improved code
generation. As these models scale up, there is an increasing need for the
output to handle more intricate tasks. Moreover, in bioinformatics, generating
functional programs poses additional notable challenges due to the amount of
domain knowledge, the need for complicated data operations, and intricate
functional dependencies between the operations. Here, we present BioCoder, a
benchmark developed to evaluate existing pre-trained models in generating
bioinformatics code. In relation to function-code generation, BioCoder covers
potential package dependencies, class declarations, and global variables. It
incorporates 1026 functions and 1243 methods in Python and Java from GitHub and
253 examples from the Rosalind Project. BioCoder incorporates a fuzz-testing
framework for evaluation, and we have applied it to evaluate many models
including InCoder, CodeGen, CodeGen2, SantaCoder, StarCoder, StarCoder+,
InstructCodeT5+, and ChatGPT. Our detailed analysis of these models emphasizes
the importance of domain knowledge, pragmatic code generation, and contextual
understanding. Our dataset, benchmark, Docker images, and scripts required for

<p class="mathjax">The development of learning-based methods has greatly improved the detection
of synapses from electron microscopy (EM) images. However, training a model for
each dataset is time-consuming and requires extensive annotations.
Additionally, it is difficult to apply a learned model to data from different
brain regions due to variations in data distributions. In this paper, we
present AdaSyn, a two-stage segmentation-based framework for domain adaptive
synapse detection with weak point annotations. In the first stage, we address
the detection problem by utilizing a segmentation-based pipeline to obtain
synaptic instance masks. In the second stage, we improve model generalizability
on target data by regenerating square masks to get high-quality pseudo labels.
Benefiting from our high-accuracy detection results, we introduce the distance
nearest principle to match paired pre-synapses and post-synapses. In the
WASPSYN challenge at ISBI 2023, our method ranks the 1st place.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models exhibit enhanced zero-shot performance on various tasks
when fine-tuned with instruction-following data. Multimodal
instruction-following models extend these capabilities by integrating both text
and images. However, existing models such as MiniGPT-4 face challenges in
maintaining dialogue coherence in scenarios involving multiple images. A
primary reason is the lack of a specialized dataset for this critical
application. To bridge these gaps, we present SparklesChat, a multimodal
instruction-following model for open-ended dialogues across multiple images. To
support the training, we introduce SparklesDialogue, the first
machine-generated dialogue dataset tailored for word-level interleaved
multi-image and text interactions. Furthermore, we construct SparklesEval, a
GPT-assisted benchmark for quantitatively assessing a model's conversational
competence across multiple images and dialogue turns. Our experiments validate
the effectiveness of SparklesChat in understanding and reasoning across
multiple images and dialogue turns. Specifically, SparklesChat outperformed
MiniGPT-4 on established vision-and-language benchmarks, including the BISON
binary image selection task and the NLVR2 visual reasoning task. Moreover,
SparklesChat scored 8.56 out of 10 on SparklesEval, substantially exceeding
MiniGPT-4's score of 3.91 and nearing GPT-4's score of 9.26. Qualitative
evaluations further demonstrate SparklesChat's generality in handling
real-world applications. All resources will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Software development projects rely on issue tracking systems at the core of
tracking maintenance tasks such as bug reports, and enhancement requests.
Incoming issue-reports on these issue tracking systems must be managed in an
effective manner. First, they must be labelled and then assigned to a
particular developer with relevant expertise. This handling of issue-reports is
critical and requires thorough scanning of the text entered in an issue-report
making it a labor-intensive task. In this paper, we present a unified framework
called MaintainoMATE, which is capable of automatically categorizing the
issue-reports in their respective category and further assigning the
issue-reports to a developer with relevant expertise. We use the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), as an underlying model for
MaintainoMATE to learn the contextual information for automatic issue-report
labeling and assignment tasks. We deploy the framework used in this work as a
GitHub application. We empirically evaluate our approach on GitHub
issue-reports to show its capability of assigning labels to the issue-reports.
We were able to achieve an F1-score close to 80\%, which is comparable to
existing state-of-the-art results. Similarly, our initial evaluations show that
we can assign relevant developers to the issue-reports with an F1 score of
54\%, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches. Our initial
findings suggest that MaintainoMATE has the potential of improving software
quality and reducing maintenance costs by accurately automating activities
involved in the maintenance processes. Our future work would be directed
towards improving the issue-assignment module.

<p class="mathjax">While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels in semantic segmentation for
general-purpose images, its performance significantly deteriorates when applied
to medical images, primarily attributable to insufficient representation of
medical images in its training dataset. Nonetheless, gathering comprehensive
datasets and training models that are universally applicable is particularly
challenging due to the long-tail problem common in medical images. To address
this gap, here we present a Self-Sampling Meta SAM (SSM-SAM) framework for
few-shot medical image segmentation. Our innovation lies in the design of three
key modules: 1) An online fast gradient descent optimizer, further optimized by
a meta-learner, which ensures swift and robust adaptation to new tasks. 2) A
Self-Sampling module designed to provide well-aligned visual prompts for
improved attention allocation; and 3) A robust attention-based decoder
specifically designed for medical few-shot learning to capture relationship
between different slices. Extensive experiments on a popular abdominal CT
dataset and an MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot
segmentation, with an average improvements of 10.21% and 1.80% in terms of DSC,
respectively. In conclusion, we present a novel approach for rapid online
adaptation in interactive image segmentation, adapting to a new organ in just
0.83 minutes. Code is publicly available on GitHub upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">The efficient and accurate simulation of material systems with defects using
atomistic- to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods is a topic of considerable
interest in the field of computational materials science. To achieve the
desired balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, the use of a
posteriori analysis and adaptive algorithms is critical. In this work, we
present a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for three typical blended a/c
coupling methods: the blended energy-based quasi-continuum (BQCE) method, the
blended force-based quasi-continuum (BQCF) method, and the atomistic/continuum
blending with ghost force correction (BGFC) method. We employ first and
second-order finite element methods (and potentially higher-order methods) to
discretize the Cauchy-Born model in the continuum region. The resulting error
estimator provides both an upper bound on the true approximation error and a
lower bound up to a theory-based truncation indicator, ensuring its reliability
and efficiency. Moreover, we propose an a posteriori analysis for the energy
error. We have designed and implemented a corresponding adaptive mesh
refinement algorithm for two typical examples of crystalline defects. In both
numerical experiments, we observe optimal convergence rates with respect to
degrees of freedom when compared to a priori error estimates.

large knowledge bases. In this paper, we present our system to solve this task
at the Data Science and Advanced Analytics 2023 Competition "Efficient and
Effective Link Prediction" (DSAA-2023 Competition) with a corpus containing
948,233 training and 238,265 for public testing. This paper introduces an
approach to link prediction in Wikipedia articles by formulating it as a
natural language inference (NLI) task. Drawing inspiration from recent
advancements in natural language processing and understanding, we cast link
prediction as an NLI task, wherein the presence of a link between two articles
is treated as a premise, and the task is to determine whether this premise
holds based on the information presented in the articles. We implemented our
system based on the Sentence Pair Classification for Link Prediction for the
Wikipedia Articles task. Our system achieved 0.99996 Macro F1-score and 1.00000
Macro F1-score for the public and private test sets, respectively. Our team
UIT-NLP ranked 3rd in performance on the private test set, equal to the scores
of the first and second places. Our code is publicly for research purposes.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-network node classification (CNNC), which aims to classify nodes in a
label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source
network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address
CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network
(DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional
adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative
representations for node classification that are also transferrable across
networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to
separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to
jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes.
Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's
label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction.
In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source
network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class
propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly,
conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the
neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial
domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks
can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.

<p class="mathjax">In dynamic motion generation tasks, including contact and collisions, small
changes in policy parameters can lead to extremely different returns. For
example, in soccer, the ball can fly in completely different directions with a
similar heading motion by slightly changing the hitting position or the force
applied to the ball or when the friction of the ball varies. However, it is
difficult to imagine that completely different skills are needed for heading a
ball in different directions. In this study, we proposed a multitask
reinforcement learning algorithm for adapting a policy to implicit changes in
goals or environments in a single motion category with different reward
functions or physical parameters of the environment. We evaluated the proposed
method on the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed
that the proposed method can adapt to implicit changes in the goal positions or
the coefficients of restitution of the ball, whereas the standard domain
randomization approach cannot cope with different task settings.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) refers to a model expanded from a
Large Language Model (LLM) that possesses the capability to handle and infer
multi-modal data. Current MLLMs typically begin by using LLMs to decompose
tasks into multiple subtasks, then employing individual pre-trained models to
complete specific subtasks, and ultimately utilizing LLMs to integrate the
results of each subtasks to obtain the results of the task. In real-world
scenarios, when dealing with large projects, it is common practice to break
down the project into smaller sub-projects, with different teams providing
corresponding solutions or results. The project owner then decides which
solution or result to use, ensuring the best possible outcome for each subtask
and, consequently, for the entire project. Inspired by this, this study
considers selecting multiple pre-trained models to complete the same subtask.
By combining the results from multiple pre-trained models, the optimal subtask
result is obtained, enhancing the performance of the MLLM. Specifically, this
study first selects multiple pre-trained models focused on the same subtask
based on distinct evaluation approaches, and then invokes these models in
parallel to process input data and generate corresponding subtask results.
Finally, the results from multiple pre-trained models for the same subtask are
compared using the LLM, and the best result is chosen as the outcome for that
subtask. Extensive experiments are conducted in this study using GPT-4
annotated datasets and human-annotated datasets. The results of various
evaluation metrics adequately demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in this paper.

<p class="mathjax">We propose TCSP, a novel method for compressing a transformer model by
focusing on reducing the hidden size of the model. By projecting the whole
transform model into a subspace, we enable matrix operations between the weight
matrices in the model and features in a reduced-dimensional space, leading to
significant reductions in model parameters and computing resources. To
establish this subspace, we decompose the feature matrix, derived from
different layers of sampled data instances, into a projection matrix. For
evaluation, TCSP is applied to compress T5 and BERT models on the GLUE and
SQuAD benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSP achieves a
compression ratio of 44\% with at most 1.6\% degradation in accuracy,
surpassing or matching prior compression methods. Furthermore, TCSP exhibits
compatibility with other methods targeting filter and attention head size
compression.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale centralized development of wind and solar energy and peer-to-grid
transmission of renewable energy source (RES) via high voltage direct current
(HVDC) has been regarded as one of the most promising ways to achieve goals of
peak carbon and carbon neutrality in China. Traditionally, large-scale thermal
generation is needed to economically support the load demand of HVDC with a
given profile, which in turn raises concerns about carbon emissions. To address
the issues above, hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) and ammonia energy
storage system (AESS) are introduced to gradually replace thermal generation,
which is represented as a multi-stage expansion planning (MSEP) problem.
Specifically, first, HESS and AESS are established in the MSEP model with
carbon emission reduction constraints, and yearly data with hourly time
resolution are utilized for each stage to well describe the intermittence of
RES. Then, a combined Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) and column generation
(CG) solution approach is proposed to efficiently solve the large-scale MSEP
model. Finally, a real-life system in China is studied. The results indicate
that HESS and AESS have the potential to handle the intermittence of RES, as
well as the monthly imbalance between RES and load demand. Especially under the
goal of carbon neutrality, the contribution of HESS and AESS in reducing
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reaches 12.28% and 14.59%, respectively, which
finally leads to a LCOE of 0.4324 RMB/kWh.

<p class="mathjax">Vectorized high-definition map online construction has garnered considerable
attention in the field of autonomous driving research. Most existing approaches
model changeable map elements using a fixed number of points, or predict local
maps in a two-stage autoregressive manner, which may miss essential details and
lead to error accumulation. Towards precise map element learning, we propose a
simple yet effective architecture named PivotNet, which adopts unified
pivot-based map representations and is formulated as a direct set prediction
paradigm. Concretely, we first propose a novel Point-to-Line Mask module to
encode both the subordinate and geometrical point-line priors in the network.
Then, a well-designed Pivot Dynamic Matching module is proposed to model the
topology in dynamic point sequences by introducing the concept of sequence
matching. Furthermore, to supervise the position and topology of the vectorized
point predictions, we propose a Dynamic Vectorized Sequence loss. Extensive
experiments and ablations show that PivotNet is remarkably superior to other
SOTAs by 5.9 mAP at least. The code will be available soon.

objects ranging from 5mm to 25mm. Our integrated strategy incorporates the
robot arm, gripper, and sensor to manipulate and orient small objects for
subsequent classification effectively. We contribute a specialized dataset
designed for classifying these objects based on tactile sensor output and a new
control algorithm for in-hand orientation tasks. Our system demonstrates 88% of
successful grasp and successfully classified small objects in cluttered
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We present Point-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation framework for point cloud
registration (PCR) that improves the generalization and the performance of
registration models. While learning-based approaches have achieved impressive
progress, generalization to unknown testing environments remains a major
challenge due to the variations in 3D scans. Existing methods typically train a
generic model and the same trained model is applied on each instance during
testing. This could be sub-optimal since it is difficult for the same model to
handle all the variations during testing. In this paper, we propose a test-time
adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at
test-time without requiring any prior knowledge of the test data. Concretely,
we design three self-supervised auxiliary tasks that are optimized jointly with
the primary PCR task. Given a test instance, we adapt our model using these
auxiliary tasks and the updated model is used to perform the inference. During
training, our model is trained using a meta-auxiliary learning approach, such
that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks improves the accuracy of the primary
task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
improving generalization of point cloud registration and outperforming other
state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">As multi-robot systems continue to advance and become integral to various
applications, managing conflicts and ensuring secure access control are
critical challenges that need to be addressed. Access control is essential in
multi-robot systems to ensure secure and authorized interactions among robots,
protect sensitive data, and prevent unauthorized access to resources. This
paper presents a novel framework for customizable conflict resolution and
attribute-based access control in multi-robot systems for ROS 2 leveraging the
Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. We introduce an attribute-based access control
(ABAC) Fabric-ROS 2 bridge to enable secure communication and control between
users and robots. By defining conflict resolution policies based on task
priorities, robot capabilities, and user-defined constraints, our framework
offers a flexible way to resolve conflicts. Additionally, it incorporates
attribute-based access control, granting access rights based on user and robot
attributes. ABAC offers a modular approach to control access compared to
existing access control approaches in ROS 2, such as SROS2. Through this
framework, multi-robot systems can be managed efficiently, securely, and
adaptably, ensuring controlled access to resources and managing conflicts. Our
experimental evaluation shows that our framework marginally improves latency
and throughput over exiting Fabric and ROS 2 integration solutions. At higher
network load, it is the only solution to operate reliably without a diverging
transaction commitment latency. We also demonstrate how conflicts arising from
simultaneous control or a robot by two users are resolved in real-time and
motion distortion is effectively eliminated.

<p class="mathjax">Affordable 3D scanners often produce sparse and non-uniform point clouds that
negatively impact downstream applications in robotic systems. While existing
point cloud upsampling architectures have demonstrated promising results on
standard benchmarks, they tend to experience significant performance drops when
the test data have different distributions from the training data. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a test-time adaption approach to enhance model
generality of point cloud upsampling. The proposed approach leverages
meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption.
Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During
meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of
instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point
clouds from the training data. During meta-testing, the trained model is
fine-tuned with a few gradient updates to produce a unique set of network
parameters for each test instance. The updated model is then used for the final
prediction. Our framework is generic and can be applied in a plug-and-play
manner with existing backbone networks in point cloud upsampling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models.

<p class="mathjax">Nighttime person Re-ID (person re-identification in the nighttime) is a very
important and challenging task for visual surveillance but it has not been
thoroughly investigated. Under the low illumination condition, the performance
of person Re-ID methods usually sharply deteriorates. To address the low
illumination challenge in nighttime person Re-ID, this paper proposes an
Illumination Distillation Framework (IDF), which utilizes illumination
enhancement and illumination distillation schemes to promote the learning of
Re-ID models. Specifically, IDF consists of a master branch, an illumination
enhancement branch, and an illumination distillation module. The master branch
is used to extract the features from a nighttime image. The illumination
enhancement branch first estimates an enhanced image from the nighttime image
using a nonlinear curve mapping method and then extracts the enhanced features.
However, nighttime and enhanced features usually contain data noise due to
unstable lighting conditions and enhancement failures. To fully exploit the
complementary benefits of nighttime and enhanced features while suppressing
data noise, we propose an illumination distillation module. In particular, the
illumination distillation module fuses the features from two branches through a
bottleneck fusion model and then uses the fused features to guide the learning
of both branches in a distillation manner. In addition, we build a real-world
nighttime person Re-ID dataset, named Night600, which contains 600 identities
captured from different viewpoints and nighttime illumination conditions under
complex outdoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our IDF can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on two nighttime person Re-ID datasets
(i.e., Night600 and Knight ). We will release our code and dataset at
https://github.com/Alexadlu/IDF.

When denoising the latent, the predicted original image at each step

denoising nature of the diffuser, and only renders a sharpening process. This

<p class="mathjax">Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Previous work has proposed
incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential
solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this
approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students,
educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data
analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and
benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve
the state of science?
<br />In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the
project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL
(N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys
administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can
replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively
and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data
analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes
in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of
attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide
information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate
replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring
as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible
benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities,
such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication
barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.
<br />Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large
data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a
by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and
students.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown powerful capabilities in visual
question answering and reasoning tasks by combining visual representations with
the abstract skill set large language models (LLMs) learn during pretraining.
Vision, while the most popular modality to augment LLMs with, is only one
representation of a scene. In human-robot interaction scenarios, robot
perception requires accurate scene understanding by the robot. In this paper,
we define and demonstrate a method of aligning the embedding spaces of
different modalities (in this case, inertial measurement unit (IMU) data) to
the vision embedding space through a combination of supervised and contrastive
training, enabling the VLM to understand and reason about these additional
modalities without retraining. We opt to give the model IMU embeddings directly
over using a separate human activity recognition model that feeds directly into
the prompt to allow for any nonlinear interactions between the query, image,
and IMU signal that would be lost by mapping the IMU data to a discrete
activity label. Further, we demonstrate our methodology's efficacy through
experiments involving human activity recognition using IMU data and visual
inputs. Our results show that using multiple modalities as input improves the
VLM's scene understanding and enhances its overall performance in various
tasks, thus paving the way for more versatile and capable language models in
multi-modal contexts.

<p class="mathjax">Building on the theory of quantum posets, we introduce a non-commutative
version of suplattices, i.e., complete lattices whose morphisms are
supremum-preserving maps, which form a step towards a new notion of quantum
topological spaces. We show that the theory of these quantum suplattices
resembles the classical theory: the opposite quantum poset of a quantum
suplattice is again a quantum suplattice, and quantum suplattices arise as
algebras of a non-commutative version of the monad of downward-closed subsets
of a poset. The existence of this monad is proved by introducing a
non-commutative generalization of monotone relations between quantum posets,
which form a compact closed category. Moreover, we introduce a non-commutative
generalization of Galois connections and we prove that an upper Galois adjoint
of a monotone map between quantum suplattices exists if and only if the map is
a morphism of quantum suplattices. Finally, we prove a quantum version of the
Knaster-Tarski fixpoint theorem: the quantum set of fixpoints of a monotone
endomap on a quantum suplattice form a quantum suplattice.

<p class="mathjax">The notion of a Moore-Penrose inverse (M-P inverse) was introduced by Moore
in 1920 and rediscovered by Penrose in 1955. The M-P inverse of a complex
matrix is a special type of inverse which is unique, always exists, and can be
computed using singular value decomposition. In a series of papers in the
1980s, Puystjens and Robinson studied M-P inverses more abstractly in the
context of dagger categories. Despite the fact that dagger categories are now a
fundamental notion in categorical quantum mechanics, the notion of a M-P
inverse has not (to our knowledge) been revisited since their work. One purpose
of this paper is, thus, to renew the study of M-P inverses in dagger
categories.
<br />Here we introduce the notion of a Moore-Penrose dagger category and provide
many examples including complex matrices, finite Hilbert spaces, dagger
groupoids, and inverse categories. We also introduce generalized versions of
singular value decomposition, compact singular value decomposition, and polar
decomposition for maps in a dagger category, and show how, having such a
decomposition is equivalent to having M-P inverses. This allows us to provide
precise characterizations of which maps have M-P inverses in a dagger
idempotent complete category, a dagger kernel category with dagger biproducts
(and negatives), and a dagger category with unique square roots.

<p class="mathjax">Ambiguities in natural language give rise to probability distributions over
interpretations. The distributions are often over multiple ambiguous words at a
time; a multiplicity which makes them a suitable topic for sheaf-theoretic
models of quantum contextuality. Previous research showed that different
quantitative measures of contextuality correlate well with Psycholinguistic
research on lexical ambiguities. In this work, we focus on coreference
ambiguities and investigate the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a test
proposed by Levesque in 2011 to evaluate the intelligence of machines. The WSC
consists of a collection of multiple-choice questions that require
disambiguating pronouns in sentences structured according to the Winograd
schema, in a way that makes it difficult for machines to determine the correct
referents but remains intuitive for human comprehension. In this study, we
propose an approach that analogously models the Winograd schema as an
experiment in quantum physics. However, we argue that the original Winograd
Schema is inherently too simplistic to facilitate contextuality. We introduce a
novel mechanism for generalising the schema, rendering it analogous to a
Bell-CHSH measurement scenario. We report an instance of this generalised
schema, complemented by the human judgements we gathered via a crowdsourcing
platform. The resulting model violates the Bell-CHSH inequality by 0.192, thus
exhibiting contextuality in a coreference resolution setting.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we are concerned with the automated exchange of orders between
logistics companies in a marketplace platform to optimize total revenues. We
introduce a novel multi-agent approach to this problem, focusing on the
Collaborative Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) through the lens of individual
rationality. Our proposed algorithm applies the principles of Vehicle Routing
Problem (VRP) to pairs of vehicles from different logistics companies,
optimizing the overall routes while considering standard VRP constraints plus
individual rationality constraints. By facilitating cooperation among competing
logistics agents through a Give-and-Take approach, we show that it is possible
to reduce travel distance and increase operational efficiency system-wide. More
importantly, our approach ensures individual rationality and faster

sustainability of the marketplace platform. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach through extensive experiments using real-world test data from major

<p class="mathjax">Recommender models excel at providing domain-specific item recommendations by
leveraging extensive user behavior data. Despite their ability to act as
lightweight domain experts, they struggle to perform versatile tasks such as
providing explanations and engaging in conversations. On the other hand, large
language models (LLMs) represent a significant step towards artificial general
intelligence, showcasing remarkable capabilities in instruction comprehension,
commonsense reasoning, and human interaction. However, LLMs lack the knowledge
of domain-specific item catalogs and behavioral patterns, particularly in areas
that diverge from general world knowledge, such as online e-commerce.
Finetuning LLMs for each domain is neither economic nor efficient.
<br />In this paper, we bridge the gap between recommender models and LLMs,
combining their respective strengths to create a versatile and interactive
recommender system. We introduce an efficient framework called RecAgent, which
employs LLMs as the brain and recommender models as tools. We first outline a
minimal set of essential tools required to transform LLMs into RecAgent. We
then propose an efficient workflow within RecAgent for task execution,
incorporating key components such as a memory bus, dynamic
demonstration-augmented task planning, and reflection. RecAgent enables
traditional recommender systems, such as those ID-based matrix factorization
models, to become interactive systems with a natural language interface through
the integration of LLMs. Experimental results on several public datasets show
that RecAgent achieves satisfying performance as a conversational recommender
system, outperforming general-purpose LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in real image editing have been attributed to the
exploration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) latent space. However,
the main challenge of this procedure is GAN inversion, which aims to map the
image to the latent space accurately. Existing methods that work on extended
latent space $W+$ are unable to achieve low distortion and high editability
simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose an approach which works in
native latent space $W$ and tunes the generator network to restore missing
image details. We introduce a novel regularization strategy with learnable
coefficients obtained by training randomized StyleGAN 2 model - WRanGAN. This
method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of reconstruction quality
and computational efficiency, achieving the lowest distortion with 4 times
fewer parameters. Furthermore, we observe a slight improvement in the quality
of constructing hyperplanes corresponding to binary image attributes. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two complex datasets:
Flickr-Faces-HQ and LSUN Church.

<p class="mathjax">We propose MVDream, a multi-view diffusion model that is able to generate
geometrically consistent multi-view images from a given text prompt. By
leveraging image diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale web datasets and a
multi-view dataset rendered from 3D assets, the resulting multi-view diffusion
model can achieve both the generalizability of 2D diffusion and the consistency
of 3D data. Such a model can thus be applied as a multi-view prior for 3D
generation via Score Distillation Sampling, where it greatly improves the
stability of existing 2D-lifting methods by solving the 3D consistency problem.
Finally, we show that the multi-view diffusion model can also be fine-tuned
under a few shot setting for personalized 3D generation, i.e. DreamBooth3D
application, where the consistency can be maintained after learning the subject

<p class="mathjax">\textsc{Edge Triangle Packing} and \textsc{Edge Triangle Covering} are dual
problems extensively studied in the field of parameterized complexity.
<br />Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, \textsc{Edge Triangle Packing} seeks to
determine whether there exists a set of at least $k$ edge-disjoint triangles in
$G$,
<br />while \textsc{Edge Triangle Covering} aims to find out whether there exists a
set of at most $k$ edges that intersects all triangles in $G$.
<br />Previous research has shown that \textsc{Edge Triangle Packing} has a kernel
of $(3+\epsilon)k$ vertices, while \textsc{Edge Triangle Covering} has a kernel
of $6k$ vertices.
<br />In this paper, we show that the two problems allow kernels of $3k$ vertices,
improving all previous results. A significant contribution of our work is the
utilization of a novel discharging method for analyzing kernel size, which

<p class="mathjax">Over-squashing and over-smoothing are two critical issues, that limit the
capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs). While over-smoothing eliminates
the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing
refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances,
as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations.
Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph
topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose
CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of
a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing
and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature,
CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper
models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other
state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms
of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool
outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most
consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the
sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each
pool.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing has gained popularity in edge computing due to its
flexible features, including the pay-per-use pricing model, auto-scaling
capabilities, and multi-tenancy support. Complex Serverless-based applications
typically rely on Serverless workflows (also known as Serverless function
orchestration) to express task execution logic, and numerous application- and
system-level optimization techniques have been developed for Serverless
workflow scheduling. However, there has been limited exploration of optimizing
Serverless workflow scheduling in edge computing systems, particularly in
high-density, resource-constrained environments such as system-on-chip clusters
and single-board-computer clusters. In this work, we discover that existing
Serverless workflow scheduling techniques typically assume models with limited
expressiveness and cause significant resource contention. To address these
issues, we propose modeling Serverless workflows using behavior trees, a novel
and fundamentally different approach from existing directed-acyclic-graph- and
state machine-based models. Behavior tree-based modeling allows for easy
analysis without compromising workflow expressiveness. We further present
observations derived from the inherent tree structure of behavior trees for
contention-free function collections and awareness of exact and empirical
concurrent function invocations. Based on these observations, we introduce
BeeFlow, a behavior tree-based Serverless workflow system tailored for
resource-constrained edge clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that
BeeFlow achieves up to 3.2X speedup in a high-density, resource-constrained
edge testbed and 2.5X speedup in a high-profile cloud testbed, compared with
the state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Lidar point clouds, as a type of data with accurate distance perception, can
effectively represent the motion and posture of objects in three-dimensional
space. However, the sparsity and disorderliness of point clouds make it
challenging to extract features directly from them. Many studies have addressed
this issue by transforming point clouds into regular voxel representations.
However, these methods often lead to the loss of fine-grained local feature
information due to downsampling. Moreover, the sparsity of point clouds poses
difficulties in efficiently aggregating features in 3D feature layers using
voxel-based two-stage methods. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
two-stage 3D detection framework called MS$^{2}$3D. In MS$^{2}$3D, we utilize
small-sized voxels to extract fine-grained local features and large-sized
voxels to capture long-range local features. Additionally, we propose a method
for constructing 3D feature layers using multi-scale semantic feature points,
enabling the transformation of sparse 3D feature layers into more compact
representations. Furthermore, we compute the offset between feature points in
the 3D feature layers and the centroid of objects, aiming to bring them as
close as possible to the object's center. It significantly enhances the
efficiency of feature aggregation. To validate the effectiveness of our method,
we evaluated our method on the KITTI dataset and ONCE dataset together.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous exploration requires the robot to explore an unknown environment
while constructing an accurate map with the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping) techniques. Without prior information, the exploratory performance is
usually conservative due to the limited planning horizon. This paper exploits a
prior topo-metric graph of the environment to benefit both the exploration
efficiency and the pose graph accuracy in SLAM. Based on recent advancements in
relating pose graph reliability with graph topology, we are able to formulate
both objectives into a SLAM-aware path planning problem over the prior graph,
which finds a fast exploration path with informative loop closures that
globally stabilize the pose graph. Furthermore, we derive theoretical
thresholds to speed up the greedy algorithm to the problem, which significantly
prune non-optimal loop closures in iterations. The proposed planner is
incorporated into a hierarchical exploration framework, with flexible features
including path replanning and online prior map update that adds additional
information to the prior graph. Extensive experiments indicate that our method
has comparable exploration efficiency to others while consistently maintaining
higher mapping accuracy in various environments. Our implementations will be
open-source on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) extends object detection problem to a
realistic and dynamic scenario, where a detection model is required to be
capable of detecting both known and unknown objects and incrementally learning
newly introduced knowledge. Current OWOD models, such as ORE and OW-DETR, focus
on pseudo-labeling regions with high objectness scores as unknowns, whose
performance relies heavily on the supervision of known objects. While they can
detect the unknowns that exhibit similar features to the known objects, they
suffer from a severe label bias problem that they tend to detect all regions
(including unknown object regions) that are dissimilar to the known objects as
part of the background. To eliminate the label bias, this paper proposes a
novel approach that learns an unsupervised discriminative model to recognize
true unknown objects from raw pseudo labels generated by unsupervised region
proposal methods. The resulting model can be further refined by a
classification-free self-training method which iteratively extends pseudo
unknown objects to the unlabeled regions. Experimental results show that our
method 1) significantly outperforms the prior SOTA in detecting unknown objects
while maintaining competitive performance of detecting known object classes on
the MS COCO dataset, and 2) achieves better generalization ability on the LVIS
and Objects365 datasets.

<p class="mathjax">To enable meaningful robotic manipulation of objects in the real-world, 6D
pose estimation is one of the critical aspects. Most existing approaches have
difficulties to extend predictions to scenarios where novel object instances
are continuously introduced, especially with heavy occlusions. In this work, we
propose a few-shot pose estimation (FSPE) approach called SA6D, which uses a
self-adaptive segmentation module to identify the novel target object and
construct a point cloud model of the target object using only a small number of
cluttered reference images. Unlike existing methods, SA6D does not require
object-centric reference images or any additional object information, making it
a more generalizable and scalable solution across categories. We evaluate SA6D
on real-world tabletop object datasets and demonstrate that SA6D outperforms
existing FSPE methods, particularly in cluttered scenes with occlusions, while
requiring fewer reference images.

<p class="mathjax">We propose augmenting the empathetic capacities of social robots by
integrating non-verbal cues. Our primary contribution is the design and
labeling of four types of empathetic non-verbal cues, abbreviated as SAFE:
Speech, Action (gesture), Facial expression, and Emotion, in a social robot.
These cues are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM). We developed an
LLM-based conversational system for the robot and assessed its alignment with
social cues as defined by human counselors. Preliminary results show distinct
patterns in the robot's responses, such as a preference for calm and positive
social emotions like 'joy' and 'lively', and frequent nodding gestures. Despite
these tendencies, our approach has led to the development of a social robot
capable of context-aware and more authentic interactions. Our work lays the
groundwork for future studies on human-robot interactions, emphasizing the
essential role of both verbal and non-verbal cues in creating social and
empathetic robots.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL)-based solutions have been extensively researched in the
medical domain in recent years, enhancing the efficacy of diagnosis, planning,
and treatment. Since the usage of health-related data is strictly regulated,
processing medical records outside the hospital environment for developing and
using DL models demands robust data protection measures. At the same time, it
can be challenging to guarantee that a DL solution delivers a minimum level of
performance when being trained on secured data, without being specifically
designed for the given task. Our approach uses singular value decomposition
(SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA) to obfuscate the medical images
before employing them in the DL analysis. The capability of DL algorithms to
extract relevant information from secured data is assessed on a task of
angiographic view classification based on obfuscated frames. The security level
is probed by simulated artificial intelligence (AI)-based reconstruction
attacks, considering two threat actors with different prior knowledge of the
targeted data. The degree of privacy is quantitatively measured using
similarity indices. Although a trade-off between privacy and accuracy should be
considered, the proposed technique allows for training the angiographic view
classifier exclusively on secured data with satisfactory performance and with
no computational overhead, model adaptation, or hyperparameter tuning. While
the obfuscated medical image content is well protected against human
perception, the hypothetical reconstruction attack proved that it is also
difficult to recover the complete information of the original frames.

<p class="mathjax">The unstructured nature of point clouds demands that local aggregation be
adaptive to different local structures. Previous methods meet this by
explicitly embedding spatial relations into each aggregation process. Although
this coupled approach has been shown effective in generating clear semantics,
aggregation can be greatly slowed down due to repeated relation learning and
redundant computation to mix directional and point features. In this work, we
propose to decouple the explicit modelling of spatial relations from local
aggregation. We theoretically prove that basic neighbor pooling operations can
too function without loss of clarity in feature fusion, so long as essential
spatial information has been encoded in point features. As an instantiation of
decoupled local aggregation, we present DeLA, a lightweight point network,
where in each learning stage relative spatial encodings are first formed, and
only pointwise convolutions plus edge max-pooling are used for local
aggregation then. Further, a regularization term is employed to reduce
potential ambiguity through the prediction of relative coordinates.
Conceptually simple though, experimental results on five classic benchmarks
demonstrate that DeLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced or
comparable latency. Specifically, DeLA achieves over 90\% overall accuracy on
ScanObjectNN and 74\% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Matrix-ASC/DeLA .

<p class="mathjax">Score-based and diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for
both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is
based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier
guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when the
classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose an approach to sample from
unconditional score-based generative models enforcing arbitrary logical
constraints, without any additional training. Firstly, we show how to
manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized
distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a
flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft
logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but
approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective
heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of our approach for various types of constraints and data:
tabular data, images and time series.

<p class="mathjax">This report examines Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial sector,
outlining its potential to revolutionise the industry and identify its
challenges. It underscores the criticality of a well-rounded understanding of
AI, its capabilities, and its implications to effectively leverage its
potential while mitigating associated risks. The potential of AI potential
extends from augmenting existing operations to paving the way for novel
applications in the finance sector. The application of AI in the financial
sector is transforming the industry. Its use spans areas from customer service
enhancements, fraud detection, and risk management to credit assessments and
high-frequency trading. However, along with these benefits, AI also presents
several challenges. These include issues related to transparency,
interpretability, fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness. The use of AI
in the financial sector further raises critical questions about data privacy
and security. A further issue identified in this report is the systemic risk
that AI can introduce to the financial sector. Being prone to errors, AI can
exacerbate existing systemic risks, potentially leading to financial crises.
Regulation is crucial to harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating its
potential risks. Despite the global recognition of this need, there remains a
lack of clear guidelines or legislation for AI use in finance. This report
discusses key principles that could guide the formation of effective AI
regulation in the financial sector, including the need for a risk-based
approach, the inclusion of ethical considerations, and the importance of
maintaining a balance between innovation and consumer protection. The report
provides recommendations for academia, the finance industry, and regulators.

<p class="mathjax">Game theory offers an interpretable mathematical framework for modeling
multi-agent interactions. However, its applicability in real-world robotics
applications is hindered by several challenges, such as unknown agents'
preferences and goals. To address these challenges, we show a connection
between differential games, optimal control, and energy-based models and
demonstrate how existing approaches can be unified under our proposed
Energy-based Potential Game formulation. Building upon this formulation, this
work introduces a new end-to-end learning application that combines neural
networks for game-parameter inference with a differentiable game-theoretic
optimization layer, acting as an inductive bias. The experiments using
simulated mobile robot pedestrian interactions and real-world automated driving
data provide empirical evidence that the game-theoretic layer improves the
predictive performance of various neural network backbones.

<p class="mathjax">The success of existing multi-view clustering (MVC) relies on the assumption
that all views are complete. However, samples are usually partially available
due to data corruption or sensor malfunction, which raises the research of
incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although several anchor-based IMVC
methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they
still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect
the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be
consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii)
Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might
be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete
data (AUP-ID). Such the AUP-ID would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrades
clustering performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
anchor graph learning framework termed Scalable Incomplete Multi-View
Clustering with Structure Alignment (SIMVC-SA). Specially, we construct the
view-specific anchor graph to capture the complementary information from
different views. In order to solve the AUP-ID, we propose a novel structure
alignment module to refine the cross-view anchor correspondence. Meanwhile, the
anchor graph construction and alignment are jointly optimized in our unified
framework to enhance clustering quality. Through anchor graph construction
instead of full graphs, the time and space complexity of the proposed SIMVC-SA
is proven to be linearly correlated with the number of samples. Extensive
experiments on seven incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/wy1019/SIMVC-SA.

<p class="mathjax">Model-checking is one of the most powerful techniques for verifying systems
and programs, which since the pioneering results by Knapik et al., Ong, and
Kobayashi, is known to be applicable to functional programs with higher-order
types against properties expressed by formulas of monadic second-order logic.
What happens when the program in question, in addition to higher-order
functions, also exhibits algebraic effects such as probabilistic choice or
global store? The results in the literature range from those, mostly positive,
about nondeterministic effects, to those about probabilistic effects, in the
presence of which even mere reachability becomes undecidable. This work takes a
fresh and general look at the problem, first of all showing that there is an
elegant and natural way of viewing higher-order programs producing algebraic
effects as ordinary higher-order recursion schemes. We then move on to consider
effect handlers, showing that in their presence the model checking problem is
bound to be undecidable in the general case, while it stays decidable when
handlers have a simple syntactic form, still sufficient to capture so-called
generic effects. Along the way we hint at how a general specification language
could look like, this way justifying some of the results in the literature, and
deriving new ones.

future service demand has the potential patient outcomes. Despite active
research on the subject, several gaps remain: 1) proposed forecasting models

extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in
catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather

we define the observation mappings of the system by taking delays and losses

the existence of a set of supervisors. This condition is expressed as network

<p class="mathjax">A wide range of systems across the social and natural sciences produce
temporal data consisting of interaction events among nodes in disjoint sets.
Online shopping, for example, generates purchasing events of the form (user,
product, time of purchase), and mutualistic interactions in plant-pollinator
systems generate pollination events of the form (insect, plant, time of
pollination). These data sets can be meaningfully modeled as temporal
hypergraph snapshots in which multiple nodes within one set (i.e. online
shoppers) share a hyperedge if they interacted with a common node in the
opposite set (i.e. purchased the same product) within a given time window,
allowing for the application of a range of hypergraph analysis techniques.
However, it is often unclear how to choose the number and duration of these
temporal snapshots, which have a strong influence on the final hypergraph
representations. Here we propose a principled, efficient, nonparametric
solution to this longstanding problem by extracting temporal hypergraph
snapshots that optimally capture structural regularities in temporal event data
according to the minimum description length principle. We demonstrate our
methods on real and synthetic datasets, finding that they can recover planted
artificial hypergraph structure in the presence of considerable noise and
reveal meaningful activity fluctuations in human mobility data.

<p class="mathjax">Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models
that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations.
The development of reduced order models for parametric nonlinear Hamiltonian
systems is still challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure
encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying
Kolmogorov $n$-width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of
the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the
state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects
via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical
low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and
parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose to vary in time the dimensions of
both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the
quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the
projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive
hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow,
do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost
that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the
number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved
performances of the resulting fully adaptive models compared to the original
and reduced order models.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is a summary of the work in my PhD thesis. In which, I investigate
the impact of bias in NLP models on the task of hate speech detection from
three perspectives: explainability, offensive stereotyping bias, and fairness.
I discuss the main takeaways from my thesis and how they can benefit the
broader NLP community. Finally, I discuss important future research directions.
The findings of my thesis suggest that bias in NLP models impacts the task of
hate speech detection from all three perspectives. And that unless we start
incorporating social sciences in studying bias in NLP models, we will not
effectively overcome the current limitations of measuring and mitigating bias
in NLP models.

<p class="mathjax">The vast majority of people who suffer unexpected cardiac arrest are
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by passersby in a desperate
attempt to restore life, but endeavors turn out to be fruitless on account of
disqualification. Fortunately, many pieces of research manifest that
disciplined training will help to elevate the success rate of resuscitation,
which constantly desires a seamless combination of novel techniques to yield
further advancement. To this end, we collect a custom CPR video dataset in
which trainees make efforts to behave resuscitation on mannequins independently
in adherence to approved guidelines, thereby devising an auxiliary toolbox to
assist supervision and rectification of intermediate potential issues via
modern deep learning methodologies. Our research empirically views this problem
as a temporal action segmentation (TAS) task in computer vision, which aims to
segment an untrimmed video at a frame-wise level. Here, we propose a
Prompt-enhanced hierarchical Transformer (PhiTrans) that integrates three
indispensable modules, including a textual prompt-based Video Features
Extractor (VFE), a transformer-based Action Segmentation Executor (ASE), and a
regression-based Prediction Refinement Calibrator (PRC). The backbone of the
model preferentially derives from applications in three approved public
datasets (GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast) collected for TAS tasks, which
accounts for the excavation of the segmentation pipeline on the CPR dataset. In
general, we unprecedentedly probe into a feasible pipeline that genuinely
elevates the CPR instruction qualification via action segmentation in
conjunction with cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Associated experiments
advocate our implementation with multiple metrics surpassing 91.0%.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and robust correspondence matching is of utmost importance for
various 3D computer vision tasks. However, traditional explicit
programming-based methods often struggle to handle challenging scenarios, and
deep learning-based methods require large well-labeled datasets for network
training. In this article, we introduce Epipolar-Constrained Cascade
Correspondence (E3CM), a novel approach that addresses these limitations.
Unlike traditional methods, E3CM leverages pre-trained convolutional neural
networks to match correspondence, without requiring annotated data for any
network training or fine-tuning. Our method utilizes epipolar constraints to
guide the matching process and incorporates a cascade structure for progressive
refinement of matches. We extensively evaluate the performance of E3CM through
comprehensive experiments and demonstrate its superiority over existing
methods. To promote further research and facilitate reproducibility, we make
our source code publicly available at https://mias.group/E3CM.

<p class="mathjax">One of the critical phases in software development is software testing.
Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs.
The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of tests
by suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers have
leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. While
the code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature has
acknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency of
tests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, we
introduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMs
in terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achieved
by augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight the
limitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generating
effective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of the
Program Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluate
their performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposed
method is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets.
Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fully
automated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learning
approaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57%
on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation.
Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generate
test cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance the
effectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic or
functional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs and
testing corner cases PUTs.

<p class="mathjax">Visualization onboarding supports users in reading, interpreting, and
extracting information from visual data representations. General-purpose
onboarding tools and libraries are applicable for explaining a wide range of
graphical user interfaces but cannot handle specific visualization
requirements. This paper describes a first step towards developing an
onboarding library called VisAhoi, which is easy to integrate, extend,
semi-automate, reuse, and customize. VisAhoi supports the creation of
onboarding elements for different visualization types and datasets. We
demonstrate how to extract and describe onboarding instructions using three
well-known high-level descriptive visualization grammars - Vega-Lite,
Plotly.js, and ECharts. We show the applicability of our library by performing
two usage scenarios that describe the integration of VisAhoi into a VA tool for
the analysis of high-throughput screening (HTS) data and, second, into a
Flourish template to provide an authoring tool for data journalists for a
treemap visualization. We provide a supplementary website that demonstrates the
applicability of VisAhoi to various visualizations, including a bar chart, a
horizon graph, a change matrix or heatmap, a scatterplot, and a treemap

<p class="mathjax">Due to the proliferation of malware, defenders are increasingly turning to
automation and machine learning as part of the malware detection tool-chain.
However, machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks,
requiring the testing of model and product robustness. Meanwhile, attackers
also seek to automate malware generation and evasion of antivirus systems, and
defenders try to gain insight into their methods. This work proposes a new
algorithm that combines Malware Evasion and Model Extraction (MEME) attacks.
MEME uses model-based reinforcement learning to adversarially modify Windows
executable binary samples while simultaneously training a surrogate model with
a high agreement with the target model to evade. To evaluate this method, we
compare it with two state-of-the-art attacks in adversarial malware creation,
using three well-known published models and one antivirus product as targets.
Results show that MEME outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
evasion capabilities in almost all cases, producing evasive malware with an
evasion rate in the range of 32-73%. It also produces surrogate models with a
prediction label agreement with the respective target models between 97-99%.
The surrogate could be used to fine-tune and improve the evasion rate in the
future.

<p class="mathjax">Whole-program analysis is an essential technique that enables advanced
compiler optimizations. An important example of such a method is points-to
analysis used by ahead-of-time (AOT) compilers to discover program elements
(classes, methods, fields) used on at least one program path. GraalVM Native
Image uses a points-to analysis to optimize Java applications, which is a
time-consuming step of the build. We explore how much the analysis time can be
improved by replacing the points-to analysis with a rapid type analysis (RTA),
which computes reachable elements faster by allowing more imprecision. We
propose several extensions of previous approaches to RTA: making it parallel,
incremental, and supporting heap snapshotting. We present an extensive
experimental evaluation of the effects of using RTA instead of points-to
analysis, in which RTA allowed us to reduce the analysis time for Spring
Petclinic, a popular demo application of the Spring framework, by 64% and the
overall build time by 35% at the cost of increasing the image size due to the
imprecision by 15%.

<p class="mathjax">The principle underlying most existing continual learning (CL) methods is to
prioritize stability by penalizing changes in parameters crucial to old tasks,
while allowing for plasticity in other parameters. The importance of weights
for each task can be determined either explicitly through learning a
task-specific mask during training (e.g., parameter isolation-based approaches)
or implicitly by introducing a regularization term (e.g., regularization-based
approaches). However, all these methods assume that the importance of weights
for each task is unknown prior to data exposure. In this paper, we propose
ScrollNet as a scrolling neural network for continual learning. ScrollNet can
be seen as a dynamic network that assigns the ranking of weight importance for
each task before data exposure, thus achieving a more favorable
stability-plasticity tradeoff during sequential task learning by reassigning
this ranking for different tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that ScrollNet
can be combined with various CL methods, including regularization-based and
replay-based approaches. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and TinyImagenet
datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method. We release our code at
https://github.com/FireFYF/ScrollNet.git.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models bring thousands of TTS
applications into daily life, where models are deployed in cloud to provide
services for customs. Among these models are diffusion probabilistic models
(DPMs), which can be stably trained and are more parameter-efficient compared
with other generative models. As transmitting data between customs and the
cloud introduces high latency and the risk of exposing private data, deploying
TTS models on edge devices is preferred. When implementing DPMs onto edge
devices, there are two practical problems. First, current DPMs are not
lightweight enough for resource-constrained devices. Second, DPMs require many
denoising steps in inference, which increases latency. In this work, we present
LightGrad, a lightweight DPM for TTS. LightGrad is equipped with a lightweight
U-Net diffusion decoder and a training-free fast sampling technique, reducing
both model parameters and inference latency. Streaming inference is also
implemented in LightGrad to reduce latency further. Compared with Grad-TTS,
LightGrad achieves 62.2% reduction in paramters, 65.7% reduction in latency,
while preserving comparable speech quality on both Chinese Mandarin and English
in 4 denoising steps.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile devices have widespread to become the most used piece of technology.
Due to their characteristics, they have become major targets for botnet-related
malware. FluBot is one example of botnet malware that infects mobile devices.
In particular, FluBot is a DNS-based botnet that uses Domain Generation
Algorithms (DGA) to establish communication with the Command and Control Server
(C2). MONDEO is a multistage mechanism with a flexible design to detect
DNS-based botnet malware. MONDEO is lightweight and can be deployed without
requiring the deployment of software, agents, or configuration in mobile
devices, allowing easy integration in core networks. MONDEO comprises four
detection stages: Blacklisting/Whitelisting, Query rate analysis, DGA analysis,
and Machine learning evaluation. It was created with the goal of processing
streams of packets to identify attacks with high efficiency, in the distinct
phases. MONDEO was tested against several datasets to measure its efficiency
and performance, being able to achieve high performance with RandomForest
classifiers. The implementation is available at github.

pivotal role in automated information extraction and interpretation. In our
work, we have trained MViTv2 transformer model architecture with cascaded mask
R-CNN on BaDLAD dataset to extract text box, paragraphs, images and tables from
a document. After training on 20365 document images for 36 epochs in a 3 phase
cycle, we achieved a training loss of 0.2125 and a mask loss of 0.19. Our work
extends beyond training, delving into the exploration of potential enhancement
avenues. We investigate the impact of rotation and flip augmentation, the
effectiveness of slicing input images pre-inference, the implications of
varying the resolution of the transformer backbone, and the potential of
employing a dual-pass inference to uncover missed text-boxes. Through these
explorations, we observe a spectrum of outcomes, where some modifications
result in tangible performance improvements, while others offer unique insights
for future endeavors.

<p class="mathjax">Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext task for
generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized across
multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly masking
patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged
during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that
updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the
self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel
learnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of
different complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked
autoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting
its behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE
(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the
opposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between
these behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with
the reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure
generates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked
Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior
representation learning capabilities compared to MAE. The empirical results on
five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture, demonstrating that curriculum
learning can be successfully used to self-supervise masked autoencoders.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of learning a generalizable
human NeRF model from a monocular video. Although existing generalizable human
NeRFs have achieved impressive results, they require muti-view images or videos
which might not be always available. On the other hand, some works on
free-viewpoint rendering of human from monocular videos cannot be generalized
to unseen identities. In view of these limitations, we propose GHuNeRF to learn
a generalizable human NeRF model from a monocular video of the human performer.
We first introduce a visibility-aware aggregation scheme to compute vertex-wise
features, which is used to construct a 3D feature volume. The feature volume
can only represent the overall geometry of the human performer with
insufficient accuracy due to the limited resolution. To solve this, we further
enhance the volume feature with temporally aligned point-wise features using an
attention mechanism. Finally, the enhanced feature is used for predicting
density and color for each sampled point. A surface-guided sampling strategy is
also introduced to improve the efficiency for both training and inference. We
validate our approach on the widely-used ZJU-MoCap dataset, where we achieve
comparable performance with existing multi-view video based approaches. We also
test on the monocular People-Snapshot dataset and achieve better performance
than existing works when only monocular video is used.

<p class="mathjax">For text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, prosodic structure prediction (PSP) plays
an important role in producing natural and intelligible speech. Although
inter-utterance linguistic information can influence the speech interpretation
of the target utterance, previous works on PSP mainly focus on utilizing
intrautterance linguistic information of the current utterance only. This work
proposes to use inter-utterance linguistic information to improve the
performance of PSP. Multi-level contextual information, which includes both
inter-utterance and intrautterance linguistic information, is extracted by a
hierarchical encoder from character level, utterance level and discourse level
of the input text. Then a multi-task learning (MTL) decoder predicts prosodic
boundaries from multi-level contextual information. Objective evaluation
results on two datasets show that our method achieves better F1 scores in
predicting prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPH) and intonational phrase
(IPH). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-level contextual
information for PSP. Subjective preference tests also indicate the naturalness
of synthesized speeches are improved.

<p class="mathjax">Stable diffusion, a generative model used in text-to-image synthesis,
frequently encounters resolution-induced composition problems when generating
images of varying sizes. This issue primarily stems from the model being
trained on pairs of single-scale images and their corresponding text
descriptions. Moreover, direct training on images of unlimited sizes is
unfeasible, as it would require an immense number of text-image pairs and
entail substantial computational expenses. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a two-stage pipeline named Any-Size-Diffusion (ASD), designed to
efficiently generate well-composed images of any size, while minimizing the
need for high-memory GPU resources. Specifically, the initial stage, dubbed Any
Ratio Adaptability Diffusion (ARAD), leverages a selected set of images with a
restricted range of ratios to optimize the text-conditional diffusion model,
thereby improving its ability to adjust composition to accommodate diverse
image sizes. To support the creation of images at any desired size, we further
introduce a technique called Fast Seamless Tiled Diffusion (FSTD) at the
subsequent stage. This method allows for the rapid enlargement of the ASD
output to any high-resolution size, avoiding seaming artifacts or memory
overloads. Experimental results on the LAION-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ benchmarks
demonstrate that ASD can produce well-structured images of arbitrary sizes,
cutting down the inference time by 2x compared to the traditional tiled
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">We present a general framework for unsupervised text style transfer with deep
generative models. The framework models each sentence-label pair in the
non-parallel corpus as partially observed from a complete quadruplet which
additionally contains two latent codes representing the content and style,
respectively. These codes are learned by exploiting dependencies inside the
observed data. Then a sentence is transferred by manipulating them. Our
framework is able to unify previous embedding and prototype methods as two
special forms. It also provides a principled perspective to explain previously
proposed techniques in the field such as aligned encoder and adversarial
training. We further conduct experiments on three benchmarks. Both automatic

<p class="mathjax">Background Weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery vary widely
between individuals, and predicting weight loss before the operation remains
challenging. We aimed to develop a model using machine learning to provide
individual preoperative prediction of 5-year weight loss trajectories after
surgery. Methods In this multinational retrospective observational study we
enrolled adult participants (aged $\ge$18 years) from ten prospective cohorts
(including ABOS [NCT01129297], BAREVAL [NCT02310178], the Swedish Obese
Subjects study, and a large cohort from the Dutch Obesity Clinic [Nederlandse
Obesitas Kliniek]) and two randomised trials (SleevePass [NCT00793143] and
SM-BOSS [NCT00356213]) in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, with a 5 year
followup after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric band.
Patients with a previous history of bariatric surgery or large delays between
scheduled and actual visits were excluded. The training cohort comprised
patients from two centres in France (ABOS and BAREVAL). The primary outcome was
BMI at 5 years. A model was developed using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator to select variables and the classification and regression
trees algorithm to build interpretable regression trees. The performances of
the model were assessed through the median absolute deviation (MAD) and root
mean squared error (RMSE) of BMI. Findings10 231 patients from 12 centres in
ten countries were included in the analysis, corresponding to 30 602
patient-years. Among participants in all 12 cohorts, 7701 (75$\bullet$3%) were
female, 2530 (24$\bullet$7%) were male. Among 434 baseline attributes available
in the training cohort, seven variables were selected: height, weight,
intervention type, age, diabetes status, diabetes duration, and smoking status.
At 5 years, across external testing cohorts the overall mean MAD BMI was
2$\bullet$8 kg/m${}^2$ (95% CI 2$\bullet$6-3$\bullet$0) and mean RMSE BMI was
4$\bullet$7 kg/m${}^2$ (4$\bullet$4-5$\bullet$0), and the mean difference
between predicted and observed BMI was-0$\bullet$3 kg/m${}^2$ (SD 4$\bullet$7).
This model is incorporated in an easy to use and interpretable web-based
prediction tool to help inform clinical decision before surgery.
InterpretationWe developed a machine learning-based model, which is
internationally validated, for predicting individual 5-year weight loss
trajectories after three common bariatric interventions.

<p class="mathjax">Patch representation is crucial in automating various software engineering
tasks, like determining patch accuracy or summarizing code changes. While
recent research has employed deep learning for patch representation, focusing
on token sequences or Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), they often miss the
change's semantic intent and the context of modified lines. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel method, Patcherizer. It delves into the intentions of
context and structure, merging the surrounding code context with two innovative
representations. These capture the intention in code changes and the intention
in AST structural modifications pre and post-patch. This holistic
representation aptly captures a patch's underlying intentions. Patcherizer
employs graph convolutional neural networks for structural intention graph
representation and transformers for intention sequence representation. We
evaluated Patcherizer's embeddings' versatility in three areas: (1) Patch
description generation, (2) Patch accuracy prediction, and (3) Patch intention
identification. Our experiments demonstrate the representation's efficacy
across all tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For example, in patch
description generation, Patcherizer excels, showing an average boost of 19.39%
in BLEU, 8.71% in ROUGE-L, and 34.03% in METEOR scores.

<p class="mathjax">As the key to sentiment analysis, sentiment composition considers the
classification of a constituent via classifications of its contained
sub-constituents and rules operated on them. Such compositionality has been
widely studied previously in the form of hierarchical trees including untagged
and sentiment ones, which are intrinsically suboptimal in our view. To address
this, we propose semantic tree, a new tree form capable of interpreting the
sentiment composition in a principled way. Semantic tree is a derivation of a
context-free grammar (CFG) describing the specific composition rules on
difference semantic roles, which is designed carefully following previous
linguistic conclusions. However, semantic tree is a latent variable since there
is no its annotation in regular datasets. Thus, in our method, it is
marginalized out via inside algorithm and learned to optimize the
classification performance. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate
that our method not only achieves better or competitive results compared to
baselines in the setting of regular and domain adaptation classification, and
also generates plausible tree explanations.

<p class="mathjax">The spontaneous behavior that often occurs in conversations makes speech more
human-like compared to reading-style. However, synthesizing spontaneous-style
speech is challenging due to the lack of high-quality spontaneous datasets and
the high cost of labeling spontaneous behavior. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised pre-training method to increase the amount of spontaneous-style
speech and spontaneous behavioral labels. In the process of semi-supervised
learning, both text and speech information are considered for detecting
spontaneous behaviors labels in speech. Moreover, a linguistic-aware encoder is
used to model the relationship between each sentence in the conversation.
Experimental results indicate that our proposed method achieves superior
expressive speech synthesis performance with the ability to model spontaneous
behavior in spontaneous-style speech and predict reasonable spontaneous
behavior from text.

<p class="mathjax">In energy-efficient schemes, finding the optimal size of deep learning models
is very important and has a broad impact. Meanwhile, recent studies have
reported an unexpected phenomenon, the sparse double descent: as the model's
sparsity increases, the performance first worsens, then improves, and finally
deteriorates. Such a non-monotonic behavior raises serious questions about the
optimal model's size to maintain high performance: the model needs to be
sufficiently over-parametrized, but having too many parameters wastes training
resources.
<br />In this paper, we aim to find the best trade-off efficiently. More precisely,
we tackle the occurrence of the sparse double descent and present some
solutions to avoid it. Firstly, we show that a simple $\ell_2$ regularization
method can help to mitigate this phenomenon but sacrifices the
performance/sparsity compromise. To overcome this problem, we then introduce a
learning scheme in which distilling knowledge regularizes the student model.
Supported by experimental results achieved using typical image classification
setups, we show that this approach leads to the avoidance of such a phenomenon.

<p class="mathjax">Global sustainability requires low-carbon urban transport systems, shaped by
adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in
travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's
essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the
constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in
representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and
travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects
at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a
causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban
form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six
cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center,
demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By
considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences
align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city
and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of
travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and
associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call
for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for
location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using
causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and
municipalities across continents.

<p class="mathjax">Auditability allows to track all the read operations performed on a register.
It abstracts the need of data owners to control access to their data, tracking
who read which information. This work considers possible formalizations of
auditing and their ramification for the possibility of providing it.
<br />The natural definition is to require a linearization of all write, read and
audit operations together (atomic auditing). The paper shows that atomic
auditing is a powerful tool, as it can be used to solve consensus. The number
of processes that can solve consensus using atomic audit depends on the number
of processes that can read or audit the register. If there is a single reader
or a single auditor (the writer), then consensus can be solved among two
processes. If multiple readers and auditors are possible, then consensus can be
solved among the same number of processes. This means that strong
synchronization primitives are needed to support atomic auditing.
<br />We give implementations of atomic audit when there are either multiple
readers or multiple auditors (but not both) using primitives with consensus
number 2 (swap and fetch&amp;add). When there are multiple readers and multiple
auditors, the implementation uses compare&amp;swap.
<br />These findings motivate a weaker definition, in which audit operations are
not linearized together with the write and read operations (regular auditing).
We prove that regular auditing can be implemented from ordinary reads and
writes on atomic registers.

<p class="mathjax">Home automation for many years had faced challenges that limit its spreading
around the world. These challenges caused by the high cost of Own such a home,
inflexibility system (cannot be monitored outside the home) and issues to
achieve optimal security. Our main objective is to design and implement a smart
home model that is simple, affordable to the users. The proposed system provide
flexibility to monitor the home, using the reliable cellular network. The user
will be able what is inside the home when he /she is away from home. In
addition to that, our model overcome the issue of the security by providing
different sensors that detects smoke, gas, leakage of water and incases of
burglary. Moreover, a camera will be available in the home to give a full view
for the user when he/she is outside the home. The user will be informed by an
application on his/she phone incase if there is a fire, water leakage and if
someone break into the house. This will give the user a chance to take an
action if such cases happened. Furthermore, the user can monitor the lighting
system of the home, by giving the user a chance to turn the lights on and off
remotely.

<p class="mathjax">Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for
effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which
heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution.
In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form,
where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus
is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data
while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed
learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation
learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the
hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead
to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more
sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological
characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed
graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning
(CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail
classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of
representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier
training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and
disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the
collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">The growth of misinformation and re-contextualized media in social media and
news leads to an increasing need for fact-checking methods. Concurrently, the
advancement in generative models makes cheapfakes and deepfakes both easier to
make and harder to detect. In this paper, we present a novel approach using
generative image models to our advantage for detecting Out-of-Context (OOC) use
of images-caption pairs in news. We present two new datasets with a total of
$6800$ images generated using two different generative models including (1)
DALL-E 2, and (2) Stable-Diffusion. We are confident that the method proposed
in this paper can further research on generative models in the field of
cheapfake detection, and that the resulting datasets can be used to train and
evaluate new models aimed at detecting cheapfakes. We run a preliminary
qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate the performance of each image
generation model for this task, and evaluate a handful of methods for computing
image similarity.

<p class="mathjax">Owing to its significant success, the prior imposed on gradient maps has
consistently been a subject of great interest in the field of image processing.
Total variation (TV), one of the most representative regularizers, is known for
its ability to capture the sparsity of gradient maps. Nonetheless, TV and its
variants often underestimate the gradient maps, leading to the weakening of
edges and details whose gradients should not be zero in the original image.
Recently, total deep variation (TDV) has been introduced, assuming the sparsity
of feature maps, which provides a flexible regularization learned from
large-scale datasets for a specific task. However, TDV requires retraining when
the image or task changes, limiting its versatility. In this paper, we propose
a neural gradient regularizer (NGR) that expresses the gradient map as the
output of a neural network. Unlike existing methods, NGR does not rely on the
sparsity assumption, thereby avoiding the underestimation of gradient maps. NGR
is applicable to various image types and different image processing tasks,
functioning in a zero-shot learning fashion, making it a versatile and
plug-and-play regularizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of NGR over state-of-the-art counterparts for a range of
different tasks, further validating its effectiveness and versatility.

growth. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can
contribute to fighting terrorism by predicting in real-time future terrorist
attacks if accurate data is available. This paper is part of a research project
that uses text from social networks to extract necessary information to build
an adequate dataset for terrorist attack prediction. We collected a set of 3000

<p class="mathjax">Voxel-based segmentation volumes often store a large number of labels and
voxels, and the resulting amount of data can make storage, transfer, and
interactive visualization difficult. We present a lossless compression
technique which addresses these challenges. It processes individual small
bricks of a segmentation volume and compactly encodes the labelled regions and
their boundaries by an iterative refinement scheme. The result for each brick
is a list of labels, and a sequence of operations to reconstruct the brick
which is further compressed using rANS-entropy coding. As the relative
frequencies of operations are very similar across bricks, the entropy coding
can use global frequency tables for an entire data set which enables efficient
and effective parallel (de)compression. Our technique achieves high throughput
(up to gigabytes per second both for compression and decompression) and strong
compression ratios of about 1% to 3% of the original data set size while being
applicable to GPU-based rendering. We evaluate our method for various data sets
from different fields and demonstrate GPU-based volume visualization with
on-the-fly decompression, level-of-detail rendering (with optional on-demand
streaming of detail coefficients to the GPU), and a caching strategy for
decompressed bricks for further performance improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Co-design is an effective method for designing software, but implementing it
within the clinical setting comes with a set of unique challenges. This makes
recruitment and engagement of participants difficult, which has been
demonstrated in our study. Our work focused on designing and evaluating a data
annotation tool, however, different types of interventions had to be carried
out due to poor engagement with the study. We evaluated the effectiveness and
feasibility of each of these strategies, their applicability to different
stages of co-design research and discussed the barriers to participation
present among participants from a clinical background.

<p class="mathjax">In 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES), the earlier approach adopts
a two-stage paradigm, extracting segmentation proposals and then matching them
with referring expressions. However, this conventional paradigm encounters
significant challenges, most notably in terms of the generation of lackluster
initial proposals and a pronounced deceleration in inference speed. Recognizing
these limitations, we introduce an innovative end-to-end Superpoint-Text
Matching Network (3D-STMN) that is enriched by dependency-driven insights. One
of the keystones of our model is the Superpoint-Text Matching (STM) mechanism.
Unlike traditional methods that navigate through instance proposals, STM
directly correlates linguistic indications with their respective superpoints,
clusters of semantically related points. This architectural decision empowers
our model to efficiently harness cross-modal semantic relationships, primarily
leveraging densely annotated superpoint-text pairs, as opposed to the more
sparse instance-text pairs. In pursuit of enhancing the role of text in guiding
the segmentation process, we further incorporate the Dependency-Driven
Interaction (DDI) module to deepen the network's semantic comprehension of
referring expressions. Using the dependency trees as a beacon, this module
discerns the intricate relationships between primary terms and their associated
descriptors in expressions, thereby elevating both the localization and
segmentation capacities of our model. Comprehensive experiments on the
ScanRefer benchmark reveal that our model not only set new performance
standards, registering an mIoU gain of 11.7 points but also achieve a
staggering enhancement in inference speed, surpassing traditional methods by
95.7 times. The code and models are available at
https://github.com/sosppxo/3D-STMN.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high performance in
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). However, the
performance of CNNs depends heavily on a large amount of training data. The
insufficiency of labeled training SAR images limits the recognition performance
and even invalidates some ATR methods. Furthermore, under few labeled training
data, many existing CNNs are even ineffective. To address these challenges, we
propose a Semi-supervised SAR ATR Framework with transductive Auxiliary
Segmentation (SFAS). The proposed framework focuses on exploiting the
transductive generalization on available unlabeled samples with an auxiliary
loss serving as a regularizer. Through auxiliary segmentation of unlabeled SAR
samples and information residue loss (IRL) in training, the framework can
employ the proposed training loop process and gradually exploit the information
compilation of recognition and segmentation to construct a helpful inductive
bias and achieve high performance. Experiments conducted on the MSTAR dataset
have shown the effectiveness of our proposed SFAS for few-shot learning. The
recognition performance of 94.18\% can be achieved under 20 training samples in
each class with simultaneous accurate segmentation results. Facing variances of
EOCs, the recognition ratios are higher than 88.00\% when 10 training samples
each class.

<p class="mathjax">Face-to-face communication is a common scenario including roles of speakers
and listeners. Most existing research methods focus on producing speaker
videos, while the generation of listener heads remains largely overlooked.
Responsive listening head generation is an important task that aims to model
face-to-face communication scenarios by generating a listener head video given
a speaker video and a listener head image. An ideal generated responsive
listening video should respond to the speaker with attitude or viewpoint
expressing while maintaining diversity in interaction patterns and accuracy in
listener identity information. To achieve this goal, we propose the
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{F}aceted \textbf{R}esponsive Listening Head Generation
Network (MFR-Net). Specifically, MFR-Net employs the probabilistic denoising
diffusion model to predict diverse head pose and expression features. In order
to perform multi-faceted response to the speaker video, while maintaining
accurate listener identity preservation, we design the Feature Aggregation
Module to boost listener identity features and fuse them with other
speaker-related features. Finally, a renderer finetuned with identity
consistency loss produces the final listening head videos. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that MFR-Net not only achieves multi-faceted responses
in diversity and speaker identity information but also in attitude and
viewpoint expression.

<p class="mathjax">Uncovering novel drug candidates for treating complex diseases remain one of
the most challenging tasks in early discovery research. To tackle this
challenge, biopharma research established a standardized high content imaging
protocol that tags different cellular compartments per image channel. In order
to judge the experimental outcome, the scientist requires knowledge about the
channel importance with respect to a certain phenotype for decoding the
underlying biology. In contrast to traditional image analysis approaches, such
experiments are nowadays preferably analyzed by deep learning based approaches
which, however, lack crucial information about the channel importance. To
overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach which utilizes
multi-spectral information of high content images to interpret a certain aspect
of cellular biology. To this end, we base our method on image blending concepts
with alpha compositing for an arbitrary number of channels. More specifically,
we introduce DCMIX, a lightweight, scaleable and end-to-end trainable mixing
layer which enables interpretable predictions in high content imaging while
retaining the benefits of deep learning based methods. We employ an extensive
set of experiments on both MNIST and RXRX1 datasets, demonstrating that DCMIX
learns the biologically relevant channel importance without scarifying
prediction performance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the problem of security allocation in a networked
control system under stealthy attacks in which the system is comprised of
interconnected subsystems represented by vertices. A malicious adversary
selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack to
maximally disrupt the local performance while remaining undetected. On the
other hand, a defender selects several vertices on which to allocate defense
resources against the adversary. First, the objectives of the adversary and the
defender with uncertain targets are formulated in probabilistic ways, resulting
in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a
graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the
defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded.
This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to a
subset of available vertex sets. Then, we cast the problem of security
allocation in a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the contribution
of this paper is highlighted by utilizing the proposed admissible actions of
the defender in the context of large-scale networks. A numerical example of a
50-vertex networked control system is presented to validate the obtained
results.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of composed image retrieval that takes an input query
consisting of an image and a modification text indicating the desired changes
to be made on the image and retrieves images that match these changes. Current
state-of-the-art techniques that address this problem use global features for
the retrieval, resulting in incorrect localization of the regions of interest
to be modified because of the global nature of the features, more so in cases
of real-world, in-the-wild images. Since modifier texts usually correspond to
specific local changes in an image, it is critical that models learn local
features to be able to both localize and retrieve better. To this end, our key
novelty is a new gradient-attention-based learning objective that explicitly
forces the model to focus on the local regions of interest being modified in
each retrieval step. We achieve this by first proposing a new visual image
attention computation technique, which we call multi-modal gradient attention
(MMGrad) that is explicitly conditioned on the modifier text. We next
demonstrate how MMGrad can be incorporated into an end-to-end model training
strategy with a new learning objective that explicitly forces these MMGrad
attention maps to highlight the correct local regions corresponding to the
modifier text. By training retrieval models with this new loss function, we
show improved grounding by means of better visual attention maps, leading to
better explainability of the models as well as competitive quantitative
retrieval performance on standard benchmark datasets.

these tasks separately. We employ a state-of-the-art online multi-object
tracker and a contemporary object detector for player tracking. To overcome the
limitations of our online approach, we incorporate a post-processing stage
using interpolation and appearance-free track merging. Additionally, an
appearance-based track merging technique is used to handle the termination and
creation of tracks far from the image boundaries. Ball tracking is formulated
as single object detection, and a fine-tuned YOLOv8l detector with proprietary

<p class="mathjax">Learning personalization has proven its effectiveness in enhancing learner
performance. Therefore, modern digital learning platforms have been
increasingly depending on recommendation systems to offer learners personalized
suggestions of learning materials. Learners can utilize those recommendations
to acquire certain skills for the labor market or for their formal education.
Personalization can be based on several factors, such as personal preference,
social connections or learning context. In an educational environment, the
learning context plays an important role in generating sound recommendations,
which not only fulfill the preferences of the learner, but also correspond to
the pedagogical goals of the learning process. This is because a learning
context describes the actual situation of the learner at the moment of
requesting a learning recommendation. It provides information about the learner
current state of knowledge, goal orientation, motivation, needs, available
time, and other factors that reflect their status and may influence how
learning recommendations are perceived and utilized. Context aware recommender
systems have the potential to reflect the logic that a learning expert may
follow in recommending materials to students with respect to their status and
needs. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art approaches for defining a
user learning-context. We provide an overview of the definitions available, as
well as the different factors that are considered when defining a context.
Moreover, we further investigate the links between those factors and their
pedagogical foundations in learning theories. We aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of contextualized learning from both pedagogical and technical
points of view. By combining those two viewpoints, we aim to bridge a gap
between both domains, in terms of contextualizing learning recommendations.

<p class="mathjax">With the large-scale integration and use of neural network models, especially
in critical embedded systems, their security assessment to guarantee their
reliability is becoming an urgent need. More particularly, models deployed in
embedded platforms, such as 32-bit microcontrollers, are physically accessible
by adversaries and therefore vulnerable to hardware disturbances. We present
the first set of experiments on the use of two fault injection means,
electromagnetic and laser injections, applied on neural networks models
embedded on a Cortex M4 32-bit microcontroller platform. Contrary to most of
state-of-the-art works dedicated to the alteration of the internal parameters
or input values, our goal is to simulate and experimentally demonstrate the
impact of a specific fault model that is instruction skip. For that purpose, we
assessed several modification attacks on the control flow of a neural network
inference. We reveal integrity threats by targeting several steps in the
inference program of typical convolutional neural network models, which may be
exploited by an attacker to alter the predictions of the target models with
different adversarial goals.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, the increasing complexity of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) means that the industry must move towards a
scenario-based approach to validation rather than relying on established
technology-based methods. This new focus also requires the validation process
to take into account Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), as many
scenarios may trigger hazardous vehicle behaviour. Thus, this work demonstrates
how the integration of the SOTIF process within an existing validation tool

<p class="mathjax">Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has gained popularity due to its
practicality across various applications. Compared to the centralized version,
training a shared model among a large number of nodes in DFL is more
challenging, as there is no central server to coordinate the training process.
Especially when distributed nodes suffer from limitations in communication or
computational resources, DFL will experience extremely inefficient and unstable
training. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm based on the framework of the inexact alternating direction method
(iADM). On one hand, our goal is to train a shared model with a sparsity
constraint. This constraint enables us to leverage one-bit compressive sensing
(1BCS), allowing transmission of one-bit information among neighbour nodes. On
the other hand, communication between neighbour nodes occurs only at certain
steps, reducing the number of communication rounds. Therefore, the algorithm
exhibits notable communication efficiency. Additionally, as each node selects
only a subset of neighbours to participate in the training, the algorithm is
robust against stragglers. Additionally, complex items are computed only once
for several consecutive steps and subproblems are solved inexactly using
closed-form solutions, resulting in high computational efficiency. Finally,
numerical experiments showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in both
communication and computation.

<p class="mathjax">Motion capture from a limited number of inertial measurement units (IMUs) has
important applications in health, human performance, and virtual reality.
Real-world limitations and application-specific goals dictate different IMU
configurations (i.e., number of IMUs and chosen attachment body segments),
trading off accuracy and practicality. Although recent works were successful in
accurately reconstructing whole-body motion from six IMUs, these systems only
work with a specific IMU configuration. Here we propose a single diffusion
generative model, Diffusion Inertial Poser (DiffIP), which reconstructs human
motion in real-time from arbitrary IMU configurations. We show that DiffIP has
the benefit of flexibility with respect to the IMU configuration while being as
accurate as the state-of-the-art for the commonly used six IMU configuration.
Our system enables selecting an optimal configuration for different
applications without retraining the model. For example, when only four IMUs are
available, DiffIP found that the configuration that minimizes errors in joint
kinematics instruments the thighs and forearms. However, global translation
reconstruction is better when instrumenting the feet instead of the thighs.
Although our approach is agnostic to the underlying model, we built DiffIP
based on physiologically realistic musculoskeletal models to enable use in
biomedical research and health applications.

<p class="mathjax">The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the
trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications.
Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the
process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves
significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's
stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there
exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible
algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ
the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to
effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any
noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does
not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button
while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary
does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only
requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently
achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still
achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%)
poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the
proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable
across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this
backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to
investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: In this paper, we present an automated method for article
classification, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLM). The
primary focus is on the field of ophthalmology, but the model is extendable to
other fields. Methods: We have developed a model based on Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques, including advanced LLMs, to process and analyze
the textual content of scientific papers. Specifically, we have employed
zero-shot learning (ZSL) LLM models and compared against Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and its variants, and Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT), and its variant such as distilBERT,
SciBERT, PubmedBERT, BioBERT. Results: The classification results demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLMs in categorizing large number of ophthalmology papers
without human intervention. Results: To evalute the LLMs, we compiled a dataset
(RenD) of 1000 ocular disease-related articles, which were expertly annotated
by a panel of six specialists into 15 distinct categories. The model achieved
mean accuracy of 0.86 and mean F1 of 0.85 based on the RenD dataset.
Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves notable improvements in both
accuracy and efficiency. Its application in the domain of ophthalmology
showcases its potential for knowledge organization and retrieval in other
domains too. We performed trend analysis that enables the researchers and
clinicians to easily categorize and retrieve relevant papers, saving time and
effort in literature review and information gathering as well as identification
of emerging scientific trends within different disciplines. Moreover, the
extendibility of the model to other scientific fields broadens its impact in
facilitating research and trend analysis across diverse disciplines.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods are blossoming recently, and its
crucial goal is to jointly learn visual and textual features via a
transformer-based architecture, demonstrating promising improvements on a
variety of vision-language tasks. Prior arts usually focus on how to align
visual and textual features, but strategies for improving the robustness of
model and speeding up model convergence are left insufficiently explored.
<br />In this paper, we propose a novel method ViLTA, comprising of two components
to further facilitate the model to learn fine-grained representations among
image-text pairs. For Masked Language Modeling (MLM), we propose a
cross-distillation method to generate soft labels to enhance the robustness of
model, which alleviates the problem of treating synonyms of masked words as
negative samples in one-hot labels. For Image-Text Matching (ITM), we leverage
the current language encoder to synthesize hard negatives based on the context
of language input, encouraging the model to learn high-quality representations
by increasing the difficulty of the ITM task. By leveraging the above
techniques, our ViLTA can achieve better performance on various vision-language
tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
effectiveness of ViLTA and its promising potential for vision-language
pre-training.

<p class="mathjax">Current speech large language models build upon discrete speech
representations, which can be categorized into semantic tokens and acoustic
tokens. However, existing speech tokens are not specifically designed for
speech language modeling. To assess the suitability of speech tokens for
building speech language models, we established the first benchmark,
SLMTokBench. Our results indicate that neither semantic nor acoustic tokens are
ideal for this purpose. Therefore, we propose SpeechTokenizer, a unified speech
tokenizer for speech large language models. SpeechTokenizer adopts the
Encoder-Decoder architecture with residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unifying
semantic and acoustic tokens, SpeechTokenizer disentangles different aspects of
speech information hierarchically across different RVQ layers. Furthermore, We
construct a Unified Speech Language Model (USLM) leveraging SpeechTokenizer.
Experiments show that SpeechTokenizer performs comparably to EnCodec in speech
reconstruction and demonstrates strong performance on the SLMTokBench
benchmark. Also, USLM outperforms VALL-E in zero-shot Text-to-Speech tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the error analysis of numerical methods on graded meshes
for stochastic Volterra equations with weakly singular kernels. We first prove
a novel regularity estimate for the exact solution via analyzing the associated
convolution structure. This reveals that the exact solution exhibits an initial
singularity in the sense that its H\"older continuous exponent on any
neighborhood of $t=0$ is lower than that on every compact subset of $(0,T]$.
Motivated by the initial singularity, we then construct the Euler--Maruyama
method, fast Euler--Maruyama method, and Milstein method based on graded
meshes. By establishing their pointwise-in-time error estimates, we give the
grading exponents of meshes to attain the optimal uniform-in-time convergence
orders, where the convergence orders improve those of the uniform mesh case.
Numerical experiments are finally reported to confirm the sharpness of
theoretical findings.

method by analyzing privacy risks in programs to release public statistics. The
evaluation shows that our method accurately and efficiently analyzes privacy
risks, and outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of
our engine to analyze the effect of differential privacy in public statistics.

<p class="mathjax">Model extraction emerges as a critical security threat with attack vectors
exploiting both algorithmic and implementation-based approaches. The main goal
of an attacker is to steal as much information as possible about a protected
victim model, so that he can mimic it with a substitute model, even with a
limited access to similar training data. Recently, physical attacks such as
fault injection have shown worrying efficiency against the integrity and
confidentiality of embedded models. We focus on embedded deep neural network
models on 32-bit microcontrollers, a widespread family of hardware platforms in
IoT, and the use of a standard fault injection strategy - Safe Error Attack
(SEA) - to perform a model extraction attack with an adversary having a limited
access to training data. Since the attack strongly depends on the input
queries, we propose a black-box approach to craft a successful attack set. For
a classical convolutional neural network, we successfully recover at least 90%
of the most significant bits with about 1500 crafted inputs. These information
enable to efficiently train a substitute model, with only 8% of the training
dataset, that reaches high fidelity and near identical accuracy level than the
victim model.

<p class="mathjax">English datasets predominantly reflect the perspectives of certain
nationalities, which can lead to cultural biases in models and datasets. This
is particularly problematic in tasks heavily influenced by subjectivity, such
as hate speech detection. To delve into how individuals from different
countries perceive hate speech, we introduce CReHate, a cross-cultural
re-annotation of the sampled SBIC dataset. This dataset includes annotations
from five distinct countries: Australia, Singapore, South Africa, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. Our thorough statistical analysis highlights
significant differences based on nationality, with only 59.4% of the samples
achieving consensus among all countries. We also introduce a culturally
sensitive hate speech classifier via transfer learning, adept at capturing
perspectives of different nationalities. These findings underscore the need to
re-evaluate certain aspects of NLP research, especially with regard to the
nuanced nature of hate speech in the English language.

courses in the Civil Engineering Major at the National University of Tucum\'an,
Argentina. Students take an average of 5 years to pass these subjects. Using
the DoWhy and Causal Discovery Toolbox tools, we looked to identify the
underlying causes of these delays. The analysis revealed that the regulatory
structure of the program and the evaluation methods play a crucial role in this
delay. Specifically, the accumulation of regular subjects without passing a
final exam was identified as a key factor. These findings can guide
interventions to improve student success rates and the effectiveness of the

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems assist users in decision-making, where the presentation
of recommended items and their explanations are critical factors for enhancing
the overall user experience. Although various methods for generating
explanations have been proposed, there is still room for improvement,
particularly for users who lack expertise in a specific item domain. In this
study, we introduce the novel concept of \textit{consequence-based
explanations}, a type of explanation that emphasizes the individual impact of
consuming a recommended item on the user, which makes the effect of following
recommendations clearer. We conducted an online user study to examine our
assumption about the appreciation of consequence-based explanations and their
impacts on different explanation aims in recommender systems. Our findings
highlight the importance of consequence-based explanations, which were
well-received by users and effectively improved user satisfaction in
recommender systems. These results provide valuable insights for designing
engaging explanations that can enhance the overall user experience in
decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">HEP data-processing frameworks are essential ingredients in getting from raw
data to physics results. But they are often tricky to use well, and they
present a significant learning barrier for the beginning HEP physicist. In
addition, existing frameworks typically support rigid, collider-based data
models, which do not map well to neutrino-physics experiments like DUNE.
Neutrino physicists thus expend significant effort working around framework
limitations instead of using a framework that directly supports their needs.
<br />Presented here is Meld, a Fermilab R&amp;D project, which intends to address
these limitations. By leveraging modern C++ capabilities, state-of-the-art
concurrency libraries, and a flexible data model, it is possible for beginning
(and seasoned) HEP physicists to execute framework programs easily and
efficiently, with minimal coupling to framework-specific constructs. Meld aims
to directly support the frameworks needs of neutrino experiments like DUNE as
well as the more common collider-based experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Standard mixed-integer programming formulations for the stable set problem on
$n$-node graphs require $n$ integer variables. We prove that this is almost
optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size
MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a
polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack
problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of
$\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge &amp; Zenklusen (SODA 2018).
<br />To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose
stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate
extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$,
has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the
information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain &amp; Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM
J. Comput. 2018) who showed the same result for the case of exact extended
formulations (i.e. $\varepsilon = 0$).

<p class="mathjax">Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) autonomous driving opens up a promising direction
for developing a new generation of intelligent transportation systems.
Collaborative perception (CP) as an essential component to achieve V2X can
overcome the inherent limitations of individual perception, including occlusion
and long-range perception. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
CP methods for V2X scenarios, bringing a profound and in-depth understanding to
the community. Specifically, we first introduce the architecture and workflow
of typical V2X systems, which affords a broader perspective to understand the
entire V2X system and the role of CP within it. Then, we thoroughly summarize
and analyze existing V2X perception datasets and CP methods. Particularly, we
introduce numerous CP methods from various crucial perspectives, including
collaboration stages, roadside sensors placement, latency compensation,
performance-bandwidth trade-off, attack/defense, pose alignment, etc. Moreover,
we conduct extensive experimental analyses to compare and examine current CP
methods, revealing some essential and unexplored insights. Specifically, we
analyze the performance changes of different methods under different
bandwidths, providing a deep insight into the performance-bandwidth trade-off
issue. Also, we examine methods under different LiDAR ranges. To study the
model robustness, we further investigate the effects of various simulated
real-world noises on the performance of different CP methods, covering
communication latency, lossy communication, localization errors, and mixed
noises. In addition, we look into the sim-to-real generalization ability of
existing CP methods. At last, we thoroughly discuss issues and challenges,
highlighting promising directions for future efforts. Our codes for
experimental analysis will be public at
https://github.com/memberRE/Collaborative-Perception.

<p class="mathjax">Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where
each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one
label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always
hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not
be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial
Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the
inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a
sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we
propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that
leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify
against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual
strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and
consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality
and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of
unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of
our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible.

<p class="mathjax">Emergency communication is vital for search and rescue operations following
natural disasters. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can significantly assist
emergency communication by agile positioning, maintaining connectivity during
rapid motion, and relaying critical disaster-related information to Ground
Control Stations (GCS). Designing effective routing protocols for relaying
crucial data in UAV networks is challenging due to dynamic topology, rapid
mobility, and limited UAV resources. This paper presents a novel
energy-constrained routing mechanism that ensures connectivity, inter-UAV
collision avoidance, and network restoration post-UAV fragmentation while
adapting without a predefined UAV path. The proposed method employs improved Q
learning to optimize the next-hop node selection. Considering these factors,
the paper proposes a novel, Improved Q-learning-based Multi-hop Routing (IQMR)
protocol. Simulation results validate IQMRs adaptability to changing system
conditions and superiority over QMR, QTAR, and QFANET in energy efficiency and
data throughput. IQMR achieves energy consumption efficiency improvements of
32.27%, 36.35%, and 36.35% over QMR, Q-FANET, and QTAR, along with
significantly higher data throughput enhancements of 53.3%, 80.35%, and 93.36%
over Q-FANET, QMR, and QTAR.

<p class="mathjax">Microgels are cross-linked, colloidal polymer networks with great potential
for stimuli-response release in drug-delivery applications, as their size in
the nanometer range allows them to pass human cell boundaries. For applications
with specified requirements regarding size, producing tailored microgels in a
continuous flow reactor is advantageous because the microgel properties can be
controlled tightly. However, no fully-specified mechanistic models are
available for continuous microgel synthesis, as the physical properties of the
included components are only studied partly. To address this gap and accelerate
tailor-made microgel development, we propose a data-driven optimization in a
hardware-in-the-loop approach to efficiently synthesize microgels with defined
sizes. We optimize the synthesis regarding conflicting objectives (maximum
production efficiency, minimum energy consumption, and the desired microgel
radius) by applying Bayesian optimization via the solver ``Thompson sampling
efficient multi-objective optimization'' (TS-EMO). We validate the optimization
using the deterministic global solver ``McCormick-based Algorithm for
mixed-integer Nonlinear Global Optimization'' (MAiNGO) and verify three
computed Pareto optimal solutions via experiments. The proposed framework can
be applied to other desired microgel properties and reactor setups and has the
potential of efficient development by minimizing number of experiments and
modelling effort needed.

<p class="mathjax">Sketch-based terrain generation seeks to create realistic landscapes for
virtual environments in various applications such as computer games, animation
and virtual reality. Recently, deep learning based terrain generation has
emerged, notably the ones based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).
However, these methods often struggle to fulfill the requirements of flexible
user control and maintain generative diversity for realistic terrain.
Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, namely terrain diffusion
network (TDN), which actively incorporates user guidance for enhanced
controllability, taking into account terrain features like rivers, ridges,
basins, and peaks. Instead of adhering to a conventional monolithic denoising
process, which often compromises the fidelity of terrain details or the
alignment with user control, a multi-level denoising scheme is proposed to
generate more realistic terrains by taking into account fine-grained details,
particularly those related to climatic patterns influenced by erosion and
tectonic activities. Specifically, three terrain synthesisers are designed for
structural, intermediate, and fine-grained level denoising purposes, which
allow each synthesiser concentrate on a distinct terrain aspect. Moreover, to
maximise the efficiency of our TDN, we further introduce terrain and sketch
latent spaces for the synthesizers with pre-trained terrain autoencoders.
Comprehensive experiments on a new dataset constructed from NASA Topology
Images clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving
the state-of-the-art performance. Our code and dataset will be publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">Web apps are built by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While
building modern web apps, it is common practice to make use of third-party
libraries and frameworks, as to improve developers' productivity and code
quality. Alongside these benefits, the adoption of such libraries results in
the introduction of JavaScript dead code, i.e., code implementing unused
functionalities. The costs for downloading and parsing dead code can negatively
contribute to the loading time and resource usage of web apps. The goal of our
study is two-fold. First, we present Lacuna, an approach for automatically
detecting and eliminating JavaScript dead code from web apps. The proposed
approach supports both static and dynamic analyses, it is extensible and can be
applied to any JavaScript code base, without imposing constraints on the coding
style or on the use of specific JavaScript constructs. Secondly, by leveraging
Lacuna we conduct an experiment to empirically evaluate the run-time overhead
of JavaScript dead code in terms of energy consumption, performance, network
usage, and resource usage in the context of mobile web apps. We applied Lacuna
four times on 30 mobile web apps independently developed by third-party
developers, each time eliminating dead code according to a different
optimization level provided by Lacuna. Afterward, each different version of the
web app is executed on an Android device, while collecting measures to assess
the potential run-time overhead caused by dead code. Experimental results,
among others, highlight that the removal of JavaScript dead code has a positive
impact on the loading time of mobile web apps, while significantly reducing the
number of bytes transferred over the network.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of computational power has led to unprecedented performance gains
for deep learning models. As more data becomes available and model
architectures become more complex, the need for more computational power
increases. On the other hand, since the introduction of Bitcoin as the first
cryptocurrency and the establishment of the concept of blockchain as a
distributed ledger, many variants and approaches have been proposed. However,
many of them have one thing in common, which is the Proof of Work (PoW)
consensus mechanism. PoW is mainly used to support the process of new block
generation. While PoW has proven its robustness, its main drawback is that it
requires a significant amount of processing power to maintain the security and
integrity of the blockchain. This is due to applying brute force to solve a
hashing puzzle. To utilize the computational power available in useful and
meaningful work while keeping the blockchain secure, many techniques have been
proposed, one of which is known as Proof of Deep Learning (PoDL). PoDL is a
consensus mechanism that uses the process of training a deep learning model as
proof of work to add new blocks to the blockchain. In this paper, we survey the
various approaches for PoDL. We discuss the different types of PoDL algorithms,
their advantages and disadvantages, and their potential applications. We also
discuss the challenges of implementing PoDL and future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Context. Many Internet content platforms, such as Spotify and YouTube,
provide their services via both native and Web apps. Even though those apps
provide similar features to the end user, using their native version or Web
counterpart might lead to different levels of energy consumption and
performance. Goal. The goal of this study is to empirically assess the energy
consumption and performance of native and Web apps in the context of Internet
content platforms on Android. Method. We select 10 Internet content platforms
across 5 categories. Then, we measure them based on the energy consumption,
network traffic volume, CPU load, memory load, and frame time of their native
and Web versions; then, we statistically analyze the collected measures and
report our results. Results. We confirm that native apps consume significantly
less energy than their Web counterparts, with large effect size. Web apps use
more CPU and memory, with statistically significant difference and large effect
size. Therefore, we conclude that native apps tend to require fewer hardware
resources than their corresponding Web versions. The network traffic volume
exhibits statistically significant difference in favour of native apps, with
small effect size. Our results do not allow us to draw any conclusion in terms
of frame time. Conclusions. Based on our results, we advise users to access
Internet contents using native apps over Web apps, when possible. Also, the
results of this study motivate further research on the optimization of the
usage of runtime resources of mobile Web apps and Android browsers.

<p class="mathjax">Deployment of Deep Neural Networks in medical imaging is hindered by
distribution shift between training data and data processed after deployment,
causing performance degradation. Post-Deployment Adaptation (PDA) addresses
this by tailoring a pre-trained, deployed model to the target data distribution
using limited labelled or entirely unlabelled target data, while assuming no
access to source training data as they cannot be deployed with the model due to
privacy concerns and their large size. This makes reliable adaptation
challenging due to limited learning signal. This paper challenges this
assumption and introduces FedPDA, a novel adaptation framework that brings the
utility of learning from remote data from Federated Learning into PDA. FedPDA
enables a deployed model to obtain information from source data via remote
gradient exchange, while aiming to optimize the model specifically for the
target domain. Tailored for FedPDA, we introduce a novel optimization method
StarAlign (Source-Target Remote Gradient Alignment) that aligns gradients
between source-target domain pairs by maximizing their inner product, to
facilitate learning a target-specific model. We demonstrate the method's
effectiveness using multi-center databases for the tasks of cancer metastases
detection and skin lesion classification, where our method compares favourably
to previous work. Code is available at: https://github.com/FelixWag/StarAlign

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of localization, which is inherently
non-convex and non-smooth in a federated setting where the data is distributed
across a multitude of devices. Due to the decentralized nature of federated
environments, distributed learning becomes essential for scalability and
adaptability. Moreover, these environments are often plagued by outlier data,
which presents substantial challenges to conventional methods, particularly in
maintaining estimation accuracy and ensuring algorithm convergence. To mitigate
these challenges, we propose a method that adopts an $L_1$-norm robust
formulation within a distributed sub-gradient framework, explicitly designed to
handle these obstacles. Our approach addresses the problem in its original
form, without resorting to iterative simplifications or approximations,
resulting in enhanced computational efficiency and improved estimation
accuracy. We demonstrate that our method converges to a stationary point,
highlighting its effectiveness and reliability. Through numerical simulations,
we confirm the superior performance of our approach, notably in outlier-rich
environments, which surpasses existing state-of-the-art localization methods.

<p class="mathjax">Binary silhouettes and keypoint-based skeletons have dominated human gait
recognition studies for decades since they are easy to extract from video
frames. Despite their success in gait recognition for in-the-lab environments,
they usually fail in real-world scenarios due to their low information entropy
for gait representations. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild,
this paper presents a novel gait representation, named Gait Parsing Sequence
(GPS). GPSs are sequences of fine-grained human segmentation, i.e., human
parsing, extracted from video frames, so they have much higher information
entropy to encode the shapes and dynamics of fine-grained human parts during
walking. Moreover, to effectively explore the capability of the GPS
representation, we propose a novel human parsing-based gait recognition
framework, named ParsingGait. ParsingGait contains a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN)-based backbone and two light-weighted heads. The first head
extracts global semantic features from GPSs, while the other one learns mutual
information of part-level features through Graph Convolutional Networks to
model the detailed dynamics of human walking. Furthermore, due to the lack of
suitable datasets, we build the first parsing-based dataset for gait
recognition in the wild, named Gait3D-Parsing, by extending the large-scale and
challenging Gait3D dataset. Based on Gait3D-Parsing, we comprehensively
evaluate our method and existing gait recognition methods. The experimental
results show a significant improvement in accuracy brought by the GPS
representation and the superiority of ParsingGait. The code and dataset are
available at https://gait3d.github.io/gait3d-parsing-hp .

<p class="mathjax">Existing emotion prediction benchmarks contain coarse emotion labels which do
not consider the diversity of emotions that an image and text can elicit in
humans due to various reasons. Learning diverse reactions to multimodal content
is important as intelligent machines take a central role in generating and
delivering content to society. To address this gap, we propose Socratis, a
\underline{soc}ietal \underline{r}e\underline{a}c\underline{ti}on\underline{s}
benchmark, where each image-caption (IC) pair is annotated with multiple
emotions and the reasons for feeling them. Socratis contains 18K free-form
reactions for 980 emotions on 2075 image-caption pairs from 5 widely-read news
and image-caption (IC) datasets. We benchmark the capability of
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models to generate the reasons for
feeling an emotion given an IC pair. Based on a preliminary human study, we
observe that humans prefer human-written reasons over 2 times more often than
machine-generated ones. This shows our task is harder than standard generation
tasks because it starkly contrasts recent findings where humans cannot tell
apart machine vs human-written news articles, for instance. We further see that
current captioning metrics based on large vision-language models also fail to
correlate with human preferences. We hope that these findings and our benchmark
will inspire further research on training emotionally aware models.

<p class="mathjax">Shared benchmark problems have historically been a fundamental driver of
progress for scientific communities. In the context of academic conferences,
competitions offer the opportunity to researchers with different origins,
backgrounds, and levels of seniority to quantitatively compare their ideas. In
robotics, a hot and challenging topic is sim2real-porting approaches that work
well in simulation to real robot hardware. In our case, creating a hybrid
competition with both simulation and real robot components was also dictated by
the uncertainties around travel and logistics in the post-COVID-19 world.
Hence, this article motivates and describes an aerial sim2real robot
competition that ran during the 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on
Intelligent Robots and Systems, from the specification of the competition task,
to the details of the software infrastructure supporting simulation and
real-life experiments, to the approaches of the top-placed teams and the
lessons learned by participants and organizers.

<p class="mathjax">Progress in High-Performance Computing in general, and High-Performance Graph
Processing in particular, is highly dependent on the availability of
publicly-accessible, relevant, and realistic data sets.
<br />To ensure continuation of this progress, we (i) investigate and optimize the
process of generating large sequence similarity graphs as an HPC challenge and
(ii) demonstrate this process in creating MS-BioGraphs, a new family of
publicly available real-world edge-weighted graph datasets with up to $2.5$
trillion edges, that is, $6.6$ times greater than the largest graph published
recently. The largest graph is created by matching (i.e., all-to-all similarity
aligning) $1.7$ billion protein sequences. The MS-BioGraphs family includes
also seven subgraphs with different sizes and direction types.
<br />We describe two main challenges we faced in generating large graph datasets
and our solutions, that are, (i) optimizing data structures and algorithms for
this multi-step process and (ii) WebGraph parallel compression technique. We
present a comparative study of structural characteristics of MS-BioGraphs.
<br />The datasets are available online on

<p class="mathjax">Target detection is a basic task to divide the object types in the orchard
point cloud global map, which is used to count the overall situation of the
orchard. And provide necessary information for unmanned navigation planning of
agricultural vehicles. In order to divide the fruit trees and the ground in the
point cloud global map of the standardized orchard, and provide the orchard
overall information for the path planning of autonomous vehicles in the natural
orchard environment. A fruit tree detection method based on the Yolo-V7 network
is proposed, which can effectively detect fruit tree targets from multi-sensor
fused radar point cloud, reduce the 3D point cloud information of the point
cloud map to 2D for the fruit tree point cloud in the Yolo-V7 network detection
map, and project the prediction results into the point cloud map. Generally,
the target detection network based on PointNet has the problem of low speed and
large computational load. The method proposed in this paper is fast and low
computational load and is suitable for deployment in mobile robots. From the
experimental results, the recall rate and accuracy rate of the proposed method
in orchard fruit tree detection are 0.4 and 0.696 respectively, and its weight
and reasoning time are 7.4 M and 28 ms respectively. The experimental results
show that this method can achieve the robustness and efficiency of real-time
detection of orchard fruit trees.

<p class="mathjax">Query rewriting refers to an established family of approaches that are
applied to underspecified and ambiguous queries to overcome the vocabulary
mismatch problem in document ranking. Queries are typically rewritten during
query processing time for better query modelling for the downstream ranker.
With the advent of large-language models (LLMs), there have been initial
investigations into using generative approaches to generate pseudo documents to
tackle this inherent vocabulary gap. In this work, we analyze the utility of
LLMs for improved query rewriting for text ranking tasks. We find that there
are two inherent limitations of using LLMs as query re-writers -- concept drift
when using only queries as prompts and large inference costs during query
processing. We adopt a simple, yet surprisingly effective, approach called
context aware query rewriting (CAR) to leverage the benefits of LLMs for query
understanding. Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-aware
prompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context.Unlike
existing approaches, we use LLM-based query rewriting only during the training
phase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead of
the original queries during training. In our extensive experiments, we find
that fine-tuning a ranker using re-written queries offers a significant
improvement of up to 33% on the passage ranking task and up to 28% on the
document ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using
original queries.

<p class="mathjax">Generating 3D faces from textual descriptions has a multitude of
applications, such as gaming, movie, and robotics. Recent progresses have
demonstrated the success of unconditional 3D face generation and text-to-3D
shape generation. However, due to the limited text-3D face data pairs,
text-driven 3D face generation remains an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a text-guided 3D faces generation method, refer as TG-3DFace, for
generating realistic 3D faces using text guidance. Specifically, we adopt an
unconditional 3D face generation framework and equip it with text conditions,
which learns the text-guided 3D face generation with only text-2D face data. On
top of that, we propose two text-to-face cross-modal alignment techniques,
including the global contrastive learning and the fine-grained alignment
module, to facilitate high semantic consistency between generated 3D faces and
input texts. Besides, we present directional classifier guidance during the
inference process, which encourages creativity for out-of-domain generations.
Compared to the existing methods, TG-3DFace creates more realistic and
aesthetically pleasing 3D faces, boosting 9% multi-view consistency (MVIC) over
Latent3D. The rendered face images generated by TG-3DFace achieve higher FID
and CLIP score than text-to-2D face/image generation models, demonstrating our
superiority in generating realistic and semantic-consistent textures.

<p class="mathjax">Radio map construction requires a large amount of radio measurement data with
location labels, which imposes a high deployment cost. This paper develops a
region-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements without
location labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSS
measurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor area
exactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The main
challenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physical
regions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturally
appears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signal
subspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and an
integrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shown
to find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, the
clustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-based
approach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed scheme
reduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weighted
centroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervised
localization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector
machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN), which require labeled data for
training.

to automatically learn and generate entity (i.e., user and item) categorical

framework, namely COVE, which enables the simultaneous learning and refinement
of code representation and entity embedding in an end-to-end manner, starting
from the randomly initialized states. With its high adaptability, COVE can be
easily integrated into existing recommendation models. We validate the
effectiveness of COVE on various recommendation tasks including list
completion, collaborative filtering, and click-through rate prediction, across
different recommendation models. We will publish the code and data for other
researchers to reproduce our work.

<p class="mathjax">Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT) reinforces the reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs) through the generation of intermediate rationales.
However, these enhancements predominantly benefit large-scale models, leaving
small LMs without significant performance improvements when directly applying
CoT. Despite the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, CoT relies primarily
on their pre-trained internal knowledge. The external knowledge that is
previously unknown to the model remains unexploited. This omission becomes
pronounced in tasks such as stance detection, where the external background
knowledge plays a pivotal role. Additionally, the large-scale architecture of
LLMs inevitably present efficiency challenges during deployment. To address
these challenges, we introduce the Ladder-of-Thought (LoT) for stance
detection. Grounded in a dual-phase Cascaded Optimization framework, LoT
directs the model to incorporate high-quality external knowledge, enhancing the
intermediate rationales it generates. These bolstered rationales subsequently
serve as the foundation for more precise predictions - akin to how a ladder
facilitates reaching elevated goals. LoT achieves a balance between efficiency
and accuracy, making it an adaptable and efficient framework for stance
detection. Our empirical evaluations underscore LoT's effectiveness, marking a
16% improvement over ChatGPT and a 10% enhancement compared to ChatGPT with
CoT.

<p class="mathjax">The protection of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that are employed in
public critical infrastructures is of utmost importance due to catastrophic
physical damages cyberattacks may cause. The research community requires
testbeds for validation and comparing various intrusion detection algorithms to
protect ICS. However, there exist high barriers to entry for research and
education in the ICS cybersecurity domain due to expensive hardware, software,
and inherent dangers of manipulating real-world systems. To close the gap,
built upon recently developed 3D high-fidelity simulators, we further showcase
our integrated framework to automatically launch cyberattacks, collect data,
train machine learning models, and evaluate for practical chemical and
manufacturing processes. On our testbed, we validate our proposed intrusion
detection model called Minimal Threshold and Window SVM (MinTWin SVM) that
utilizes unsupervised machine learning via a one-class SVM in combination with
a sliding window and classification threshold. Results show that MinTWin SVM
minimizes false positives and is responsive to physical process anomalies.
Furthermore, we incorporate our framework with ICS cybersecurity education by
using our dataset in an undergraduate machine learning course where students
gain hands-on experience in practicing machine learning theory with a practical
ICS dataset. All of our implementations have been open-sourced.

<p class="mathjax">In prediction-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), performance indicators
derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These
indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component
graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate
architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted
performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with
random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep
learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional
kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a
structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are
learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological
information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these
architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our
approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms
of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence
rate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on each

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing promises an effective way to solve targeted problems that
are classically intractable. Among them, quantum computers built with
superconducting qubits are considered one of the most advanced technologies,
but they suffer from short coherence times. This can get exaggerated when they
are controlled directly by general-purpose host machines, which leads to the
loss of quantum information. To mitigate this, we need quantum control
processors (QCPs) positioned between quantum processing units and host machines
to reduce latencies. However, existing QCPs are built on top of designs with no
or inefficient scalability, requiring a large number of instructions when
scaling to more qubits. In addition, interactions between current QCPs and host
machines require frequent data transmissions and offline computations to obtain
final results, which limits the performance of quantum computers.
<br />In this paper, we propose a QCP called HiSEP-Q featuring a novel quantum
instruction set architecture (QISA) and its microarchitecture implementation.
For efficient control, we utilize mixed-type addressing modes and mixed-length
instructions in HiSEP-Q, which provides an efficient way to concurrently
address more than 100 qubits. Further, for efficient read-out and analysis, we
develop a novel onboard accumulation and sorting unit, which eliminates the
data transmission of raw data between the QCPs and host machines and enables
real-time result processing. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed
QISA achieves at least 62% and 28% improvements in encoding efficiency with
real and synthetic quantum circuits, respectively. We also validate the
microarchitecture on a field-programmable gate array, which exhibits low power
and resource consumption. Both hardware and ISA evaluations demonstrate that
HiSEP-Q features high scalability and efficiency toward the number of
controlled qubits.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot referring image segmentation is a challenging task because it aims
to find an instance segmentation mask based on the given referring
descriptions, without training on this type of paired data. Current zero-shot
methods mainly focus on using pre-trained discriminative models (e.g., CLIP).
However, we have observed that generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have
potentially understood the relationships between various visual elements and
text descriptions, which are rarely investigated in this task. In this work, we
introduce a novel Referring Diffusional segmentor (Ref-Diff) for this task,
which leverages the fine-grained multi-modal information from generative
models. We demonstrate that without a proposal generator, a generative model
alone can achieve comparable performance to existing SOTA weakly-supervised
models. When we combine both generative and discriminative models, our Ref-Diff
outperforms these competing methods by a significant margin. This indicates
that generative models are also beneficial for this task and can complement
discriminative models for better referring segmentation. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/kodenii/Ref-Diff.

<p class="mathjax">With the growing imbalance between limited medical resources and escalating
demands, AI-based clinical tasks have become paramount. Medication
recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient
history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and
more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent
long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between
head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative
relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data
long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of
medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method
using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we
design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized
entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based
on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication
precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current
state-of-the-art methods in four evaluation metrics (including safety and
accuracy).

<p class="mathjax">Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is an ensemble-based method to solve inverse
problems. Its gradient-free formulation makes it an attractive tool for
problems with involved formulation. However, EKI suffers from the ''subspace
property'', i.e., the EKI solutions are confined in the subspace spanned by the
initial ensemble. It implies that the ensemble size should be larger than the
problem dimension to ensure EKI's convergence to the correct solution. Such
scaling of ensemble size is impractical and prevents the use of EKI in high
dimensional problems. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using
dropout regularization to mitigate the subspace problem. We prove that
dropout-EKI converges in the small ensemble settings, and the computational
cost of the algorithm scales linearly with dimension. We also show that
dropout-EKI reaches the optimal query complexity, up to a constant factor.
Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a growing
trend of human-AI teaming (HAT) in various fields. As machines continue to
evolve from mere automation to a state of autonomy, they are increasingly
exhibiting unexpected behaviors and human-like cognitive/intelligent
capabilities, including situation awareness (SA). This shift has the potential
to enhance the performance of mixed human-AI teams over all-human teams,
underscoring the need for a better understanding of the dynamic SA interactions
between humans and machines. To this end, we provide a review of leading SA
theoretical models and a new framework for SA in the HAT context based on the
key features and processes of HAT. The Agent Teaming Situation Awareness (ATSA)
framework unifies human and AI behavior, and involves bidirectional, and
dynamic interaction. The framework is based on the individual and team SA
models and elaborates on the cognitive mechanisms for modeling HAT. Similar
perceptual cycles are adopted for the individual (including both human and AI)
and the whole team, which is tailored to the unique requirements of the HAT
context. ATSA emphasizes cohesive and effective HAT through structures and
components, including teaming understanding, teaming control, and the world, as
well as adhesive transactive part. We further propose several future research
directions to expand on the distinctive contributions of ATSA and address the
specific and pressing next steps.

<p class="mathjax">The main limiting factor in the development of robust multilingual dialogue
evaluation metrics is the lack of multilingual data and the limited
availability of open sourced multilingual dialogue systems. In this work, we
propose a workaround for this lack of data by leveraging a strong multilingual
pretrained LLM and augmenting existing English dialogue data using Machine
Translation. We empirically show that the naive approach of finetuning a
pretrained multilingual encoder model with translated data is insufficient to
outperform the strong baseline of finetuning a multilingual model with only
source data. Instead, the best approach consists in the careful curation of
translated data using MT Quality Estimation metrics, excluding low quality
translations that hinder its performance.

<p class="mathjax">Our study reveals new theoretical insights into over-smoothing and feature
over-correlation in deep graph neural networks. We show the prevalence of
invariant subspaces, demonstrating a fixed relative behavior that is unaffected
by feature transformations. Our work clarifies recent observations related to
convergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states,
as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the
aggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representations
being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence
rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of
the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span
this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided
by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property
that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.
We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating the
inability of existing models to capture linearly independent features.

<p class="mathjax">A new method is proposed for human motion prediction by learning temporal and
spatial dependencies. Recently, multiscale graphs have been developed to model
the human body at higher abstraction levels, resulting in more stable motion
prediction. Current methods however predetermine scale levels and combine
spatially proximal joints to generate coarser scales based on human priors,
even though movement patterns in different motion sequences vary and do not
fully comply with a fixed graph of spatially connected joints. Another problem
with graph convolutional methods is mode collapse, in which predicted poses
converge around a mean pose with no discernible movements, particularly in
long-term predictions. To tackle these issues, we propose ResChunk, an
end-to-end network which explores dynamically correlated body components based
on the pairwise relationships between all joints in individual sequences.
ResChunk is trained to learn the residuals between target sequence chunks in an
autoregressive manner to enforce the temporal connectivities between
consecutive chunks. It is hence a sequence-to-sequence prediction network which
considers dynamic spatio-temporal features of sequences at multiple levels. Our
experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets, CMU Mocap and Human3.6M,
demonstrate that our proposed method is able to effectively model the sequence
information for motion prediction and outperform other techniques to set a new
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MohsenZand/ResChunk.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual content instability caused by device pose tracking error remains a
prevalent issue in markerless augmented reality (AR), especially on smartphones
and tablets. However, when examining environments which will host AR
experiences, it is challenging to determine where those instability artifacts
will occur; we rarely have access to ground truth pose to measure pose error,
and even if pose error is available, traditional visualizations do not connect
that data with the real environment, limiting their usefulness. To address
these issues we present SiTAR (Situated Trajectory Analysis for Augmented
Reality), the first situated trajectory analysis system for AR that
incorporates estimates of pose tracking error. We start by developing the first
uncertainty-based pose error estimation method for visual-inertial simultaneous
localization and mapping (VI-SLAM), which allows us to obtain pose error
estimates without ground truth; we achieve an average accuracy of up to 96.1%
and an average F1 score of up to 0.77 in our evaluations on four VI-SLAM
datasets. Next we present our SiTAR system, implemented for ARCore devices,
combining a backend that supplies uncertainty-based pose error estimates with a
frontend that generates situated trajectory visualizations. Finally, we
evaluate the efficacy of SiTAR in realistic conditions by testing three
visualization techniques in an in-the-wild study with 15 users and 13 diverse
environments; this study reveals the impact both environment scale and the
properties of surfaces present can have on user experience and task
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Building heat electrification is central to economy-wide decarbonization
efforts and directly affects energy infrastructure planning through increasing
electricity demand and reduces the use of gas infrastructure that also serves
the power sector. However, the simultaneous effects on both the power and gas
systems have yet to be rigorously evaluated. Offering two key contributions, we
develop a modeling framework to project end-use demand for electricity and gas
in the buildings sector under various electrification pathways and evaluate
their impact on co-optimized bulk power-gas infrastructure investments and
operations under deep decarbonization scenarios. Applying the framework to
study the U.S. New England region in 2050 across 20 weather scenarios, we find
high electrification of the residential sector can increase sectoral peak and
total electricity demands by up to 62-160% and 47-65% respectively relative to
business-as-usual trajectories. Employing demand-side measures like building
envelope improvements under high electrification, however, can reduce the
magnitude and weather sensitivity of peak load as well as reduce combined power
and gas demand by 29-31% relative to the present day. Notably, a combination of
high electrification and envelope improvements yields the lowest bulk power-gas
system cost outcomes. We also find that inter-annual weather-driven variations
in demand result in up to 20% variation in optimal power sector investments,
which highlights the importance of capturing weather sensitivity for planning
purposes.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate traffic forecasting at intersections governed by intelligent traffic
signals is critical for the advancement of an effective intelligent traffic
signal control system. However, due to the irregular traffic time series
produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes
much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous
spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)
variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance
of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous
Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic
states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.
Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose
an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial
dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.
After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state
sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the
continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware
Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution
filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on
the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network
consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is
designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state
sequences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of ASeer in six metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic image segmentation is a critical component in many computer vision
systems, such as autonomous driving. In such applications, adverse conditions
(heavy rain, night time, snow, extreme lighting) on the one hand pose specific
challenges, yet are typically underrepresented in the available datasets.
Generating more training data is cumbersome and expensive, and the process
itself is error-prone due to the inherent aleatoric uncertainty. To address
this challenging problem, we propose BTSeg, which exploits image-level
correspondences as weak supervision signal to learn a segmentation model that
is agnostic to adverse conditions. To this end, our approach uses the Barlow
twins loss from the field of unsupervised learning and treats images taken at
the same location but under different adverse conditions as "augmentations" of
the same unknown underlying base image. This allows the training of a
segmentation model that is robust to appearance changes introduced by different
adverse conditions. We evaluate our approach on ACDC and the new challenging
ACG benchmark to demonstrate its robustness and generalization capabilities.
Our approach performs favorably when compared to the current state-of-the-art
methods, while also being simpler to implement and train. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a learning-based system for enabling quadrupedal robots to
manipulate large, heavy objects using their whole body. Our system is based on
a hierarchical control strategy that uses the deep latent variable embedding
which captures manipulation-relevant information from interactions,
proprioception, and action history, allowing the robot to implicitly understand
object properties. We evaluate our framework in both simulation and real-world
scenarios. In the simulation, it achieves a success rate of 93.6 % in
accurately re-positioning and re-orienting various objects within a tolerance
of 0.03 m and 5 {\deg}. Real-world experiments demonstrate the successful
manipulation of objects such as a 19.2 kg water-filled drum and a 15.3 kg
plastic box filled with heavy objects while the robot weighs 27 kg. Unlike
previous works that focus on manipulating small and light objects using
prehensile manipulation, our framework illustrates the possibility of using
quadrupeds for manipulating large and heavy objects that are ungraspable with
the robot's entire body. Our method does not require explicit object modeling
and offers significant computational efficiency compared to optimization-based
methods. The video can be found at $\href{https://youtu.be/fO_PVr27QxU}{this \

<p class="mathjax">Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) have been introduced to deal with
multiple tasks by exploiting the correlations between different outputs.
Generally, MOGPs models assume a flat correlation structure between the
outputs. However, such a formulation does not account for more elaborate
relationships, for instance, if several replicates were observed for each
output (which is a typical setting in biological experiments). This paper
proposes an extension of MOGPs for hierarchical datasets (i.e. datasets for
which the relationships between observations can be represented within a tree
structure). Our model defines a tailored kernel function accounting for
hierarchical structures in the data to capture different levels of correlations
while leveraging the introduction of latent variables to express the underlying
dependencies between outputs through a dedicated kernel. This latter feature is
expected to significantly improve scalability as the number of tasks increases.
An extensive experimental study involving both synthetic and real-world data
from genomics and motion capture is proposed to support our claims.

<p class="mathjax">When human programmers have mastered a programming language, it would be
easier when they learn a new programming language. In this report, we focus on
exploring whether programming languages can boost each other during the
instruction fine-tuning phase of code large language models. We conduct
extensive experiments of 8 popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, HTML) on StarCoder. Results demonstrate that
programming languages can significantly improve each other. For example,
CodeM-Python 15B trained on Python is able to increase Java by an absolute
17.95% pass@1 on HumanEval-X. More surprisingly, we found that CodeM-HTML 7B
trained on the HTML corpus can improve Java by an absolute 15.24% pass@1. Our
training data is released at https://github.com/NL2Code/CodeM.

<p class="mathjax">Amodal object segmentation is a challenging task that involves segmenting
both visible and occluded parts of an object. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, called Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (C2F-Seg), that addresses this
problem by progressively modeling the amodal segmentation. C2F-Seg initially
reduces the learning space from the pixel-level image space to the
vector-quantized latent space. This enables us to better handle long-range
dependencies and learn a coarse-grained amodal segment from visual features and
visible segments. However, this latent space lacks detailed information about
the object, which makes it difficult to provide a precise segmentation
directly. To address this issue, we propose a convolution refine module to
inject fine-grained information and provide a more precise amodal object
segmentation based on visual features and coarse-predicted segmentation. To
help the studies of amodal object segmentation, we create a synthetic amodal
dataset, named as MOViD-Amodal (MOViD-A), which can be used for both image and
video amodal object segmentation. We extensively evaluate our model on two
benchmark datasets: KINS and COCO-A. Our empirical results demonstrate the
superiority of C2F-Seg. Moreover, we exhibit the potential of our approach for
video amodal object segmentation tasks on FISHBOWL and our proposed MOViD-A.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) requires frequent exchange of model parameters, which
leads to long communication delay, especially when the network environments of
clients vary greatly. Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for the
slowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowest
computing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, which
may significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used client
selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of
computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. To
tackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate the
approach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, and
accordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme with
Differential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:
dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimize
the model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'
heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important model
parameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.
Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convex
optimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and
model heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameter
selection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploading
to speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence
of the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in both
communication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a strong
generalization capability to data of rare classes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an end-to-end high-quality singing voice synthesis (SVS)
system that uses bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT)
derived semantic embeddings to improve the expressiveness of the synthesized
singing voice. Based on the main architecture of recently proposed VISinger, we
put forward several specific designs for expressive singing voice synthesis.
First, different from the previous SVS models, we use text representation of
lyrics extracted from pre-trained BERT as additional input to the model. The
representation contains information about semantics of the lyrics, which could
help SVS system produce more expressive and natural voice. Second, we further
introduce an energy predictor to stabilize the synthesized voice and model the
wider range of energy variations that also contribute to the expressiveness of
singing voice. Last but not the least, to attenuate the off-key issues, the
pitch predictor is re-designed to predict the real to note pitch ratio. Both
objective and subjective experimental results indicate that the proposed SVS
system can produce singing voice with higher-quality outperforming VISinger.

<p class="mathjax">The power-grid frequency reflects the balance between electricity supply and
demand. Measuring the frequency and its variations allows monitoring of the
power balance in the system and, thus, the grid stability. In addition, gaining
insight into the characteristics of frequency variations and defining precise
evaluation metrics for these variations enables accurate assessment of the
performance of forecasts and synthetic models of the power-grid frequency.
Previous work was limited to a few geographical regions and did not quantify
the observed effects. In this contribution, we analyze and quantify the
statistical and stochastic properties of self-recorded power-grid frequency
data from various synchronous areas in Asia, Australia, and Europe at a
resolution of one second. Revealing non-standard statistics of both empirical
and synthetic frequency data, we effectively constrain the space of possible
(stochastic) power-grid frequency models and share a range of analysis tools to
benchmark any model or characterize empirical data. Furthermore, we emphasize
the need to analyze data from a large range of synchronous areas to obtain
generally applicable models.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic Diffusion Models (PDMs) have recently emerged as a very
promising class of generative models, achieving high performance in natural
image generation. However, their performance relative to non-natural images,
like radar-based satellite data, remains largely unknown. Generating large
amounts of synthetic (and especially labelled) satellite data is crucial to
implement deep-learning approaches for the processing and analysis of
(interferometric) satellite aperture radar data. Here, we leverage PDMs to
generate several radar-based satellite image datasets. We show that PDMs
succeed in generating images with complex and realistic structures, but that
sampling time remains an issue. Indeed, accelerated sampling strategies, which
work well on simple image datasets like MNIST, fail on our radar datasets. We
provide a simple and versatile open-source
https://github.com/thomaskerdreux/PDM_SAR_InSAR_generation to train, sample and
evaluate PDMs using any dataset on a single GPU.

<p class="mathjax">Treemaps have been widely applied to the visualization of hierarchical data.
A treemap takes a weighted tree and visualizes its leaves in a nested planar
geometric shape, with sub-regions partitioned such that each sub-region has an
area proportional to the weight of its associated leaf nodes. Efficiently
generating visually appealing treemaps that also satisfy other quality criteria
is an interesting problem that has been tackled from many directions. We
present an optimization model and five new algorithms for this problem,
including two divide and conquer approaches and three spiral treemap
algorithms. Our optimization model is able to generate superior treemaps that
could serve as a benchmark for comparing the quality of more computationally
efficient algorithms. Our divide and conquer and spiral algorithms either
improve the performance of their existing counterparts with respect to aspect
ratio and stability or perform competitively. Our spiral algorithms also expand
their applicability to a wider range of input scenarios. Four of these
algorithms are computationally efficient as well with quasilinear running times
and the last algorithm achieves a cubic running time. A full version of this

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and
model it by using multiport network theory. We first compare the representation
of RIS by using $Z$-parameters and $S$-parameters, by proving their equivalence
and discussing their distinct features. Then, we develop an algorithm for
optimizing the RIS configuration in the presence of electromagnetic mutual
coupling. We show that the proposed algorithm based on optimizing the
$S$-parameters results in better performance than existing algorithms based on
optimizing the $Z$-parameters. This is attributed to the fact that small
perturbations of the step size of the proposed algorithm result in larger
variations of the $S$-parameters, hence increasing the convergence speed of the
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Biomedical Engineering's Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is helping to
improve the accuracy, dependability, and productivity of electronic equipment
in the healthcare business. Real-time sensory data from patients may be
delivered and subsequently analyzed through rapid development of wearable IoMT
devices, such as neuro-stimulation devices with a range of functions. Data from
the Internet of Things is gathered, analyzed, and stored in a single location.
However, single-point failure, data manipulation, privacy difficulties, and
other challenges might arise as a result of centralization. Due to its
decentralized nature, blockchain (BC) can alleviate these issues. The viability
of establishing a non-invasive remote neurostimulation system employing
IoMT-based transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is investigated in this work
(tDCS). A hardware-based prototype tDCS device has been developed that can be
operated over the internet using an android application. Our suggested
framework addresses the problems of IoMTBC-based systems, meets the criteria of
real-time remote patient monitoring systems, and incorporates literature best
practices in the relevant fields.

<p class="mathjax">Several decades ago, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were introduced for
performing binary classification tasks, under a supervised framework. Nowadays,
they often outperform other supervised methods and remain one of the most
popular approaches in the machine learning arena. In this work, we investigate
the training of SVMs through a smooth sparse-promoting-regularized squared
hinge loss minimization. This choice paves the way to the application of quick
training methods built on majorization-minimization approaches, benefiting from
the Lipschitz differentiabililty of the loss function. Moreover, the proposed
approach allows us to handle sparsity-preserving regularizers promoting the
selection of the most significant features, so enhancing the performance.
Numerical tests and comparisons conducted on three different datasets
demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methodology in terms of
qualitative metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score) as well as
computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) methods face a significant
challenge in classifying large volumes of encrypted traffic in the open-world
assumption, i.e., simultaneously classifying the known applications and
detecting unknown applications. We propose a novel Open-World Contrastive
Pre-training (OWCP) framework for this. OWCP performs contrastive pre-training
to obtain a robust feature representation. Based on this, we determine the
spherical mapping space to find the marginal flows for each known class, which
are used to train GANs to synthesize new flows similar to the known parts but
do not belong to any class. These synthetic flows are assigned to Softmax's
unknown node to modify the classifier, effectively enhancing sensitivity
towards known flows and significantly suppressing unknown ones. Extensive
experiments on three datasets show that OWCP significantly outperforms existing
ETC and generic open-world classification methods. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies and sensitivity analyses to validate each
integral component of OWCP.

<p class="mathjax">Since its invention HyperLogLog has become the standard algorithm for
approximate distinct counting. Due to its space efficiency and suitability for
distributed systems, it is widely used and also implemented in numerous
databases. This work presents UltraLogLog, which shares the same practical
properties as HyperLogLog. It is commutative, idempotent, mergeable, and has a
fast guaranteed constant-time insert operation. At the same time, it requires
28% less space to encode the same amount of distinct count information, which
can be extracted using the maximum likelihood method. Alternatively, a simpler
and faster estimator is proposed, which still achieves a space reduction of
24%, but at an estimation speed comparable to that of HyperLogLog. In a
non-distributed setting where martingale estimation can be used, UltraLogLog is
able to reduce space by 17%. Moreover, its smaller entropy and its 8-bit
registers lead to better compaction when using standard compression algorithms.
All this is verified by experimental results that are in perfect agreement with
the theoretical analysis which also outlines potential for even more
space-efficient data structures. A production-ready Java implementation of
UltraLogLog has been released as part of the open-source Hash4j library.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes a framework for learning Automated Vehicles (AVs) driver
models via knowledge sharing between vehicles and personalization. The innate
variability in the transportation system makes it exceptionally challenging to
expose AVs to all possible driving scenarios during empirical experimentation
or testing. Consequently, AVs could be blind to certain encounters that are
deemed detrimental to their safe and efficient operation. It is then critical
to share knowledge across AVs that increase exposure to driving scenarios
occurring in the real world. This paper explores a method to collaboratively
train a driver model by sharing knowledge and borrowing strength across
vehicles while retaining a personalized model tailored to the vehicle's unique
conditions and properties. Our model brings a federated learning approach to
collaborate between multiple vehicles while circumventing the need to share raw
data between them. We showcase our method's performance in experimental
simulations. Such an approach to learning finds several applications across
transportation engineering including intelligent transportation systems,
traffic management, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Code and sample

<p class="mathjax">Gender biases in language generation systems are challenging to mitigate. One
possible source for these biases is gender representation disparities in the
training and evaluation data. Despite recent progress in documenting this
problem and many attempts at mitigating it, we still lack shared methodology
and tooling to report gender representation in large datasets. Such
quantitative reporting will enable further mitigation, e.g., via data
augmentation. This paper describes the Gender-GAP Pipeline (for Gender-Aware
Polyglot Pipeline), an automatic pipeline to characterize gender representation
in large-scale datasets for 55 languages. The pipeline uses a multilingual
lexicon of gendered person-nouns to quantify the gender representation in text.
We showcase it to report gender representation in WMT training data and
development data for the News task, confirming that current data is skewed
towards masculine representation. Having unbalanced datasets may indirectly
optimize our systems towards outperforming one gender over the others. We
suggest introducing our gender quantification pipeline in current datasets and,
ideally, modifying them toward a balanced representation.

<p class="mathjax">Visual active tracking is a growing research topic in robotics due to its key
role in applications such as human assistance, disaster recovery, and
surveillance. In contrast to passive tracking, active tracking approaches
combine vision and control capabilities to detect and actively track the
target. Most of the work in this area focuses on ground robots, while the very
few contributions on aerial platforms still pose important design constraints
that limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we
propose D-VAT, a novel end-to-end visual active tracking methodology based on
deep reinforcement learning that is tailored to micro aerial vehicle platforms.
The D-VAT agent computes the vehicle thrust and angular velocity commands
needed to track the target by directly processing monocular camera
measurements. We show that the proposed approach allows for precise and
collision-free tracking operations, outperforming different state-of-the-art
baselines on simulated environments which differ significantly from those
encountered during training.

<p class="mathjax">Human-centric video frame interpolation has great potential for improving
people's entertainment experiences and finding commercial applications in the
sports analysis industry, e.g., synthesizing slow-motion videos. Although there
are multiple benchmark datasets available in the community, none of them is
dedicated for human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SportsSloMo, a benchmark consisting of more than 130K video clips and 1M video
frames of high-resolution ($\geq$720p) slow-motion sports videos crawled from
YouTube. We re-train several state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, and the
results show a decrease in their accuracy compared to other datasets. It
highlights the difficulty of our benchmark and suggests that it poses
significant challenges even for the best-performing methods, as human bodies
are highly deformable and occlusions are frequent in sports videos. To improve
the accuracy, we introduce two loss terms considering the human-aware priors,
where we add auxiliary supervision to panoptic segmentation and human keypoints
detection, respectively. The loss terms are model agnostic and can be easily
plugged into any video frame interpolation approaches. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our proposed loss terms, leading to consistent
performance improvement over 5 existing models, which establish strong baseline
models on our benchmark. The dataset and code can be found at:

<p class="mathjax">The end of Dennard scaling and the slowdown of Moore's law led to a shift in
technology trends toward parallel architectures, particularly in HPC systems.
To continue providing performance benefits, HPC should embrace Approximate
Computing (AC), which trades application quality loss for improved performance.
However, existing AC techniques have not been extensively applied and evaluated
in state-of-the-art hardware architectures such as GPUs, the primary execution
vehicle for HPC applications today.
<br />This paper presents HPAC-Offload, a pragma-based programming model that
extends OpenMP offload applications to support AC techniques, allowing portable
approximations across different GPU architectures. We conduct a comprehensive
performance analysis of HPAC-Offload across GPU-accelerated HPC applications,
revealing that AC techniques can significantly accelerate HPC applications
(1.64x LULESH on AMD, 1.57x NVIDIA) with minimal quality loss (0.1%). Our
analysis offers deep insights into the performance of GPU-based AC that guide
the future development of AC algorithms and systems for these architectures.

<p class="mathjax">For example, in machine translation tasks, to achieve bidirectional
translation between two languages, the source corpus is often used as the
target corpus, which involves the training of two models with opposite
directions. The question of which one can adapt most quickly to a domain shift
is of significant importance in many fields. Specifically, consider an original
distribution p that changes due to an unknown intervention, resulting in a
modified distribution p*. In aligning p with p*, several factors can affect the
adaptation rate, including the causal dependencies between variables in p. In
real-life scenarios, however, we have to consider the fairness of the training
process, and it is particularly crucial to involve a sensitive variable (bias)
present between a cause and an effect variable. To explore this scenario, we
examine a simple structural causal model (SCM) with a cause-bias-effect
structure, where variable A acts as a sensitive variable between cause (X) and
effect (Y). The two models, respectively, exhibit consistent and contrary
cause-effect directions in the cause-bias-effect SCM. After conducting unknown
interventions on variables within the SCM, we can simulate some kinds of domain
shifts for analysis. We then compare the adaptation speeds of two models across
four shift scenarios. Additionally, we prove the connection between the
adaptation speeds of the two models across all interventions.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Text2Scene, a method to automatically create realistic textures
for virtual scenes composed of multiple objects. Guided by a reference image
and text descriptions, our pipeline adds detailed texture on labeled 3D
geometries in the room such that the generated colors respect the hierarchical
structure or semantic parts that are often composed of similar materials.
Instead of applying flat stylization on the entire scene at a single step, we
obtain weak semantic cues from geometric segmentation, which are further
clarified by assigning initial colors to segmented parts. Then we add texture
details for individual objects such that their projections on image space
exhibit feature embedding aligned with the embedding of the input. The
decomposition makes the entire pipeline tractable to a moderate amount of
computation resources and memory. As our framework utilizes the existing
resources of image and text embedding, it does not require dedicated datasets
with high-quality textures designed by skillful artists. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first practical and scalable approach that can create
detailed and realistic textures of the desired style that maintain structural
context for scenes with multiple objects.

<p class="mathjax">In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(mMIMO) systems, the reciprocity mismatch caused by receiver distortion
seriously degrades the amplitude prediction performance of channel state
information (CSI). To tackle this issue, from the perspective of distortion
suppression and reciprocity calibration, a lightweight neural network-based
amplitude prediction method is proposed in this paper. Specifically, with the
receiver distortion at the base station (BS), conventional methods are employed
to extract the amplitude feature of uplink CSI. Then, learning along the
direction of the uplink wireless propagation channel, a dedicated and
lightweight distortion-learning network (Dist-LeaNet) is designed to restrain
the receiver distortion and calibrate the amplitude reciprocity between the
uplink and downlink CSI. Subsequently, by cascading, a single hidden
layer-based amplitude-prediction network (Amp-PreNet) is developed to
accomplish amplitude prediction of downlink CSI based on the strong amplitude
reciprocity. Simulation results show that, considering the receiver distortion
in FDD systems, the proposed scheme effectively improves the amplitude
prediction accuracy of downlink CSI while reducing the transmission and
processing delay.

<p class="mathjax">We present Belebele, a multiple-choice machine reading comprehension (MRC)
dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language
coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset
enables the evaluation of text models in high-, medium-, and low-resource
languages. Each question is based on a short passage from the Flores-200
dataset and has four multiple-choice answers. The questions were carefully
curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general
language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough
to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this
dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We
use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language
models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results
and find that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric
LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still
understand far more languages. We also observe that larger vocabulary size and
conscious vocabulary construction correlate with better performance on
low-resource languages. Overall, Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating
and analyzing the multilingual capabilities of NLP systems.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) involves several devices that collaboratively train a
shared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces the
communication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhanced
wireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,
implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAV
placement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.
Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucial
variables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we
first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor
network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution
based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network
coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution
that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy
constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification
algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected
reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms
in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our
multi-objective and cost-aware algorithm. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently witnessed rapid
advancements, exhibiting a remarkable capacity for perceiving, understanding,
and processing visual information by connecting visual receptor with large
language models (LLMs). However, current assessments mainly focus on
recognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation of
conversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities. In this
paper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to
comprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct
a comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world
images and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27
subtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and
comprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating
detailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input
content into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced
LLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without
requiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful
LVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging
their textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences. We hope our
work can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs' evaluation and pave the way for
building stronger LVLMs. The evaluation code is available at
https://github.com/OFA-Sys/TouchStone.

<p class="mathjax">It is a long-standing problem in robotics to develop agents capable of
executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured
real-world environments. To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have a
comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. In
this work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent for
multi-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$eural
feature $\textbf{F}$ields. GNFactor jointly optimizes a generalizable neural
field (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a
decision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To
incorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a
vision-language foundation model ($\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill
rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3
real robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a
limited number of demonstrations. We observe a substantial improvement of
GNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen tasks,
demonstrating the strong generalization ability of GNFactor. Our project

<p class="mathjax">Contact is at the core of robotic manipulation. At times, it is desired (e.g.
manipulation and grasping), and at times, it is harmful (e.g. when avoiding
obstacles). However, traditional path planning algorithms focus solely on
collision-free paths, limiting their applicability in contact-rich tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose the domain of Language-Conditioned Path
Planning, where contact-awareness is incorporated into the path planning
problem. As a first step in this domain, we propose Language-Conditioned
Collision Functions (LACO) a novel approach that learns a collision function
using only a single-view image, language prompt, and robot configuration. LACO
predicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,
conditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, point
cloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the real
world, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans that
allow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than
prohibiting any collision.

<p class="mathjax">We present EMDB, the Electromagnetic Database of Global 3D Human Pose and
Shape in the Wild. EMDB is a novel dataset that contains high-quality 3D SMPL
pose and shape parameters with global body and camera trajectories for
in-the-wild videos. We use body-worn, wireless electromagnetic (EM) sensors and
a hand-held iPhone to record a total of 58 minutes of motion data, distributed
over 81 indoor and outdoor sequences and 10 participants. Together with
accurate body poses and shapes, we also provide global camera poses and body
root trajectories. To construct EMDB, we propose a multi-stage optimization
procedure, which first fits SMPL to the 6-DoF EM measurements and then refines
the poses via image observations. To achieve high-quality results, we leverage

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation in autonomous driving has been undergoing an evolution
from sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objective
is to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.
The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient
2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)
ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address
this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds
effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them
efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we
construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for
more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to
maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to
efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each
point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes
without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D
occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.
Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all
other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the
OpenOccupancy benchmark. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/PointOcc.

<p class="mathjax">Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecture
has led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within the
transformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interact
through pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where
$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish a
formal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and a
hard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimal
tokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. This
formalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers
optimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with
vanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to
an SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter
$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm
objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur
toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementing
this, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descent
under suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show that
over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility
of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid
of stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linear
prediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts the
implicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrary
datasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduce
several open problems and research directions. We believe these findings
inspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs that
separates and selects optimal tokens.

encompasses 897k images of wine labels and 824k reviews of wines curated from

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale linear systems, $Ax=b$, frequently arise in practice and demand
effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side
vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the
coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, is
corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy
vector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}
\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$
represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and
realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless
coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can
control the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings by
performing comprehensive numerical experiments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses a novel task of anticipating 3D human-object
interactions (HOIs). Most existing research on HOI synthesis lacks
comprehensive whole-body interactions with dynamic objects, e.g., often limited
to manipulating small or static objects. Our task is significantly more
challenging, as it requires modeling dynamic objects with various shapes,
capturing whole-body motion, and ensuring physically valid interactions. To
this end, we propose InterDiff, a framework comprising two key steps: (i)
interaction diffusion, where we leverage a diffusion model to encode the
distribution of future human-object interactions; (ii) interaction correction,
where we introduce a physics-informed predictor to correct denoised HOIs in a
diffusion step. Our key insight is to inject prior knowledge that the
interactions under reference with respect to contact points follow a simple
pattern and are easily predictable. Experiments on multiple human-object
interaction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for this task,
capable of producing realistic, vivid, and remarkably long-term 3D HOI
predictions.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to fine-grained cross-view
geo-localization. Our method aligns a warped ground image with a corresponding
GPS-tagged satellite image covering the same area using homography estimation.
We first employ a differentiable spherical transform, adhering to geometric
principles, to accurately align the perspective of the ground image with the
satellite map. This transformation effectively places ground and aerial images
in the same view and on the same plane, reducing the task to an image alignment
problem. To address challenges such as occlusion, small overlapping range, and
seasonal variations, we propose a robust correlation-aware homography estimator
to align similar parts of the transformed ground image with the satellite
image. Our method achieves sub-pixel resolution and meter-level GPS accuracy by
mapping the center point of the transformed ground image to the satellite image
using a homography matrix and determining the orientation of the ground camera
using a point above the central axis. Operating at a speed of 30 FPS, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the mean metric
localization error by 21.3% and 32.4% in same-area and cross-area
generalization tasks on the VIGOR benchmark, respectively, and by 34.4% on the
KITTI benchmark in same-area evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Unconditional video generation is a challenging task that involves
synthesizing high-quality videos that are both coherent and of extended
duration. To address this challenge, researchers have used pretrained StyleGAN
image generators for high-quality frame synthesis and focused on motion
generator design. The motion generator is trained in an autoregressive manner
using heavy 3D convolutional discriminators to ensure motion coherence during
video generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel motion generator design
that uses a learning-based inversion network for GAN. The encoder in our method
captures rich and smooth priors from encoding images to latents, and given the
latent of an initially generated frame as guidance, our method can generate
smooth future latent by modulating the inversion encoder temporally. Our method
enjoys the advantage of sparse training and naturally constrains the generation
space of our motion generator with the inversion network guided by the initial
frame, eliminating the need for heavy discriminators. Moreover, our method
supports style transfer with simple fine-tuning when the encoder is paired with
a pretrained StyleGAN generator. Extensive experiments conducted on various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating long and
high-resolution videos with decent single-frame quality and temporal
consistency.

Networks (RVPINNs) to approximate the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
solution. We start from a weak Petrov-Galerkin formulation of the problem,
select a discrete test space, and define a quadratic loss functional as in
VPINNs. Whereas in VPINNs the loss depends upon the selected basis functions of
a given test space, herein we minimize a loss based on the residual in the
discrete dual norm, which is independent of the test space's choice of test
basis functions. We demonstrate that this loss is a reliable and efficient
estimator of the true error in the energy norm. The proposed loss function
requires computation of the Gram matrix inverse, similar to what occurs in
traditional residual minimization methods. To validate our theoretical
findings, we test the performance and robustness of our algorithm in several
advection-dominated-diffusion problems in one spatial dimension. We conclude
that RVPINNs is a robust method.

<p class="mathjax">The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created a
profound impact on natural language processing but are yet to fully embrace the
realm of 3D understanding. This paper introduces PointLLM, a preliminary effort
to fill this gap, thereby enabling LLMs to understand point clouds and offering
a new avenue beyond 2D visual data. PointLLM processes colored object point
clouds with human instructions and generates contextually appropriate
responses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense.
Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM to
effectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. We collect
a novel dataset comprising 660K simple and 70K complex point-text instruction
pairs to enable a two-stage training strategy: initially aligning latent spaces
and subsequently instruction-tuning the unified model. To rigorously evaluate
our model's perceptual abilities and its generalization capabilities, we
establish two benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D Object
Captioning, assessed through three different methods, including human
evaluation, GPT-4/ChatGPT evaluation, and traditional metrics. Experiment
results show that PointLLM demonstrates superior performance over existing 2D
baselines. Remarkably, in human-evaluated object captioning tasks, PointLLM
outperforms human annotators in over 50% of the samples. Codes, datasets, and
benchmarks are available at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/PointLLM .

<p class="mathjax">Though Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a core component of spoken dialogue
systems, recent work on this task mostly deals with chat corpora, disregarding
the discrepancies between spoken and written language.In this paper, we propose
OLISIA, a cascade system which integrates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
model and a DST model. We introduce several adaptations in the ASR and DST
modules to improve integration and robustness to spoken conversations.With
these adaptations, our system ranked first in DSTC11 Track 3, a benchmark to
evaluate spoken DST. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the results and find
that normalizing the ASR outputs and adapting the DST inputs through data
augmentation, along with increasing the pre-trained models size all play an
important role in reducing the performance discrepancy between written and
spoken conversations.

<p class="mathjax">The assessment of the well-being of the peripheral auditory nerve system in
individuals experiencing hearing impairment is conducted through auditory
brainstem response (ABR) testing. Audiologists assess and document the results
of the ABR test. They interpret the findings and assign labels to them using
reference-based markers like peak latency, waveform morphology, amplitude, and
other relevant factors. Inaccurate assessment of ABR tests may lead to
incorrect judgments regarding the integrity of the auditory nerve system;
therefore, proper Hearing Loss (HL) diagnosis and analysis are essential. To
identify and assess ABR automation while decreasing the possibility of human
error, machine learning methods, notably deep learning, may be an appropriate
option. To address these issues, this study proposed deep-learning models using
the transfer-learning (TL) approach to extract features from ABR testing and
diagnose HL using support vector machines (SVM). Pre-trained convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures like AlexNet, DenseNet, GoogleNet,
InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, ResNet18, ResNet50,
ResNet101, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet are used to extract features from the
collected ABR reported images dataset in the proposed model. It has been
decided to use six measures accuracy, precision, recall, geometric mean (GM),
standard deviation (SD), and area under the ROC curve to measure the
effectiveness of the proposed model. According to experimental findings, the
ShuffleNet and ResNet50 models' TL is effective for ABR to diagnose HL using an
SVM classifier, with a high accuracy rate of 95% when using the 5-fold
cross-validation method.

<p class="mathjax">Retrosynthesis planning is a fundamental challenge in chemistry which aims at
designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a
target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires
accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule
and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model
single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a
discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative
framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete
distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our
framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned
at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does
not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly
operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior
distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our
novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis
modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Lossy video compression is commonly used when transmitting and storing video
data. Unified video codecs (e.g., H.264 or H.265) remain the \emph{de facto}
standard, despite the availability of advanced (neural) compression approaches.
Transmitting videos in the face of dynamic network bandwidth conditions
requires video codecs to adapt to vastly different compression strengths. Rate
control modules augment the codec's compression such that bandwidth constraints
are satisfied and video distortion is minimized. While, both standard video
codes and their rate control modules are developed to minimize video distortion
w.r.t. human quality assessment, preserving the downstream performance of deep
vision models is not considered. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end
learnable deep video codec control considering both bandwidth constraints and
downstream vision performance, while not breaking existing standardization. We
demonstrate for two common vision tasks (semantic segmentation and optical flow
estimation) and on two different datasets that our deep codec control better
preserves downstream performance than using 2-pass average bit rate control
while meeting dynamic bandwidth constraints and adhering to standardizations.

<p class="mathjax">Existing classical optical network infrastructure cannot be immediately used
for quantum network applications due to photon loss. The first step towards
enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical
networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum
hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that
optimizes the allocation of quantum repeaters and memories. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently
distributing quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the
objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement
distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a
preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of
the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing
within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on
quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness
assumptions on network planning, uncovering their impacts on real-time network
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Signalling pathways are conserved across different species, therefore making
yeast a model organism to study these via disruption of kinase activity. Yeast
has 159 genes that encode protein kinases and phosphatases, and 136 of these
have counterparts in humans. Therefore any insight in this model organism could
potentially offer indications of mechanisms of action in the human kinome. The
study utilises a Prolog-based approach, data from a yeast kinase deletions
strains study and publicly available kinase-protein associations. Prolog, a
programming language that is well-suited for symbolic reasoning is used to
reason over the data and infer compensatory kinase networks. This approach is
based on the idea that when a kinase is knocked out, other kinases may
compensate for this loss of activity. Background knowledge on kinases targeting
proteins is used to guide the analysis. This knowledge is used to infer the
potential compensatory interactions between kinases based on the changes in
phosphorylation observed in the phosphoproteomics data from the yeast study.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Prolog-based approach in
analysing complex cell signalling mechanisms in yeast. The inferred
compensatory kinase networks provide new insights into the regulation of cell
signalling in yeast and may aid in the identification of potential therapeutic
targets for modulating signalling pathways in yeast and other organisms.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we utilize image segmentation to visually identify blood
vessels in retinal examination images. This process is typically carried out
manually. However, we can employ heuristic methods and machine learning to
automate or at least expedite the process. In this context, we propose a
cross-platform, open-source, and responsive software that allows users to
manually segment a retinal image. The purpose is to use the user-segmented
image to retrain machine learning algorithms, thereby enhancing future
automated segmentation results. Moreover, the software also incorporates and
applies certain image filters established in the literature to improve vessel
visualization. We propose the first solution of this kind in the literature.
This is the inaugural integrated software that embodies the aforementioned
attributes: open-source, responsive, and cross-platform. It offers a
comprehensive solution encompassing manual vessel segmentation, as well as the
automated execution of classification algorithms to refine predictive models.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a general geometric framework for simulating and learning
the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under a Lie group of
transformations. This means that a group of symmetries is known to act on the
system respecting its dynamics and, as a consequence, Noether's Theorem,
conserved quantities are observed. We propose to simulate and learn the
mappings of interest through the construction of $G$-invariant Lagrangian
submanifolds, which are pivotal objects in symplectic geometry. A notable
property of our constructions is that the simulated/learned dynamics also
preserves the same conserved quantities as the original system, resulting in a
more faithful surrogate of the original dynamics than non-symmetry aware
methods, and in a more accurate predictor of non-observed trajectories.
Furthermore, our setting is able to simulate/learn not only Hamiltonian flows,
but any Lie group-equivariant symplectic transformation. Our designs leverage
pivotal techniques and concepts in symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics:
reduction theory, Noether's Theorem, Lagrangian submanifolds, momentum
mappings, and coisotropic reduction among others. We also present methods to
learn Poisson transformations while preserving the underlying geometry and how
to endow non-geometric integrators with geometric properties. Thus, this work
presents a novel attempt to harness the power of symplectic and Poisson
geometry towards simulating and learning problems.

<p class="mathjax">Denoising diffusion models have found applications in image segmentation by
generating segmented masks conditioned on images. Existing studies
predominantly focus on adjusting model architecture or improving inference such
as test-time sampling strategies. In this work, we focus on training strategy
improvements and propose a novel recycling method. During each training step, a
segmentation mask is first predicted given an image and a random noise. This
predicted mask, replacing the conventional ground truth mask, is used for
denoising task during training. This approach can be interpreted as aligning
the training strategy with inference by eliminating the dependence on ground
truth masks for generating noisy samples. Our proposed method significantly
outperforms standard diffusion training, self-conditioning, and existing
recycling strategies across multiple medical imaging data sets: muscle
ultrasound, abdominal CT, prostate MR, and brain MR. This holds true for two
widely adopted sampling strategies: denoising diffusion probabilistic model and
denoising diffusion implicit model. Importantly, existing diffusion models
often display a declining or unstable performance during inference, whereas our
novel recycling consistently enhances or maintains performance. Furthermore, we
show for the first time that, under a fair comparison with the same network
architectures and computing budget, the proposed recycling-based diffusion
models achieved on-par performance with non-diffusion-based supervised
training. This paper summarises these quantitative results and discusses their
values, with a fully reproducible JAX-based implementation, released at
https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg.

schemes to establish rate of convergence for Prox-SubGrad without assuming
Lipschitz continuity. We present a novel convergence analysis in this context.
Furthermore, we propose some new stochastic subgradient upper bounding
conditions and establish convergence and iteration complexity rates for the
stochastic subgradient method (Sto-SubGrad) to solve non-Lipschitz and
nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems. In particular, for both
deterministic and stochastic subgradient methods on weakly convex optimization
problems without Lipschitz continuity, under any of the subgradient upper
bounding conditions to be introduced in the paper, we show that $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate holds in terms of the square of gradient of the Moreau
envelope function, which further improves to be $O(1/{T})$ if, in addition, the
uniform KL condition with exponent $1/2$ holds.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately measuring the evolution of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) critically informs understanding of disease progression
and helps to direct therapeutic strategy. Deep learning models have shown
promise for automatically segmenting MS lesions, but the scarcity of accurately
annotated data hinders progress in this area. Obtaining sufficient data from a
single clinical site is challenging and does not address the heterogeneous need
for model robustness. Conversely, the collection of data from multiple sites
introduces data privacy concerns and potential label noise due to varying
annotation standards. To address this dilemma, we explore the use of the
federated learning framework while considering label noise. Our approach
enables collaboration among multiple clinical sites without compromising data
privacy under a federated learning paradigm that incorporates a noise-robust
training strategy based on label correction. Specifically, we introduce a
Decoupled Hard Label Correction (DHLC) strategy that considers the imbalanced
distribution and fuzzy boundaries of MS lesions, enabling the correction of
false annotations based on prediction confidence. We also introduce a Centrally
Enhanced Label Correction (CELC) strategy, which leverages the aggregated
central model as a correction teacher for all sites, enhancing the reliability
of the correction process. Extensive experiments conducted on two multi-site
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods,
indicating their potential for clinical applications in multi-site
collaborations.

<p class="mathjax">The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to
their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary
coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their
computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle
time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In
addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and
applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations,
thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we
introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by
sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal
convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5
detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of
multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year
data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive
rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less
than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for
interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for
future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.

numerical analysis that convergence rates depend on the regularity of
solutions, and here we consider cases with varying solution regularity: (i)
Strongly degenerate problems with Lipschitz solutions, and (ii) weakly
non-degenerate problems where we show that solutions have bounded fractional
derivatives of order between 1 and 2. Our main results are optimal error
estimates with convergence rates that capture precisely both the fractional
order of the schemes and the fractional regularity of the solutions. For
strongly degenerate equations, these rates improve earlier results. For weakly
non-degenerate problems of order greater than one, the results are new. Here we
show improved rates compared to the strongly degenerate case, rates that are
always better than 1/2.

<p class="mathjax">In the present paper, we formulate two versions of Frank--Wolfe algorithm or
conditional gradient method to solve the DC optimization problem with an
adaptive step size. The DC objective function consists of two components; the
first is thought to be differentiable with a continuous Lipschitz gradient,
while the second is only thought to be convex. The second version is based on
the first and employs finite differences to approximate the gradient of the
first component of the objective function. In contrast to past formulations
that used the curvature/Lipschitz-type constant of the objective function, the
step size computed does not require any constant associated with the
components. For the first version, we established that the algorithm is
well-defined of the algorithm and that every limit point of the generated
sequence is a stationary point of the problem. We also introduce the class of
weak-star-convex functions and show that, despite the fact that these functions
are non-convex in general, the rate of convergence of the first version of the
algorithm to minimize these functions is ${\cal O}(1/k)$. The finite difference
used to approximate the gradient in the second version of the Frank-Wolfe
algorithm is computed with the step-size adaptively updated using two previous
iterations. Unlike previous applications of finite difference in the
Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which provided approximate gradients with absolute
error, the one used here provides us with a relative error, simplifying the
algorithm analysis. In this case, we show that all limit points of the
generated sequence for the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are
stationary points for the problem under consideration, and we establish that
the rate of convergence for the duality gap is ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{k})$.

influence mechanism for the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM).
Without changing the equation constraints of the original LSSVM, this
mechanism, allows an accurate partitioning of the training set without
overfitting. The maximum memory impact model (MIMM) and the weighted impact
memory model (WIMM) are then proposed. It is demonstrated that these models can
be degraded to the LSSVM. Furthermore, we propose some different memory impact
functions for the MIMM and WIMM. The experimental results show that that our
MIMM and WIMM have better generalization performance compared to the LSSVM and
significant advantage in time cost compared to other memory models.

<p class="mathjax">When taking images against strong light sources, the resulting images often
contain heterogeneous flare artifacts. These artifacts can importantly affect
image visual quality and downstream computer vision tasks. While collecting
real data pairs of flare-corrupted/flare-free images for training flare removal
models is challenging, current methods utilize the direct-add approach to
synthesize data. However, these methods do not consider automatic exposure and
tone mapping in image signal processing pipeline (ISP), leading to the limited
generalization capability of deep models training using such data. Besides,
existing methods struggle to handle multiple light sources due to the different
sizes, shapes and illuminance of various light sources. In this paper, we
propose a solution to improve the performance of lens flare removal by
revisiting the ISP and remodeling the principle of automatic exposure in the
synthesis pipeline and design a more reliable light sources recovery strategy.
The new pipeline approaches realistic imaging by discriminating the local and
global illumination through convex combination, avoiding global illumination
shifting and local over-saturation. Our strategy for recovering multiple light
sources convexly averages the input and output of the neural network based on
illuminance levels, thereby avoiding the need for a hard threshold in
identifying light sources. We also contribute a new flare removal testing
dataset containing the flare-corrupted images captured by ten types of consumer
electronics. The dataset facilitates the verification of the generalization
capability of flare removal methods. Extensive experiments show that our
solution can effectively improve the performance of lens flare removal and push
the frontier toward more general situations.

ground and excited states of quantum systems. Our approach is based on
approximating wavefunctions in the linear span of basis functions that are
augmented and optimized \emph{via} composition with normalizing flows. The
accuracy and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated in the calculations of
a large number of vibrational states of the triatomic H$_2$S molecule as well

<p class="mathjax">In the rapidly evolving field of automatic echocardiographic analysis and
interpretation, automatic view classification is a critical yet challenging
task, owing to the inherent complexity and variability of echocardiographic
data. This study presents ECHOcardiography VIew Classification with
Out-of-Distribution dEtection (ECHO-VICODE), a novel deep learning-based
framework that effectively addresses this challenge by training to classify 31
classes, surpassing previous studies and demonstrating its capacity to handle a
wide range of echocardiographic views. Furthermore, ECHO-VICODE incorporates an
integrated out-of-distribution (OOD) detection function, leveraging the
relative Mahalanobis distance to effectively identify 'near-OOD' instances
commonly encountered in echocardiographic data. Through extensive
experimentation, we demonstrated the outstanding performance of ECHO-VICODE in
terms of view classification and OOD detection, significantly reducing the
potential for errors in echocardiographic analyses. This pioneering study
significantly advances the domain of automated echocardiography analysis and
exhibits promising prospects for substantial applications in extensive clinical

<p class="mathjax">Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a challenging task due to limited data
and blurred boundaries of certain emotions. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive approach to improve the SER performance throughout the model
lifecycle, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages. To
address the data scarcity issue, we utilize a pre-trained model, wav2vec2.0.
During fine-tuning, we propose a novel loss function that combines
cross-entropy loss with supervised contrastive learning loss to improve the
model's discriminative ability. This approach increases the inter-class
distances and decreases the intra-class distances, mitigating the issue of
blurred boundaries. Finally, to leverage the improved distances, we propose an
interpolation method at the inference stage that combines the model prediction
with the output from a k-nearest neighbors model. Our experiments on IEMOCAP
demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art
results.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction is crucial to evaluate the
perceptual quality of the synthetic speech. While recent approaches using
pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models have shown promising results,
they only partly address the data scarcity issue for the feature extractor.
This leaves the data scarcity issue for the decoder unresolved and leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a
retrieval-augmented MOS prediction method, dubbed {\bf RAMP}, to enhance the
decoder's ability against the data scarcity issue. A fusing network is also
proposed to dynamically adjust the retrieval scope for each instance and the
fusion weights based on the predictive confidence. Experimental results show
that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods in multiple
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">A common approach to quantum circuit transformation is to use the properties
of a specific gate set to create an efficient representation of a given
circuit's unitary, such as a parity matrix or stabiliser tableau, and then
resynthesise an improved circuit, e.g. with fewer gates or respecting
connectivity constraints. Since these methods rely on a restricted gate set,
generalisation to arbitrary circuits usually involves slicing the circuit into
pieces that can be resynthesised and working with these separately. The choices
made about what gates should go into each slice can have a major effect on the
performance of the resynthesis. In this paper we propose an alternative
approach to generalising these resynthesis algorithms to general quantum
circuits. Instead of cutting the circuit into slices, we "cut out" the gates we
can't resynthesise leaving holes in our quantum circuit. The result is a
second-order process called a quantum comb, which can be resynthesised
directly. We apply this idea to the RowCol algorithm, which resynthesises CNOT
circuits for topologically constrained hardware, explaining how we were able to
extend it to work for quantum combs. We then compare the generalisation of
RowCol using our method to the naive "slice and build" method empirically on a
variety of circuit sizes and hardware topologies. Finally, we outline how
quantum combs could be used to help generalise other resynthesis algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a novel zero-shot user-defined keyword spotting model
that utilizes the audio-phoneme relationship of the keyword to improve
performance. Unlike the previous approach that estimates at utterance level, we
use both utterance and phoneme level information. Our proposed method comprises
a two-stream speech encoder architecture, self-attention-based pattern
extractor, and phoneme-level detection loss for high performance in various
pronunciation environments. Based on experimental results, our proposed model
outperforms the baseline model and achieves competitive performance compared
with full-shot keyword spotting models. Our proposed model significantly
improves the EER and AUC across all datasets, including familiar words, proper
nouns, and indistinguishable pronunciations, with an average relative
improvement of 67% and 80%, respectively. The implementation code of our
proposed model is available at https://github.com/ncsoft/PhonMatchNet.

<p class="mathjax">In medical research, the traditional way to collect data, i.e. browsing
patient files, has been proven to induce bias, errors, human labor and costs.
We propose a semi-automated system able to extract every type of data,
including notes. The Smart Data Extractor pre-populates clinic research forms
by following rules. We performed a cross-testing experiment to compare
semi-automated to manual data collection. 20 target items had to be collected
for 79 patients. The average time to complete one form was 6'81'' for manual
data collection and 3'22'' with the Smart Data Extractor. There were also more
mistakes during manual data collection (163 for the whole cohort) than with the
Smart Data Extractor (46 for the whole cohort). We present an easy to use,
understandable and agile solution to fill out clinical research forms. It
reduces human effort and provides higher quality data, avoiding data re-entry
and fatigue induced errors.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a new method for the accurate estimation and
tracking of formants in speech signals using time-varying quasi-closed-phase
(TVQCP) analysis. Conventional formant tracking methods typically adopt a
two-stage estimate-and-track strategy wherein an initial set of formant
candidates are estimated using short-time analysis (e.g., 10--50 ms), followed
by a tracking stage based on dynamic programming or a linear state-space model.
One of the main disadvantages of these approaches is that the tracking stage,
however good it may be, cannot improve upon the formant estimation accuracy of
the first stage. The proposed TVQCP method provides a single-stage formant
tracking that combines the estimation and tracking stages into one. TVQCP
analysis combines three approaches to improve formant estimation and tracking:
(1) it uses temporally weighted quasi-closed-phase analysis to derive
closed-phase estimates of the vocal tract with reduced interference from the
excitation source, (2) it increases the residual sparsity by using the $L_1$
optimization and (3) it uses time-varying linear prediction analysis over long
time windows (e.g., 100--200 ms) to impose a continuity constraint on the vocal
tract model and hence on the formant trajectories. Formant tracking experiments
with a wide variety of synthetic and natural speech signals show that the
proposed TVQCP method performs better than conventional and popular formant
tracking tools, such as Wavesurfer and Praat (based on dynamic programming),
the KARMA algorithm (based on Kalman filtering), and DeepFormants (based on
deep neural networks trained in a supervised manner). Matlab scripts for the
proposed method can be found at: https://github.com/njaygowda/ftrack

<p class="mathjax">Dental caries is one of the most common oral diseases that, if left
untreated, can lead to a variety of oral problems. It mainly occurs inside the
pits and fissures on the occlusal/buccal/palatal surfaces of molars and
children are a high-risk group for pit and fissure caries in permanent molars.
Pit and fissure sealing is one of the most effective methods that is widely
used in prevention of pit and fissure caries. However, current detection of
pits and fissures or caries depends primarily on the experienced dentists,
which ordinary parents do not have, and children may miss the remedial
treatment without timely detection. To address this issue, we present a method
to autodetect caries and pit and fissure sealing requirements using oral photos
taken by smartphones. We use the YOLOv5 and YOLOX models and adopt a tiling
strategy to reduce information loss during image pre-processing. The best
result for YOLOXs model with tiling strategy is 72.3 mAP.5, while the best
result without tiling strategy is 71.2. YOLOv5s6 model with/without tiling
attains 70.9/67.9 mAP.5, respectively. We deploy the pre-trained network to
mobile devices as a WeChat applet, allowing in-home detection by parents or
children guardian.

<p class="mathjax">There is no doubt that advanced artificial intelligence models and high
quality data are the keys to success in developing computational pathology
tools. Although the overall volume of pathology data keeps increasing, a lack
of quality data is a common issue when it comes to a specific task due to
several reasons including privacy and ethical issues with patient data. In this
work, we propose to exploit knowledge distillation, i.e., utilize the existing
model to learn a new, target model, to overcome such issues in computational
pathology. Specifically, we employ a student-teacher framework to learn a
target model from a pre-trained, teacher model without direct access to source
data and distill relevant knowledge via momentum contrastive learning with
multi-head attention mechanism, which provides consistent and context-aware
feature representations. This enables the target model to assimilate
informative representations of the teacher model while seamlessly adapting to
the unique nuances of the target data. The proposed method is rigorously
evaluated across different scenarios where the teacher model was trained on the
same, relevant, and irrelevant classification tasks with the target model.
Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach in
transferring knowledge to different domains and tasks, outperforming other
related methods. Moreover, the results provide a guideline on the learning
strategy for different types of tasks and scenarios in computational pathology.

<p class="mathjax">The efficient construction of an anatomical model is one of the major
challenges of patient-specific in-silico models of the human heart. Current
methods frequently rely on linear statistical models, allowing no advanced
topological changes, or requiring medical image segmentation followed by a
meshing pipeline, which strongly depends on image resolution, quality, and
modality. These approaches are therefore limited in their transferability to
other imaging domains. In this work, the cardiac shape is reconstructed by
means of three-dimensional deep signed distance functions with Lipschitz
regularity. For this purpose, the shapes of cardiac MRI reconstructions are
learned from public databases to model the spatial relation of multiple
chambers in Cartesian space. We demonstrate that this approach is also capable
of reconstructing anatomical models from partial data, such as point clouds
from a single ventricle, or modalities different from the trained MRI, such as
electroanatomical mapping, and in addition, allows us to generate new
anatomical shapes by randomly sampling latent vectors.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation methods often rely on fully supervised approaches
to achieve excellent performance, which is contingent upon having an extensive
set of labeled images for training. However, annotating medical images is both
expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning offers a solution by
leveraging numerous unlabeled images alongside a limited set of annotated ones.
In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method
based on the mean-teacher model, referred to as Dual-Decoder Consistency via
Pseudo-Labels Guided Data Augmentation (DCPA). This method combines consistency
regularization, pseudo-labels, and data augmentation to enhance the efficacy of
semi-supervised segmentation. Firstly, the proposed model comprises both
student and teacher models with a shared encoder and two distinct decoders
employing different up-sampling strategies. Minimizing the output discrepancy
between decoders enforces the generation of consistent representations, serving
as regularization during student model training. Secondly, we introduce mixup
operations to blend unlabeled data with labeled data, creating mixed data and
thereby achieving data augmentation. Lastly, pseudo-labels are generated by the
teacher model and utilized as labels for mixed data to compute unsupervised
loss. We compare the segmentation results of the DCPA model with six
state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on three publicly available medical
datasets. Beyond classical 10\% and 20\% semi-supervised settings, we
investigate performance with less supervision (5\% labeled data). Experimental
outcomes demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods across the three
semi-supervised settings.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of tumors in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) plays an essential
role in the early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Deep learning models
backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the
dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However,
since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not
able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this
restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality
of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,
their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the
model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size
improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation
tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a
technique to select the vision transformer's optimal input multi-resolution
image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We
further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique,
demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance
was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using
the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We
experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a
multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved
results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a
smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing
semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers. The
implementation source code is available

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are widely considered to become an
integral part of future wireless communication systems. Various methodologies
exist to design such surfaces; however, most consider or require a very large
number of tunable components. This not only raises system complexity, but also
significantly increases power consumption. Sparse RISs (SRISs) consider using a
smaller or even minimal number of tunable components to improve overall
efficiency while maintaining sufficient RIS capability. The versatile
semidefinite relaxation-based optimization method previously applied to
transmit array antennas is adapted and applied accordingly, to evaluate the
potential of different SRIS configurations. Because the relaxation is tight in
all cases, the maximum possible performance is found reliably. Hence, with this
approach, the trade-off between performance and sparseness of SRIS can be
analyzed. Preliminary results show that even a much smaller number of
reconfigurable elements, e.g. only 50%, can still have a significant impact.

<p class="mathjax">The online Data Quality Monitoring system (DQM) of the CMS electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL) is a crucial operational tool that allows ECAL experts to
quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that
would otherwise hinder physics-quality data taking. Although the existing ECAL
DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains
one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning,
a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is
able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial
variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies,
the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an
estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing
benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the
system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the
CMS online DQM workflow for the ECAL barrel during Run 3 of the LHC are
presented, showing its promising performance in detecting obscure issues that
could have been missed in the existing DQM system.

<p class="mathjax">We can learn from analyzing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs)
that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical
system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for
quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable
basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin
models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling
layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can
contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning
process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators
are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models
strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps
with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and
generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor
the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We
demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on
classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing.
Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be
used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good
generalization and proven trainability.

<p class="mathjax">We propose to apply several gradient estimation techniques to enable the
differentiation of programs with discrete randomness in High Energy Physics.
Such programs are common in High Energy Physics due to the presence of
branching processes and clustering-based analysis. Thus differentiating such
programs can open the way for gradient based optimization in the context of
detector design optimization, simulator tuning, or data analysis and
reconstruction optimization. We discuss several possible gradient estimation
strategies, including the recent Stochastic AD method, and compare them in
simplified detector design experiments. In doing so we develop, to the best of
our knowledge, the first fully differentiable branching program.

<p class="mathjax">A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.
<br />To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Exact diagonalization is a well-established method for simulating small
quantum systems. Its applicability is limited by the exponential growth of the
so-called Hamiltonian matrix that needs to be diagonalized. Physical symmetries
are usually utilized to reduce the matrix dimension, and distributed-memory
parallelism is employed to explore larger systems. This paper focuses on the
implementation the core distributed algorithms, with a special emphasis on the
matrix-vector product operation. Instead of the conventional MPI+X paradigm,
Chapel is chosen as the language for these distributed algorithms.
<br />We provide a comprehensive description of the algorithms and present
performance and scalability tests. Our implementation outperforms the
state-of-the-art MPI-based solution by a factor of 7--8 on 32 compute nodes or
4096 cores and exhibits very good scaling on up to 256 nodes or 32768 cores.
The implementation has 3 times fewer software lines of code than the current
state of the art while remaining fully generic.

<p class="mathjax">Ultrasound imaging serves as a pivotal tool for diagnosing cervical lymph
node lesions. However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the
expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to
misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially
improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a
conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our
work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal
lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions,
and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are
generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily
tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations
with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building
upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This
architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial
domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various
lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we
benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold
cross-validation. The results show that US-SFNet is SOTA and can achieve 92.89%
accuracy, 90.46% precision, 89.95% sensitivity and 97.49% specificity,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">During the process of computed tomography (CT), metallic implants often cause
disruptive artifacts in the reconstructed images, impeding accurate diagnosis.
Several supervised deep learning-based approaches have been proposed for
reducing metal artifacts (MAR). However, these methods heavily rely on training
with simulated data, as obtaining paired metal artifact CT and clean CT data in
clinical settings is challenging. This limitation can lead to decreased
performance when applying these methods in clinical practice. Existing
unsupervised MAR methods, whether based on learning or not, typically operate
within a single domain, either in the image domain or the sinogram domain. In
this paper, we propose an unsupervised MAR method based on the diffusion model,
a generative model with a high capacity to represent data distributions.
Specifically, we first train a diffusion model using CT images without metal
artifacts. Subsequently, we iteratively utilize the priors embedded within the
pre-trained diffusion model in both the sinogram and image domains to restore
the degraded portions caused by metal artifacts. This dual-domain processing
empowers our approach to outperform existing unsupervised MAR methods,
including another MAR method based on the diffusion model, which we have
qualitatively and quantitatively validated using synthetic datasets. Moreover,
our method demonstrates superior visual results compared to both supervised and
unsupervised methods on clinical datasets.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a proximal variant of the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) for distributed optimization. Although the current versions
of ADMM algorithm provide promising numerical results in producing solutions
that are close to optimal for many convex and non-convex optimization problems,
it remains unclear if they can converge to a stationary point for weakly convex
and locally non-smooth functions. Through our analysis using the Moreau
envelope function, we demonstrate that MADM can indeed converge to a stationary
point under mild conditions. Our analysis also includes computing the bounds on
the amount of change in the dual variable update step by relating the gradient
of the Moreau envelope function to the proximal function. Furthermore, the
results of our numerical experiments indicate that our method is faster and
more robust than widely-used approaches.

interpolation techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. We
generalize the method to Krein spaces, and show that widely-used neural network
architectures are subsets of reproducing kernel Krein spaces (RKKS). We study
the concept of "associated Hilbert spaces" of RKKS and develop techniques to
improve upon the expressivity of various activation functions. Next, using
concepts from the theory of functions of several complex variables, we prove a
computationally applicable, multidimensional generalization of the celebrated
Adamjan- Arov-Krein (AAK) theorem. The theorem yields a novel class of neural
networks, called Prolongation Neural Networks (PNN). We demonstrate that, by
applying the multidimensional AAK theorem to gain a PNN, one can gain
performance superior to both our interpolatory methods and current
state-of-the-art methods in noisy environments. We provide useful illustrations
of our methods in practice.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we study the problem of semantic communication and inference,
in which a student agent (i.e. mobile device) queries a teacher agent (i.e.
cloud sever) to generate higher-order data semantics living in a simplicial
complex. Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-order
simplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effective
communication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient and
invariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimal
simplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected by
the Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.
Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a masked
simplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remote
teacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy under
different channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on a
coauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacian
values yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.
Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves query
accuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared to
remote teacher based query. Finally, incorporating channel semantics is shown
to effectively improve inference accuracy, notably at low SNR values.

<p class="mathjax">We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest
excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the
estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no
explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the
problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the
ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables
can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states
such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general,
it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural
networks as variational Ansatze for many-electron systems, and we show that by
combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as
large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect
this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational
quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurological disease characterized by
inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Hence, predicting
inflammatory disease activity is crucial for disease assessment and treatment.
However, MS lesions can occur throughout the brain and vary in shape, size and
total count among patients. The high variance in lesion load and locations
makes it challenging for machine learning methods to learn a globally effective
representation of whole-brain MRI scans to assess and predict disease.
Technically it is non-trivial to incorporate essential biomarkers such as
lesion load or spatial proximity. Our work represents the first attempt to
utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to aggregate these biomarkers for a novel
global representation. We propose a two-stage MS inflammatory disease activity
prediction approach. First, a 3D segmentation network detects lesions, and a
self-supervised algorithm extracts their image features. Second, the detected
lesions are used to build a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes in the
graph and are initialized with image features extracted in the first stage.
Finally, the lesions are connected based on their spatial proximity and the
inflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graph
classification task. Furthermore, we propose a self-pruning strategy to
auto-select the most critical lesions for prediction. Our proposed method
outperforms the existing baseline by a large margin (AUCs of 0.67 vs. 0.61 and
0.66 vs. 0.60 for one-year and two-year inflammatory disease activity,
respectively). Finally, our proposed method enjoys inherent explainability by
assigning an importance score to each lesion for the overall prediction. Code

<p class="mathjax">A machine learning approach is presented to accelerate the computation of
block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed
self-assembly and materials design in micro-electronics, battery materials, and
membranes.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce region-customizable sound extraction (ReZero), a general and
flexible framework for the multi-channel region-wise sound extraction (R-SE)
task. R-SE task aims at extracting all active target sounds (e.g., human
speech) within a specific, user-defined spatial region, which is different from
conventional and existing tasks where a blind separation or a fixed, predefined
spatial region are typically assumed. The spatial region can be defined as an
angular window, a sphere, a cone, or other geometric patterns. Being a solution
to the R-SE task, the proposed ReZero framework includes (1) definitions of
different types of spatial regions, (2) methods for region feature extraction
and aggregation, and (3) a multi-channel extension of the band-split RNN
(BSRNN) model specified for the R-SE task. We design experiments for different
microphone array geometries, different types of spatial regions, and
comprehensive ablation studies on different system configurations. Experimental
results on both simulated and real-recorded data demonstrate the effectiveness
of ReZero. Demos are available at https://innerselfm.github.io/rezero/.
