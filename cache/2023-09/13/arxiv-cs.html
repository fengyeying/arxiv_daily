<p class="mathjax">In recent times, significant advancements have been witnessed in the field of
language models, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models
(LLMs) that are trained on vast amounts of data extracted from internet
archives. These LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have become widely accessible, allowing
users to generate text for various purposes including articles, essays, jokes,
and poetry. Given that LLMs are trained on a diverse range of text sources,
encompassing platforms like Reddit and Twitter, it is foreseeable that future
training datasets will also incorporate text generated by previous iterations
of the models themselves. In light of this development, our research aims to
investigate the influence of artificial text in the pre-training phase of
language models. Specifically, we conducted a comparative analysis between a
language model, RoBERTa, pre-trained using CNN/DailyMail news articles, and
ChatGPT, which employed the same articles for its training and evaluated their
performance on three downstream tasks as well as their potential gender bias,
using sentiment analysis as a metric. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate that the utilization of artificial text during pre-training does
not have a significant impact on either the performance of the models in
downstream tasks or their gender bias. In conclusion, our findings suggest that
the inclusion of text generated by LLMs in their own pre-training process does
not yield substantial effects on the subsequent performance of the models in
downstream tasks or their potential gender bias.

<p class="mathjax">Static site generation (SSG) is a common technique in the web development
space to create performant websites that are easy to host. Numerous SSG tools
exist, and the approach has been complemented by newer approaches, such as
Jamstack, that extend its usability. Edge computing represents a new option to
extend the usefulness of SSG further by allowing the creation of dynamic sites
on top of a static backdrop, providing dynamic resources close to the user. In
this paper, we explore the impact of the recent developments in the edge
computing space and consider its implications for SSG.

<p class="mathjax">A third of greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the food sector. A
shift in dietary habits could reduce these by half. Engaging and empowering
consumers is vital to this critical shift; yet, if we get the framing wrong, we
might cause distress or eco-anxiety, impeding initial engagement as well as
longer-term diet change. Evoking joy is a powerful yet under-explored motivator
to overcome psychological barriers and support pro-environmental attitudes.
This pictorial presents the outcomes of a one-day workshop as a series of
speculative ideas in the form of an annotated portfolio, highlighting design
qualities and interaction mechanisms that afford joy and sustainability in food
choices. Our contribution will inspire HCI researchers and designers to
reposition joy as a fundamental value to sustainability communication

<p class="mathjax">The increasing availability of large clinical datasets collected from
patients can enable new avenues for computational characterization of complex
diseases using different analytic algorithms. One of the promising new methods
for extracting knowledge from large clinical datasets involves temporal pattern
mining integrated with machine learning workflows. However, mining these
temporal patterns is a computational intensive task and has memory
repercussions. Current algorithms, such as the temporal sequence pattern mining
(tSPM) algorithm, are already providing promising outcomes, but still leave
room for optimization. In this paper, we present the tSPM+ algorithm, a
high-performance implementation of the tSPM algorithm, which adds a new
dimension by adding the duration to the temporal patterns. We show that the
tSPM+ algorithm provides a speed up to factor 980 and a up to 48 fold
improvement in memory consumption. Moreover, we present a docker container with
an R-package, We also provide vignettes for an easy integration into already
existing machine learning workflows and use the mined temporal sequences to
identify Post COVID-19 patients and their symptoms according to the WHO
definition.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancements in machine learning have motivated researchers to
generate classification models dealing with hundreds of classes such as in the
case of image datasets. However, visualization of classification models with
high number of classes and inter-model comparison in such classification
problems are two areas that have not received much attention in the literature,
despite the ever-increasing use of classification models to address problems
with very large class categories. In this paper, we present our interactive
visual analytics tool, called Circles, that allows a visual inter-model
comparison of numerous classification models with 1K classes in one view. To
mitigate the tricky issue of visual clutter, we chose concentric a radial line
layout for our inter-model comparison task. Our prototype shows the results of
9 models with 1K classes

<p class="mathjax">Effectively medication recommendation with complex multimorbidity conditions
is a critical task in healthcare. Most existing works predicted medications
based on longitudinal records, which assumed the information transmitted
patterns of learning longitudinal sequence data are stable and intra-visit
medical events are serialized. However, the following conditions may have been
ignored: 1) A more compact encoder for intra-relationship in the intra-visit
medical event is urgent; 2) Strategies for learning accurate representations of
the variable longitudinal sequences of patients are different. In this paper,
we proposed a novel Sample-adaptive Hierarchical medicAtion Prediction nEtwork,
termed SHAPE, to tackle the above challenges in the medication recommendation
task. Specifically, we design a compact intra-visit set encoder to encode the
relationship in the medical event for obtaining visit-level representation and
then develop an inter-visit longitudinal encoder to learn the patient-level
longitudinal representation efficiently. To endow the model with the capability
of modeling the variable visit length, we introduce a soft curriculum learning
method to assign the difficulty of each sample automatically by the visit
length. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset verify the superiority of
our model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies propose enhancing machine learning models by aligning the
geometric characteristics of the latent space with the underlying data
structure. Instead of relying solely on Euclidean space, researchers have
suggested using hyperbolic and spherical spaces with constant curvature, or
their combinations (known as product manifolds), to improve model performance.
However, there exists no principled technique to determine the best latent
product manifold signature, which refers to the choice and dimensionality of
manifold components. To address this, we introduce a novel notion of distance
between candidate latent geometries using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from
metric geometry. We propose using a graph search space that uses the estimated
Gromov-Hausdorff distances to search for the optimal latent geometry. In this
work we focus on providing a description of an algorithm to compute the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance between model spaces and its computational
implementation.

<p class="mathjax">While enjoying the great achievements brought by deep learning (DL), people
are also worried about the decision made by DL models, since the high degree of
non-linearity of DL models makes the decision extremely difficult to
understand. Consequently, attacks such as adversarial attacks are easy to carry
out, but difficult to detect and explain, which has led to a boom in the
research on local explanation methods for explaining model decisions. In this
paper, we evaluate the faithfulness of explanation methods and find that
traditional tests on faithfulness encounter the random dominance problem, \ie,
the random selection performs the best, especially for complex data. To further
solve this problem, we propose three trend-based faithfulness tests and
empirically demonstrate that the new trend tests can better assess faithfulness
than traditional tests on image, natural language and security tasks. We
implement the assessment system and evaluate ten popular explanation methods.
Benefiting from the trend tests, we successfully assess the explanation methods
on complex data for the first time, bringing unprecedented discoveries and
inspiring future research. Downstream tasks also greatly benefit from the
tests. For example, model debugging equipped with faithful explanation methods
performs much better for detecting and correcting accuracy and security
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Chatbots, the common moniker for collaborative assistants, are Artificial
Intelligence (AI) software that enables people to naturally interact with them
to get tasks done. Although chatbots have been studied since the dawn of AI,
they have particularly caught the imagination of the public and businesses
since the launch of easy-to-use and general-purpose Large Language Model-based
chatbots like ChatGPT. As businesses look towards chatbots as a potential
technology to engage users, who may be end customers, suppliers, or even their
own employees, proper testing of chatbots is important to address and mitigate
issues of trust related to service or product performance, user satisfaction
and long-term unintended consequences for society. This paper reviews current
practices for chatbot testing, identifies gaps as open problems in pursuit of
user trust, and outlines a path forward.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of identifying authorship by posing it as a knowledge
graph construction and refinement. To this effect, we model this problem as
learning a probabilistic logic model in the presence of human guidance
(knowledge-based learning). Specifically, we learn relational regression trees
using functional gradient boosting that outputs explainable rules. To
incorporate human knowledge, advice in the form of first-order clauses is
injected to refine the trees. We demonstrate the usefulness of human knowledge
both quantitatively and qualitatively in seven authorship domains.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in data science, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence, such as the emergence of large language models, are leading to an
increasing demand for data that can be processed by such models. While data
sources are application-specific, and it is impossible to produce an exhaustive
list of such data sources, it seems that a comprehensive, rather than complete,
list would still benefit data scientists and machine learning experts of all
levels of seniority. The goal of this publication is to provide just such an
(inevitably incomplete) list -- or compendium -- of data sources across
multiple areas of applications, including finance and economics, legal (laws
and regulations), life sciences (medicine and drug discovery), news sentiment
and social media, retail and ecommerce, satellite imagery, and shipping and
logistics, and sports.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. Existing
mainstream research and continuoual learning-based methods all require training
on complete datasets, leading to poor prediction accuracy when sudden changes
in scenarios occur and failing to promptly respond and update the model.
Whether these methods can make a prediction in real-time and use data instances
to update the model immediately(i.e., online learning settings) remains a
question. The problem of gradient explosion or vanishing caused by data
instance streams also needs to be addressed. Inspired by Hedge Propagation
algorithm, we propose Expert Attention Network, a complete online learning
framework for trajectory prediction. We introduce expert attention, which
adjusts the weights of different depths of network layers, avoiding the model
updated slowly due to gradient problem and enabling fast learning of new
scenario's knowledge to restore prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a
short-term motion trend kernel function which is sensitive to scenario change,
allowing the model to respond quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first attempt to address the online learning problem in trajectory
prediction. The experimental results indicate that traditional methods suffer
from gradient problems and that our method can quickly reduce prediction errors
and reach the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Radar sensors offer power-efficient solutions for always-on smart devices,
but processing the data streams on resource-constrained embedded platforms
remains challenging. This paper presents novel techniques that leverage the
temporal correlation present in streaming radar data to enhance the efficiency
of Early Exit Neural Networks for Deep Learning inference on embedded devices.
These networks add additional classifier branches between the architecture's
hidden layers that allow for an early termination of the inference if their
result is deemed sufficient enough by an at-runtime decision mechanism. Our
methods enable more informed decisions on when to terminate the inference,
reducing computational costs while maintaining a minimal loss of accuracy.
<br />Our results demonstrate that our techniques save up to 26% of operations per
inference over a Single Exit Network and 12% over a confidence-based Early Exit
version. Our proposed techniques work on commodity hardware and can be combined
with traditional optimizations, making them accessible for resource-constrained
embedded platforms commonly used in smart devices. Such efficiency gains enable
real-time radar data processing on resource-constrained platforms, allowing for
new applications in the context of smart homes, Internet-of-Things, and
human-computer interaction.

<p class="mathjax">With the advances in machine learning, there is a growing interest in
AI-enabled tools for autocompleting source code. GitHub Copilot has been
trained on billions of lines of open source GitHub code, and is one of such
tools that has been increasingly used since its launch in June 2021. However,
little effort has been devoted to understanding the practices, challenges, and
expected features of using Copilot in programming for auto-completed source
code from the point of view of practitioners. To this end, we conducted an
empirical study by collecting and analyzing the data from Stack Overflow (SO)
and GitHub Discussions. We searched and manually collected 303 SO posts and 927
GitHub discussions related to the usage of Copilot. We identified the
programming languages, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), technologies
used with Copilot, functions implemented, benefits, limitations, and challenges
when using Copilot. The results show that when practitioners use Copilot: (1)
The major programming languages used with Copilot are JavaScript and Python,
(2) the main IDE used with Copilot is Visual Studio Code, (3) the most common
used technology with Copilot is Node.js, (4) the leading function implemented
by Copilot is data processing, (5) the main purpose of users using Copilot is
to help generate code, (6) the significant benefit of using Copilot is useful
code generation, (7) the main limitation encountered by practitioners when
using Copilot is difficulty of integration, and (8) the most common expected
feature is that Copilot can be integrated with more IDEs. Our results suggest
that using Copilot is like a double-edged sword, which requires developers to
carefully consider various aspects when deciding whether or not to use it. Our
study provides empirically grounded foundations that could inform developers
and practitioners, as well as provide a basis for future investigations.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we use large language models (LLMs) to augment and accelerate
research on the P versus NP problem, one of the most important open problems in
theoretical computer science and mathematics. Specifically, we propose Socratic
reasoning, a general framework that promotes in-depth thinking with LLMs for
complex problem-solving. Socratic reasoning encourages LLMs to recursively
discover, solve, and integrate problems while facilitating self-evaluation and
refinement. Our pilot study on the P vs. NP problem shows that GPT-4
successfully produces a proof schema and engages in rigorous reasoning
throughout 97 dialogue turns, concluding "P $\neq$ NP", which is in alignment
with (Xu and Zhou, 2023). The investigation uncovers novel insights within the
extensive solution space of LLMs, shedding light on LLM for Science.

<p class="mathjax">Data visualization can be defined as the visual communication of information.
One important barometer for the success of a visualization is whether the
intents of the communicator(s) are faithfully conveyed. The processes of
constructing and displaying visualizations have been widely studied by our
community. However, due to the lack of consistency in this literature, there is
a growing acknowledgment of a need for frameworks and methodologies for
classifying and formalizing the communicative component of visualization. This
work focuses on intent and introduces how this concept in communicative
visualization mirrors concepts in linguistics. We construct a mapping between
the two spaces that enables us to leverage relevant frameworks to apply to
visualization. We describe this translation as using the philosophy of language
as a base for explaining communication in visualization. Furthermore, we
illustrate the benefits and point out several prospective research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Hardware Reverse Engineering (HRE) is a technique for analyzing Integrated
Circuits (ICs). Experts employ HRE for various security-critical tasks, such as
design verification or the detection of intellectual property violations.
However, HRE also enables threat actors to subvert the security of an IC.
Previous studies have shown that analysts rely heavily on their cognitive
abilities to perform HRE as no fully automated solutions exist. Therefore,
conducting controlled experimental studies to assess the cognitive processes
involved in HRE could open new avenues for hardware protection. However,
researchers have faced the methodological challenge that HRE experts are
largely unavailable for such empirical research. To address this scarcity, we
have developed REVERSIM, a game-based simulation that mimics realistic HRE
subprocesses and is specifically designed to require no prior knowledge. To
support these claims, we conducted two empirical studies: First, we performed
semi-structured interviews with 14 professionals and researchers from the HRE
domain, who attested to the comparability of REVERSIM to real-world HRE
problems. Second, we conducted a user study involving 89 non-expert
participants, demonstrating that participants could engage in the simulation
without prior knowledge in HRE or related domains. Finally, we outline several
research directions for experiments with REVERSIM, highlighting its potential
in advancing HRE research.

<p class="mathjax">We develop a novel method of virtual sources to formulate boundary integral
equations for exterior wave propagation problems. However, by contrast to
classical boundary integral formulations, we displace the singularity of the
Green's function by a small distance $h&gt;0$. As a result, the discretization can
be performed on the actual physical boundary with continuous kernels so that
any naive quadrature scheme can be used to approximate integral operators.
Using on-surface radiation conditions, we combine single- and double-layer
potential representations of the solution to arrive at a well-conditioned
system upon discretization. The virtual displacement parameter $h$ controls the
conditioning of the discrete system. We provide mathematical guidance to choose
$h$, in terms of the wavelength and mesh refinements, in order to strike a
balance between accuracy and stability. Proof-of-concept implementations are
presented, including piecewise linear and isogeometric element formulations in
two- and three-dimensional settings. We observe exceptionally well-behaved
spectra, and solve the corresponding systems using matrix-free GMRES
iterations. The results are compared to analytical solutions for canonical
problems. We conclude that the proposed method leads to accurate solutions and
good stability for a wide range of wavelengths and mesh refinements.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world systems are often characterized by high-dimensional nonlinear
dynamics, making them challenging to control in real time. While reduced-order
models (ROMs) are frequently employed in model-based control schemes,
dimensionality reduction introduces model uncertainty which can potentially
compromise the stability and safety of the original high-dimensional system. In
this work, we propose a novel reduced-order model predictive control (ROMPC)
scheme to solve constrained optimal control problems for nonlinear,
high-dimensional systems. To address the challenges of using ROMs in predictive
control schemes, we derive an error bounding system that dynamically accounts
for model reduction error. Using these bounds, we design a robust MPC scheme
that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and
asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method
in simulations on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states.

<p class="mathjax">The objective of this investigation is to evaluate and contrast the
effectiveness of four state-of-the-art pre-trained models, ResNet-34, VGG-19,
DenseNet-121, and Inception V3, in classifying traffic and road signs with the
utilization of the GTSRB public dataset. The study focuses on evaluating the
accuracy of these models' predictions as well as their ability to employ
appropriate features for image categorization. To gain insights into the
strengths and limitations of the model's predictions, the study employs the

<p class="mathjax">Metric learning aims at finding a suitable distance metric over the input

high-dimensional settings, metric learning can also play the role of
dimensionality reduction, by imposing a low-rank restriction to the learnt
metric. In this paper, instead of training a low-rank metric on
high-dimensional data, we consider a randomly compressed version of the data,
and train a full-rank metric there. We give theoretical guarantees on the error
of distance-based metric learning, with respect to the random compression,
which do not depend on the ambient dimension. Our bounds do not make any
explicit assumptions, aside from i.i.d. data from a bounded support, and
automatically tighten when benign geometrical structures are present.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets support our
theoretical findings in high-dimensional settings.

<p class="mathjax">The field of visual document understanding has witnessed a rapid growth in
emerging challenges and powerful multi-modal strategies. However, they rely on
an extensive amount of document data to learn their pretext objectives in a
``pre-train-then-fine-tune'' paradigm and thus, suffer a significant
performance drop in real-world online industrial settings. One major reason is
the over-reliance on OCR engines to extract local positional information within
a document page. Therefore, this hinders the model's generalizability,
flexibility and robustness due to the lack of capturing global information
within a document image. We introduce TransferDoc, a cross-modal
transformer-based architecture pre-trained in a self-supervised fashion using
three novel pretext objectives. TransferDoc learns richer semantic concepts by
unifying language and visual representations, which enables the production of
more transferable models. Besides, two novel downstream tasks have been
introduced for a ``closer-to-real'' industrial evaluation scenario where
TransferDoc outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-Language models jointly learn multimodal text and audio representations
that enable Zero-Shot inference. Models rely on the encoders to create powerful
representations of the input and generalize to multiple tasks ranging from
sounds, music, and speech. Although models have achieved remarkable
performance, there is still a performance gap with task-specific models. In
this paper, we propose a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining model that is
pretrained with a diverse collection of 4.6M audio-text pairs employing two
innovative encoders for Zero-Shot inference. To learn audio representations, we
trained an audio encoder on 22 audio tasks, instead of the standard training of
sound event classification. To learn language representations, we trained an
autoregressive decoder-only model instead of the standard encoder-only models.
Then, the audio and language representations are brought into a joint
multimodal space using Contrastive Learning. We used our encoders to improve
the downstream performance by a margin. We extensively evaluated the
generalization of our representations on 26 downstream tasks, the largest in
the literature. Our model achieves state of the art results in several tasks
leading the way towards general-purpose audio representations.

fall detection, indoor localization, and activity recognition in assisted
living spaces. We propose a novel, sample-efficient approach to find a
high-quality sensor placement in an arbitrary indoor space based on grey-box
Bayesian optimization and simulation-based evaluation. Our key technical
contribution lies in capturing domain-specific knowledge about the spatial
distribution of activities and incorporating it into the iterative selection of
query points in Bayesian optimization. Considering two simulated indoor
environments and a real-world dataset containing human activities and sensor
triggers, we show that our proposed method performs better compared to
state-of-the-art black-box optimization techniques in identifying high-quality
sensor placements, leading to accurate activity recognition in terms of
F1-score, while also requiring a significantly lower (51.3% on average) number
of expensive function queries.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces Stringesthesia, an interactive and improvised
performance paradigm. Stringesthesia uses real-time neuroimaging to connect
performers and audiences, enabling direct access to the performers mental state
and determining audience participation during the performance. Functional
near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS, a noninvasive neuroimaging tool, was used
to assess metabolic activity of brain areas collectively associated with a
metric we call trust. A visualization representing the real-time measurement of
the performers level of trust was projected behind the performer and used to
dynamically restrict or promote audience participation. Throughout the paper we
discuss prior work that heavily influenced our design, conceptual and

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled
autonomous systems to perceive and comprehend objects and their environments in
a perceptual subsymbolic manner. These systems can now perform object
detection, sensor data fusion, and language understanding tasks. However, there
is a growing need to enhance these systems to understand objects and their
environments more conceptually and symbolically. It is essential to consider
both the explicit teaching provided by humans (e.g., describing a situation or
explaining how to act) and the implicit teaching obtained by observing human
behavior (e.g., through the system's sensors) to achieve this level of powerful
artificial intelligence. Thus, the system must be designed with multimodal
input and output capabilities to support implicit and explicit interaction
models. In this position paper, we argue for considering both types of inputs,
as well as human-in-the-loop and incremental learning techniques, for advancing
the field of artificial intelligence and enabling autonomous systems to learn
like humans. We propose several hypotheses and design guidelines and highlight
a use case from related work to achieve this goal.

<p class="mathjax">millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (THz) communications have the
potential of increasing mobile network throughput drastically. However, the
challenging propagation conditions experienced at mmWave and beyond frequencies
can potentially limit the range of the wireless link down to a few meters,
compared to up to kilometers for sub-6GHz links. Thus, increasing the density
of base station deployments is required to achieve sufficient coverage in the
Radio Access Network (RAN). To such end, 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) introduced wireless backhauled base stations with Integrated Access and
Backhaul (IAB), a key technology to achieve dense networks while preventing the
need for costly fiber deployments. In this paper, we introduce SeBaSi, a
system-level simulator for IAB networks, and demonstrate its functionality by
simulating IAB deployments in Manhattan, New York City and Padova. Finally, we
show how SeBaSi can represent a useful tool for the performance evaluation of
self-backhauled cellular networks, thanks to its high level of network
abstraction, coupled with its open and customizable design, which allows users
to extend it to support novel technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RISs)

<p class="mathjax">The development of tactile sensing is expected to enhance robotic systems in
handling complex objects like deformables or reflective materials. However,
readily available industrial grippers generally lack tactile feedback, which
has led researchers to develop their own tactile sensors, resulting in a wide
range of sensor hardware. Reading data from these sensors poses an integration
challenge: either external wires must be routed along the robotic arm, or a
wireless processing unit has to be fixed to the robot, increasing its size. We
have developed a microcontroller-based sensor readout solution that seamlessly
integrates with Robotiq grippers. Our Arduino compatible design takes away a
major part of the integration complexity of tactile sensors and can serve as a
valuable accelerator of research in the field. Design files and installation
instructions can be found at https://github.com/RemkoPr/airo-halberd.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized text-to-image generation has emerged as a powerful and
sought-after tool, empowering users to create customized images based on their
specific concepts and prompts. However, existing approaches to personalization
encounter multiple challenges, including long tuning times, large storage
requirements, the necessity for multiple input images per identity, and
limitations in preserving identity and editability. To address these obstacles,
we present PhotoVerse, an innovative methodology that incorporates a
dual-branch conditioning mechanism in both text and image domains, providing
effective control over the image generation process. Furthermore, we introduce
facial identity loss as a novel component to enhance the preservation of
identity during training. Remarkably, our proposed PhotoVerse eliminates the
need for test time tuning and relies solely on a single facial photo of the
target identity, significantly reducing the resource cost associated with image
generation. After a single training phase, our approach enables generating
high-quality images within only a few seconds. Moreover, our method can produce
diverse images that encompass various scenes and styles. The extensive
evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of our approach, which
achieves the dual objectives of preserving identity and facilitating
editability. Project page: https://photoverse2d.github.io/

<p class="mathjax">Hypergraphs can naturally model group-wise relations (e.g., a group of users
who co-purchase an item) as hyperedges. Hyperedge prediction is to predict
future or unobserved hyperedges, which is a fundamental task in many real-world
applications (e.g., group recommendation). Despite the recent breakthrough of
hyperedge prediction methods, the following challenges have been rarely
studied: (C1) How to aggregate the nodes in each hyperedge candidate for
accurate hyperedge prediction? and (C2) How to mitigate the inherent data
sparsity problem in hyperedge prediction? To tackle both challenges together,
in this paper, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction framework (CASH) that
employs (1) context-aware node aggregation to precisely capture complex
relations among nodes in each hyperedge for (C1) and (2) self-supervised
contrastive learning in the context of hyperedge prediction to enhance
hypergraph representations for (C2). Furthermore, as for (C2), we propose a
hyperedge-aware augmentation method to fully exploit the latent semantics
behind the original hypergraph and consider both node-level and group-level
contrasts (i.e., dual contrasts) for better node and hyperedge representations.
Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that CASH
consistently outperforms all competing methods in terms of the accuracy in
hyperedge prediction and each of the proposed strategies is effective in
improving the model accuracy of CASH. For the detailed information of CASH, we
provide the code and datasets at: https://github.com/yy-ko/cash.

<p class="mathjax">A crucial design decision for any robot learning pipeline is the choice of
policy representation: what type of model should be used to generate the next
set of robot actions? Owing to the inherent multi-modal nature of many robotic
tasks, combined with the recent successes in generative modeling, researchers
have turned to state-of-the-art probabilistic models such as diffusion models
for policy representation. In this work, we revisit the choice of energy-based
models (EBM) as a policy class. We show that the prevailing folklore -- that
energy models in high dimensional continuous spaces are impractical to train --
is false. We develop a practical training objective and algorithm for energy
models which combines several key ingredients: (i) ranking noise contrastive
estimation (R-NCE), (ii) learnable negative samplers, and (iii) non-adversarial
joint training. We prove that our proposed objective function is asymptotically
consistent and quantify its limiting variance. On the other hand, we show that
the Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC) objective is actually biased even at the
population level, providing a mathematical explanation for the poor performance
of IBC trained energy policies in several independent follow-up works. We
further extend our algorithm to learn a continuous stochastic process that
bridges noise and data, modeling this process with a family of EBMs indexed by
scale variable. In doing so, we demonstrate that the core idea behind recent
progress in generative modeling is actually compatible with EBMs. Altogether,
our proposed training algorithms enable us to train energy-based models as
policies which compete with -- and even outperform -- diffusion models and
other state-of-the-art approaches in several challenging multi-modal
benchmarks: obstacle avoidance path planning and contact-rich block pushing.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past two decades, dialogue modeling has made significant strides,
moving from simple rule-based responses to personalized and persuasive response
generation. However, despite these advancements, the objective functions and
evaluation metrics for dialogue generation have remained stagnant, i.e.,
cross-entropy and BLEU, respectively. These lexical-based metrics have the
following key limitations: (a) word-to-word matching without semantic
consideration: It assigns the same credit for failure to generate 'nice' and
'rice' for 'good'. (b) missing context attribute for evaluating the generated
response: Even if a generated response is relevant to the ongoing dialogue
context, it may still be penalized for not matching the gold utterance provided
in the corpus. In this paper, we first investigate these limitations
comprehensively and propose a new loss function called Semantic Infused
Contextualized diaLogue (SemTextualLogue) loss function. Furthermore, we
formulate a new evaluation metric called Dialuation, which incorporates both
context relevance and semantic appropriateness while evaluating a generated
response. We conducted experiments on two benchmark dialogue corpora,
encompassing both task-oriented and open-domain scenarios. We found that the
dialogue generation model trained with SemTextualLogue loss attained superior
performance (in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation) compared to the
traditional cross-entropy loss function across the datasets and evaluation
metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Online machine learning (ML) is often used in self-adaptive systems to
strengthen the adaptation mechanism and improve the system utility. Despite
such benefits, applying online ML for self-adaptation can be challenging, and
not many papers report its limitations. Recently, we experimented with applying
online ML for self-adaptation of a smart farming scenario and we had faced
several unexpected difficulties -- traps -- that, to our knowledge, are not
discussed enough in the community. In this paper, we report our experience with
these traps. Specifically, we discuss several traps that relate to the
specification and online training of the ML-based estimators, their impact on
self-adaptation, and the approach used to evaluate the estimators. Our overview
of these traps provides a list of lessons learned, which can serve as guidance
for other researchers and practitioners when applying online ML for
self-adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly proposed as models of human
vision, bolstered by their impressive performance on image classification and
object recognition tasks. Yet, the extent to which DNNs capture fundamental
aspects of human vision such as color perception remains unclear. Here, we
develop novel experiments for evaluating the perceptual coherence of color
embeddings in DNNs, and we assess how well these algorithms predict human color
similarity judgments collected via an online survey. We find that
state-of-the-art DNN architectures $-$ including convolutional neural networks
and vision transformers $-$ provide color similarity judgments that strikingly
diverge from human color judgments of (i) images with controlled color
properties, (ii) images generated from online searches, and (iii) real-world
images from the canonical CIFAR-10 dataset. We compare DNN performance against
an interpretable and cognitively plausible model of color perception based on
wavelet decomposition, inspired by foundational theories in computational
neuroscience. While one deep learning model $-$ a convolutional DNN trained on
a style transfer task $-$ captures some aspects of human color perception, our
wavelet algorithm provides more coherent color embeddings that better predict
human color judgments compared to all DNNs we examine. These results hold when
altering the high-level visual task used to train similar DNN architectures
(e.g., image classification versus image segmentation), as well as when
examining the color embeddings of different layers in a given DNN architecture.
These findings break new ground in the effort to analyze the perceptual
representations of machine learning algorithms and to improve their ability to
serve as cognitively plausible models of human vision. Implications for machine
learning, human perception, and embodied cognition are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">We present SHIFT3D, a differentiable pipeline for generating 3D shapes that
are structurally plausible yet challenging to 3D object detectors. In
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, discovering such novel
challenging objects can offer insight into unknown vulnerabilities of 3D
detectors. By representing objects with a signed distanced function (SDF), we
show that gradient error signals allow us to smoothly deform the shape or pose
of a 3D object in order to confuse a downstream 3D detector. Importantly, the
objects generated by SHIFT3D physically differ from the baseline object yet
retain a semantically recognizable shape. Our approach provides interpretable
failure modes for modern 3D object detectors, and can aid in preemptive
discovery of potential safety risks within 3D perception systems before these
risks become critical failures.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless communications in the terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz) is a
promising and key wireless technology enabling ultra-high data rate
communication over multi-gigahertz-wide bandwidths, thus fulfilling the demand
for denser networks. The complex propagation environment at such high
frequencies introduces several challenges, such as high spreading and molecular
absorption losses. As such, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been
proposed as a promising solution to enable communication in the presence of
blockage or to aid a resource-limited quasi-omnidirectional transmitter direct
its radiated power. In this paper, we present a metallic reflectarray design
achieving static controlled non-specular reflection at true THz frequencies
(i.e., 1-1.05 THz). We conduct extensive experiments to further characterize
and validate its working principle using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
(THz-TDS) and demonstrate its effectiveness with information-carrying signals
using a continuous wave (CW) THz testbed. Our results show that the
reflectarray can help facilitate robust communication links over non-specular
paths and improve the reliability of THz communications, thereby unleashing the
true potential of the THz band.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a one-dimensional nonlocal hyperbolic model introduced to
describe the formation and movement of self-organizing collectives of animals
in homogeneous 1D environments. Previous research has shown that this model
exhibits a large number of complex spatial and spatiotemporal aggregation
patterns, as evidenced by numerical simulations and weakly nonlinear analysis.
In this study, we focus on a particular type of localised patterns with
odd/even/no symmetries (which are usually part of snaking solution branches
with different symmetries that form complex bifurcation structures called
snake-and-ladder bifurcations). To numerically investigate the bifurcating
solution branches (to eventually construct the full bifurcating structures), we
first need to understand the numerical issues that could appear when using
different numerical schemes. To this end, in this study, we consider ten
different numerical schemes (the upwind scheme, the MacCormack scheme, the
Fractional-Step method, and the Quasi-Steady Wave-Propagation algorithm,
combining them with high-resolution methods), while paying attention to the
preservation of the solution symmetries with all these schemes. We show several
numerical issues: first, we observe the presence of two distinct types of
numerical solutions (with different symmetries) that exhibit very small errors;
second, in some cases, none of the investigated numerical schemes converge,
posing a challenge for the development of numerical continuation algorithms for
nonlocal hyperbolic systems; lastly, the choice of the numerical schemes, as
well as their corresponding parameters such as time-space steps, exert a
significant influence on the type and symmetry of bifurcating solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Rice is considered a strategic crop in Egypt as it is regularly consumed in
the Egyptian people's diet. Even though Egypt is the highest rice producer in
Africa with a share of 6 million tons per year, it still imports rice to
satisfy its local needs due to production loss, especially due to rice disease.
Rice blast disease is responsible for 30% loss in rice production worldwide.
Therefore, it is crucial to target limiting yield damage by detecting rice
crops diseases in its early stages. This paper introduces a public
multispectral and RGB images dataset and a deep learning pipeline for rice
plant disease detection using multi-modal data. The collected multispectral
images consist of Red, Green and Near-Infrared channels and we show that using
multispectral along with RGB channels as input archives a higher F1 accuracy

capability to use machine-learning and optimization heuristics in establishing
and reconfiguration of autonomic component ensembles. We show how to capture
these concepts on the model level and give an example of how such a model can
be beneficially used for modeling access-control related problem in the

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a crucial approach in deep learning
as a way to address the challenge of limited labeled data. The success of deep
neural networks heavily relies on the availability of large-scale high-quality
labeled data. However, the process of data labeling is time-consuming and
unscalable, leading to shortages in labeled data. SSL aims to tackle this
problem by leveraging additional unlabeled data in the training process. One of
the popular SSL algorithms, FixMatch, trains identical weight-sharing teacher
and student networks simultaneously using a siamese neural network (SNN).
However, it is prone to performance degradation when the pseudo labels are
heavily noisy in the early training stage. We present KD-FixMatch, a novel SSL
algorithm that addresses the limitations of FixMatch by incorporating knowledge
distillation. The algorithm utilizes a combination of sequential and
simultaneous training of SNNs to enhance performance and reduce performance
degradation. Firstly, an outer SNN is trained using labeled and unlabeled data.
After that, the network of the well-trained outer SNN generates pseudo labels
for the unlabeled data, from which a subset of unlabeled data with trusted
pseudo labels is then carefully created through high-confidence sampling and
deep embedding clustering. Finally, an inner SNN is trained with the labeled
data, the unlabeled data, and the subset of unlabeled data with trusted pseudo
labels. Experiments on four public data sets demonstrate that KD-FixMatch
outperforms FixMatch in all cases. Our results indicate that KD-FixMatch has a
better training starting point that leads to improved model performance
compared to FixMatch.

<p class="mathjax">Precipitation nowcasting (up to a few hours) remains a challenge due to the
highly complex local interactions that need to be captured accurately.
Convolutional Neural Networks rely on convolutional kernels convolving with
grid data and the extracted features are trapped by limited receptive field,
typically expressed in excessively smooth output compared to ground truth. Thus
they lack the capacity to model complex spatial relationships among the grids.
Geometric deep learning aims to generalize neural network models to
non-Euclidean domains. Such models are more flexible in defining nodes and
edges and can effectively capture dynamic spatial relationship among
geographical grids. Motivated by this, we explore a geometric deep
learning-based temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for precipitation
nowcasting. The adjacency matrix that simulates the interactions among grid
cells is learned automatically by minimizing the L1 loss between prediction and
ground truth pixel value during the training procedure. Then, the spatial
relationship is refined by GCN layers while the temporal information is
extracted by 1D convolution with various kernel lengths. The neighboring
information is fed as auxiliary input layers to improve the final result. We
test the model on sequences of radar reflectivity maps over the Trento/Italy
area. The results show that GCNs improves the effectiveness of modeling the
local details of the cloud profile as well as the prediction accuracy by
achieving decreased error measures.

<p class="mathjax">The introduction of robust backbones, such as Vision Transformers, has
improved the performance of object tracking algorithms in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art trackers are computationally expensive since
they have a large number of model parameters and rely on specialized hardware
(e.g., GPU) for faster inference. On the other hand, recent lightweight
trackers are fast but are less accurate, especially on large-scale datasets. We
propose a lightweight, accurate, and fast tracking algorithm using Mobile
Vision Transformers (MobileViT) as the backbone for the first time. We also
present a novel approach of fusing the template and search region
representations in the MobileViT backbone, thereby generating superior feature
encoding for target localization. The experimental results show that our
MobileViT-based Tracker, MVT, surpasses the performance of recent lightweight
trackers on the large-scale datasets GOT10k and TrackingNet, and with a high
inference speed. In addition, our method outperforms the popular DiMP-50
tracker despite having 4.7 times fewer model parameters and running at 2.8
times its speed on a GPU. The tracker code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">This work presents an instance-agnostic learning framework that fuses vision
with dynamics to simultaneously learn shape, pose trajectories and physical
properties via the use of geometry as a shared representation. Unlike many
contact learning approaches that assume motion capture input and a known shape
prior for the collision model, our proposed framework learns an object's
geometric and dynamic properties from RGBD video, without requiring either
category-level or instance-level shape priors. We integrate a vision system,
BundleSDF, with a dynamics system, ContactNets and propose a cyclic training
pipeline to use the output from the dynamics module to refine the poses and the
geometry from the vision module, using perspective reprojection. Experiments
demonstrate our framework's ability to learn the geometry and dynamics of rigid
and convex objects and improve upon the current tracking framework.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the transition to cloud-based platforms in the IT sector has
emphasized the significance of cloud incident root cause analysis to ensure
service reliability and maintain customer trust. Central to this process is the
efficient determination of root causes, a task made challenging due to the
complex nature of contemporary cloud infrastructures. Despite the proliferation
of AI-driven tools for root cause identification, their applicability remains
limited by the inconsistent quality of their outputs. This paper introduces a
method for enhancing confidence estimation in root cause analysis tools by
prompting retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs). This approach
operates in two phases. Initially, the model evaluates its confidence based on
historical incident data, considering its assessment of the evidence strength.
Subsequently, the model reviews the root cause generated by the predictor. An
optimization step then combines these evaluations to determine the final
confidence assignment. Experimental results illustrate that our method enables
the model to articulate its confidence effectively, providing a more calibrated
score. We address research questions evaluating the ability of our method to
produce calibrated confidence scores using LLMs, the impact of domain-specific
retrieved examples on confidence estimates, and its potential generalizability
across various root cause analysis models. Through this, we aim to bridge the
confidence estimation gap, aiding on-call engineers in decision-making and
bolstering the efficiency of cloud incident management.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive learning has achieved great success in skeleton-based action
recognition. However, most existing approaches encode the skeleton sequences as
entangled spatiotemporal representations and confine the contrasts to the same
level of representation. Instead, this paper introduces a novel contrastive
learning framework, namely Spatiotemporal Clues Disentanglement Network
(SCD-Net). Specifically, we integrate the decoupling module with a feature
extractor to derive explicit clues from spatial and temporal domains
respectively. As for the training of SCD-Net, with a constructed global anchor,
we encourage the interaction between the anchor and extracted clues. Further,
we propose a new masking strategy with structural constraints to strengthen the
contextual associations, leveraging the latest development from masked image
modelling into the proposed SCD-Net. We conduct extensive evaluations on the
NTU-RGB+D (60&amp;120) and PKU-MMD (I&amp;II) datasets, covering various downstream
tasks such as action recognition, action retrieval, transfer learning, and
semi-supervised learning. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches significantly.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen significant progress in the realm of robot autonomy,
accompanied by the expanding reach of robotic technologies. However, the
emergence of new deployment domains brings unprecedented challenges in ensuring
safe operation of these systems, which remains as crucial as ever. While
traditional model-based safe control methods struggle with generalizability and
scalability, emerging data-driven approaches tend to lack well-understood
guarantees, which can result in unpredictable catastrophic failures. Successful
deployment of the next generation of autonomous robots will require integrating
the strengths of both paradigms. This article provides a review of safety
filter approaches, highlighting important connections between existing
techniques and proposing a unified technical framework to understand, compare,
and combine them. The new unified view exposes a shared modular structure
across a range of seemingly disparate safety filter classes and naturally
suggests directions for future progress towards more scalable synthesis, robust
monitoring, and efficient intervention.

<p class="mathjax">Remote sensing image semantic segmentation is an important problem for remote
sensing image interpretation. Although remarkable progress has been achieved,
existing deep neural network methods suffer from the reliance on massive
training data. Few-shot remote sensing semantic segmentation aims at learning
to segment target objects from a query image using only a few annotated support
images of the target class. Most existing few-shot learning methods stem
primarily from their sole focus on extracting information from support images,
thereby failing to effectively address the large variance in appearance and
scales of geographic objects. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
Self-Correlation and Cross-Correlation Learning Network for the few-shot remote
sensing image semantic segmentation. Our model enhances the generalization by
considering both self-correlation and cross-correlation between support and
query images to make segmentation predictions. To further explore the
self-correlation with the query image, we propose to adopt a classical spectral
method to produce a class-agnostic segmentation mask based on the basic visual
information of the image. Extensive experiments on two remote sensing image
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model in few-shot
remote sensing image semantic segmentation. Code and models will be accessed at
https://github.com/linhanwang/SCCNe.

<p class="mathjax">The design dataset is the backbone of data-driven design. Ideally, the
dataset should be fairly distributed in both shape and property spaces to
efficiently explore the underlying relationship. However, the classical
experimental design focuses on shape diversity and thus yields biased
exploration in the property space. Recently developed methods either conduct
subset selection from a large dataset or employ assumptions with severe
limitations. In this paper, fairness- and uncertainty-aware data generation
(FairGen) is proposed to actively detect and generate missing properties
starting from a small dataset. At each iteration, its coverage module computes
the data coverage to guide the selection of the target properties. The
uncertainty module ensures that the generative model can make certain and thus
accurate shape predictions. Integrating the two modules, Bayesian optimization
determines the target properties, which are thereafter fed into the generative
model to predict the associated shapes. The new designs, whose properties are
analyzed by simulation, are added to the design dataset. An S-slot design
dataset case study was implemented to demonstrate the efficiency of FairGen in
auxetic structural design. Compared with grid and randomized sampling, FairGen
increased the coverage score at twice the speed and significantly expanded the
sampled region in the property space. As a result, the generative models
trained with FairGen-generated datasets showed consistent and significant
reductions in mean absolute errors.

<p class="mathjax">Health-related acoustic signals, such as cough and breathing sounds, are
relevant for medical diagnosis and continuous health monitoring. Most existing
machine learning approaches for health acoustics are trained and evaluated on
specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various healthcare
applications. In this paper, we leverage a self-supervised learning framework,
SimCLR with a Slowfast NFNet backbone, for contrastive learning of health
acoustics. A crucial aspect of optimizing Slowfast NFNet for this application
lies in identifying effective audio augmentations. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of various audio augmentation strategies and demonstrate that an
appropriate augmentation strategy enhances the performance of the Slowfast
NFNet audio encoder across a diverse set of health acoustic tasks. Our findings
reveal that when augmentations are combined, they can produce synergistic
effects that exceed the benefits seen when each is applied individually.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series (MTS) data collected from multiple sensors provide
the potential for accurate abnormal activity detection in smart healthcare
scenarios. However, anomalies exhibit diverse patterns and become unnoticeable
in MTS data. Consequently, achieving accurate anomaly detection is challenging
since we have to capture both temporal dependencies of time series and
inter-relationships among variables. To address this problem, we propose a
Residual-based Anomaly Detection approach, Rs-AD, for effective representation
learning and abnormal activity detection. We evaluate our scheme on a
real-world gait dataset and the experimental results demonstrate an F1 score of
0.839.

<p class="mathjax">The incredible capabilities of generative artificial intelligence models have
inevitably led to their application in the domain of drug discovery. It is
therefore of tremendous interest to develop methodologies that enhance the
abilities and applicability of these powerful tools. In this work, we present a
novel and efficient semi-supervised active learning methodology that allows for
the fine-tuning of a generative model with respect to an objective function by
strategically operating within a constructed representation of the sample
space. In the context of targeted molecular generation, we demonstrate the
ability to fine-tune a GPT-based molecular generator with respect to an
attractive interaction-based scoring function by strategically operating within
a chemical space proxy, thereby maximizing attractive interactions between the
generated molecules and a protein target. Importantly, our approach does not
require the individual evaluation of all data points that are used for
fine-tuning, enabling the incorporation of computationally expensive metrics.
We are hopeful that the inherent generality of this methodology ensures that it
will remain applicable as this exciting field evolves. To facilitate
implementation and reproducibility, we have made all of our software available
through the open-source ChemSpaceAL Python package.

<p class="mathjax">Social learning, a fundamental process through which individuals shape their
beliefs and perspectives via observation and interaction with others, is
critical for the development of our society and the functioning of social
governance. Prior works on social learning usually assume that the initial
beliefs are given and focus on the update rule. With the recent proliferation
of online social networks, there is an avalanche amount of information, which
may significantly influence users' initial beliefs. In this paper, we use the
rational inattention theory to model how agents acquire information to form
initial beliefs and assess its influence on their adjustments in beliefs.
Furthermore, we analyze the dynamic evolution of belief distribution among
agents. Simulations and social experiments are conducted to validate our
proposed model and analyze the impact of model parameters on belief dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">What makes waveform-based deep learning so hard? Despite numerous attempts at
training convolutional neural networks (convnets) for filterbank design, they
often fail to outperform hand-crafted baselines. This is all the more
surprising because these baselines are linear time-invariant systems: as such,
their transfer functions could be accurately represented by a convnet with a
large receptive field. In this article, we elaborate on the statistical
properties of simple convnets from the mathematical perspective of random
convolutional operators. We find that FIR filterbanks with random Gaussian
weights are ill-conditioned for large filters and locally periodic input
signals, which both are typical in audio signal processing applications.
Furthermore, we observe that expected energy preservation of a random
filterbank is not sufficient for numerical stability and derive theoretical
bounds for its expected frame bounds.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason
for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that
the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards
mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model
consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal
learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through
optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of
autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks,
uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the
generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass
optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised
few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context
learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel
self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves
optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to
improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling
experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an
important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

<p class="mathjax">Muscle forces and joint kinematics estimated with musculoskeletal (MSK)
modeling techniques offer useful metrics describing movement quality.
Model-based computational MSK models can interpret the dynamic interaction
between the neural drive to muscles, muscle dynamics, body and joint
kinematics, and kinetics. Still, such a set of solutions suffers from high
computational time and muscle recruitment problems, especially in complex
modeling. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising
alternative due to the benefits of flexibility and adaptability. However, a
large amount of labeled training data is not easy to be acquired. This paper
proposes a physics-informed deep learning method based on MSK modeling to
predict joint motion and muscle forces. The MSK model is embedded into the
neural network as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) loss function with
physiological parameters of muscle activation dynamics and muscle contraction
dynamics to be identified. These parameters are automatically estimated during
the training process which guides the prediction of muscle forces combined with
the MSK forward dynamics model. Experimental validations on two groups of data,
including one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset from six healthy
subjects, are performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep
learning method can effectively identify subject-specific MSK physiological
parameters and the trained physics-informed forward-dynamics surrogate yields
accurate motion and muscle forces predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Graph embedding has become an increasingly important technique for analyzing
graph-structured data. By representing nodes in a graph as vectors in a
low-dimensional space, graph embedding enables efficient graph processing and
analysis tasks like node classification, link prediction, and visualization. In
this paper, we propose a novel force-directed graph embedding method that
utilizes the steady acceleration kinetic formula to embed nodes in a way that
preserves graph topology and structural features. Our method simulates a set of
customized attractive and repulsive forces between all node pairs with respect
to their hop distance. These forces are then used in Newton's second law to
obtain the acceleration of each node. The method is intuitive, parallelizable,
and highly scalable. We evaluate our method on several graph analysis tasks and
show that it achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
unsupervised embedding techniques.

<p class="mathjax">The Amazon Alexa marketplace is the largest Voice Personal Assistant (VPA)
platform with over 100,000 voice applications (i.e., skills) published to the
skills store. In an effort to maintain the quality and trustworthiness of
voice-apps, Amazon Alexa has implemented a set of policy requirements to be
adhered to by third-party skill developers. However, recent works reveal the
prevalence of policy-violating skills in the current skills store. To
understand the causes of policy violations in skills, we first conduct a user
study with 34 third-party skill developers focusing on whether they are aware
of the various policy requirements defined by the Amazon Alexa platform. Our
user study results show that there is a notable gap between VPA's policy
requirements and skill developers' practices. As a result, it is inevitable
that policy-violating skills will be published.
<br />To prevent the inflow of new policy-breaking skills to the skills store from
the source, it is critical to identify potential policy violations at the
development phase. In this work, we design and develop SkillScanner, an
efficient static code analysis tool to facilitate third-party developers to
detect policy violations early in the skill development lifecycle. To evaluate
the performance of SkillScanner, we conducted an empirical study on 2,451 open
source skills collected from GitHub. SkillScanner effectively identified 1,328
different policy violations from 786 skills. Our results suggest that 32% of
these policy violations are introduced through code duplication (i.e., code
copy and paste). In particular, we found that 42 skill code examples from
potential Alexa's official accounts (e.g., "alexa" and "alexa-samples" on
GitHub) contain policy violations, which lead to 81 policy violations in other
skills due to the copy-pasted code snippets from these Alexa's code examples.

<p class="mathjax">CholeskyQR2 and shifted CholeskyQR3 are two state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing tall-and-skinny QR factorizations since they attain high performance
on current computer architectures. However, to guarantee stability, for some
applications, CholeskyQR2 faces a prohibitive restriction on the condition
number of the underlying matrix to factorize. Shifted CholeskyQR3 is stable but
has $50\%$ more computational and communication costs than CholeskyQR2. In this
paper, a randomized QR algorithm called Randomized Householder-Cholesky
(\texttt{rand\_cholQR}) is proposed and analyzed. Using one or two random
sketch matrices, it is proved that with high probability, its orthogonality
error is bounded by a constant of the order of unit roundoff for any
numerically full-rank matrix, and hence it is as stable as shifted CholeskyQR3.
An evaluation of the performance of \texttt{rand\_cholQR} on a NVIDIA A100 GPU
demonstrates that for tall-and-skinny matrices, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} with
multiple sketch matrices is nearly as fast as, or in some cases faster than,
CholeskyQR2. Hence, compared to CholeskyQR2, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} is more
stable with almost no extra computational or memory cost, and therefore a
superior algorithm both in theory and practice.

<p class="mathjax">We study a new framework for designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms
via randomized graph colorings, called rainbow differential privacy. In this
framework, datasets are nodes in a graph, and two neighboring datasets are
connected by an edge. Each dataset in the graph has a preferential ordering for
the possible outputs of the mechanism, and these orderings are called rainbows.
Different rainbows partition the graph of connected datasets into different
regions. We show that if a DP mechanism at the boundary of such regions is
fixed and it behaves identically for all same-rainbow boundary datasets, then a
unique optimal $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism exists (as long as the boundary
condition is valid) and can be expressed in closed-form. Our proof technique is
based on an interesting relationship between dominance ordering and DP, which
applies to any finite number of colors and for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP,
improving upon previous results that only apply to at most three colors and for
$\epsilon$-DP. We justify the homogeneous boundary condition assumption by
giving an example with non-homogeneous boundary condition, for which there
exists no optimal DP mechanism.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce a flow based machine learning approach, called
reaction coordinate (RC) flow, for discovery of low-dimensional kinetic models
of molecular systems. The RC flow utilizes a normalizing flow to design the
coordinate transformation and a Brownian dynamics model to approximate the
kinetics of RC, where all model parameters can be estimated in a data-driven
manner. In contrast to existing model reduction methods for molecular kinetics,
RC flow offers a trainable and tractable model of reduced kinetics in
continuous time and space due to the invertibility of the normalizing flow.
Furthermore, the Brownian dynamics-based reduced kinetic model investigated in
this work yields a readily discernible representation of metastable states
within the phase space of the molecular system. Numerical experiments
demonstrate how effectively the proposed method discovers interpretable and
accurate low-dimensional representations of given full-state kinetics from
simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Face verification (FV) using deep neural network models has made tremendous
progress in recent years, surpassing human accuracy and seeing deployment in
various applications such as border control and smartphone unlocking. However,
FV systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks, which manipulate input images
to deceive these systems in ways usually unnoticeable to humans. This paper
provides an in-depth study of attacks on FV systems. We introduce the
DodgePersonation Attack that formulates the creation of face images that
impersonate a set of given identities while avoiding being identified as any of
the identities in a separate, disjoint set. A taxonomy is proposed to provide a
unified view of different types of Adversarial Attacks against FV systems,
including Dodging Attacks, Impersonation Attacks, and Master Face Attacks.
Finally, we propose the ''One Face to Rule Them All'' Attack which implements
the DodgePersonation Attack with state-of-the-art performance on a well-known
scenario (Master Face Attack) and which can also be used for the new scenarios
introduced in this paper. While the state-of-the-art Master Face Attack can
produce a set of 9 images to cover 43.82% of the identities in their test

<p class="mathjax">On shopping websites, product images of low quality negatively affect
customer experience. Although there are plenty of work in detecting images with
different defects, few efforts have been dedicated to correct those defects at
scale. A major challenge is that there are thousands of product types and each
has specific defects, therefore building defect specific models is unscalable.
In this paper, we propose a unified Image-to-Image (I2I) translation model to
correct multiple defects across different product types. Our model leverages an
attention mechanism to hierarchically incorporate high-level defect groups and
specific defect types to guide the network to focus on defect-related image
regions. Evaluated on eight public datasets, our model reduces the Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) by 24.6% in average compared with MoNCE, the
state-of-the-art I2I method. Unlike public data, another practical challenge on
shopping websites is that some paired images are of low quality. Therefore we
design our model to be semi-paired by combining the L1 loss of paired data with
the cycle loss of unpaired data. Tested on a shopping website dataset to
correct three image defects, our model reduces (FID) by 63.2% in average
compared with WS-I2I, the state-of-the art semi-paired I2I method.

<p class="mathjax">Recent literature highlights a significant cross-impact between transfer
learning and cybersecurity. Many studies have been conducted on using transfer
learning to enhance security, leading to various applications in different
cybersecurity tasks. However, previous research is focused on specific areas of
cybersecurity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of transfer learning
applications in cybersecurity by covering a wide range of domains, identifying
current trends, and shedding light on under-explored areas. The survey
highlights the significance of transfer learning in addressing critical issues
in cybersecurity, such as improving detection accuracy, reducing training time,
handling data imbalance, and enhancing privacy preservation. Additional
insights are provided on the common problems solved using transfer learning,
such as the lack of labeled data, different data distributions, and privacy
concerns. The paper identifies future research directions and challenges that
require community attention, including the need for privacy-preserving models,
automatic tools for knowledge transfer, metrics for measuring domain
relatedness, and enhanced privacy preservation mechanisms. The insights and
roadmap presented in this paper will guide researchers in further advancing
transfer learning in cybersecurity, fostering the development of robust and
efficient cybersecurity systems to counter emerging threats and protect
sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of
its kind to present a comprehensive taxonomy of all areas of cybersecurity that
benefited from transfer learning and propose a detailed future roadmap to shape
the possible research direction in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Current practice for evaluating recommender systems typically focuses on
point estimates of user-oriented effectiveness metrics or business metrics,
sometimes combined with additional metrics for considerations such as diversity
and novelty. In this paper, we argue for the need for researchers and
practitioners to attend more closely to various distributions that arise from a
recommender system (or other information access system) and the sources of
uncertainty that lead to these distributions. One immediate implication of our
argument is that both researchers and practitioners must report and examine
more thoroughly the distribution of utility between and within different
stakeholder groups. However, distributions of various forms arise in many more
aspects of the recommender systems experimental process, and distributional
thinking has substantial ramifications for how we design, evaluate, and present
recommender systems evaluation and research results. Leveraging and emphasizing
distributions in the evaluation of recommender systems is a necessary step to
ensure that the systems provide appropriate and equitably-distributed benefit
to the people they affect.

<p class="mathjax">Power systems Unit Commitment (UC) problem determines the generator
commitment schedule and dispatch decisions for power networks based on
forecasted electricity demand. However, with the increasing penetration of
renewables and stochastic demand behaviors, it becomes challenging to solve the
large-scale, multi-interval UC problem in an efficient manner. The main
objective of this paper is to propose a fast and reliable scheme to eliminate a
set of redundant or inactive physical constraints in the high-dimensional,
multi-interval, mixed-integer UC problem, while the reduced problem is
equivalent to the original full problem in terms of commitment decisions. Our
key insights lie on pre-screening the constraints based on the load
distribution and considering the physical feasibility regions of multi-interval
UC problem. For the multistep UC formulation, we overcome screening
conservativeness by utilizing the multi-step ramping relationships, and can
reliably screen out more constraints compared to current practice. Extensive
simulations on both specific load samples and load regions validate the
proposed technique can screen out more than 80% constraints while preserving
the feasibility of multi-interval UC problem.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the strategic decision-making capabilities of three
Large Language Models (LLMs): GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMa-2, within the framework
of game theory. Utilizing four canonical two-player games -- Prisoner's
Dilemma, Stag Hunt, Snowdrift, and Prisoner's Delight -- we explore how these
models navigate social dilemmas, situations where players can either cooperate
for a collective benefit or defect for individual gain. Crucially, we extend
our analysis to examine the role of contextual framing, such as diplomatic
relations or casual friendships, in shaping the models' decisions. Our findings
reveal a complex landscape: while GPT-3.5 is highly sensitive to contextual
framing, it shows limited ability to engage in abstract strategic reasoning.
Both GPT-4 and LLaMa-2 adjust their strategies based on game structure and
context, but LLaMa-2 exhibits a more nuanced understanding of the games'
underlying mechanics. These results highlight the current limitations and
varied proficiencies of LLMs in strategic decision-making, cautioning against
their unqualified use in tasks requiring complex strategic reasoning.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning is at the center of mainstream technology and outperforms
classical approaches to handcrafted feature design. Aside from its learning
process for artificial feature extraction, it has an end-to-end paradigm from
input to output, reaching outstandingly accurate results. However, security
concerns about its robustness to malicious and imperceptible perturbations have
drawn attention since its prediction can be changed entirely. Salient object
detection is a research area where deep convolutional neural networks have
proven effective but whose trustworthiness represents a significant issue
requiring analysis and solutions to hackers' attacks. Brain programming is a
kind of symbolic learning in the vein of good old-fashioned artificial
intelligence. This work provides evidence that symbolic learning robustness is
crucial in designing reliable visual attention systems since it can withstand
even the most intense perturbations. We test this evolutionary computation
methodology against several adversarial attacks and noise perturbations using
standard databases and a real-world problem of a shorebird called the Snowy
Plover portraying a visual attention task. We compare our methodology with five
different deep learning approaches, proving that they do not match the symbolic
paradigm regarding robustness. All neural networks suffer significant
performance losses, while brain programming stands its ground and remains
unaffected. Also, by studying the Snowy Plover, we remark on the importance of
security in surveillance activities regarding wildlife protection and
conservation.

for enabling full adaptivity in composing differentially private interactive

<p class="mathjax">Recently, multi-modal vision-language foundation models have gained
significant attention in the medical field. While these models offer great
opportunities, they still face a number of challenges, such as the requirement
for fine-grained knowledge understanding in computer-aided diagnosis and
capability of utilizing very limited or no task-specific labeled data in
real-world clinical applications. In this study, we present MaCo, a novel
multi-modal medical foundation model that explores masked contrastive learning
to achieve granular alignment and zero-shot learning for a variety of medical
imaging tasks. MaCo incorporates a correlation weighting mechanism to adjust
the correlation between masked image patches and their corresponding reports,
thereby enhancing the representation learning capabilities. We evaluate MaCo on
six well-known open-source X-ray datasets, and the experimental results show it
outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches for classification, segmentation,
and zero-shot phase grounding, demonstrating its great potential to promote a
wide range of medical image analysis tasks.

<p class="mathjax">A nonlinear optimal control strategy, named the geometry enhanced finite time
$\boldsymbol{\theta-}$D technique, is proposed to manipulate the acrobatic flip
flight of variable pitch (VP) quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (abbreviated
as VP copter). A unique superiority of the VP copter, which can provide the
thrust in both positive and negative vertical directions by varying the pitch
angles of blades, facilitates the acrobatic flip motion. The finite time
$\boldsymbol{\theta-}$D technique can offer a closed-form near-optimal state
feedback control law with online computational efficiency as compared with the
finite time state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique. Meanwhile, by
virtue of the geometric technique, the singularity issue of the rotation matrix
in the acrobatic flip maneuver can be avoided. The simulation experiments
verify the proposed control strategy is effective and efficient.

<p class="mathjax">Controller synthesis, including reset controller, feedback controller, and
switching logic controller, provides an essential mechanism to guarantee the
correctness and reliability of hybrid systems in a correct-by-construction
manner. Unfortunately, reset controller synthesis is still in an infant stage
in the literature, although it makes theoretical and practical significance. In
this paper, we propose a convex programming based method to synthesize reset
controllers for polynomial hybrid systems subject to safety, possibly together
with liveness. Such a problem essentially corresponds to computing an initial
set of continuous states in each mode and a reset map associated with each
discrete jump such that any trajectory starting from any computed initial state
keeps safe if only safety constraints are given or reaches the target set
eventually and keeps safe before that if both safety and liveness are given,
through the computed reset maps. Both cases can be reduced to reach-avoid
and/or differential invariant generation problems, further encoded as convex
optimization problems. Finally, several examples are provided to demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">A reset controller plays a crucial role in designing hybrid systems. It
restricts the initial set and redefines the reset map associated with discrete
transitions, in order to guarantee the system to achieve its objective. Reset
controller synthesis, together with feedback controller synthesis and switching
logic controller synthesis, provides a correct-by-construction approach to
designing hybrid systems. However, time-delay is an inevitable factor in hybrid
systems, which can degrade control performance and render verification
certificates obtained by abstracting away time-delay invalid in practice. In
this paper, we investigate this issue in a practical manner by taking
time-delay into account. We propose an approach that reduces the synthesis of
reset controllers to the generation of reach-avoid sets for the hybrid system
under consideration, which can be efficiently solved using off-the-shell convex
optimization solvers.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake has recently raised a plethora of societal concerns over its
possible security threats and dissemination of fake information. Much research
on deepfake detection has been undertaken. However, detecting low quality as
well as simultaneously detecting different qualities of deepfakes still remains
a grave challenge. Most SOTA approaches are limited by using a single specific
model for detecting certain deepfake video quality type. When constructing
multiple models with prior information about video quality, this kind of
strategy incurs significant computational cost, as well as model and training
data overhead. Further, it cannot be scalable and practical to deploy in
real-world settings. In this work, we propose a universal intra-model
collaborative learning framework to enable the effective and simultaneous
detection of different quality of deepfakes. That is, our approach is the
quality-agnostic deepfake detection method, dubbed QAD . In particular, by
observing the upper bound of general error expectation, we maximize the
dependency between intermediate representations of images from different
quality levels via Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. In addition, an
Adversarial Weight Perturbation module is carefully devised to enable the model
to be more robust against image corruption while boosting the overall model's
performance. Extensive experiments over seven popular deepfake datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our QAD model over prior SOTA benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This research paper entails an examination of the Enhanced Wi-Fi protocol,
focusing on its control command reverse-engineering analysis and subsequent
demonstration of a hijacking attack. Our investigation discovered
vulnerabilities in the Enhanced Wi-Fi control commands, rendering them
susceptible to hijacking attacks. Notably, the study established that even
readily available and cost-effective commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi routers
could be leveraged as effective tools for executing such attacks. To illustrate
this vulnerability, a proof-of-concept remote hijacking attack was carried out
on a DJI Mini SE drone, whereby we intercepted the control commands to
manipulate the drone's flight trajectory. The findings of this research
emphasize the critical necessity of implementing robust security measures to
safeguard unmanned aerial vehicles against potential hijacking threats.
Considering that civilian drones are now used as war weapons, the study
underscores the urgent need for further exploration and advancement in the
domain of civilian drone security.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has shown promising contributions in medical image segmentation
with powerful learning and feature representation abilities. However, it has
limitations for reasoning with and combining imperfect (imprecise, uncertain,
and partial) information. In this thesis, we study medical image segmentation
approaches with belief function theory and deep learning, specifically focusing
on information modeling and fusion based on uncertain evidence.
<br />First, we review existing belief function theory-based medical image
segmentation methods and discuss their advantages and challenges. Second, we
present a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework to decrease the
uncertainty caused by the lack of annotations with evidential segmentation and
evidence fusion. Third, we compare two evidential classifiers, evidential
neural network and radial basis function network, and show the effectiveness of
belief function theory in uncertainty quantification; we use the two evidential
classifiers with deep neural networks to construct deep evidential models for
lymphoma segmentation. Fourth, we present a multimodal medical image fusion
framework taking into account the reliability of each MR image source when
performing different segmentation tasks using mass functions and contextual
discounting.

<p class="mathjax">Decision Transformer (DT), which employs expressive sequence modeling
techniques to perform action generation, has emerged as a promising approach to
offline policy optimization. However, DT generates actions conditioned on a
desired future return, which is known to bear some weaknesses such as the
susceptibility to environmental stochasticity. To overcome DT's weaknesses, we
propose to empower DT with dynamic programming. Our method comprises three
steps. First, we employ in-sample value iteration to obtain approximated value
functions, which involves dynamic programming over the MDP structure. Second,
we evaluate action quality in context with estimated advantages. We introduce
two types of advantage estimators, IAE and GAE, which are suitable for
different tasks. Third, we train an Advantage-Conditioned Transformer (ACT) to
generate actions conditioned on the estimated advantages. Finally, during
testing, ACT generates actions conditioned on a desired advantage. Our
evaluation results validate that, by leveraging the power of dynamic
programming, ACT demonstrates effective trajectory stitching and robust action
generation in spite of the environmental stochasticity, outperforming baseline
methods across various benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of ACT's various design choices through ablation studies.

<p class="mathjax">In our opinion the exuberance surrounding the relative success of data-driven
large language models (LLMs) is slightly misguided and for several reasons (i)
LLMs cannot be relied upon for factual information since for LLMs all ingested
text (factual or non-factual) was created equal; (ii) due to their subsymbolic
na-ture, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire about language will always
be buried in billions of microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful
on its own; and (iii) LLMs will often fail to make the correct inferences in
several linguistic contexts (e.g., nominal compounds, copredication, quantifier
scope ambi-guities, intensional contexts. Since we believe the relative success
of data-driven large language models (LLMs) is not a reflection on the symbolic
vs. subsymbol-ic debate but a reflection on applying the successful strategy of
a bottom-up reverse engineering of language at scale, we suggest in this paper
applying the effective bottom-up strategy in a symbolic setting resulting in
symbolic, explainable, and ontologically grounded language models.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce SAGE; a Generative LLM for inferring attribute values for
products across world-wide e-Commerce catalogs. We introduce a novel
formulation of the attribute-value prediction problem as a Seq2Seq
summarization task, across languages, product types and target attributes. Our
novel modeling approach lifts the restriction of predicting attribute values
within a pre-specified set of choices, as well as, the requirement that the
sought attribute values need to be explicitly mentioned in the text. SAGE can
infer attribute values even when such values are mentioned implicitly using
periphrastic language, or not-at-all-as is the case for common-sense defaults.
Additionally, SAGE is capable of predicting whether an attribute is
inapplicable for the product at hand, or non-obtainable from the available
information. SAGE is the first method able to tackle all aspects of the
attribute-value-prediction task as they arise in practical settings in
e-Commerce catalogs. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, as well as, its superiority against
state-of-the-art competing alternatives. Moreover, our experiments highlight
SAGE's ability to tackle the task of predicting attribute values in zero-shot
setting; thereby, opening up opportunities for significantly reducing the
overall number of labeled examples required for training.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse logistic regression aims to perform classification and feature
selection simultaneously for high-dimensional data. Although many studies have
been done to solve $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression, there is no
equivalently abundant literature about solving sparse logistic regression
associated with nonconvex penalties. In this paper, we propose to solve
$\ell_1$-regularized sparse logistic regression and some nonconvex
penalties-regularized sparse logistic regression, when the nonconvex penalties
satisfy some prerequisites, with similar optimization frameworks. In the
proposed optimization frameworks, we utilize different line search criteria to
guarantee good convergence performance for different regularization terms.
Empirical experiments on binary classification tasks with real-world datasets
demonstrate our proposed algorithms are capable of performing classification
and feature selection effectively with a lower computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging multimodal information from biosignals is vital for building a
comprehensive representation of people's physical and mental states. However,
multimodal biosignals often exhibit substantial distributional shifts between
pretraining and inference datasets, stemming from changes in task specification
or variations in modality compositions. To achieve effective pretraining in the
presence of potential distributional shifts, we propose a frequency-aware
masked autoencoder ($\texttt{bio}$FAME) that learns to parameterize the
representation of biosignals in the frequency space. $\texttt{bio}$FAME
incorporates a frequency-aware transformer, which leverages a fixed-size
Fourier-based operator for global token mixing, independent of the length and
sampling rate of inputs. To maintain the frequency components within each input
channel, we further employ a frequency-maintain pretraining strategy that
performs masked autoencoding in the latent space. The resulting architecture
effectively utilizes multimodal information during pretraining, and can be
seamlessly adapted to diverse tasks and modalities at test time, regardless of
input size and order. We evaluated our approach on a diverse set of transfer
experiments on unimodal time series, achieving an average of $\uparrow$5.5%
improvement in classification accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that our architecture is robust in modality
mismatch scenarios, including unpredicted modality dropout or substitution,
proving its practical utility in real-world applications. Code will be
available soon.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate crop type maps are an essential source of information for monitoring
yield progress at scale, projecting global crop production, and planning
effective policies. To date, however, crop type maps remain challenging to
create in low and middle-income countries due to a lack of ground truth labels
for training machine learning models. Field surveys are the gold standard in
terms of accuracy but require an often-prohibitively large amount of time,
money, and statistical capacity. In recent years, street-level imagery, such as
Google Street View, KartaView, and Mapillary, has become available around the
world. Such imagery contains rich information about crop types grown at
particular locations and times. In this work, we develop an automated system to
generate crop type ground references using deep learning and Google Street View
imagery. The method efficiently curates a set of street view images containing
crop fields, trains a model to predict crop type by utilizing weakly-labelled
images from disparate out-of-domain sources, and combines predicted labels with
remote sensing time series to create a wall-to-wall crop type map. We show
that, in Thailand, the resulting country-wide map of rice, cassava, maize, and
sugarcane achieves an accuracy of 93%. As the availability of roadside imagery
expands, our pipeline provides a way to map crop types at scale around the
globe, especially in underserved smallholder regions.

<p class="mathjax">Ontological knowledge, which comprises classes and properties and their
relationships, is integral to world knowledge. It is significant to explore
whether Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) know and understand such knowledge.
However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge,
lacking a systematic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus
on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic
understanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface
form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well
PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among
classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of
Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of
properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and
the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly
understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study
whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge
according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs
can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in
reasoning. However, both the memorizing and reasoning performances are less
than perfect, indicating incomplete knowledge and understanding.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a new task in the field of Answering Subjective Induction
Question on Products (SUBJPQA). The answer to this kind of question is
non-unique, but can be interpreted from many perspectives. For example, the
answer to 'whether the phone is heavy' has a variety of different viewpoints. A
satisfied answer should be able to summarize these subjective opinions from
multiple sources and provide objective knowledge, such as the weight of a
phone. That is quite different from the traditional QA task, in which the
answer to a factoid question is unique and can be found from a single data
source. To address this new task, we propose a three-steps method. We first
retrieve all answer-related clues from multiple knowledge sources on facts and
opinions. The implicit commonsense facts are also collected to supplement the
necessary but missing contexts. We then capture their relevance with the
questions by interactive attention. Next, we design a reinforcement-based
summarizer to aggregate all these knowledgeable clues. Based on a
template-controlled decoder, we can output a comprehensive and
multi-perspective answer. Due to the lack of a relevant evaluated benchmark set
for the new task, we construct a large-scale dataset, named SupQA, consisting
of 48,352 samples across 15 product domains. Evaluation results show the
effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">AIGC (AI-Generated Content) has achieved tremendous success in many
applications such as text-to-image tasks, where the model can generate
high-quality images with diverse prompts, namely, different descriptions in
natural languages. More surprisingly, the emerging personalization techniques
even succeed in describing unseen concepts with only a few personal images as
references, and there have been some commercial platforms for sharing the
valuable personalized concept. However, such an advanced technique also
introduces a severe threat, where malicious users can misuse the target concept
to generate highly-realistic illegal images. Therefore, it becomes necessary
for the platform to trace malicious users and hold them accountable.
<br />In this paper, we focus on guarding the most popular lightweight
personalization model, ie, Textual Inversion (TI). To achieve it, we propose
the novel concept watermarking, where watermark information is embedded into
the target concept and then extracted from generated images based on the
watermarked concept. Specifically, we jointly train a watermark encoder and a
watermark decoder with the sampler in the loop.
<br />It shows great resilience to different diffusion sampling processes possibly
chosen by malicious users, meanwhile preserving utility for normal use. In
practice, the concept owner can upload his concept with different watermarks
(ie, serial numbers) to the platform, and the platform allocates different
users with different serial numbers for subsequent tracing and forensics.

<p class="mathjax">Despite encryption, the packet size is still visible, enabling observers to
infer private information in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment (e.g.,
IoT device identification). Packet padding obfuscates packet-length
characteristics with a high data overhead because it relies on adding noise to
the data. This paper proposes a more data-efficient approach that randomizes
packet sizes without adding noise. We achieve this by splitting large TCP
segments into random-sized chunks; hence, the packet length distribution is
obfuscated without adding noise data. Our client-server implementation using
TCP sockets demonstrates the feasibility of our approach at the application
level. We realize our packet size control by adjusting two local
socket-programming parameters. First, we enable the TCP_NODELAY option to send
out each packet with our specified length. Second, we downsize the sending
buffer to prevent the sender from pushing out more data than can be received,
which could disable our control of the packet sizes. We simulate our defense on
a network trace of four IoT devices and show a reduction in device
classification accuracy from 98% to 63%, close to random guessing. Meanwhile,
the real-world data transmission experiments show that the added latency is
reasonable, less than 21%, while the added packet header overhead is only about
5%.

<p class="mathjax">Sketch-based shape modeling aims to bridge the gap between 2D drawing and 3D
modeling by providing an intuitive and accessible approach to create 3D shapes
from 2D sketches. However, existing methods still suffer from limitations in
reconstruction quality and multi-view interaction friendliness, hindering their
practical application. This paper proposes a faithful and user-friendly
iterative solution to tackle these limitations by learning geometry-aligned
deep implicit functions from one or multiple sketches. Our method lifts 2D
sketches to volume-based feature tensors, which align strongly with the output
3D shape, enabling accurate reconstruction and faithful editing. Such a
geometry-aligned feature encoding technique is well-suited to iterative
modeling since features from different viewpoints can be easily memorized or
aggregated. Based on these advantages, we design a unified interactive system
for sketch-based shape modeling. It enables users to generate the desired
geometry iteratively by drawing sketches from any number of viewpoints. In
addition, it allows users to edit the generated surface by making a few local
modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our method
with extensive experiments and user studies, where we found that our method
outperformed existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and user
satisfaction. The source code of this project is available at

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we propose a new metaheuristic inspired by the morphogenetic
cellular movements of endothelial cells (ECs) that occur during the tumor
angiogenesis process. This algorithm starts with a random initial population.
In each iteration, the best candidate selected as the tumor, while the other
individuals in the population are treated as ECs migrating toward the tumor's
direction following a coordinated dynamics through a spatial relationship
between tip and follower ECs. EC movements mathematical model in angiogenic
morphogenesis are detailed in the article. This algorithm has an advantage
compared to other similar optimization metaheuristics: the model parameters are
already configured according to the tumor angiogenesis phenomenon modeling,
preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values.
Subsequently, the algorithm is compared against well-known benchmark functions,
and the results are validated through a comparative study with Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO). The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of
providing highly competitive outcomes. Also the proposed algorithm is applied
to a real-world problem. The results showed that the proposed algorithm
performed effective in solving constrained optimization problems, surpassing
other known algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale datasets have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of vision and multimodal
tasks. Currently, fine-tuning methods for VLMs mainly operate in a white-box
setting, requiring access to model parameters for backpropagation. However,
many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not open-source, which restricts the
use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning. Given that popular private large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT still offer a language-based user
interface, we aim to develop a novel fine-tuning approach for VLMs through
natural language prompts, thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters,
feature embeddings, or output logits. In this setup, we propose employing
chat-based LLMs as black-box optimizers to search for the best text prompt on
the illustrative task of few-shot image classification using CLIP.
Specifically, we adopt an automatic "hill-climbing" procedure that converges on
an effective prompt by evaluating the accuracy of current prompts and asking
LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback, all within a conversational
process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot learning setup, our
simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method CoOp by an
average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also
outperforms OpenAI's manually crafted prompts and is more efficient than other
black-box methods like iterative APE. Additionally, we highlight the advantage
of conversational feedback incorporating both positive and negative prompts,
suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit "gradient" direction in textual
feedback for a more efficient search. Lastly, we find that the text prompts
generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also
transfer well across different CLIP architectures in a black-box manner.

<p class="mathjax">As social media becomes increasingly popular, more and more public health
activities emerge, which is worth noting for pandemic monitoring and government
decision-making. Current techniques for public health analysis involve popular
models such as BERT and large language models (LLMs). Although recent progress
in LLMs has shown a strong ability to comprehend knowledge by being fine-tuned
on specific domain datasets, the costs of training an in-domain LLM for every
specific public health task are especially expensive. Furthermore, such kinds
of in-domain datasets from social media are generally highly imbalanced, which
will hinder the efficiency of LLMs tuning. To tackle these challenges, the data
imbalance issue can be overcome by sophisticated data augmentation methods for
social media datasets. In addition, the ability of the LLMs can be effectively
utilised by prompting the model properly. In light of the above discussion, in
this paper, a novel ALEX framework is proposed for social media analysis on
public health. Specifically, an augmentation pipeline is developed to resolve
the data imbalance issue. Furthermore, an LLMs explanation mechanism is
proposed by prompting an LLM with the predicted results from BERT models.
Extensive experiments conducted on three tasks at the Social Media Mining for
Health 2023 (SMM4H) competition with the first ranking in two tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed ALEX method. Our code has been
released in https://github.com/YanJiangJerry/ALEX.

<p class="mathjax">We address the personalization of control systems, which is an attempt to
adjust inherent safety and other essential control performance based on each
user's personal preferences. A typical approach to personalization requires a
substantial amount of user feedback and data collection, which may result in a
burden on users. Moreover, it might be challenging to collect data in
real-time. To overcome this drawback, we propose a natural language-based
personalization, which places a comparatively lighter burden on users and
enables the personalization system to collect data in real-time. In particular,
we consider model predictive control (MPC) and introduce an approach that
updates the control specification using chat within the MPC framework, namely
ChatMPC. In the numerical experiment, we simulated an autonomous robot equipped
with ChatMPC. The result shows that the specification in robot control is
updated by providing natural language-based chats, which generate different
behaviors.

<p class="mathjax">Logs play a crucial role in system monitoring and debugging by recording
valuable system information, including events and states. Although various
methods have been proposed to detect anomalies in log sequences, they often
overlook the significance of considering relations among system components,
such as services and users, which can be identified from log contents.
Understanding these relations is vital for detecting anomalies and their
underlying causes. To address this issue, we introduce GLAD, a Graph-based Log
Anomaly Detection framework designed to detect relational anomalies in system
logs. GLAD incorporates log semantics, relational patterns, and sequential
patterns into a unified framework for anomaly detection. Specifically, GLAD
first introduces a field extraction module that utilizes prompt-based few-shot
learning to identify essential fields from log contents. Then GLAD constructs
dynamic log graphs for sliding windows by interconnecting extracted fields and
log events parsed from the log parser. These graphs represent events and fields
as nodes and their relations as edges. Subsequently, GLAD utilizes a
temporal-attentive graph edge anomaly detection model for identifying anomalous

<p class="mathjax">Accurate disturbance estimation is essential for safe robot operations. The
recently proposed neural moving horizon estimation (NeuroMHE), which uses a
portable neural network to model the MHE's weightings, shows promise in this
context. Currently, NeuroMHE is trained through gradient descent, with its
gradient computed recursively using a Kalman filter. This paper proposes a
trust-region policy optimization method for training NeuroMHE. We achieve this
by providing the second-order derivatives of MHE, referred to as the MHE
Hessian. Remarkably, we establish that much of computation already used to
obtain the gradient, especially the Kalman filter, can be efficiently reused to
compute the MHE Hessian. This offers linear computational complexity relative
to the MHE horizon. Through validation with an open-source real quadrotor
flight dataset, our approach demonstrates data-efficient training (&lt;5 min) and
outperforms a state-of-the-art neural estimator by up to 68.1% in force
estimation accuracy, utilizing only 1.4% of its network parameters.
Furthermore, our method showcases enhanced robustness to network initialization
compared to the gradient descent counterpart.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new paradigm to automatically generate training data with
accurate labels at scale using the text-to-image synthesis frameworks (e.g.,
DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.). The proposed approach1 decouples training data
generation into foreground object generation, and contextually coherent
background generation. To generate foreground objects, we employ a
straightforward textual template, incorporating the object class name as input
prompts. This is fed into a text-to-image synthesis framework, producing
various foreground images set against isolated backgrounds. A
foreground-background segmentation algorithm is then used to generate
foreground object masks. To generate context images, we begin by creating
language descriptions of the context. This is achieved by applying an image
captioning method to a small set of images representing the desired context.
These textual descriptions are then transformed into a diverse array of context
images via a text-to-image synthesis framework. Subsequently, we composite
these with the foreground object masks produced in the initial step, utilizing
a cut-and-paste method, to formulate the training data. We demonstrate the
advantages of our approach on five object detection and segmentation datasets,
including Pascal VOC and COCO. We found that detectors trained solely on
synthetic data produced by our method achieve performance comparable to those
trained on real data (Fig. 1). Moreover, a combination of real and synthetic
data yields even much better results. Further analysis indicates that the
synthetic data distribution complements the real data distribution effectively.
Additionally, we emphasize the compositional nature of our data generation
approach in out-of-distribution and zero-shot data generation scenarios. We
open-source our code at https://github.com/gyhandy/Text2Image-for-Detection

<p class="mathjax">As large language models (LLMs) become more deeply integrated into various
sectors, understanding how they make moral judgments has become crucial,
particularly in the realm of autonomous driving. This study utilized the Moral
Machine framework to investigate the ethical decision-making tendencies of
prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2, and Llama 2, comparing their
responses to human preferences. While LLMs' and humans' preferences such as
prioritizing humans over pets and favoring saving more lives are broadly
aligned, PaLM 2 and Llama 2, especially, evidence distinct deviations.
Additionally, despite the qualitative similarities between the LLM and human
preferences, there are significant quantitative disparities, suggesting that
LLMs might lean toward more uncompromising decisions, compared to the milder
inclinations of humans. These insights elucidate the ethical frameworks of LLMs
and their potential implications for autonomous driving.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate cooperative vehicle coordination for connected
and automated vehicles (CAVs) at unsignalized intersections. To support high
traffic throughput while reducing computational complexity, we present a novel
collision region model and decompose the optimal coordination problem into two
sub-problems: \textit{centralized} priority scheduling and distributed
trajectory planning. Then, we propose a bi-level coordination framework which
includes: (i) a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based high-level priority
scheduler aims to find high-quality passing orders to maximize traffic
throughput, and (ii) a priority-based low-level trajectory planner that
generates optimal collision-free control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate
that our bi-level strategy achieves near-optimal coordination performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art centralized strategies, and significantly
outperform the traffic signal control systems in terms of traffic throughput.
Moreover, our approach exhibits good scalability, with computational complexity
scaling linearly with the number of vehicles.

Additionally, by employing conventional machine learning models to analyze

<p class="mathjax">This paper is concerned with the mean curvature flow, which describes the
dynamics of a hypersurface whose normal velocity is determined by local mean
curvature. We present a Cartesian grid-based method for solving mean curvature
flows in two and three space dimensions. The present method embeds a closed
hypersurface into a fixed Cartesian grid and decomposes it into multiple
overlapping subsets. For each subset, extra tangential velocities are
introduced such that marker points on the hypersurface only moves along grid
lines. By utilizing an alternating direction implicit (ADI)-type time
integration method, the subsets are evolved alternately by solving scalar
parabolic partial differential equations on planar domains. The method removes
the stiffness using a semi-implicit scheme and has no high-order stability
constraint on time step size. Numerical examples in two and three space
dimensions are presented to validate the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">The envisioned wireless networks of the future entail the provisioning of
massive numbers of connections, heterogeneous data traffic, ultra-high spectral
efficiency, and low latency services. This vision is spurring research
activities focused on defining a next generation multiple access (NGMA)
protocol that can accommodate massive numbers of users in different resource
blocks, thereby, achieving higher spectral efficiency and increased
connectivity compared to conventional multiple access schemes. In this article,
we present a multiple access scheme for NGMA in wireless communication systems
assisted by multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this
regard, considering the practical scenario of static users operating together
with mobile ones, we first study the interplay of the design of NGMA schemes
and RIS phase configuration in terms of efficiency and complexity. Based on
this, we then propose a multiple access framework for RIS-assisted
communication systems, and we also design a medium access control (MAC)
protocol incorporating RISs. In addition, we give a detailed performance
analysis of the designed RIS-assisted MAC protocol. Our extensive simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed MAC design outperforms the benchmarks in
terms of system throughput and access fairness, and also reveal a trade-off
relationship between the system throughput and fairness.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses a novel version of the kernel-free boundary integral
(KFBI) method for solving elliptic PDEs with implicitly defined irregular
boundaries and interfaces. We focus on boundary value problems and interface
problems, which are reformulated into boundary integral equations and solved
with the matrix-free GMRES method. In the KFBI method, evaluating boundary and
volume integrals only requires solving equivalent but much simpler interface
problems in a bounding box, for which fast solvers such as FFTs and geometric
multigrid methods are applicable. For the simple interface problem, a
correction function is introduced for both the evaluation of right-hand side
correction terms and the interpolation of a non-smooth potential function. A
mesh-free collocation method is proposed to compute the correction function
near the interface. The new method avoids complicated derivation for derivative
jumps of the solution and is easy to implement, especially for the fourth-order
method in three space dimensions. Various numerical examples are presented,
including challenging cases such as high-contrast coefficients, arbitrarily
close interfaces and heterogeneous interface problems. The reported numerical
results verify that the proposed method is both accurate and efficient.

network (NN) encoding theorem which shows that for every stably converged NN of
continuous activation functions, its weight matrix actually encodes a
continuous function that approximates its training dataset to within a finite
margin of error over a bounded domain. We further show that using the
Eckart-Young theorem for truncated singular value decomposition of the weight
matrix for every NN layer, we can illuminate the nature of the latent space
manifold of the training dataset encoded and represented by every NN layer, and
the geometric nature of the mathematical operations performed by each NN layer.
Our results have implications for understanding how NNs break the curse of

are complementary. This Layer Matrix Decomposition (LMD) further suggests a
close relationship between eigen-decomposition of NN layers and the latest

<p class="mathjax">The present paper proposes an encoder-decoder model for extracting the
structures of human motions represented by frame-wise discrete features in a
self-supervised manner. In the proposed method, features are extracted as codes
in a motion codebook without the use of human knowledge, and the relationship
between these codes can be visualized on a graph. Since the codes are expected
to be temporally sparse compared to the captured frame rate and can be shared
by multiple sequences, the proposed network model also addresses the need for
training constraints. Specifically, the model consists of self-attention layers
and a vector clustering block. The attention layers contribute to finding
sparse keyframes and discrete features as motion codes, which are then
extracted by vector clustering. The constraints are realized as training losses
so that the same motion codes can be as contiguous as possible and can be
shared by multiple sequences. In addition, we propose the use of causal
self-attention as a method by which to calculate attention for long sequences
consisting of numerous frames. In our experiments, the sparse structures of
motion codes were used to compile a graph that facilitates visualization of the
relationship between the codes and the differences between sequences. We then
evaluated the effectiveness of the extracted motion codes by applying them to
multiple recognition tasks and found that performance levels comparable to
task-optimized methods could be achieved by linear probing.

<p class="mathjax">Language models often exhibit behaviors that improve performance on a
pre-training objective but harm performance on downstream tasks. We propose a
novel approach to removing undesirable behaviors by ablating a small number of
causal pathways between model components, with the intention of disabling the
computational circuit responsible for the bad behavior. Given a small dataset
of inputs where the model behaves poorly, we learn to ablate a small number of
important causal pathways. In the setting of reducing GPT-2 toxic language
generation, we find ablating just 12 of the 11.6K causal edges mitigates toxic
generation with minimal degradation of performance on other inputs.

and deep learning (DL) based codes for error correction, and
cyclic-redundancy-check (CRC) codes for error detection. We use a metric called
reported age of information (AoI), abbreviated as RAoI, to measure the
freshness of information, which increases from an initial value if the CRC
reports a failure, else is reset. We minimize long-term average expected RAoI,
subject to constraints on transmission power and distortion, for which we
obtain age-agnostic randomized and age-aware drift-plus-penalty policies that
decide which user to transmit to, with what message-word length and transmit
power, and derive bounds on their performance. Simulations show that longer CRC
codes lead to higher RAoI, but the RAoI achieved is closer to the true,
genie-aided AoI. DL-based codes achieve lower RAoI. Finally, we conclude that
prior AoI optimization literature with finite blocklengths substantially
underestimates AoI because they assume that all errors can be detected
perfectly without using CRC.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present CleanUNet 2, a speech denoising model that combines
the advantages of waveform denoiser and spectrogram denoiser and achieves the
best of both worlds. CleanUNet 2 uses a two-stage framework inspired by popular
speech synthesis methods that consist of a waveform model and a spectrogram
model. Specifically, CleanUNet 2 builds upon CleanUNet, the state-of-the-art
waveform denoiser, and further boosts its performance by taking predicted
spectrograms from a spectrogram denoiser as the input. We demonstrate that
CleanUNet 2 outperforms previous methods in terms of various objective and
subjective evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">Memory corruption attacks (MCAs) refer to malicious behaviors of system
intruders that modify the contents of a memory location to disrupt the normal
operation of computing systems, causing leakage of sensitive data or
perturbations to ongoing processes. Unlike general-purpose systems, unmanned
systems cannot deploy complete security protection schemes, due to their
limitations in size, cost and performance. MCAs in unmanned systems are
particularly difficult to defend against. Furthermore, MCAs have diverse and
unpredictable attack interfaces in unmanned systems, severely impacting digital
and physical sectors. In this paper, we first generalize, model and taxonomize
MCAs found in unmanned systems currently, laying the foundation for designing a
portable and general defense approach. According to different attack
mechanisms, we found that MCAs are mainly categorized into two
types--return2libc and return2shellcode. To tackle return2libc attacks, we
model the erratic operation of unmanned systems with cycles and then propose a
cycle-task-oriented memory protection (CToMP) approach to protect control flows
from tampering. To defend against return2shellcode attacks, we introduce a
secure process stack with a randomized memory address by leveraging the memory
pool to prevent Shellcode from being executed. Moreover, we discuss the
mechanism by which CToMP resists the ROP attack, a novel variant of return2libc
attacks. Finally, we implement CToMP on CUAV V5+ with Ardupilot and Crazyflie.
The evaluation and security analysis results demonstrate that the proposed
approach CToMP is resilient to various MCAs in unmanned systems with low
footprints and system overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Quantification of the political leaning of online news articles can aid in
understanding the dynamics of political ideology in social groups and measures
to mitigating them. However, predicting the accurate political leaning of a
news article with machine learning models is a challenging task. This is due to
(i) the political ideology of a news article is defined by several factors, and
(ii) the innate nature of existing learning models to be biased with the
political bias of the news publisher during the model training. There is only a
limited number of methods to study the political leaning of news articles which
also do not consider the algorithmic political bias which lowers the
generalization of machine learning models to predict the political leaning of
news articles published by any new news publishers. In this work, we propose a
knowledge-infused deep learning model that utilizes relatively reliable
external data resources to learn unbiased representations of news articles
using their global and local contexts. We evaluate the proposed model by
setting the data in such a way that news domains or news publishers in the test
set are completely unseen during the training phase. With this setup we show
that the proposed model mitigates algorithmic political bias and outperforms
baseline methods to predict the political leaning of news articles with up to
73% accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Given the close association between colorectal cancer and polyps, the
diagnosis and identification of colorectal polyps play a critical role in the
detection and surgical intervention of colorectal cancer. In this context, the
automatic detection and segmentation of polyps from various colonoscopy images
has emerged as a significant problem that has attracted broad attention.
Current polyp segmentation techniques face several challenges: firstly, polyps
vary in size, texture, color, and pattern; secondly, the boundaries between
polyps and mucosa are usually blurred, existing studies have focused on
learning the local features of polyps while ignoring the long-range
dependencies of the features, and also ignoring the local context and global
contextual information of the combined features. To address these challenges,
we propose FLDNet (Foreground-Long-Distance Network), a Transformer-based
neural network that captures long-distance dependencies for accurate polyp
segmentation. Specifically, the proposed model consists of three main modules:
a pyramid-based Transformer encoder, a local context module, and a
foreground-Aware module. Multilevel features with long-distance dependency
information are first captured by the pyramid-based transformer encoder. On the
high-level features, the local context module obtains the local characteristics
related to the polyps by constructing different local context information. The
coarse map obtained by decoding the reconstructed highest-level features guides
the feature fusion process in the foreground-Aware module of the high-level
features to achieve foreground enhancement of the polyps. Our proposed method,
FLDNet, was evaluated using seven metrics on common datasets and demonstrated
superiority over state-of-the-art methods on widely-used evaluation measures.

<p class="mathjax">In order to improve the task execution capability of home service robot, and
to cope with the problem that purely physical robot platforms cannot sense the
environment and make decisions online, a method for building digital twin
system for home service robot based on motion simulation is proposed. A
reliable mapping of the home service robot and its working environment from
physical space to digital space is achieved in three dimensions: geometric,
physical and functional. In this system, a digital space-oriented URDF file
parser is designed and implemented for the automatic construction of the robot
geometric model. Next, the physical model is constructed from the kinematic
equations of the robot and an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is
proposed for the inverse kinematic solution. In addition, to adapt to the home
environment, functional attributes are used to describe household objects, thus
improving the semantic description of the digital space for the real home
environment. Finally, through geometric model consistency verification,
physical model validity verification and virtual-reality consistency
verification, it shows that the digital twin system designed in this paper can
construct the robot geometric model accurately and completely, complete the
operation of household objects successfully, and the digital twin system is
effective and practical.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in dense out-of-distribution (OOD) detection have
primarily focused on scenarios where the training and testing datasets share a
similar domain, with the assumption that no domain shift exists between them.
However, in real-world situations, domain shift often exits and significantly
affects the accuracy of existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection models. In
this work, we propose a dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain
shift and semantic shift jointly. The first level distinguishes whether domain
shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the
second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense
high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to
unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes.
We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation
benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts and those without,
observing consistent performance improvements across various baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">Building autonomous --- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and
adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a
holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime
example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy.
Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal
environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of
an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state
variables representing internal environments from external environments and
adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states.
This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build
autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with
recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for a snake robot to move straight
up a cylindrical surface. Prior works on pole-climbing for a snake robot mainly
utilized a rolling helix gait, and although proven to be efficient, it does not
reassemble movements made by a natural snake. We take inspiration from nature
and seek to imitate the Arboreal Concertina Locomotion (ACL) from real-life
serpents. In order to represent the 3D curves that make up the key motion
patterns of ACL, we establish a set of parametric equations that identify
periodic functions, which produce a sequence of backbone curves. We then build
up the gait equation using the curvature integration method, and finally, we
propose a simple motion estimation strategy using virtual chassis and non-slip
model assumptions. We present experimental results using a 20-DOF snake robot
traversing outside of a straight pipe.

<p class="mathjax">Artistic style transfer aims to create new artistic images by rendering a
given photograph with the target artistic style. Existing methods learn styles
simply based on global statistics or local patches, lacking careful
consideration of the drawing process in practice. Consequently, the stylization
results either fail to capture abundant and diversified local style patterns,
or contain undesired semantic information of the style image and deviate from
the global style distribution. To address this issue, we imitate the drawing
process of humans and propose a Two-Stage Statistics-Aware Transformation
(TSSAT) module, which first builds the global style foundation by aligning the
global statistics of content and style features and then further enriches local
style details by swapping the local statistics (instead of local features) in a
patch-wise manner, significantly improving the stylization effects. Moreover,
to further enhance both content and style representations, we introduce two
novel losses: an attention-based content loss and a patch-based style loss,
where the former enables better content preservation by enforcing the semantic
relation in the content image to be retained during stylization, and the latter
focuses on increasing the local style similarity between the style and stylized
images. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the
effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">The SoccerNet 2023 challenges were the third annual video understanding
challenges organized by the SoccerNet team. For this third edition, the
challenges were composed of seven vision-based tasks split into three main
themes. The first theme, broadcast video understanding, is composed of three
high-level tasks related to describing events occurring in the video
broadcasts: (1) action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related
to global actions in soccer, (2) ball action spotting, focusing on retrieving
all timestamps related to the soccer ball change of state, and (3) dense video
captioning, focusing on describing the broadcast with natural language and
anchored timestamps. The second theme, field understanding, relates to the
single task of (4) camera calibration, focusing on retrieving the intrinsic and
extrinsic camera parameters from images. The third and last theme, player
understanding, is composed of three low-level tasks related to extracting
information about the players: (5) re-identification, focusing on retrieving
the same players across multiple views, (6) multiple object tracking, focusing
on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams, and (7) jersey
number recognition, focusing on recognizing the jersey number of players from
tracklets. Compared to the previous editions of the SoccerNet challenges, tasks
(2-3-7) are novel, including new annotations and data, task (4) was enhanced
with more data and annotations, and task (6) now focuses on end-to-end
approaches. More information on the tasks, challenges, and leaderboards are
available on https://www.soccer-net.org. Baselines and development kits can be
found on https://github.com/SoccerNet.

<p class="mathjax">The kinematics of many control systems, especially in the robotics field,
naturally live on smooth manifolds. Most classical state-estimation algorithms,
including the extended Kalman filter, are posed on Euclidean space. Although
any filter algorithm can be adapted to a manifold setting by implementing it in
local coordinates and ignoring the geometric structure, it has always been
clear that there would be advantages in taking the geometric structure into
consideration in developing the algorithm. In this paper, we argue that the
minimum geometric structure required to adapt the extended Kalman filter to a
manifold is that of an affine connection. With this structure, we show that a
naive coordinate implementation of the EKF fails to account for geometry of the
manifold in the update step and in the reset step. We provide geometric
modifications to the classical EKF based on parallel transport of the
measurement covariance (for the update) and a-posteriori state covariance (for
the reset) that address these limitations. Preliminary results for attitude
estimation with two directional measurements demonstrate that the proposed
modifications significantly improve the transient behavior of the filter.

<p class="mathjax">Many computational linguistic methods have been proposed to study the
information content of languages. We consider two interesting research
questions: 1) how is information distributed over long documents, and 2) how
does content reduction, such as token selection and text summarization, affect
the information density in long documents. We present four criteria for
information density estimation for long documents, including surprisal,
entropy, uniform information density, and lexical density. Among those
criteria, the first three adopt the measures from information theory. We
propose an attention-based word selection method for clinical notes and study
machine summarization for multiple-domain documents. Our findings reveal the
systematic difference in information density of long text in various domains.
Empirical results on automated medical coding from long clinical notes show the
effectiveness of the attention-based word selection method.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the expressive power of deep residual neural networks
idealized as continuous dynamical systems through control theory. Specifically,
we consider two properties that arise from supervised learning, namely
universal interpolation - the ability to match arbitrary input and target
training samples - and the closely related notion of universal approximation -
the ability to approximate input-target functional relationships via flow maps.
Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a
characterisation of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for
essentially any architecture with non-linearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the
relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the
context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be
deduced from each other. At the same time, we identify conditions on the
control family and the target function that ensures the equivalence of the two
notions.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement in high-resolution satellite remote sensing data
acquisition, particularly those achieving submeter precision, has uncovered the
potential for detailed extraction of surface architectural features. However,
the diversity and complexity of surface distributions frequently lead to
current methods focusing exclusively on localized information of surface
features. This often results in significant intraclass variability in boundary
recognition and between buildings. Therefore, the task of fine-grained
extraction of surface features from high-resolution satellite imagery has
emerged as a critical challenge in remote sensing image processing. In this
work, we propose the Feature Aggregation Network (FANet), concentrating on
extracting both global and local features, thereby enabling the refined
extraction of landmark buildings from high-resolution satellite remote sensing
imagery. The Pyramid Vision Transformer captures these global features, which
are subsequently refined by the Feature Aggregation Module and merged into a
cohesive representation by the Difference Elimination Module. In addition, to
ensure a comprehensive feature map, we have incorporated the Receptive Field
Block and Dual Attention Module, expanding the receptive field and intensifying
attention across spatial and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets have validated the outstanding capability of FANet in
extracting features from high-resolution satellite images. This signifies a
major breakthrough in the field of remote sensing image processing. We will
release our code soon.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a Digit-Serial Left-tO-righT (DSLOT) arithmetic based processing
technique called DSLOT-NN with aim to accelerate inference of the convolution
operation in the deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed work has the ability
to assess and terminate the ineffective convolutions which results in massive
power and energy savings. The processing engine is comprised of low-latency
most-significant-digit-first (MSDF) (also called online) multipliers and adders
that processes data from left-to-right, allowing the execution of subsequent
operations in digit-pipelined manner. Use of online operators eliminates the
need for the development of complex mechanism of identifying the negative
activation, as the output with highest weight value is generated first, and the
sign of the result can be identified as soon as first non-zero digit is
generated. The precision of the online operators can be tuned at run-time,
making them extremely useful in situations where accuracy can be compromised
for power and energy savings. The proposed design has been implemented on
Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and is compared with state-of-the-art Stripes on various
performance metrics. The results show the proposed design presents power
savings, has shorter cycle time, and approximately 50% higher OPS per watt.

<p class="mathjax">Technical debt refers to the consequences of sub-optimal decisions made
during software development that prioritize short-term benefits over long-term
maintainability. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a specific form of
technical debt, explicitly documented by developers within software artifacts
such as source code comments and commit messages. As SATD can hinder software
development and maintenance, it is crucial to address and prioritize it
effectively. However, current methodologies lack the ability to automatically
estimate the repayment effort of SATD based on its textual descriptions. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for automatically
estimating SATD repayment effort, utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprising
341,740 SATD items from 2,568,728 commits across 1,060 Apache repositories. Our
findings show that different types of SATD require varying levels of repayment
effort, with code/design, requirement, and test debt demanding greater effort
compared to non-SATD items, while documentation debt requires less. We
introduce and evaluate machine learning methodologies, particularly BERT and
TextCNN, which outperforms classic machine learning methods and the naive
baseline in estimating repayment effort. Additionally, we summarize keywords
associated with varying levels of repayment effort that occur during SATD
repayment. Our contributions aim to enhance the prioritization of SATD
repayment effort and resource allocation efficiency, ultimately benefiting
software development and maintainability.

<p class="mathjax">In different wireless network scenarios, multiple network entities need to
cooperate in order to achieve a common task with minimum delay and energy
consumption. Future wireless networks mandate exchanging high dimensional data
in dynamic and uncertain environments, therefore implementing communication
control tasks becomes challenging and highly complex. Multi-agent reinforcement
learning with emergent communication (EC-MARL) is a promising solution to
address high dimensional continuous control problems with partially observable
states in a cooperative fashion where agents build an emergent communication
protocol to solve complex tasks. This paper articulates the importance of
EC-MARL within the context of future 6G wireless networks, which imbues
autonomous decision-making capabilities into network entities to solve complex
tasks such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, flying base stations
network planning, and smart city applications. An overview of EC-MARL
algorithms and their design criteria are provided while presenting use cases
and research opportunities on this emerging topic.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive learning has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for high-level
vision tasks, which, by introducing properly negative samples, has also been
exploited for low-level vision tasks to achieve a compact optimization space to
account for their ill-posed nature. However, existing methods rely on manually
predefined, task-oriented negatives, which often exhibit pronounced
task-specific biases. In this paper, we propose a innovative approach for the
adaptive generation of negative samples directly from the target model itself,
called ``learning from history``. We introduce the Self-Prior guided Negative
loss for image restoration (SPNIR) to enable this approach. Our approach is
task-agnostic and generic, making it compatible with any existing image
restoration method or task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
retraining existing models with SPNIR. The results show significant
improvements in image restoration across various tasks and architectures. For
example, models retrained with SPNIR outperform the original FFANet and
DehazeFormer by 3.41 dB and 0.57 dB on the RESIDE indoor dataset for image
dehazing. Similarly, they achieve notable improvements of 0.47 dB on SPA-Data
over IDT for image deraining and 0.12 dB on Manga109 for a 4x scale
super-resolution over lightweight SwinIR, respectively. Code and retrained
models are available at

modeling by NeRF has problems in terms of scalability and maintainability when
modeling earth-scale environments. Therefore, to address these problems, we
propose a federated learning pipeline for large-scale modeling with NeRF. We
tailor the model aggregation pipeline in federated learning for NeRF, thereby
allowing local updates of NeRF. In the aggregation step, the accuracy of the
clients' global pose is critical. Thus, we also propose global pose alignment
to align the noisy global pose of clients before the aggregation step. In
experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed pose alignment and the
federated learning pipeline on the large-scale scene dataset, Mill19.

anomalies that deviate from most nodes. However, the model is prone to learn
the pattern of normal samples which make up the majority of samples. Meanwhile,
anomalies can be easily detected when their behaviors differ from normality.
Therefore, the performance can be further improved by enhancing the ability to
learn the normal pattern. To this end, we propose a normality learning-based
GAD framework via multi-scale contrastive learning networks (NLGAD for
abbreviation). Specifically, we first initialize the model with the contrastive
networks on different scales. To provide sufficient and reliable normal nodes
for normality learning, we design an effective hybrid strategy for normality
selection. Finally, the model is refined with the only input of reliable normal
nodes and learns a more accurate estimate of normality so that anomalous nodes
can be more easily distinguished. Eventually, extensive experiments on six
benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our normality
learning-based scheme on GAD. Notably, the proposed algorithm improves the
detection performance (up to 5.89% AUC gain) compared with the state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is released at https://github.com/FelixDJC/NLGAD.

<p class="mathjax">The use of anthropomorphic robotic hands for assisting individuals in
situations where human hands may be unavailable or unsuitable has gained
significant importance. In this paper, we propose a novel task called
human-assisting dexterous grasping that aims to train a policy for controlling
a robotic hand's fingers to assist users in grasping objects. Unlike
conventional dexterous grasping, this task presents a more complex challenge as
the policy needs to adapt to diverse user intentions, in addition to the
object's geometry. We address this challenge by proposing an approach
consisting of two sub-modules: a hand-object-conditional grasping primitive
called Grasping Gradient Field~(GraspGF), and a history-conditional residual
policy. GraspGF learns `how' to grasp by estimating the gradient from a success
grasping example set, while the residual policy determines `when' and at what
speed the grasping action should be executed based on the trajectory history.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method
compared to baselines, highlighting the user-awareness and practicality in
real-world applications. The codes and demonstrations can be viewed at

<p class="mathjax">Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are a popular technique for autonomous
exploration of mobile robots. However, the random sampling used by RRTs can
result in inefficient and inaccurate frontiers extraction, which affects the
exploration performance. To address the issues of slow path planning and high
path cost, we propose a framework that uses a generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD)
based multi-choice strategy for robot exploration. Our framework consists of
three components: a novel mapping model that uses an end-to-end neural network
to construct GVDs of the environments in real time; a GVD-based heuristic
scheme that accelerates frontiers extraction and reduces frontiers redundancy;
and a multi-choice frontiers assignment scheme that considers different types
of frontiers and enables the robot to make rational decisions during the
exploration process. We evaluate our method on simulation and real-world
experiments and show that it outperforms RRT-based exploration methods in terms
of efficiency and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Sizing optimization of truss structures is a complex computational problem,
and the reinforcement learning (RL) is suitable for dealing with multimodal
problems without gradient computations. In this paper, a new efficient
optimization algorithm called update Monte Carlo tree search (UMCTS) is
developed to obtain the appropriate design for truss structures. UMCTS is an
RL-based method that combines the novel update process and Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS) with the upper confidence bound (UCB). Update process means that
in each round, the optimal cross-sectional area of each member is determined by
search tree, and its initial state is the final state in the previous round. In
the UMCTS algorithm, an accelerator for the number of selections for member
area and iteration number is introduced to reduce the computation time.
Moreover, for each state, the average reward is replaced by the best reward
collected on the simulation process to determine the optimal solution. The
proposed optimization method is examined on some benchmark problems of planar
and spatial trusses with discrete sizing variables to demonstrate the
efficiency and validity. It is shown that the computation time for the proposed
approach is at least ten times faster than the branch and bound (BB) method.
The numerical results indicate that the proposed method stably achieves better
solution than other conventional methods.

<p class="mathjax">The negative impact of label noise is well studied in classical supervised
learning yet remains an open research question in meta-learning. Meta-learners
aim to adapt to unseen learning tasks by learning a good initial model in
meta-training and consecutively fine-tuning it according to new tasks during
meta-testing. In this paper, we present the first extensive analysis of the
impact of varying levels of label noise on the performance of state-of-the-art
meta-learners, specifically gradient-based $N$-way $K$-shot learners. We show
that the accuracy of Reptile, iMAML, and foMAML drops by up to 42% on the
Omniglot and CifarFS datasets when meta-training is affected by label noise. To
strengthen the resilience against label noise, we propose two sampling
techniques, namely manifold (Man) and batch manifold (BatMan), which transform
the noisy supervised learners into semi-supervised ones to increase the utility
of noisy labels. We first construct manifold samples of $N$-way
$2$-contrastive-shot tasks through augmentation, learning the embedding via a
contrastive loss in meta-training, and then perform classification through
zeroing on the embedding in meta-testing. We show that our approach can
effectively mitigate the impact of meta-training label noise. Even with 60%
wrong labels \batman and \man can limit the meta-testing accuracy drop to
${2.5}$, ${9.4}$, ${1.1}$ percent points, respectively, with existing
meta-learners across the Omniglot, CifarFS, and MiniImagenet datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Real-time semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a challenging
task that requires a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. It has
many applications including tracking forest fires, detecting changes in land
use and land cover, crop health monitoring, and so on. With the success of
efficient deep learning methods (i.e., efficient deep neural networks) for
real-time semantic segmentation in computer vision, researchers have adopted
these efficient deep neural networks in remote sensing image analysis. This
paper begins with a summary of the fundamental compression methods for
designing efficient deep neural networks and provides a brief but comprehensive
survey, outlining the recent developments in real-time semantic segmentation of
remote sensing imagery. We examine several seminal efficient deep learning
methods, placing them in a taxonomy based on the network architecture design
approach. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality and efficiency of some existing
efficient deep neural networks on a publicly available remote sensing semantic
segmentation benchmark dataset, the OpenEarthMap. The experimental results of
an extensive comparative study demonstrate that most of the existing efficient
deep neural networks have good segmentation quality, but they suffer low
inference speed (i.e., high latency rate), which may limit their capability of
deployment in real-time applications of remote sensing image segmentation. We
provide some insights into the current trend and future research directions for
real-time semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel online learning method that aims at finding a
separator hyperplane between data points labelled as either positive or
negative. Since weights and biases of artificial neurons can directly be
related to hyperplanes in high-dimensional spaces, the technique is applicable
to train perceptron-based binary classifiers in machine learning. In case of
large or imbalanced data sets, use of analytical or gradient-based solutions
can become prohibitive and impractical, where heuristics and approximation
techniques are still applicable. The proposed method is based on the Perceptron
algorithm, however, it tunes neuron weights in just the necessary extent during
searching the separator hyperplane. Due to an appropriate transformation of the
initial data set we need not to consider data labels, neither the bias term.

presented method has proven converge; empirical results show that it can be
more efficient than the Perceptron algorithm, especially, when the size of the
data set exceeds data dimensionality.

<p class="mathjax">A key need in different disciplines is to perform analytics over fast-paced
data streams, similar in nature to the traditional OLAP analytics in relational
databases i.e., with filters and aggregates. Storing unbounded streams,
however, is not a realistic, or desired approach due to the high storage
requirements, and the delays introduced when storing massive data. Accordingly,
many synopses/sketches have been proposed that can summarize the stream in
small memory (usually sufficiently small to be stored in RAM), such that
aggregate queries can be efficiently approximated, without storing the full
stream. However, past synopses predominantly focus on summarizing
single-attribute streams, and cannot handle filters and constraints on
arbitrary subsets of multiple attributes efficiently. In this work, we propose
OmniSketch, the first sketch that scales to fast-paced and complex data streams
(with many attributes), and supports aggregates with filters on multiple
attributes, dynamically chosen at query time. The sketch offers probabilistic
guarantees, a favorable space-accuracy tradeoff, and a worst-case logarithmic
complexity for updating and for query execution. We demonstrate experimentally
with both real and synthetic data that the sketch outperforms the
state-of-the-art, and that it can approximate complex ad-hoc queries within the
configured accuracy guarantees, with small memory requirements.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning, i.e., learning from in-context samples, is an impressive
ability of Transformer. However, the mechanism driving the in-context learning
is not yet fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate from an
underexplored perspective of representation learning. The representation is
more complex for in-context learning senario, where the representation can be
impacted by both model weights and in-context samples. We refer the above two
conceptually aspects of representation as in-weight component and in-context
component, respectively. To study how the two components affect in-context
learning capabilities, we construct a novel synthetic task, making it possible
to device two probes, in-weights probe and in-context probe, to evaluate the
two components, respectively. We demonstrate that the goodness of in-context
component is highly related to the in-context learning performance, which
indicates the entanglement between in-context learning and representation
learning. Furthermore, we find that a good in-weights component can actually
benefit the learning of the in-context component, indicating that in-weights
learning should be the foundation of in-context learning. To further understand
the the in-context learning mechanism and importance of the in-weights
component, we proof by construction that a simple Transformer, which uses
pattern matching and copy-past mechanism to perform in-context learning, can
match the in-context learning performance with more complex, best tuned
Transformer under the perfect in-weights component assumption. In short, those
discoveries from representation learning perspective shed light on new
approaches to improve the in-context capacity.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to unprecedented progress in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Owing to limited data and computation
resources, using third-party data and models has become a new paradigm for
adapting various tasks. However, research shows that it has some potential
security vulnerabilities because attackers can manipulate the training process
and data source. Such a way can set specific triggers, making the model exhibit
expected behaviors that have little inferior influence on the model's
performance for primitive tasks, called backdoor attacks. Hence, it could have
dire consequences, especially considering that the backdoor attack surfaces are
broad.
<br />To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, a systematic and
comprehensive review is required to confront various security challenges from
different phases and attack purposes. Additionally, there is a dearth of
analysis and comparison of the various emerging backdoor countermeasures in
this situation.In this paper, we conduct a timely review of backdoor attacks
and countermeasures to sound the red alarm for the NLP security community.
According to the affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack
surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into three
categorizations: attacking pre-trained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or
prompt-tuning (APMP), and attacking final model with training (AFMT), where
AFMT can be subdivided into different attack aims. Thus, attacks under each
categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general
classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Overall, the research on the
defense side is far behind the attack side, and there is no single defense that
can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. An attacker can intelligently bypass
existing defenses with a more invisible attack. ......

<p class="mathjax">Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to reduce manual debugging efforts
for developers and improve software reliability. While conventional
search-based techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy
assumption to mine fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep
learning (DL) based approaches to automate the program repair process in a
data-driven manner. However, their performance is often limited by a fixed set
of parameters to model the highly complex search space of APR. To ease such
burden on the parametric models, in this work, we propose a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen) by explicitly
leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous bug-fix
pairs. Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both
lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a
language-agnostic manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In
addition, we adapt a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our foundation model
to facilitate both patch retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We
adopt a stage-wise approach where the patch retriever first retrieves a
relevant external bug-fix pair to augment the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch
generator, which synthesizes a ranked list of repair patch candidates. Notably,
RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can flexibly integrate different patch
retrievers and generators to repair various types of bugs. We thoroughly
evaluate RAP-Gen on three benchmarks in two programming languages, including
the TFix benchmark in JavaScript, and Code Refinement and Defects4J benchmarks
in Java, where the bug localization information may or may not be provided.
Experimental results show that RAP-Gen significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art approaches on all benchmarks, e.g., repairing 15 more bugs on
818 Defects4J bugs.

<p class="mathjax">Fair machine learning is a thriving and vibrant research topic. In this
paper, we propose Fairness as a Service (FaaS), a secure, verifiable and
privacy-preserving protocol to computes and verify the fairness of any machine
learning (ML) model. In the deisgn of FaaS, the data and outcomes are
represented through cryptograms to ensure privacy. Also, zero knowledge proofs
guarantee the well-formedness of the cryptograms and underlying data. FaaS is
model--agnostic and can support various fairness metrics; hence, it can be used
as a service to audit the fairness of any ML model. Our solution requires no
trusted third party or private channels for the computation of the fairness
metric. The security guarantees and commitments are implemented in a way that
every step is securely transparent and verifiable from the start to the end of
the process. The cryptograms of all input data are publicly available for
everyone, e.g., auditors, social activists and experts, to verify the
correctness of the process. We implemented FaaS to investigate performance and
demonstrate the successful use of FaaS for a publicly available data set with
thousands of entries.

<p class="mathjax">Landslides are a common natural disaster that can cause casualties, property
safety threats and economic losses. Therefore, it is important to understand or
predict the probability of landslide occurrence at potentially risky sites. A
commonly used means is to carry out a landslide susceptibility assessment based
on a landslide inventory and a set of landslide contributing factors. This can
be readily achieved using machine learning (ML) models such as logistic
regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme
gradient boosting (Xgboost), or deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional
neural network (CNN) and long short time memory (LSTM). As the input data for
these models, landslide contributing factors have varying influences on
landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is logically feasible to select more
important contributing factors and eliminate less relevant ones, with the aim
of increasing the prediction accuracy of these models. However, selecting more
important factors is still a challenging task and there is no generally
accepted method. Furthermore, the effects of factor selection using various
methods on the prediction accuracy of ML and DL models are unclear. In this
study, the impact of the selection of contributing factors on the accuracy of
landslide susceptibility predictions using ML and DL models was investigated.
Four methods for selecting contributing factors were considered for all the
aforementioned ML and DL models, which included Information Gain Ratio (IGR),
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators (LASSO) and Harris Hawk Optimization
(HHO). In addition, autoencoder-based factor selection methods for DL models
were also investigated. To assess their performances, an exhaustive approach
was adopted,...

<p class="mathjax">Private closeness testing asks to decide whether the underlying probability
distributions of two sensitive datasets are identical or differ significantly
in statistical distance, while guaranteeing (differential) privacy of the data.
As in most (if not all) distribution testing questions studied under privacy
constraints, however, previous work assumes that the two datasets are equally
sensitive, i.e., must be provided the same privacy guarantees. This is often an
unrealistic assumption, as different sources of data come with different
privacy requirements; as a result, known closeness testing algorithms might be
unnecessarily conservative, ``paying'' too high a privacy budget for half of
the data.
<br />In this work, we initiate the study of the closeness testing problem under
heterogeneous privacy constraints, where the two datasets come with distinct
privacy requirements.

<p class="mathjax">To fight climate change, new "green" technology are emerging, most of them
using electricity as a power source. Among the solutions, Electric Vehicles
(EVs) represent a central asset in the future transport system. EVs require a
complex infrastructure to enable the so-called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm
to manage the charging process between the smart grid and the EV. In this
paradigm, the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), or charging station, is
the end device that authenticates the vehicle and delivers the power to charge
it. However, since an EVSE is publicly exposed and connected to the Internet,
recent works show how an attacker with physical tampering and remote access can
target an EVSE, exposing the security of the entire infrastructure and the
final user. For this reason, it is important to develop novel strategies to
secure such infrastructures. In this paper we present HoneyEVSE, the first
honeypot conceived to simulate an EVSE. HoneyEVSE can simulate with high
fidelity the EV charging process and, at the same time, enables a user to
interact with it through a dashboard. Furthermore, based on other charging
columns exposed on the Internet, we emulate the login and device information
pages to increase user engagement. We exposed HoneyEVSE for 30 days to the
Internet to assess its capability and measured the interaction received with
its Shodan Honeyscore. Results show that HoneyEVSE can successfully evade the
Shodan honeyscore metric while attracting a high number of interactions on the
exposed services.

<p class="mathjax">Given a stable linear time-invariant (LTI) system subject to output
constraints, we present a method to compute a set of disturbances such that the
reachable set of outputs matches as closely as possible the output constraint
set, while being included in it. This problem finds application in several
control design problems, such as the development of hierarchical control loops,
decentralized control, supervisory control, robustness-verification, etc. We
first characterize the set of disturbance sets satisfying the output constraint
inclusion using corresponding minimal robust positive invariant (mRPI) sets,
following which we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the
distance between the reachable output set and the output constraint set. We
tackle the optimization problem using an implicit RPI set approach that
provides a priori approximation error guarantees, and adopt a novel disturbance
set parameterization that permits the encoding of the set of feasible
disturbance sets as a polyhedron. Through extensive numerical examples, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach computes disturbance sets with reduced
conservativeness improved computational efficiency than state-of-the-art
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in healthcare and other
domains due to their ability to process multi-modal and multi-relational
graphs. However, efficient training of GNNs remains challenging, with several
open research questions. In this paper, we investigate how the flow of
embedding information within GNNs affects the prediction of links in Knowledge
Graphs (KGs). Specifically, we propose a mathematical model that decouples the
GNN connectivity from the connectivity of the graph data and evaluate the
performance of GNNs in a clinical triage use case. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating domain knowledge into the GNN connectivity leads to better
performance than using the same connectivity as the KG or allowing
unconstrained embedding propagation. Moreover, we show that negative edges play
a crucial role in achieving good predictions, and that using too many GNN
layers can degrade performance.

<p class="mathjax">Power grids are moving towards 100% renewable energy source bulk power grids,
and the overall dynamics of power system operations and electricity markets are
changing. The electricity markets are not only dispatching resources
economically but also taking into account various controllable actions like
renewable curtailment, transmission congestion mitigation, and energy storage
optimization to ensure grid reliability. As a result, price formations in
electricity markets have become quite complex. Traditional root cause analysis
and statistical approaches are rendered inapplicable to analyze and infer the
main drivers behind price formation in the modern grid and markets with
variable renewable energy (VRE). In this paper, we propose a machine
learning-based analysis framework to deconstruct the primary drivers for price
spike events in modern electricity markets with high renewable energy. The
outcomes can be utilized for various critical aspects of market design,
renewable dispatch and curtailment, operations, and cyber-security
applications. The framework can be applied to any ISO or market data; however,
in this paper, it is applied to open-source publicly available datasets from
California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and ISO New England (ISO-NE).

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the emergence of
novel abilities with scale have necessitated the construction of holistic,
diverse and challenging benchmarks such as HELM and BIG-bench. However, at the
moment, most of these benchmarks focus only on performance in English and
evaluations that include Southeast Asian (SEA) languages are few in number. We
therefore propose BHASA, a holistic linguistic and cultural evaluation suite
for LLMs in SEA languages. It comprises three components: (1) a NLP benchmark
covering eight tasks across Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Generation
(NLG) and Reasoning (NLR) tasks, (2) LINDSEA, a linguistic diagnostic toolkit
that spans the gamut of linguistic phenomena including syntax, semantics and
pragmatics, and (3) a cultural diagnostics dataset that probes for both
cultural representation and sensitivity. For this preliminary effort, we
implement the NLP benchmark only for Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Tamil,
and we only include Indonesian and Tamil for LINDSEA and the cultural
diagnostics dataset. As GPT-4 is purportedly one of the best-performing
multilingual LLMs at the moment, we use it as a yardstick to gauge the
capabilities of LLMs in the context of SEA languages. Our initial experiments
on GPT-4 with BHASA find it lacking in various aspects of linguistic
capabilities, cultural representation and sensitivity in the targeted SEA
languages. BHASA is a work in progress and will continue to be improved and
expanded in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Continuous unsupervised representation learning (CURL) research has greatly
benefited from improvements in self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques. As a
result, existing CURL methods using SSL can learn high-quality representations
without any labels, but with a notable performance drop when learning on a
many-tasks data stream. We hypothesize that this is caused by the
regularization losses that are imposed to prevent forgetting, leading to a
suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off: they either do not adapt fully to
the incoming data (low plasticity), or incur significant forgetting when
allowed to fully adapt to a new SSL pretext-task (low stability). In this work,
we propose to train an expert network that is relieved of the duty of keeping
the previous knowledge and can focus on performing optimally on the new tasks
(optimizing plasticity). In the second phase, we combine this new knowledge
with the previous network in an adaptation-retrospection phase to avoid
forgetting and initialize a new expert with the knowledge of the old network.
We perform several experiments showing that our proposed approach outperforms
other CURL exemplar-free methods in few- and many-task split settings.
Furthermore, we show how to adapt our approach to semi-supervised continual
learning (Semi-SCL) and show that we surpass the accuracy of other
exemplar-free Semi-SCL methods and reach the results of some others that use
exemplars.

<p class="mathjax">The cross-lingual transfer is a promising technique to solve tasks in
less-resourced languages. In this empirical study, we compare two fine-tuning
approaches combined with zero-shot and full-shot learning approaches for large
language models in a cross-lingual setting. As fine-tuning strategies, we
compare parameter-efficient adapter methods with fine-tuning of all parameters.
As cross-lingual transfer strategies, we compare the intermediate-training
(\textit{IT}) that uses each language sequentially and cross-lingual validation
(\textit{CLV}) that uses a target language already in the validation phase of
fine-tuning. We assess the success of transfer and the extent of catastrophic
forgetting in a source language due to cross-lingual transfer, i.e., how much
previously acquired knowledge is lost when we learn new information in a
different language. The results on two different classification problems, hate
speech detection and product reviews, each containing datasets in several
languages, show that the \textit{IT} cross-lingual strategy outperforms
\textit{CLV} for the target language. Our findings indicate that, in the
majority of cases, the \textit{CLV} strategy demonstrates superior retention of
knowledge in the base language (English) compared to the \textit{IT} strategy,
when evaluating catastrophic forgetting in multiple cross-lingual transfers.

<p class="mathjax">An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning,
concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour
for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by
means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding
by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude
the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic
techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of
elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to
encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we
present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and
certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for
control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate
control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal
guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype
software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and
certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.

indicator of overtraining, illness, or other health issues. In this article, we
present an automated method for estimating exercise-induced fatigue levels
through the use of thermal imaging and facial analysis techniques utilizing
deep learning models. Leveraging a novel dataset comprising over 400,000
thermal facial images of rested and fatigued users, our results suggest that
exercise-induced fatigue levels could be predicted with only one static thermal
frame with an average error smaller than 15\%. The results emphasize the

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in
sequential decision-making problems. However, existing DRL agents make
decisions in an opaque fashion, hindering the user from establishing trust and
scrutinizing weaknesses of the agents. While recent research has developed
Interpretable Policy Extraction (IPE) methods for explaining how an agent takes
actions, their explanations are often inconsistent with the agent's behavior
and thus, frequently fail to explain. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
method, Fidelity-Induced Policy Extraction (FIPE). Specifically, we start by
analyzing the optimization mechanism of existing IPE methods, elaborating on
the issue of ignoring consistency while increasing cumulative rewards. We then
design a fidelity-induced mechanism by integrate a fidelity measurement into
the reinforcement learning feedback. We conduct experiments in the complex
control environment of StarCraft II, an arena typically avoided by current IPE
methods. The experiment results demonstrate that FIPE outperforms the baselines
in terms of interaction performance and consistency, meanwhile easy to
understand.

<p class="mathjax">The growing integration of distributed energy resources into distribution
systems poses challenges for voltage regulation. Dynamic VAR Compensators
(DVCs) are a new generation of power electronics-based Volt/VAR compensation
devices designed to address voltage issues in distribution systems with a high
penetration of renewable generation resources. Currently, the IEEE Std.
1547-based Volt/VAR Curve (VV-C) is widely used as the local control scheme for
controlling a DVC. However, the effectiveness of this scheme is not well
documented, and there is limited literature on alternative control and
placement schemes that can maximize the effective use of a DVC. In this paper,
we propose an optimal dispatch and control mechanism to enhance the
conventional VV-C based localized DVC control. First, we establish a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the optimal dispatch
strategy and suitable placement for the DVC. Next, we introduce two supervisory
control strategies to determine the appropriate instances for adjusting the
VV-C when the operating condition changes. The outlined scheme comprises two
primary stages: time segmentation and VV-C fitting. Within this framework, each
time segment aims to produce optimized Q-V trajectories. The proposed method is
tested on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system using OpenDSS for a wide range of
operating scenarios, including sunny and cloudy days. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively reduces voltage variations
compared to the standard VV-C specified in IEEE Std. 1547.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting which specific parts of a video users will replay is important for
several applications, including targeted advertisement placement on video
platforms and assisting video creators. In this work, we explore whether it is
possible to predict the Most Replayed (MR) data from YouTube videos. To this
end, we curate a large video benchmark, the YTMR500 dataset, which comprises
500 YouTube videos with MR data annotations. We evaluate Deep Learning (DL)
models of varying complexity on our dataset and perform an extensive ablation
study. In addition, we conduct a user study to estimate the human performance
on MR data prediction. Our results show that, although by a narrow margin, all
the evaluated DL models outperform random predictions. Additionally, they
exceed human-level accuracy. This suggests that predicting the MR data is a
difficult task that can be enhanced through the assistance of DL. Finally, we
believe that DL performance on MR data prediction can be further improved, for
example, by using multi-modal learning. We encourage the research community to
use our benchmark dataset to further investigate automatic MR data prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Taxonomy expansion task is essential in organizing the ever-increasing volume
of new concepts into existing taxonomies. Most existing methods focus
exclusively on using textual semantics, leading to an inability to generalize
to unseen terms and the "Prototypical Hypernym Problem." In this paper, we
propose Visual Taxonomy Expansion (VTE), introducing visual features into the
taxonomy expansion task. We propose a textual hypernymy learning task and a
visual prototype learning task to cluster textual and visual semantics. In
addition to the tasks on respective modalities, we introduce a hyper-proto
constraint that integrates textual and visual semantics to produce fine-grained
visual semantics. Our method is evaluated on two datasets, where we obtain
compelling results. Specifically, on the Chinese taxonomy dataset, our method
significantly improves accuracy by 8.75 %. Additionally, our approach performs
better than ChatGPT on the Chinese taxonomy dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We present an automated and efficient approach for retrieving high-quality
CAD models of objects and their poses in a scene captured by a moving RGB-D
camera. We first investigate various objective functions to measure similarity
between a candidate CAD object model and the available data, and the best
objective function appears to be a "render-and-compare" method comparing depth
and mask rendering. We thus introduce a fast-search method that approximates an
exhaustive search based on this objective function for simultaneously
retrieving the object category, a CAD model, and the pose of an object given an
approximate 3D bounding box. This method involves a search tree that organizes
the CAD models and object properties including object category and pose for
fast retrieval and an algorithm inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, that
efficiently searches this tree. We show that this method retrieves CAD models
that fit the real objects very well, with a speed-up factor of 10x to 120x
compared to exhaustive search.

<p class="mathjax">Media houses reporting on public figures, often come with their own biases
stemming from their respective worldviews. A characterization of these
underlying patterns helps us in better understanding and interpreting news
stories. For this, we need diverse or subjective summarizations, which may not
be amenable for classifying into predefined class labels. This work proposes a
zero-shot approach for non-extractive or generative characterizations of person
entities from a corpus using GPT-2. We use well-articulated articles from
several well-known news media houses as a corpus to build a sound argument for
this approach. First, we fine-tune a GPT-2 pre-trained language model with a
corpus where specific person entities are characterized. Second, we further
fine-tune this with demonstrations of person entity characterizations, created
from a corpus of programmatically constructed characterizations. This twice
fine-tuned model is primed with manual prompts consisting of entity names that
were not previously encountered in the second fine-tuning, to generate a simple
sentence about the entity. The results were encouraging, when compared against
actual characterizations from the corpus.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous inspection tasks necessitate effective path-planning mechanisms to
efficiently gather observations from points of interest (POI). However,
localization errors commonly encountered in urban environments can introduce
execution uncertainty, posing challenges to the successful completion of such
tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present IRIS-under uncertainty
(IRIS-U^2), an extension of the incremental random inspection-roadmap search
(IRIS) algorithm, that addresses the offline planning problem via an A*-based
approach, where the planning process occurs prior the online execution. The key
insight behind IRIS-U^2 is transforming the computed localization uncertainty,
obtained through Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, into a POI probability. IRIS-U^2
offers insights into the expected performance of the execution task by
providing confidence intervals (CI) for the expected coverage, expected path
length, and collision probability, which becomes progressively tighter as the
number of MC samples increase. The efficacy of IRIS-U^2 is demonstrated through
a case study focusing on structural inspections of bridges. Our approach
exhibits improved expected coverage, reduced collision probability, and yields
increasingly-precise CIs as the number of MC samples grows. Furthermore, we
emphasize the potential advantages of computing bounded sub-optimal solutions
to reduce computation time while still maintaining the same CI boundaries.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation of ground robots on uneven terrain is being considered
in more and more tasks. However, uneven terrain will bring two problems to
motion planning: how to assess the traversability of the terrain and how to
cope with the dynamics model of the robot associated with the terrain. The
trajectories generated by existing methods are often too conservative or cannot
be tracked well by the controller since the second problem is not well solved.
In this paper, we propose terrain pose mapping to describe the impact of
terrain on the robot. With this mapping, we can obtain the SE(3) state of the
robot on uneven terrain for a given state in SE(2). Then, based on it, we
present a trajectory optimization framework for car-like robots on uneven
terrain that can consider both of the above problems. The trajectories
generated by our method conform to the dynamics model of the system without
being overly conservative and yet able to be tracked well by the controller. We
perform simulations and real-world experiments to validate the efficiency and
trajectory quality of our algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to extract and integrate the
complementary information in two different modalities to generate high-quality
fused images with salient targets and abundant texture details. However,
current image fusion methods go to great lengths to excavate complementary
features, which is generally achieved through two efforts. On the one hand, the
feature extraction network is expected to have excellent performance in
extracting complementary information. On the other hand, complex fusion
strategies are often designed to aggregate the complementary information. In
other words, enabling the network to perceive and extract complementary
information is extremely challenging. Complicated fusion strategies, while
effective, still run the risk of losing weak edge details. To this end, this
paper rethinks the IVIF outside the box, proposing a complementary-redundant
information transfer network (C-RITNet). It reasonably transfers complementary
information into redundant one, which integrates both the shared and
complementary features from two modalities. Hence, the proposed method is able
to alleviate the challenges posed by the complementary information extraction
and reduce the reliance on sophisticated fusion strategies. Specifically, to
skillfully sidestep aggregating complementary information in IVIF, we first
design the mutual information transfer (MIT) module to mutually represent
features from two modalities, roughly transferring complementary information
into redundant one. Then, a redundant information acquisition supervised by
source image (RIASSI) module is devised to further ensure the
complementary-redundant information transfer after MIT. Meanwhile, we also
propose a structure information preservation (SIP) module to guarantee that the
edge structure information of the source images can be transferred to the
fusion results.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating the disruptive nature of academic ideas is a new area of research
evaluation that moves beyond standard citation-based metrics by taking into
account the broader citation context of publications or patents. The "$CD$
index" and a number of related indicators have been proposed in order to
characterise mathematically the disruptiveness of scientific publications or
patents. This research area has generated a lot of attention in recent years,
yet there is no general consensus on the significance and reliability of
disruption indices. More experimentation and evaluation would be desirable,
however is hampered by the fact that these indicators are expensive and
time-consuming to calculate, especially if done at scale on large citation
networks. We present a novel method to calculate disruption indices that
leverages the Dimensions cloud-based research infrastructure and reduces the
computational time taken to produce such indices by an order of magnitude, as
well as making available such functionalities within an online environment that
requires no set-up efforts. We explain the novel algorithm and describe how its
results align with preexisting implementations of disruption indicators. This
method will enable researchers to develop, validate and improve mathematical
disruption models more quickly and with more precision, thus contributing to
the development of this new research area.

<br />This paper presents a technique to support precise name-based navigation of
language specifications in online repositories using ordinary web browsers. The
idea is to generate hyperlinked twins: websites where verbatim copies of

declarations. By generating hyperlinks directly from the name binding analysis
used internally in a language workbench, online navigation in hyperlinked twins
is automatically consistent with local navigation.
<br />The presented technique has been implemented for the Spoofax language
workbench, and used to generate hyperlinked twin websites from various language
specifications in Spoofax meta-languages. However, the applicability of the
technique is not limited to Spoofax, and developers of other language
workbenches could presumably implement similar tooling, to make their language
specifications more accessible to those who do not have the workbench

<p class="mathjax">Parameter efficient transfer learning (PETL) is an emerging research spot
that aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Recent
advances have achieved great success in saving storage and computation costs.
However, these methods do not take into account instance-specific visual clues
for visual tasks. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Visual Prompt Tuning
framework (DVPT), which can generate a dynamic instance-wise token for each
image. In this way, it can capture the unique visual feature of each image,
which can be more suitable for downstream visual tasks. We designed a Meta-Net
module that can generate learnable prompts based on each image, thereby
capturing dynamic instance-wise visual features. Extensive experiments on a
wide range of downstream recognition tasks show that DVPT achieves superior
performance than other PETL methods. More importantly, DVPT even outperforms
full fine-tuning on 17 out of 19 downstream tasks while maintaining high
parameter efficiency. Our code will be released soon.

<p class="mathjax">In algorithms for solving optimization problems constrained to a smooth
manifold, retractions are a well established tool to ensure that the iterates
stay on the manifold. More recently, it has been demonstrated that retractions
are a useful concept for other computational tasks on manifold as well,
including interpolation tasks. In this work, we consider the application of
retractions to the numerical integration of differential equations on
fixed-rank matrix manifolds. This is closely related to dynamical low-rank
approximation (DLRA) techniques. In fact, any retraction leads to a numerical
integrator and, vice versa, certain DLRA techniques bear a direct relation with
retractions. As an example for the latter, we introduce a new retraction,
called KLS retraction, that is derived from the so-called unconventional
integrator for DLRA. We also illustrate how retractions can be used to recover
known DLRA techniques and to design new ones. In particular, this work
introduces two novel numerical integration schemes that apply to differential
equations on general manifolds: the accelerated forward Euler (AFE) method and
the Ralston-Hermite (RH) method. Both methods build on retractions by using
them as a tool for approximating curves on manifolds. The two methods are
proven to have local truncation error of order three. Numerical experiments on
classical DLRA examples highlight the advantages and shortcomings of these new
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has bolstered gaze estimation techniques, but real-world
deployment has been impeded by inadequate training datasets. This problem is
exacerbated by both hardware-induced variations in eye images and inherent
biological differences across the recorded participants, leading to both
feature and pixel-level variance that hinders the generalizability of models
trained on specific datasets. While synthetic datasets can be a solution, their
creation is both time and resource-intensive. To address this problem, we
present a framework called Light Eyes or "LEyes" which, unlike conventional
photorealistic methods, only models key image features required for video-based
eye tracking using simple light distributions. LEyes facilitates easy
configuration for training neural networks across diverse gaze-estimation
tasks. We demonstrate that models trained using LEyes outperform other
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of pupil and CR localization across
well-known datasets. In addition, a LEyes trained model outperforms the
industry standard eye tracker using significantly more cost-effective hardware.
Going forward, we are confident that LEyes will revolutionize synthetic data
generation for gaze estimation models, and lead to significant improvements of
the next generation video-based eye trackers.

<p class="mathjax">Action anticipation involves forecasting future actions by connecting past
events to future ones. However, this reasoning ignores the real-life hierarchy
of events which is considered to be composed of three main parts: past,
present, and future. We argue that considering these three main parts and their
dependencies could improve performance. On the other hand, online action
detection is the task of predicting actions in a streaming manner. In this
case, one has access only to the past and present information. Therefore, in
online action detection (OAD) the existing approaches miss semantics or future
information which limits their performance. To sum up, for both of these tasks,
the complete set of knowledge (past-present-future) is missing, which makes it
challenging to infer action dependencies, therefore having low performances. To
address this limitation, we propose to fuse both tasks into a single uniform
architecture. By combining action anticipation and online action detection, our
approach can cover the missing dependencies of future information in online
action detection. This method referred to as JOADAA, presents a uniform model
that jointly performs action anticipation and online action detection. We
validate our proposed model on three challenging datasets: THUMOS'14, which is
a sparsely annotated dataset with one action per time step, CHARADES, and
Multi-THUMOS, two densely annotated datasets with more complex scenarios.
JOADAA achieves SOTA results on these benchmarks for both tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Search methods based on Pretrained Language Models (PLM) have demonstrated
great effectiveness gains compared to statistical and early neural ranking
models. However, fine-tuning PLM-based rankers requires a great amount of
annotated training data. Annotating data involves a large manual effort and
thus is expensive, especially in domain specific tasks. In this paper we
investigate fine-tuning PLM-based rankers under limited training data and
budget. We investigate two scenarios: fine-tuning a ranker from scratch, and
domain adaptation starting with a ranker already fine-tuned on general data,
and continuing fine-tuning on a target dataset. We observe a great variability
in effectiveness when fine-tuning on different randomly selected subsets of
training data. This suggests that it is possible to achieve effectiveness gains
by actively selecting a subset of the training data that has the most positive
effect on the rankers. This way, it would be possible to fine-tune effective
PLM rankers at a reduced annotation budget. To investigate this, we adapt
existing Active Learning (AL) strategies to the task of fine-tuning PLM rankers
and investigate their effectiveness, also considering annotation and
computational costs. Our extensive analysis shows that AL strategies do not
significantly outperform random selection of training subsets in terms of
effectiveness. We further find that gains provided by AL strategies come at the
expense of more assessments (thus higher annotation costs) and AL strategies
underperform random selection when comparing effectiveness given a fixed
annotation cost. Our results highlight that ``optimal'' subsets of training
data that provide high effectiveness at low annotation cost do exist, but
current mainstream AL strategies applied to PLM rankers are not capable of
identifying them.

subjectivity in texts. We first introduce the expert system VAGO, we illustrate
it on a small benchmark of fact vs. opinion sentences, and then test it on the
larger French press corpus FreSaDa to confirm the higher prevalence of
subjective markers in satirical vs. regular texts. We then build a neural clone
of VAGO, based on a BERT-like architecture, trained on the symbolic VAGO scores
obtained on FreSaDa. Using explainability tools (LIME), we show the interest of
this neural version for the enrichment of the lexicons of the symbolic version,

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion (SD), lately have shown
remarkable ability in high-quality content generation, and become one of the
representatives for the recent wave of transformative AI. Nevertheless, such
advance comes with an intensifying concern about the misuse of this generative
technology, especially for producing copyrighted or NSFW (i.e. not safe for
work) images. Although efforts have been made to filter inappropriate
images/prompts or remove undesirable concepts/styles via model fine-tuning, the
reliability of these safety mechanisms against diversified problematic prompts
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Prompting4Debugging (P4D)
as a debugging and red-teaming tool that automatically finds problematic
prompts for diffusion models to test the reliability of a deployed safety
mechanism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our P4D tool in uncovering new
vulnerabilities of SD models with safety mechanisms. Particularly, our result
shows that around half of prompts in existing safe prompting benchmarks which
were originally considered "safe" can actually be manipulated to bypass many
deployed safety mechanisms, including concept removal, negative prompt, and
safety guidance. Our findings suggest that, without comprehensive testing, the
evaluations on limited safe prompting benchmarks can lead to a false sense of
safety for text-to-image models.

<p class="mathjax">There are ubiquitous distribution shifts in the real world. However, deep
neural networks (DNNs) are easily biased towards the training set, which causes
severe performance degradation when they receive out-of-distribution data. Many
methods are studied to train models that generalize under various distribution
shifts in the literature of domain generalization (DG). However, the recent
DomainBed and WILDS benchmarks challenged the effectiveness of these methods.
Aiming at the problems in the existing research, we propose a new domain
generalization task for handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) to
enrich the application scenarios of DG method research. We evaluate eighteen DG
methods on the proposed PaHCC (Printed and Handwritten Chinese Characters)
dataset and show that the performance of existing methods on this dataset is
still unsatisfactory. Besides, under a designed dynamic DG setting, we reveal
more properties of DG methods and argue that only the leave-one-domain-out
protocol is unreliable. We advocate that researchers in the DG community refer
to dynamic performance of methods for more comprehensive and reliable
evaluation. Our dataset and evaluations bring new perspectives to the community
for more substantial progress. We will make our dataset public with the article
published to facilitate the study of domain generalization.

useful life (RUL) prediction and condition operations (CO) identification of
rotating machines is proposed. In particular, the proposed system comprises
main components: (1) an LSTM-Autoencoder to denoise the vibration data; (2) a
feature extraction to generate time-domain, frequency-domain, and
time-frequency based features from the denoised data; (3) a novel and robust
multi-branch deep learning network architecture to exploit the multiple
features. The performance of our proposed system was evaluated and compared to
the state-of-the-art systems on two benchmark datasets of XJTU-SY and
PRONOSTIA. The experimental results prove that our proposed system outperforms
the state-of-the-art systems and presents potential for real-life applications
on bearing machines.

<p class="mathjax">Remote sensing through semantic segmentation of satellite images contributes
to the understanding and utilisation of the earth's surface. For this purpose,
semantic segmentation networks are typically trained on large sets of labelled
satellite images. However, obtaining expert labels for these images is costly.
Therefore, we propose to rely on a low-cost approach, e.g. crowdsourcing or
pretrained networks, to label the images in the first step. Since these initial
labels are partially erroneous, we use active learning strategies to
cost-efficiently refine the labels in the second step. We evaluate the active
learning strategies using satellite images of Bengaluru in India, labelled with
land cover and land use labels. Our experimental results suggest that an active
label refinement to improve the semantic segmentation network's performance is
beneficial.

<p class="mathjax">Science mapping is an important tool to gain insight into scientific fields,
to identify emerging research trends, and to support science policy.
Understanding the different ways in which different science mapping approaches
capture the structure of scientific fields is critical. This paper presents a
comparative analysis of two commonly used approaches, topic modeling (TM) and
citation-based clustering (CC), to assess their respective strengths,
weaknesses, and the characteristics of their results. We compare the two
approaches using cluster-to-topic and topic-to-cluster mappings based on
science maps of cardiovascular research (CVR) generated by TM and CC. Our
findings reveal that relations between topics and clusters are generally weak,
with limited overlap between topics and clusters. Only in a few exceptional
cases do more than one-third of the documents in a topic belong to the same
cluster, or vice versa. CC excels at identifying diseases and generating
specialized clusters in Clinical Treatment &amp; Surgical Procedures, while TM
focuses on sub-techniques within diagnostic techniques, provides a general
perspective on Clinical Treatment &amp; Surgical Procedures, and identifies
distinct topics related to practical guidelines. Our work enhances the
understanding of science mapping approaches based on TM and CC and delivers
practical guidance for scientometricians on how to apply these approaches
effectively.

<p class="mathjax">Software applications play an increasingly critical role in various aspects
of our lives, from communication and entertainment to business and healthcare.
As these applications become more pervasive, the importance of considering
human values in software development has gained significant attention. In this
preliminary study, we investigate developers's perceptions and experiences
related to human values, with a focus on the human value of transparency. We
interviewed five experienced developers and conducted thematic analysis to
explore how developers perceive transparency, violations of transparency, and
the process of fixing reported violations of transparency. Our findings reveal
the significance of transparency as a fundamental value in software
development, with developers recognising its importance for building trust,
promoting accountability, and fostering ethical practices. Developers recognise
the negative consequences of the violation of the human value of transparency
and follow a systematic process to fix reported violations. This includes
investigation, root cause analysis, corrective action planning, collaborative
problem-solving, and testing and verification. These preliminary findings
contribute to the understanding of transparency in software development and
provide insights for promoting ethical practices.

<p class="mathjax">We present the first shared task for detecting and analyzing code-switching
in Guarani and Spanish, GUA-SPA at IberLEF 2023. The challenge consisted of
three tasks: identifying the language of a token, NER, and a novel task of
classifying the way a Spanish span is used in the code-switched context. We
annotated a corpus of 1500 texts extracted from news articles and tweets,
around 25 thousand tokens, with the information for the tasks. Three teams took
part in the evaluation phase, obtaining in general good results for Task 1, and
more mixed results for Tasks 2 and 3.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent success, state-of-the-art learning-based models remain highly
vulnerable to input changes such as adversarial examples. In order to obtain
certifiable robustness against such perturbations, recent work considers
Lipschitz-based regularizers or constraints while at the same time increasing
prediction margin. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of significantly
decreased accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Calibrated Lipschitz-Margin
Loss (CLL) that addresses this issue and improves certified robustness by
tackling two problems: Firstly, commonly used margin losses do not adjust the
penalties to the shrinking output distribution; caused by minimizing the
Lipschitz constant $K$. Secondly, and most importantly, we observe that
minimization of $K$ can lead to overly smooth decision functions. This limits
the model's complexity and thus reduces accuracy. Our CLL addresses these
issues by explicitly calibrating the loss w.r.t. margin and Lipschitz constant,
thereby establishing full control over slack and improving robustness
certificates even with larger Lipschitz constants. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and
Tiny-ImageNet, our models consistently outperform losses that leave the
constant unattended. On CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, CLL improves upon
state-of-the-art deterministic $L_2$ robust accuracies. In contrast to current
trends, we unlock potential of much smaller models without $K=1$ constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing (QC) introduces a novel mode of computation with the
possibility of greater computational power that remains to be exploited
$\unicode{x2013}$ presenting exciting opportunities for high performance
computing (HPC) applications. However, recent advancements in the field have
made clear that QC does not supplant conventional HPC, but can rather be
incorporated into current heterogeneous HPC infrastructures as an additional
accelerator, thereby enabling the optimal utilization of both paradigms. The
desire for such integration significantly affects the development of software
for quantum computers, which in turn influences the necessary software
infrastructure. To date, previous review papers have investigated various
quantum programming tools (QPTs) (such as languages, libraries, frameworks) in
their ability to program, compile, and execute quantum circuits. However, the
integration effort with classical HPC frameworks or systems has not been
addressed. This study aims to characterize existing QPTs from an HPC
perspective, investigating if existing QPTs have the potential to be
efficiently integrated with classical computing models and determining where
work is still required. This work structures a set of criteria into an analysis
blueprint that enables HPC scientists to assess whether a QPT is suitable for
the quantum-accelerated classical application at hand.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models (DMs) demonstrate potent image generation capabilities in
various generative modeling tasks. Nevertheless, their primary limitation lies
in slow sampling speed, requiring hundreds or thousands of sequential function
evaluations through large neural networks to generate high-quality images.
Sampling from DMs can be seen as solving corresponding stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this work, we
formulate the sampling process as an extended reverse-time SDE (ER SDE),
unifying prior explorations into ODEs and SDEs. Leveraging the semi-linear
structure of ER SDE solutions, we offer exact solutions and arbitrarily
high-order approximate solutions for VP SDE and VE SDE, respectively. Based on
the solution space of the ER SDE, we yield mathematical insights elucidating
the superior performance of ODE solvers over SDE solvers in terms of fast
sampling. Additionally, we unveil that VP SDE solvers stand on par with their
VE SDE counterparts. Finally, we devise fast and training-free samplers, ER-SDE
Solvers, elevating the efficiency of stochastic samplers to unprecedented
levels. Experimental results demonstrate achieving 3.45 FID in 20 function
evaluations and 2.24 FID in 50 function evaluations on the ImageNet
64$\times$64 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">With the generation of personal and medical data at several locations,
medical data science faces unique challenges when working on distributed
datasets. Growing data protection requirements in recent years drastically
limit the use of personally identifiable information. Distributed data analysis
aims to provide solutions for securely working on highly sensitive data while
minimizing the risk of information leaks, which would not be possible to the
same degree in a centralized approach. A novel concept in this field is the
Personal Health Train (PHT), which encapsulates the idea of bringing the
analysis to the data, not vice versa. Data sources are represented as train
stations. Trains containing analysis tasks move between stations and aggregate
results. Train executions are coordinated by a central station which data
analysts can interact with. Data remains at their respective stations and
analysis results are only stored inside the train, providing a safe and secure
environment for distributed data analysis.
<br />Duplicate records across multiple locations can skew results in a distributed
data analysis. On the other hand, merging information from several datasets
referring to the same real-world entities may improve data completeness and
therefore data quality. In this paper, we present an approach for record
linkage on distributed datasets using the Personal Health Train. We verify this
approach and evaluate its effectiveness by applying it to two datasets based on
real-world data and outline its possible applications in the context of
distributed data analysis tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Make-up temporal video grounding (MTVG) aims to localize the target video
segment which is semantically related to a sentence describing a make-up
activity, given a long video. Compared with the general video grounding task,
MTVG focuses on meticulous actions and changes on the face. The make-up
instruction step, usually involving detailed differences in products and facial
areas, is more fine-grained than general activities (e.g, cooking activity and
furniture assembly). Thus, existing general approaches cannot locate the target
activity effectually. More specifically, existing proposal generation modules
are not yet fully developed in providing semantic cues for the more
fine-grained make-up semantic comprehension. To tackle this issue, we propose
an effective proposal-based framework named Dual-Path Temporal Map Optimization
Network (DPTMO) to capture fine-grained multimodal semantic details of make-up
activities. DPTMO extracts both query-agnostic and query-guided features to
construct two proposal sets and uses specific evaluation methods for the two
sets. Different from the commonly used single structure in previous methods,
our dual-path structure can mine more semantic information in make-up videos
and distinguish fine-grained actions well. These two candidate sets represent
the cross-modal makeup video-text similarity and multi-modal fusion
relationship, complementing each other. Each set corresponds to its respective
optimization perspective, and their joint prediction enhances the accuracy of
video timestamp prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the YouMakeup dataset
demonstrate our proposed dual structure excels in fine-grained semantic
comprehension.

<p class="mathjax">Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs translation while reading the
source sentence. Unlike conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) training,
existing SiMT methods adopt the prefix-to-prefix (prefix2prefix) training,
where the model predicts target tokens based on partial source tokens. However,
the prefix2prefix training diminishes the ability of the model to capture
global information and introduces forced predictions due to the absence of
essential source information. Consequently, it is crucial to bridge the gap
between the prefix2prefix training and seq2seq training to enhance the
translation capability of the SiMT model. In this paper, we propose a novel
method that glances future in curriculum learning to achieve the transition
from the seq2seq training to prefix2prefix training. Specifically, we gradually
reduce the available source information from the whole sentence to the prefix
corresponding to that latency. Our method is applicable to a wide range of SiMT
methods and experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching
sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle
because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and
grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be
significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the
batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention
algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in
operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that
achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV
cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our
evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by
2-4$\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art

with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the block Bregman-Kaczmarz method for finite dimensional linear
inverse problems. The block Bregman-Kaczmarz method uses blocks of the linear
system and performs iterative steps with these blocks only. We assume a noise
model that we call independent noise, i.e. each time the method performs a step
for some block, one obtains a noisy sample of the respective part of the
right-hand side which is contaminated with new noise that is independent of all
previous steps of the method. One can view these noise models as making a fresh
noisy measurement of the respective block each time it is used. In this
framework, we are able to show that a well-chosen adaptive stepsize of the
block Bergman-Kaczmarz method is able to converge to the exact solution of the
linear inverse problem. The plain form of this adaptive stepsize relies on
unknown quantities (like the Bregman distance to the solution), but we show a
way how these quantities can be estimated purely from given data. We illustrate
the finding in numerical experiments and confirm that these heuristic estimates
lead to effective stepsizes.

<p class="mathjax">News recommender systems play an increasingly influential role in shaping
information access within democratic societies. However, tailoring
recommendations to users' specific interests can result in the divergence of
information streams. Fragmented access to information poses challenges to the
integrity of the public sphere, thereby influencing democracy and public
discourse. The Fragmentation metric quantifies the degree of fragmentation of
information streams in news recommendations. Accurate measurement of this
metric requires the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
identify distinct news events, stories, or timelines. This paper presents an
extensive investigation of various approaches for quantifying Fragmentation in
news recommendations. These approaches are evaluated both intrinsically, by
measuring performance on news story clustering, and extrinsically, by assessing
the Fragmentation scores of different simulated news recommender scenarios. Our
findings demonstrate that agglomerative hierarchical clustering coupled with
SentenceBERT text representation is substantially better at detecting
Fragmentation than earlier implementations. Additionally, the analysis of
simulated scenarios yields valuable insights and recommendations for
stakeholders concerning the measurement and interpretation of Fragmentation.

<p class="mathjax">The Yongle Palace murals, as valuable cultural heritage, have suffered
varying degrees of damage, making their restoration of significant importance.
However, the giant size and unique data of Yongle Palace murals present
challenges for existing deep-learning based restoration methods: 1) The
distinctive style introduces domain bias in traditional transfer learning-based
restoration methods, while the scarcity of mural data further limits the
applicability of these methods. 2) Additionally, the giant size of these murals
results in a wider range of defect types and sizes, necessitating models with
greater adaptability. Consequently, there is a lack of focus on deep
learning-based restoration methods for the unique giant murals of Yongle
Palace. Here, a 3M-Hybrid model is proposed to address these challenges.
Firstly, based on the characteristic that the mural data frequency is prominent
in the distribution of low and high frequency features, high and low frequency
features are separately abstracted for complementary learning. Furthermore, we
integrate a pre-trained Vision Transformer model (VIT) into the CNN module,
allowing us to leverage the benefits of a large model while mitigating domain
bias. Secondly, we mitigate seam and structural distortion issues resulting
from the restoration of large defects by employing a multi-scale and
multi-perspective strategy, including data segmentation and fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. In
regular-sized mural restoration, it improves SSIM and PSNR by 14.61% and 4.73%,
respectively, compared to the best model among four representative CNN models.
Additionally, it achieves favorable results in the final restoration of giant
murals.

<p class="mathjax">Solving linear inverse problems plays a crucial role in numerous
applications. Algorithm unfolding based, model-aware data-driven approaches
have gained significant attention for effectively addressing these problems.
Learned iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (LISTA) and alternating direction
method of multipliers compressive sensing network (ADMM-CSNet) are two widely
used such approaches, based on ISTA and ADMM algorithms, respectively. In this
work, we study optimization guarantees, i.e., achieving near-zero training loss
with the increase in the number of learning epochs, for finite-layer unfolded
networks such as LISTA and ADMM-CSNet with smooth soft-thresholding in an
over-parameterized (OP) regime. We achieve this by leveraging a modified
version of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz, denoted PL$^*$, condition. Satisfying the
PL$^*$ condition within a specific region of the loss landscape ensures the
existence of a global minimum and exponential convergence from initialization
using gradient descent based methods. Hence, we provide conditions, in terms of
the network width and the number of training samples, on these unfolded
networks for the PL$^*$ condition to hold. We achieve this by deriving the
Hessian spectral norm of these networks. Additionally, we show that the
threshold on the number of training samples increases with the increase in the
network width. Furthermore, we compare the threshold on training samples of
unfolded networks with that of a standard fully-connected feed-forward network
(FFNN) with smooth soft-thresholding non-linearity. We prove that unfolded
networks have a higher threshold value than FFNN. Consequently, one can expect
a better expected error for unfolded networks than FFNN.

<p class="mathjax">The enforcement of the GDPR led to the widespread adoption of consent
notices, colloquially known as cookie banners. Studies have shown that many
website operators do not comply with the law and track users prior to any
interaction with the consent notice, or attempt to trick users into giving
consent through dark patterns. Previous research has relied on manually curated
filter lists or automated detection methods limited to a subset of websites,
making research on GDPR compliance of consent notices tedious or limited. We
present \emph{cookiescanner}, an automated scanning tool that detects and
extracts consent notices via various methods and checks if they offer a decline
option or use color diversion. We evaluated cookiescanner on a random sample of
the top 10,000 websites listed by Tranco. We found that manually curated filter
lists have the highest precision but recall fewer consent notices than our
keyword-based methods. Our BERT model achieves high precision for English
notices, which is in line with previous work, but suffers from low recall due
to insufficient candidate extraction. While the automated detection of decline
options proved to be challenging due to the dynamic nature of many sites,
detecting instances of different colors of the buttons was successful in most
cases. Besides systematically evaluating our various detection techniques, we
have manually annotated 1,000 websites to provide a ground-truth baseline,
which has not existed previously. Furthermore, we release our code and the
annotated dataset in the interest of reproducibility and repeatability.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning applications on LiDAR data suffer from a strong domain gap when
applied to different sensors or tasks. In order for these methods to obtain
similar accuracy on different data in comparison to values reported on public
benchmarks, a large scale annotated dataset is necessary. However, in practical
applications labeled data is costly and time consuming to obtain. Such factors
have triggered various research in label-efficient methods, but a large gap
remains to their fully-supervised counterparts. Thus, we propose ImageTo360, an
effective and streamlined few-shot approach to label-efficient LiDAR
segmentation. Our method utilizes an image teacher network to generate semantic
predictions for LiDAR data within a single camera view. The teacher is used to
pretrain the LiDAR segmentation student network, prior to optional fine-tuning
on 360$^\circ$ data. Our method is implemented in a modular manner on the point
level and as such is generalizable to different architectures. We improve over
the current state-of-the-art results for label-efficient methods and even
surpass some traditional fully-supervised segmentation networks.

<p class="mathjax">3D object detection using LiDAR point clouds is a fundamental task in the
fields of computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, existing
3D detectors heavily rely on annotated datasets, which are both time-consuming
and prone to errors during the process of labeling 3D bounding boxes. In this
paper, we propose a Scene Completion Pre-training (SCP) method to enhance the
performance of 3D object detectors with less labeled data. SCP offers three key
advantages: (1) Improved initialization of the point cloud model. By completing
the scene point clouds, SCP effectively captures the spatial and semantic
relationships among objects within urban environments. (2) Elimination of the
need for additional datasets. SCP serves as a valuable auxiliary network that
does not impose any additional efforts or data requirements on the 3D
detectors. (3) Reduction of the amount of labeled data for detection. With the
help of SCP, the existing state-of-the-art 3D detectors can achieve comparable
performance while only relying on 20% labeled data.

enhancement techniques for collaboration processes. The collaboration process
model is key to represent the discovery result. As for process mining in
general, Petri Net classes are candidates for collaboration process models due
to their analytical power. However, a standard model class to represent
collaboration processes is lacking due to the heterogeneity of collaboration
and, thus, of collaboration mining techniques. Collaboration heterogeneity
requires to cover, for example, intra-organizational collaborations as well as
choreographies that span a process across multiple organizations. A standard
collaboration model class would advance collaboration mining by focusing
discovery through a common target model, supporting comparison, and enabling
flexible mining pipelines. To find a standard model class, we aim at capturing
collaboration heterogeneity in a meta model, assess Petri net classes as
candidates for collaboration process models through the meta model, and derive
design guidelines for the collaboration discovery.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a class of high order methods to approximate the
singular value decomposition of a given complex matrix (SVD). To the best of
our knowledge, only methods up to order three appear in the the literature. A
first part is dedicated to defline and analyse this class of method in the
regular case, i.e., when the singular values are pairwise distinct. The
construction is based on a perturbation analysis of a suitable system of
associated to the SVD (SVD system). More precisely, for an integer $p$ be
given, we define a sequence which converges with an order $p + 1$ towards the
left-right singular vectors and the singular values if the initial
approximation of the SVD system satisfies a condition which depends on three
quantities : the norm of initial approximation of the SVD system, the greatest
singular value and the greatest inverse of the modulus of the difference
between the singular values. From a numerical computational point of view, this
furnishes a very efficient simple test to prove and certifiy the existence of a
SVD in neighborhood of the initial approximation. We generalize these result in
the case of clusters of singular values. We show also how to use the result of
regular case to detect the clusters of singular values and to define a notion
of deflation of the SVD. Moreover numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
results.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of unsupervised feature selection, sparse principal component
analysis (SPCA) methods have attracted more and more attention recently.
Compared to spectral-based methods, SPCA methods don't rely on the construction
of a similarity matrix and show better feature selection ability on real-world
data. The original SPCA formulates a nonconvex optimization problem. Existing
convex SPCA methods reformulate SPCA as a convex model by regarding the
reconstruction matrix as an optimization variable. However, they are lack of
constraints equivalent to the orthogonality restriction in SPCA, leading to
larger solution space. In this paper, it's proved that the optimal solution to
a convex SPCA model falls onto the Positive Semidefinite (PSD) cone. A standard
convex SPCA-based model with PSD constraint for unsupervised feature selection
is proposed. Further, a two-step fast optimization algorithm via PSD projection
is presented to solve the proposed model. Two other existing convex SPCA-based
models are also proven to have their solutions optimized on the PSD cone in
this paper. Therefore, the PSD versions of these two models are proposed to
accelerate their convergence as well. We also provide a regularization
parameter setting strategy for our proposed method. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">This work studies the meta distribution (MD) in a two-user partial
non-orthogonal multiple access (pNOMA) network. Compared to NOMA where users
fully share a resource-element, pNOMA allows sharing only a fraction $\alpha$
of the resource-element. The MD is computed via moment-matching using the first
two moments where reduced integral expressions are derived. Accurate
approximates are also proposed for the $b{\rm th}$ moment for mathematical
tractability. We show that in terms of percentile-performance of links, pNOMA
only outperforms NOMA when $\alpha$ is small. Additionally, pNOMA improves the
percentile-performance of the weak-user more than the strong-user highlighting
its role in improving fairness.

<p class="mathjax">Point Cloud Registration (PCR) is a critical and challenging task in computer
vision. One of the primary difficulties in PCR is identifying salient and
meaningful points that exhibit consistent semantic and geometric properties
across different scans. Previous methods have encountered challenges with
ambiguous matching due to the similarity among patch blocks throughout the
entire point cloud and the lack of consideration for efficient global geometric
consistency. To address these issues, we propose a new framework that includes
several novel techniques. Firstly, we introduce a semantic-aware geometric
encoder that combines object-level and patch-level semantic information. This
encoder significantly improves registration recall by reducing ambiguity in
patch-level superpoint matching. Additionally, we incorporate a prior knowledge
approach that utilizes an intrinsic shape signature to identify salient points.
This enables us to extract the most salient super points and meaningful dense
points in the scene. Secondly, we introduce an innovative transformer that
encodes High-Order (HO) geometric features. These features are crucial for
identifying salient points within initial overlap regions while considering
global high-order geometric consistency. To optimize this high-order
transformer further, we introduce an anchor node selection strategy. By
encoding inter-frame triangle or polyhedron consistency features based on these
anchor nodes, we can effectively learn high-order geometric features of salient
super points. These high-order features are then propagated to dense points and
utilized by a Sinkhorn matching module to identify key correspondences for
successful registration. In our experiments conducted on well-known datasets
such as 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and KITTI, our approach has shown promising results,
highlighting the effectiveness of our novel method.

<p class="mathjax">The accurate prediction of drought probability in specific regions is crucial
for informed decision-making in agricultural practices. It is important to make
predictions one year in advance, particularly for long-term decisions. However,
forecasting this probability presents challenges due to the complex interplay
of various factors within the region of interest and neighboring areas. In this
study, we propose an end-to-end solution to address this issue based on various
spatiotemporal neural networks. The models considered focus on predicting the
drought intensity based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for
subregions of interest, leveraging intrinsic factors and insights from climate
models to enhance drought predictions.
<br />Comparative evaluations demonstrate the superior accuracy of Convolutional
LSTM (ConvLSTM) and transformer models compared to baseline gradient boosting
and logistic regression solutions. The two former models achieved impressive
ROC AUC scores from 0.90 to 0.70 for forecast horizons from one to six months,
outperforming baseline models. The transformer showed superiority for shorter
horizons, while ConvLSTM did so for longer horizons. Thus, we recommend
selecting the models accordingly for long-term drought forecasting.
<br />To ensure the broad applicability of the considered models, we conduct
extensive validation across regions worldwide, considering different
environmental conditions. We also run several ablation and sensitivity studies
to challenge our findings and provide additional information on how to solve
the problem.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) has gained significant attention in recent
years, which leverages data from multiple domains to enhance their performance
concurrently.However, current MDR models are confronted with two limitations.
Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares
parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them.
Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of
static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to
diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model Hyper
Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation (HAMUR). Specifically, HAMUR consists
of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module
that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone
models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared
information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the
adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various
backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and
scalability of the proposed model.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has shown that bit-flip attacks (BFAs) can manipulate deep
neural networks (DNNs) via DRAM Rowhammer exploitations. Existing attacks are
primarily launched over high-level DNN frameworks like PyTorch and flip bits in
model weight files. Nevertheless, DNNs are frequently compiled into low-level
executables by deep learning (DL) compilers to fully leverage low-level
hardware primitives. The compiled code is usually high-speed and manifests
dramatically distinct execution paradigms from high-level DNN frameworks.
<br />In this paper, we launch the first systematic study on the attack surface of
BFA specifically for DNN executables compiled by DL compilers. We design an
automated search tool to identify vulnerable bits in DNN executables and
identify practical attack vectors that exploit the model structure in DNN
executables with BFAs (whereas prior works make likely strong assumptions to
attack model weights). DNN executables appear more "opaque" than models in
high-level DNN frameworks. Nevertheless, we find that DNN executables contain
extensive, severe (e.g., single-bit flip), and transferrable attack surfaces
that are not present in high-level DNN models and can be exploited to deplete
full model intelligence and control output labels. Our finding calls for
incorporating security mechanisms in future DNN compilation toolchains.

<p class="mathjax">Bug datasets are vital for enabling deep learning techniques to address
software maintenance tasks related to bugs. However, existing bug datasets
suffer from precise and scale limitations: they are either small-scale but
precise with manual validation or large-scale but imprecise with simple commit
message processing. In this paper, we introduce PreciseBugCollector, a precise,
multi-language bug collection approach that overcomes these two limitations.
PreciseBugCollector is based on two novel components: a) A bug tracker to map
the codebase repositories with external bug repositories to trace bug type
information, and b) A bug injector to generate project-specific bugs by
injecting noise into the correct codebases and then executing them against
their test suites to obtain test failure messages.
<br />We implement PreciseBugCollector against three sources: 1) A bug tracker that
links to the national vulnerability data set (NVD) to collect general-wise
vulnerabilities, 2) A bug tracker that links to OSS-Fuzz to collect
general-wise bugs, and 3) A bug injector based on 16 injection rules to
generate project-wise bugs. To date, \approach comprises 1057818 bugs extracted
from 2968 open-source projects. Of these, 12602 bugs are sourced from bug
repositories (NVD and OSS-Fuzz), while the remaining 1045216 project-specific
bugs are generated by the bug injector. Considering the challenge objectives,
we argue that a bug injection approach is highly valuable for the industrial
setting, since project-specific bugs align with domain knowledge, share the
same codebase, and adhere to the coding style employed in industrial projects.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
across diverse tasks, leading individuals to increasingly use them as personal
assistants and universal computing engines. Nevertheless, a notable obstacle
emerges when feeding numerical/temporal data into these models, such as data
sourced from wearables or electronic health records. LLMs employ tokenizers in
their input that break down text into smaller units. However, tokenizers are
not designed to represent numerical values and might struggle to understand
repetitive patterns and context, treating consecutive values as separate tokens
and disregarding their temporal relationships. Here, we discuss recent works
that employ LLMs for human-centric tasks such as in mobile health sensing and
present a case study showing that popular LLMs tokenize temporal data
incorrectly. To address that, we highlight potential solutions such as prompt
tuning with lightweight embedding layers as well as multimodal adapters, that
can help bridge this "modality gap". While the capability of language models to
generalize to other modalities with minimal or no finetuning is exciting, this
paper underscores the fact that their outputs cannot be meaningful if they
stumble over input nuances.

<p class="mathjax">In the dynamic and uncertain environments where reinforcement learning (RL)
operates, risk management becomes a crucial factor in ensuring reliable
decision-making. Traditional RL approaches, while effective in reward
optimization, often overlook the landscape of potential risks. In response,
this paper pioneers the integration of Optimal Transport (OT) theory with RL to
create a risk-aware framework. Our approach modifies the objective function,
ensuring that the resulting policy not only maximizes expected rewards but also
respects risk constraints dictated by OT distances between state visitation
distributions and the desired risk profiles. By leveraging the mathematical
precision of OT, we offer a formulation that elevates risk considerations
alongside conventional RL objectives. Our contributions are substantiated with
a series of theorems, mapping the relationships between risk distributions,
optimal value functions, and policy behaviors. Through the lens of OT, this
work illuminates a promising direction for RL, ensuring a balanced fusion of
reward pursuit and risk awareness.

<p class="mathjax">Probability estimation models play an important role in various fields, such
as weather forecasting, recommendation systems, and sports analysis. Among
several models estimating probabilities, it is difficult to evaluate which
model gives reliable probabilities since the ground-truth probabilities are not
available. The win probability estimation model for esports, which calculates
the win probability under a certain game state, is also one of the fields being
actively studied in probability estimation. However, most of the previous works
evaluated their models using accuracy, a metric that only can measure the
performance of discrimination. In this work, we firstly investigate the Brier
score and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a replacement of accuracy
used as a performance evaluation metric for win probability estimation models
in esports field. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel metric called
Balance score which is a simple yet effective metric in terms of six good
properties that probability estimation metric should have. Under the general
condition, we also found that the Balance score can be an effective
approximation of the true expected calibration error which has been imperfectly
approximated by ECE using the binning technique. Extensive evaluations using
simulation studies and real game snapshot data demonstrate the promising
potential to adopt the proposed metric not only for the win probability
estimation model for esports but also for evaluating general probability
estimation models.

<p class="mathjax">Proactivity in robot assistance refers to the robot's ability to anticipate
user needs and perform assistive actions without explicit requests. This
requires understanding user routines, predicting consistent activities, and
actively seeking information to predict inconsistent behaviors. We propose
SLaTe-PRO (Sequential Latent Temporal model for Predicting Routine Object
usage), which improves upon prior state-of-the-art by combining object and user
action information, and conditioning object usage predictions on past history.
Additionally, we find some human behavior to be inherently stochastic and
lacking in contextual cues that the robot can use for proactive assistance. To
address such cases, we introduce an interactive query mechanism that can be
used to ask queries about the user's intended activities and object use to
improve prediction. We evaluate our approach on longitudinal data from three
households, spanning 24 activity classes. SLaTe-PRO performance raises the F1
score metric to 0.57 without queries, and 0.60 with user queries, over a score
of 0.43 from prior work. We additionally present a case study with a fully
autonomous household robot.

<p class="mathjax">A Stochastic Control Problem can be solved by Dynamic Programming or
Distributed Optimal Control with the Kolmogorov equation for the probability
density of the Markov process of the problem. It can be solved also with
Supervised Learning. We shall compare these two classes of methods for the
control of fisheries.
<br />Fishing quotas are unpleasant but efficient to control the productivity of a
fishing site. A popular model has a vector-valued stochastic differential
equation for the biomass of the different species. Optimization of quota will
be obtained by a gradient method applied to the least square difference with an
ideal state weighted by the probability density of the biomasses. Alternatively
a deep neural network which preserves the Markov property of the problem can be
trained with a stochastic gradient algorithm. The model is extended to
distributed fishing sites and biomass is stabilized by adjusting the quota to
its time derivative.

<p class="mathjax">Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising noninvasive in vivo imaging
modality that makes it possible to map the spatial distribution of
superparamagnetic nanoparticles by exposing them to dynamic magnetic fields. In
the Field-Free Line (FFL) scanner topology, the spatial encoding of the
particle distribution is performed by applying magnetic fields vanishing on
straight lines. The voltage induced in the receiving coils by the particles
when exposed to the magnetic fields constitute the signal from which the
particle distribution is to be reconstructed. To avoid lengthy calibration,
model-based reconstruction formulae have been developed for the 2D FFL scanning
topology. In this work we develop reconstruction formulae for 3D FFL. Moreover,
we provide a model-based reconstruction algorithm for 3D FFL and we validate it

<p class="mathjax">One primary topic of multi-modal learning is to jointly incorporate
heterogeneous information from different modalities. However, most models often
suffer from unsatisfactory multi-modal cooperation, which could not jointly
utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance
the worse learnt modality, but are often hard to provide the fine-grained
observation of multi-modal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical
support. Hence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the
fine-grained cooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic
scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples.
To this end, we introduce a fine-grained modality valuation metric to evaluate
the contribution of each modality at sample-level. Via modality valuation, we
regretfully observe that the multi-modal model tends to rely on one specific
modality, resulting in other modalities being low-contributing. We further
analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities by enhancing the
discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner.
Overall, our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution
at sample-level and achieve considerable improvement on different multi-modal
models.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models, including Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs), possess the $generality$ to handle diverse distributions and
tasks, which stems from their extensive pre-training datasets. The fine-tuning
of foundation models is a common practice to enhance task performance or align
the model's behavior with human expectations, allowing them to gain
$speciality$. However, the small datasets used for fine-tuning may not
adequately cover the diverse distributions and tasks encountered during
pre-training. Consequently, the pursuit of speciality during fine-tuning can
lead to a loss of {generality} in the model, which is related to catastrophic
forgetting (CF) in deep learning. In this study, we demonstrate this phenomenon
in both VLMs and LLMs. For instance, fine-tuning VLMs like CLIP on ImageNet
results in a loss of generality in handling diverse distributions, and
fine-tuning LLMs like Galactica in the medical domain leads to a loss in
following instructions and common sense.
<br />To address the trade-off between the speciality and generality, we
investigate multiple regularization methods from continual learning, the weight
averaging method (Wise-FT) from out-of-distributional (OOD) generalization,
which interpolates parameters between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our
findings show that both continual learning and Wise-ft methods effectively
mitigate the loss of generality, with Wise-FT exhibiting the strongest
performance in balancing speciality and generality.

<p class="mathjax">Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task due
to large cross-modality discrepancies and intra-class variations. Existing
methods mainly focus on learning modality-shared representations by embedding
different modalities into the same feature space. As a result, the learned
feature emphasizes the common patterns across modalities while suppressing
modality-specific and identity-aware information that is valuable for Re-ID. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Modality Unifying Network (MUN) to
explore a robust auxiliary modality for VI-ReID. First, the auxiliary modality
is generated by combining the proposed cross-modality learner and
intra-modality learner, which can dynamically model the modality-specific and
modality-shared representations to alleviate both cross-modality and
intra-modality variations. Second, by aligning identity centres across the
three modalities, an identity alignment loss function is proposed to discover
the discriminative feature representations. Third, a modality alignment loss is
introduced to consistently reduce the distribution distance of visible and
infrared images by modality prototype modeling. Extensive experiments on
multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the
current state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

<p class="mathjax">Location data privacy has become a serious concern for users as Location
Based Services (LBSs) have become an important part of their life. It is
possible for malicious parties having access to geolocation data to learn
sensitive information about the user such as religion or political views.
Location Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed by previous
works to ensure the privacy of the shared data while allowing the users to use
LBSs. But there is no clear view of which mechanism to use according to the
scenario in which the user makes use of a LBS. The scenario is the way the user
is using a LBS (frequency of reports, number of reports). In this paper, we
study the sensitivity of LPPMs on the scenario on which they are used. We
propose a framework to systematically evaluate LPPMs by considering an
exhaustive combination of LPPMs, attacks and metrics. Using our framework we
compare a selection of LPPMs including an improved mechanism that we introduce.
By evaluating over a variety of scenarios, we find that the efficacy (privacy,
utility, and robustness) of the studied mechanisms is dependent on the
scenario: for example the privacy of Planar Laplace geo-indistinguishability is
greatly reduced in a continuous scenario. We show that the scenario is
essential to consider when choosing an obfuscation mechanism for a given
application.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel, fast (exponential rate adaption), ab initio
(hyper-parameter-free) gradient based optimizer algorithm. The main idea of the
method is to adapt the learning rate $\alpha$ by situational awareness, mainly
striving for orthogonal neighboring gradients. The method has a high success
and fast convergence rate and does not rely on hand-tuned parameters giving it
greater universality. It can be applied to problems of any dimensions n and
scales only linearly (of order O(n)) with the dimension of the problem. It
optimizes convex and non-convex continuous landscapes providing some kind of
gradient. In contrast to the Ada-family (AdaGrad, AdaMax, AdaDelta, Adam, etc.)
the method is rotation invariant: optimization path and performance are
independent of coordinate choices. The impressive performance is demonstrated
by extensive experiments on the MNIST benchmark data-set against
state-of-the-art optimizers. We name this new class of optimizers after its
core idea Exponential Learning Rate Adaption - ELRA. We present it in two
variants c2min and p2min with slightly different control. The authors strongly
believe that ELRA will open a completely new research direction for gradient
descent optimize.

<p class="mathjax">Reasoning presents a significant and challenging issue for Large Language
Models (LLMs). The predominant focus of research has revolved around developing
diverse prompting strategies to guide and structure the reasoning processes of
LLMs. However, these approaches based on decoder-only causal language models
often operate the input question in a single forward pass, potentially missing
the rich, back-and-forth interactions inherent in human reasoning. Scant
attention has been paid to a critical dimension, i.e., the input question
itself embedded within the prompts. In response, we introduce a deceptively
simple yet highly effective prompting strategy, termed question "re-reading".
Drawing inspiration from human learning and problem-solving, re-reading entails
revisiting the question information embedded within input prompts. This
approach aligns seamlessly with the cognitive principle of reinforcement,
enabling LLMs to extract deeper insights, identify intricate patterns,
establish more nuanced connections, and ultimately enhance their reasoning
capabilities across various tasks. Experiments conducted on a series of
reasoning benchmarks serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of
our method. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our approach seamlessly
integrates with various language models, though-eliciting prompting methods,
and ensemble techniques, further underscoring its versatility and compatibility
in the realm of LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal action segmentation is typically achieved by discovering the
dramatic variances in global visual descriptors. In this paper, we explore the
merits of local features by proposing the unsupervised framework of
Object-centric Temporal Action Segmentation (OTAS). Broadly speaking, OTAS
consists of self-supervised global and local feature extraction modules as well
as a boundary selection module that fuses the features and detects salient
boundaries for action segmentation. As a second contribution, we discuss the
pros and cons of existing frame-level and boundary-level evaluation metrics.
Through extensive experiments, we find OTAS is superior to the previous
state-of-the-art method by $41\%$ on average in terms of our recommended F1

<p class="mathjax">The development of quantum computers has been advancing rapidly in recent
years. As quantum computers become more widely accessible, potentially
malicious users could try to execute their code on the machines to leak
information from other users, to interfere with or manipulate the results of
other users, or to reverse engineer the underlying quantum computer
architecture and its intellectual property, for example. Among different
security threats, previous work has demonstrated information leakage across the
reset operations, and it then proposed a secure reset operation could be an
enabling technology that allows the sharing of a quantum computer among
different users, or among different quantum programs of the same user. This
work first shows a set of new, extended reset operation attacks that could be
more stealthy by hiding the intention of the attacker's circuit. This work
shows various masking circuits and how attackers can retrieve information from
the execution of a previous shot of a circuit, even if the masking circuit is
used between the reset operation (of the victim, after the shot of the circuit
is executed) and the measurement (of the attacker). Based on the uncovered new
possible attacks, this work proposes a set of heuristic checks that could be
applied at transpile time to check for the existence of malicious circuits that
try to steal information via the attack on the reset operation. Unlike run-time
protection or added secure reset gates, this work proposes a complimentary,
compile-time security solution to the attacks on reset~operation.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, where the model is trained only on source data without access to any
target data. Despite the proposal of numerous DGSS strategies, the
generalization capability remains limited in CNN architectures. Though some
Transformer-based segmentation models show promising performance, they
primarily focus on capturing intra-sample attentive relationships, disregarding
inter-sample correlations which can potentially benefit DGSS. To this end, we
enhance the attention modules in Transformer networks for improving DGSS by
incorporating information from other independent samples in the same batch,
enriching contextual information, and diversifying the training data for each
attention block. Specifically, we propose two alternative intra-batch attention
mechanisms, namely mean-based intra-batch attention (MIBA) and element-wise
intra-batch attention (EIBA), to capture correlations between different
samples, enhancing feature representation and generalization capabilities.
Building upon intra-batch attention, we introduce IBAFormer, which integrates
self-attention modules with the proposed intra-batch attention for DGSS.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBAFormer achieves SOTA performance in
DGSS, and ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each introduced
component.

<p class="mathjax">Text-driven human motion generation in computer vision is both significant
and challenging. However, current methods are limited to producing either
deterministic or imprecise motion sequences, failing to effectively control the
temporal and spatial relationships required to conform to a given text
description. In this work, we propose a fine-grained method for generating
high-quality, conditional human motion sequences supporting precise text
description. Our approach consists of two key components: 1) a
linguistics-structure assisted module that constructs accurate and complete
language feature to fully utilize text information; and 2) a context-aware
progressive reasoning module that learns neighborhood and overall semantic
linguistics features from shallow and deep graph neural networks to achieve a
multi-step inference. Experiments show that our approach outperforms
text-driven motion generation methods on HumanML3D and KIT test sets and
generates better visually confirmed motion to the text conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Player identification is a crucial component in vision-driven soccer
analytics, enabling various downstream tasks such as player assessment, in-game
analysis, and broadcast production. However, automatically detecting jersey
numbers from player tracklets in videos presents challenges due to motion blur,
low resolution, distortions, and occlusions. Existing methods, utilizing
Spatial Transformer Networks, CNNs, and Vision Transformers, have shown success
in image data but struggle with real-world video data, where jersey numbers are
not visible in most of the frames. Hence, identifying frames that contain the
jersey number is a key sub-problem to tackle. To address these issues, we
propose a robust keyframe identification module that extracts frames containing
essential high-level information about the jersey number. A spatio-temporal
network is then employed to model spatial and temporal context and predict the
probabilities of jersey numbers in the video. Additionally, we adopt a
multi-task loss function to predict the probability distribution of each digit
separately. Extensive evaluations on the SoccerNet dataset demonstrate that
incorporating our proposed keyframe identification module results in a
significant 37.81% and 37.70% increase in the accuracies of 2 different test
sets with domain gaps. These results highlight the effectiveness and importance
of our approach in tackling the challenges of automatic jersey number detection
in sports videos.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven research in Additive Manufacturing (AM) has gained significant
success in recent years. This has led to a plethora of scientific literature to
emerge. The knowledge in these works consists of AM and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) contexts that have not been mined and formalized in an integrated way.
Moreover, no tools or guidelines exist to support data-driven knowledge
transfer from one context to another. As a result, data-driven solutions using
specific AI techniques are being developed and validated only for specific AM
process technologies. There is a potential to exploit the inherent similarities
across various AM technologies and adapt the existing solutions from one
process or problem to another using AI, such as Transfer Learning. We propose a
three-step knowledge transferability analysis framework in AM to support
data-driven AM knowledge transfer. As a prerequisite to transferability
analysis, AM knowledge is featurized into identified knowledge components. The
framework consists of pre-transfer, transfer, and post-transfer steps to
accomplish knowledge transfer. A case study is conducted between flagship metal
AM processes. Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is the source of knowledge
motivated by its relative matureness in applying AI over Directed Energy
Deposition (DED), which drives the need for knowledge transfer as the less
explored target process. We show successful transfer at different levels of the
data-driven solution, including data representation, model architecture, and
model parameters. The pipeline of AM knowledge transfer can be automated in the
future to allow efficient cross-context or cross-process knowledge exchange.

<p class="mathjax">Self-training allows a network to learn from the predictions of a more
complicated model, thus often requires well-trained teacher models and mixture
of teacher-student data while multi-task learning jointly optimizes different
targets to learn salient interrelationship and requires multi-task annotations
for each training example. These frameworks, despite being particularly data
demanding have potentials for data exploitation if such assumptions can be
relaxed. In this paper, we compare self-training object detection under the
deficiency of teacher training data where students are trained on unseen
examples by the teacher, and multi-task learning with partially annotated data,
i.e. single-task annotation per training example. Both scenarios have their own
limitation but potentially helpful with limited annotated data. Experimental
results show the improvement of performance when using a weak teacher with
unseen data for training a multi-task student. Despite the limited setup we
believe the experimental results show the potential of multi-task knowledge
distillation and self-training, which could be beneficial for future study.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to remove specular highlights from a single object-level
image. Although previous methods have made some progresses, their performance
remains somewhat limited, particularly for real images with complex specular
highlights. To this end, we propose a three-stage network to address them.
Specifically, given an input image, we first decompose it into the albedo,
shading, and specular residue components to estimate a coarse specular-free
image. Then, we further refine the coarse result to alleviate its visual
artifacts such as color distortion. Finally, we adjust the tone of the refined
result to match that of the input as closely as possible. In addition, to
facilitate network training and quantitative evaluation, we present a
large-scale synthetic dataset of object-level images, covering diverse objects
and illumination conditions. Extensive experiments illustrate that our network
is able to generalize well to unseen real object-level images, and even produce
good results for scene-level images with multiple background objects and
complex lighting.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays millions of images are shared on social media and web platforms. In
particular, many of them are food images taken from a smartphone over time,
providing information related to the individual's diet. On the other hand,
eating behaviours are directly related to some of the most prevalent diseases
in the world. Exploiting recent advances in image processing and Artificial
Intelligence (AI), this scenario represents an excellent opportunity to: i)
create new methods that analyse the individuals' health from what they eat, and
ii) develop personalised recommendations to improve nutrition and diet under
specific circumstances (e.g., obesity or COVID). Having tunable tools for
creating food image datasets that facilitate research in both lines is very
much needed.
<br />This paper proposes AI4Food-NutritionFW, a framework for the creation of food
image datasets according to configurable eating behaviours. AI4Food-NutritionFW
simulates a user-friendly and widespread scenario where images are taken using
a smartphone. In addition to the framework, we also provide and describe a
unique food image dataset that includes 4,800 different weekly eating
behaviours from 15 different profiles and 1,200 subjects. Specifically, we
consider profiles that comply with actual lifestyles from healthy eating
behaviours (according to established knowledge), variable profiles (e.g.,
eating out, holidays), to unhealthy ones (e.g., excess of fast food or sweets).
Finally, we automatically evaluate a healthy index of the subject's eating
behaviours using multidimensional metrics based on guidelines for healthy diets
proposed by international organisations, achieving promising results (99.53%
and 99.60% accuracy and sensitivity, respectively). We also release to the
research community a software implementation of our proposed
AI4Food-NutritionFW and the mentioned food image dataset created with it.

<p class="mathjax">Increasing the amount of electric power that is used on the demand side has
brought more attention to the peak-load management of the distribution network
(DN). The creation of infrastructures for smart grids, the efficient
utilization of the distributed network's components, and the appropriate
administration of the distributed network would result in a valuable solution
for the operators of the distributed network. As a result, a framework for
peak-load management is given in this research. Within this framework, the
real-time rating of the components and the voltage-dependent characteristics of
the electric loads work together to assist the DN operator in effectively
navigating peak periods. The combination of the conservation voltage reduction
(CVR) and the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) of the components that make up the
DN produces outcomes that are more helpful than any of these factors alone
could provide. This is true even though each of these factors contributes to
the efficient functioning of the DN. According to the findings, as compared to
the individual implementation of CVR, the simultaneous utilization of DTR and
CVR results in a cost-savings rise at peak events which is 58.75 percentage
points more than the individual implementation. In addition, a discussion is
offered concerning the current difficulties that are being experienced by the
feeders that are providing the voltage-dependent constant-power loads during
the utilization of the CVR, which are handled by the dynamic rating of the
components that make up the DN.

<p class="mathjax">It is difficult to perform 3D reconstruction from on-vehicle gathered video
due to the large forward motion of the vehicle. Even object detection and human
sensing models perform significantly worse on onboard videos when compared to
standard benchmarks because objects often appear far away from the camera
compared to the standard object detection benchmarks, image quality is often
decreased by motion blur and occlusions occur often. This has led to the
popularisation of traffic data-specific benchmarks. Recently Light Detection
And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become popular to directly estimate depths
without the need to perform 3D reconstructions. However, LiDAR-based methods
still lack in articulated human detection at a distance when compared to
image-based methods. We hypothesize that benchmarks targeted at articulated
human sensing from LiDAR data could bring about increased research in human
sensing and prediction in traffic and could lead to improved traffic safety for
pedestrians.

<p class="mathjax">A set of variables is the Markov blanket of a random variable if it contains
all the information needed for predicting the variable. If the blanket cannot
be reduced without losing useful information, it is called a Markov boundary.
Identifying the Markov boundary of a random variable is advantageous because
all variables outside the boundary are superfluous. Hence, the Markov boundary
provides an optimal feature set. However, learning the Markov boundary from
data is challenging for two reasons. If one or more variables are removed from
the Markov boundary, variables outside the boundary may start providing
information. Conversely, variables within the boundary may stop providing
information. The true role of each candidate variable is only manifesting when
the Markov boundary has been identified. In this paper, we propose a new
Tsetlin Machine (TM) feedback scheme that supplements Type I and Type II
feedback. The scheme introduces a novel Finite State Automaton - a
Context-Specific Independence Automaton. The automaton learns which features
are outside the Markov boundary of the target, allowing them to be pruned from
the TM during learning. We investigate the new scheme empirically, showing how
it is capable of exploiting context-specific independence to find Markov
boundaries. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of convergence. Our
approach thus connects the field of Bayesian networks (BN) with TMs,
potentially opening up for synergies when it comes to inference and learning,
including TM-produced Bayesian knowledge bases and TM-based Bayesian inference.

<p class="mathjax">What is the time complexity of matrix multiplication of sparse integer
matrices with $m_{in}$ nonzeros in the input and $m_{out}$ nonzeros in the
output? This paper provides improved upper bounds for this question for almost
any choice of $m_{in}$ vs. $m_{out}$, and provides evidence that these new
bounds might be optimal up to further progress on fast matrix multiplication.
<br />Our main contribution is a new algorithm that reduces sparse matrix
multiplication to dense (but smaller) rectangular matrix multiplication. Our
running time thus depends on the optimal exponent $\omega(a,b,c)$ of
multiplying dense $n^a\times n^b$ by $n^b\times n^c$ matrices. We discover that
when $m_{out}=\Theta(m_{in}^r)$ the time complexity of sparse matrix
multiplication is $O(m_{in}^{\sigma+\epsilon})$, for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$, where
$\sigma$ is the solution to the equation
$\omega(\sigma-1,2-\sigma,1+r-\sigma)=\sigma$. No matter what
$\omega(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)$ turns out to be, and for all $r\in(0,2)$, the new
bound beats the state of the art, and we provide evidence that it is optimal
based on the complexity of the all-edge triangle problem.
<br />In particular, in terms of the input plus output size $m = m_{in} + m_{out}$
our algorithm runs in time $O(m^{1.3459})$. Even for Boolean matrices, this
improves over the previous
$m^{\frac{2\omega}{\omega+1}+\epsilon}=O(m^{1.4071})$ bound [Amossen, Pagh;
2009], which was a natural barrier since it coincides with the longstanding
bound of all-edge triangle in sparse graphs [Alon, Yuster, Zwick; 1994]. We
find it interesting that matrix multiplication can be solved faster than
triangle detection in this natural setting. In fact, we establish an
equivalence to a special case of the all-edge triangle problem.

<p class="mathjax">As adoption of mobile phones has skyrocketed, so have scams involving them.
The text method is called SMiShing, (aka SMShing, or smishing) in which a
fraudster sends a phishing link via Short Message Service (SMS) text to a
phone. However, no data exists on who is most vulnerable to SMiShing. Prior
work in phishing (its e-mail cousin) indicates that this is likely to vary by
demographic and contextual factors. In our study, we collect this data from
N=1007 U.S. adult mobile phone users. Younger people and college students
emerge in this sample as the most vulnerable. Participants struggled to
correctly identify legitimate messages and were easily misled when they knew
they had an account with the faked message entity. Counterintuitively,
participants with higher levels of security training and awareness were less
correct in rating possible SMiSH. We recommend next steps for researchers,
regulators and telecom providers.

<p class="mathjax">Recent novel view synthesis methods obtain promising results for relatively
small scenes, e.g., indoor environments and scenes with a few objects, but tend
to fail for unbounded outdoor scenes with a single image as input. In this
paper, we introduce SAMPLING, a Scene-adaptive Hierarchical Multiplane Images
Representation for Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image based on improved
multiplane images (MPI). Observing that depth distribution varies significantly
for unbounded outdoor scenes, we employ an adaptive-bins strategy for MPI to
arrange planes in accordance with each scene image. To represent intricate
geometry and multi-scale details, we further introduce a hierarchical
refinement branch, which results in high-quality synthesized novel views. Our
method demonstrates considerable performance gains in synthesizing large-scale
unbounded outdoor scenes using a single image on the KITTI dataset and
generalizes well to the unseen Tanks and Temples dataset. The code and models
will be made public.

<p class="mathjax">Satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are promising architecture
for providing global coverage. In STINs, full frequency reuse between a
satellite and a terrestrial base station (BS) is encouraged for enhancing
spectral efficiency, which accounts for non-negligible amount of interference.
To address the interference management problem in STINs, this paper proposes a
novel distributed precoding method. Key features of our method are: i) a
rate-splitting (RS) strategy is incorporated for efficient interference
management, ii) precoders are designed in a distributed way without sharing
channel state information between a satellite and a terrestrial BS.
Specifically, to design precoders in a distributed fashion, we put forth a
spectral efficiency decoupling technique. This technique disentangles the total
spectral efficiency into two distinct terms, each dependent solely on the
satellite's precoder and the terrestrial BS's precoder, respectively. Then, to
resolve the non-smoothness raised by adopting the RS strategy, we approximate
the spectral efficiency expression as a smooth function; thereafter we develop
a generalized power iteration inspired optimization algorithm built based on
the first-order optimality condition. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method improves the spectral efficiency (around 20~29%) compared to
existing distributed precoding schemes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the design of transmission methods and reflection
optimization for a wireless system assisted by a single or multiple
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The existing techniques are either
too complex to implement in practical systems or too inefficient to achieve
high performance. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing schemes, we
propose a simple but efficient approach based on \textit{opportunistic
reflection} and \textit{non-orthogonal transmission}. The key idea is
opportunistically selecting the best user that can reap the maximal gain from
the optimally reflected signals via RIS. That is to say, only the channel state
information of the best user is used for RIS reflection optimization, which can
in turn lower complexity substantially. In addition, the second user is
selected to superpose its signal on that of the primary user, where the
benefits of non-orthogonal transmission, i.e., high system capacity and
improved user fairness, are obtained. Additionally, a simplified variant
exploiting random phase shifts is proposed to avoid the high overhead of RIS
channel estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning approaches to natural language processing have made great
strides in recent years. While these models produce symbols that convey vast
amounts of diverse knowledge, it is unclear how such symbols are grounded in
data from the world. In this paper, we explore the development of a private
language for visual data representation by training emergent language (EL)
encoders/decoders in both i) a traditional referential game environment and ii)
a contrastive learning environment utilizing a within-class matching training
paradigm. An additional classification layer utilizing neural machine
translation and random forest classification was used to transform symbolic
representations (sequences of integer symbols) to class labels. These methods
were applied in two experiments focusing on object recognition and action
recognition. For object recognition, a set of sketches produced by human
participants from real imagery was used (Sketchy dataset) and for action
recognition, 2D trajectories were generated from 3D motion capture systems
(MOVI dataset). In order to interpret the symbols produced for data in each
experiment, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) methods were
used to identify pixel regions indicating semantic features which contribute
evidence towards symbols in learned languages. Additionally, a t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method was used to investigate embeddings
learned by CNN feature extractors.

<p class="mathjax">Domain Generalization (DG) aims to generalize to arbitrary unseen domains. A
promising approach to improve model generalization in DG is the identification
of flat minima. One typical method for this task is SWAD, which involves
averaging weights along the training trajectory. However, the success of weight
averaging depends on the diversity of weights, which is limited when training
with a small learning rate. Instead, we observe that leveraging a large
learning rate can simultaneously promote weight diversity and facilitate the
identification of flat regions in the loss landscape. However, employing a
large learning rate suffers from the convergence problem, which cannot be
resolved by simply averaging the training weights. To address this issue, we
introduce a training strategy called Lookahead which involves the weight
interpolation, instead of average, between fast and slow weights. The fast
weight explores the weight space with a large learning rate, which is not
converged while the slow weight interpolates with it to ensure the convergence.
Besides, weight interpolation also helps identify flat minima by implicitly
optimizing the local entropy loss that measures flatness. To further prevent
overfitting during training, we propose two variants to regularize the training
weight with weighted averaged weight or with accumulated history weight. Taking
advantage of this new perspective, our methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both classification and semantic segmentation domain
generalization benchmarks. The code is available at

relies on self-healing code-generation approaches to better take advantage of
the full potential of LLMs. We first thoroughly examine the challenges of using
these models to produce a fully functional &amp; correct configuration, and then
evaluate the feasibility of realizing NETBUDDY by building a proof-of-concept
solution using GPT-4 to translate a set of high-level requirements into P4 and
BGP configurations and run them using the Kathar\'a network emulator.

<p class="mathjax">High-order structures have been recognised as suitable models for systems
going beyond the binary relationships for which graph models are appropriate.
Despite their importance and surge in research on these structures, their
random cases have been only recently become subjects of interest. One of these
high-order structures is the oriented hypergraph, which relates couples of
subsets of an arbitrary number of vertices. Here we develop the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for oriented hypergraphs, which corresponds to the
random realisation of oriented hyperedges of the complete oriented hypergraph.
A particular feature of random oriented hypergraphs is that the ratio between
their expected number of oriented hyperedges and their expected degree or size
is 3/2 for large number of vertices. We highlight the suitability of oriented
hypergraphs for modelling large collections of chemical reactions and the
importance of random oriented hypergraphs to analyse the unfolding of
chemistry.

in an aerial autonomous robotics competition from April 2023. As open-ended
robotics competitions become more popular, we wish to begin documenting
successful team designs and approaches. The intended audience of this paper is
not only any future or potential participant in this particular national Defend

their first robot or system to be entered in a competition with clear goals.
Future DTR participants can and should either build on the ideas here, or find
new alternate strategies that can defeat the most successful design last time.
For non-DTR participants but students interested in robotics competitions,
identifying the minimum viable system needed to be competitive is still
important in helping manage time and prioritizing tasks that are crucial to

<p class="mathjax">Spatial data is ubiquitous. Massive amounts of data are generated every day
from a plethora of sources such as billions of GPS-enabled devices (e.g., cell
phones, cars, and sensors), consumer-based applications (e.g., Uber and
Strava), and social media platforms (e.g., location-tagged posts on Facebook,
Twitter, and Instagram). This exponential growth in spatial data has led the
research community to build systems and applications for efficient spatial data
processing.
<br />In this study, we apply a recently developed machine-learned search technique
for single-dimensional sorted data to spatial indexing. Specifically, we
partition spatial data using six traditional spatial partitioning techniques
and employ machine-learned search within each partition to support point,
range, distance, and spatial join queries. Adhering to the latest research
trends, we tune the partitioning techniques to be instance-optimized. By tuning
each partitioning technique for optimal performance, we demonstrate that: (i)
grid-based index structures outperform tree-based index structures (from
1.23$\times$ to 2.47$\times$), (ii) learning-enhanced variants of commonly used
spatial index structures outperform their original counterparts (from
1.44$\times$ to 53.34$\times$ faster), (iii) machine-learned search within a
partition is faster than binary search by 11.79% - 39.51% when filtering on one
dimension, (iv) the benefit of machine-learned search diminishes in the
presence of other compute-intensive operations (e.g. scan costs in higher
selectivity queries, Haversine distance computation, and point-in-polygon
tests), and (v) index lookup is the bottleneck for tree-based structures, which
could potentially be reduced by linearizing the indexed partitions.

<p class="mathjax">Robustness in Natural Language Processing continues to be a pertinent issue,
where state of the art models under-perform under naturally shifted
distributions. In the context of Question Answering, work on domain adaptation
methods continues to be a growing body of research. However, very little
attention has been given to the notion of domain generalization under natural
distribution shifts, where the target domain is unknown. With drastic
improvements in the quality and access to generative models, we answer the
question: How do generated datasets influence the performance of QA models
under natural distribution shifts? We perform experiments on 4 different
datasets under varying amounts of distribution shift, and analyze how
"in-the-wild" generation can help achieve domain generalization. We take a
two-step generation approach, generating both contexts and QA pairs to augment
existing datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate how augmenting
reading comprehension datasets with generated data leads to better robustness
towards natural distribution shifts.

<p class="mathjax">When deploying classifiers in the real world, users expect them to respond to
inputs appropriately. However, traditional classifiers are not equipped to
handle inputs which lie far from the distribution they were trained on.
Malicious actors can exploit this defect by making adversarial perturbations
designed to cause the classifier to give an incorrect output.
Classification-with-rejection methods attempt to solve this problem by allowing
networks to refuse to classify an input in which they have low confidence. This
works well for strongly adversarial examples, but also leads to the rejection
of weakly perturbed images, which intuitively could be correctly classified. To
address these issues, we propose Reed-Muller Aggregation Networks (RMAggNet), a
classifier inspired by Reed-Muller error-correction codes which can correct and
reject inputs. This paper shows that RMAggNet can minimise incorrectness while
maintaining good correctness over multiple adversarial attacks at different
perturbation budgets by leveraging the ability to correct errors in the
classification process. This provides an alternative
classification-with-rejection method which can reduce the amount of additional
processing in situations where a small number of incorrect classifications are
permissible.

<p class="mathjax">Prior work has shown that the ordering in which concepts are shown to a
commonsense generator plays an important role, affecting the quality of the
generated sentence. However, it remains a challenge to determine the optimal
ordering of a given set of concepts such that a natural sentence covering all
the concepts could be generated from a pretrained generator. To understand the
relationship between the ordering of the input concepts and the quality of the
generated sentences, we conduct a systematic study considering multiple
language models (LMs) and concept ordering strategies. We find that BART-large
model consistently outperforms all other LMs considered in this study when
fine-tuned using the ordering of concepts as they appear in CommonGen training
data as measured using multiple evaluation metrics. Moreover, the larger
GPT3-based large language models (LLMs) variants do not necessarily outperform
much smaller LMs on this task, even when fine-tuned on task-specific training
data. Interestingly, human annotators significantly reorder input concept sets
when manually writing sentences covering those concepts, and this ordering
provides the best sentence generations independently of the LM used for the
generation, outperforming a probabilistic concept ordering baseline

<p class="mathjax">Today, using Large-scale generative Language Models (LLMs) it is possible to
simulate free responses to interview questions like those traditionally
analyzed using qualitative research methods. Qualitative methodology
encompasses a broad family of techniques involving manual analysis of
open-ended interviews or conversations conducted freely in natural language.
Here we consider whether artificial "silicon participants" generated by LLMs
may be productively studied using qualitative methods aiming to produce
insights that could generalize to real human populations. The key concept in
our analysis is algorithmic fidelity, a term introduced by Argyle et al. (2023)
capturing the degree to which LLM-generated outputs mirror human
sub-populations' beliefs and attitudes. By definition, high algorithmic
fidelity suggests latent beliefs elicited from LLMs may generalize to real
humans, whereas low algorithmic fidelity renders such research invalid. Here we
used an LLM to generate interviews with silicon participants matching specific
demographic characteristics one-for-one with a set of human participants. Using
framework-based qualitative analysis, we showed the key themes obtained from
both human and silicon participants were strikingly similar. However, when we
analyzed the structure and tone of the interviews we found even more striking
differences. We also found evidence of the hyper-accuracy distortion described
by Aher et al. (2023). We conclude that the LLM we tested (GPT-3.5) does not
have sufficient algorithmic fidelity to expect research on it to generalize to
human populations. However, the rapid pace of LLM research makes it plausible
this could change in the future. Thus we stress the need to establish epistemic
norms now around how to assess validity of LLM-based qualitative research,
especially concerning the need to ensure representation of heterogeneous lived
experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic related work generation must ground their outputs to the content of
the cited papers to avoid non-factual hallucinations, but due to the length of
scientific documents, existing abstractive approaches have conditioned only on
the cited paper \textit{abstracts}. We demonstrate that the abstract is not
always the most appropriate input for citation generation and that models
trained in this way learn to hallucinate. We propose to condition instead on
the \textit{cited text span} (CTS) as an alternative to the abstract. Because
manual CTS annotation is extremely time- and labor-intensive, we experiment
with automatic, ROUGE-based labeling of candidate CTS sentences, achieving
sufficiently strong performance to substitute for expensive human annotations,

<p class="mathjax">Computational models can advance affective science by shedding light onto the
interplay between cognition and emotion from an information processing point of
view. We propose a computational model of emotion that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and appraisal theory, establishing a formal relationship between
reward processing, goal-directed task learning, cognitive appraisal and
emotional experiences. The model achieves this by formalizing evaluative checks
from the component process model (CPM) in terms of temporal difference learning
updates. We formalized novelty, goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and power.
The formalization is task independent and can be applied to any task that can
be represented as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and solved using RL. We
investigated to what extent CPM-RL enables simulation of emotional responses
cased by interactive task events. We evaluate the model by predicting a range
of human emotions based on a series of vignette studies, highlighting its
potential in improving our understanding of the role of reward processing in
affective experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Convolution is a fundamental operation in image processing and machine
learning. Aimed primarily at maintaining image size, padding is a key
ingredient of convolution, which, however, can introduce undesirable boundary
effects. We present a non-padding-based method for size-keeping convolution
based on the preservation of differential characteristics of kernels. The main
idea is to make convolution over an incomplete sliding window "collapse" to a
linear differential operator evaluated locally at its central pixel, which no
longer requires information from the neighbouring missing pixels. While the
underlying theory is rigorous, our final formula turns out to be simple: the
convolution over an incomplete window is achieved by convolving its nearest
complete window with a transformed kernel. This formula is computationally
lightweight, involving neither interpolation or extrapolation nor restrictions
on image and kernel sizes. Our method favours data with smooth boundaries, such
as high-resolution images and fields from physics. Our experiments include: i)
filtering analytical and non-analytical fields from computational physics and,
ii) training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the tasks of image
classification, semantic segmentation and super-resolution reconstruction. In
all these experiments, our method has exhibited visible superiority over the
compared ones.

<p class="mathjax">State redistribution (SRD) is a recently developed technique for stabilizing
cut cells that result from finite-volume embedded boundary methods. SRD has
been successfully applied to a variety of compressible and incompressible flow
problems. When used in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR),
additional steps are needed to preserve the accuracy and conservation
properties of the solution if the embedded boundary is not restricted to a
single level of the mesh hierarchy. In this work, we extend the weighted state
redistribution algorithm to cases where cut cells live at or near a coarse-fine
interface within the domain. The resulting algorithm maintains conservation and
is demonstrated on several two- and three-dimensional example problems.

<p class="mathjax">Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a feasible method for inferring
Hidden Markov models, however, it is often computationally prohibitive,
especially constrained by the curse of dimensionality, as the Monte Carlo
sampler traverses randomly taking small steps within uncertain regions in the
parameter space. We are the first to consider the posterior distribution of the
objective as a mapping of samples in an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space
where deterministic submanifolds are embedded and propose a new criterion by
maximizing the weighted Riesz polarization quantity, to discretize rectifiable
submanifolds via pairwise interaction. We study the characteristics of
Chebyshev particles and embed them into sequential MCMC, a novel sampler with a
high acceptance ratio that proposes only a few evaluations. We have achieved
high performance from the experiments for parameter inference in a linear
Gaussian state-space model with synthetic data and a non-linear stochastic
volatility model with real-world data.

<p class="mathjax">Modern recommender systems lie at the heart of complex ecosystems that couple
the behavior of users, content providers, advertisers, and other actors.
Despite this, the focus of the majority of recommender research -- and most
practical recommenders of any import -- is on the local, myopic optimization of
the recommendations made to individual users. This comes at a significant cost
to the long-term utility that recommenders could generate for its users. We
argue that explicitly modeling the incentives and behaviors of all actors in
the system -- and the interactions among them induced by the recommender's
policy -- is strictly necessary if one is to maximize the value the system
brings to these actors and improve overall ecosystem "health". Doing so
requires: optimization over long horizons using techniques such as
reinforcement learning; making inevitable tradeoffs in the utility that can be
generated for different actors using the methods of social choice; reducing
information asymmetry, while accounting for incentives and strategic behavior,
using the tools of mechanism design; better modeling of both user and
item-provider behaviors by incorporating notions from behavioral economics and
psychology; and exploiting recent advances in generative and foundation models
to make these mechanisms interpretable and actionable. We propose a conceptual
framework that encompasses these elements, and articulate a number of research
challenges that emerge at the intersection of these different disciplines.

<p class="mathjax">With recent advances in Generative AI, it is becoming easier to automatically
manipulate 3D models. However, current methods tend to apply edits to models
globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model
when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional
segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original
functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce a
method for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic
elements. This method allows users to selectively modify aesthetic segments of
3D models, without affecting the functional segments. To develop this method we
first create a taxonomy of functionality in 3D models by qualitatively
analyzing 1000 models sourced from a popular 3D printing repository,
Thingiverse. With this taxonomy, we develop a semi-automatic classification
method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. We
propose a system called Style2Fab that allows users to selectively stylize 3D
models without compromising their functionality. We evaluate the effectiveness
of our classification method compared to human-annotated data, and demonstrate
the utility of Style2Fab with a user study to show that functionality-aware
segmentation helps preserve model functionality.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with its
exceptional quality and creativity. However, its multi-step sampling process is
known to be slow, often requiring tens of inference steps to obtain
satisfactory results. Previous attempts to improve its sampling speed and
reduce computational costs through distillation have been unsuccessful in
achieving a functional one-step model. In this paper, we explore a recent
method called Rectified Flow, which, thus far, has only been applied to small
datasets. The core of Rectified Flow lies in its \emph{reflow} procedure, which
straightens the trajectories of probability flows, refines the coupling between
noises and images, and facilitates the distillation process with student
models. We propose a novel text-conditioned pipeline to turn Stable Diffusion
(SD) into an ultra-fast one-step model, in which we find reflow plays a
critical role in improving the assignment between noise and images. Leveraging
our new pipeline, we create, to the best of our knowledge, the first one-step
diffusion-based text-to-image generator with SD-level image quality, achieving
an FID (Frechet Inception Distance) of $23.3$ on MS COCO 2017-5k, surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art technique, progressive distillation, by a
significant margin ($37.2$ $\rightarrow$ $23.3$ in FID). By utilizing an
expanded network with 1.7B parameters, we further improve the FID to $22.4$. We
call our one-step models \emph{InstaFlow}. On MS COCO 2014-30k, InstaFlow
yields an FID of $13.1$ in just $0.09$ second, the best in $\leq 0.1$ second
regime, outperforming the recent StyleGAN-T ($13.9$ in $0.1$ second). Notably,
the training of InstaFlow only costs 199 A100 GPU days. Project

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as versatile tools in various daily
applications. However, they are fraught with issues that undermine their
utility and trustworthiness. These include the incorporation of erroneous
references (citation), the generation of hallucinated information
(correctness), and the inclusion of superfluous or omission of crucial details
(fluency). To ameliorate these concerns, this study makes several key
contributions. First, we build a dataset to train a critic model capable of
evaluating the citation, correctness, and fluency of responses generated by
LLMs in QA systems. Second, we propose an automated feedback mechanism that
leverages the critic model to offer real-time feedback on heterogeneous aspects
of generated text. Third, we introduce a feedback learning loop that uses this
critic model to iteratively improve the performance of the LLM responsible for
response generation. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, showing substantial improvements in citation and fluency metrics for
ChatGPT, including a 4% precision increase in citation and an approximately 8%
enhancement in the MAUVE metric for fluency, while maintaining high levels of
correctness.

<p class="mathjax">Critical nodes in networks are extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks to
trigger negative cascading events such as the spread of misinformation and
diseases. Therefore, effective moderation of critical nodes is very vital for
mitigating the potential damages caused by such malicious diffusions. The
current moderation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, they
disregard the fundamental metric of information centrality, which measures the
dissemination power of nodes.
<br />We investigate the problem of removing $k$ edges from a network to minimize
the information centrality of a target node $\lea$ while preserving the
network's connectivity. We prove that this problem is computationally
challenging: it is NP-complete and its objective function is not supermodular.
However, we propose three approximation greedy algorithms using novel
techniques such as random walk-based Schur complement approximation and fast
sum estimation. One of our algorithms runs in nearly linear time in the number
of edges.
<br />To complement our theoretical analysis, we conduct a comprehensive set of
experiments on synthetic and real networks with over one million nodes. Across
various settings, the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Deploying robots that operate in dynamic, uncertain environments, such as
Uncrewed Aerial Systems in search \&amp; rescue missions, require nearly continuous
human supervision for vehicle guidance and operation. Without approaches that
consider high level mission context, operational methods of autonomous flying
necessitate cumbersome manual operation or inefficient exhaustive search
patterns. To facilitate more effective use of autonomy, we present a
human-centered autonomous system that infers geospatial mission context through
dynamic features sets, which then guides a probabilistic target search planner.
Operators provide a limited set of diverse inputs, including priority
definition, spatial semantic observations over ad-hoc geographical areas, and
reference waypoints, which are probabilistically fused with geographical
database information and condensed into a discretized value map representing an
operator's preferences over an operational area. An online, POMDP-based
planner, optimized for target searching, is augmented with this value map to
generate an operator-constrained vehicle waypoint guidance plan. We validate
the system by gathering input from five first responders trained in search \&amp;
rescue and compare simulated system performance against current operational
methods for autonomous missions. These results display effective task mental
model alignment and more efficient guidance plans, resulting in faster rescue
times.

<p class="mathjax">Every constructive model of computation (CMC) has an underlying composition
mechanism for combining simple computation devices into more complex ones.
Composition can be done by (explicitly or implicitly) defining control flow,
data flow or any combination thereof. Control flow specifies the order in which
individual computation devices are activated, whereas data flow defines how
data is exchanged among them. Unfortunately, traditional CMCs either mix data
and control or only consider one dimension explicitly, which makes it difficult
to reason about data flow and control flow separately. Reasoning about these
dimensions orthogonally is a crucial desideratum for optimisation,
maintainability and verification purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel
model that explicitly treats data flow and control flow as separate dimensions,
while providing modularity. As the model is rooted in category theory, it
provides category-theoretic operations for compositionally constructing
sequential or parallel composites. Compositionality entails that a composite
exhibits the same properties as its respective constituents, including
separation of concerns and modularity.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the classical problem of learning, with arbitrary accuracy, the
natural parameters of a $k$-parameter truncated \textit{minimal} exponential
family from i.i.d. samples in a computationally and statistically efficient
manner. We focus on the setting where the support as well as the natural
parameters are appropriately bounded. While the traditional maximum likelihood
estimator for this class of exponential family is consistent, asymptotically
normal, and asymptotically efficient, evaluating it is computationally hard. In
this work, we propose a novel loss function and a computationally efficient
estimator that is consistent as well as asymptotically normal under mild
conditions. We show that, at the population level, our method can be viewed as
the maximum likelihood estimation of a re-parameterized distribution belonging
to the same class of exponential family. Further, we show that our estimator
can be interpreted as a solution to minimizing a particular Bregman score as
well as an instance of minimizing the \textit{surrogate} likelihood. We also
provide finite sample guarantees to achieve an error (in $\ell_2$-norm) of
$\alpha$ in the parameter estimation with sample complexity $O({\sf
poly}(k)/\alpha^2)$. Our method achives the order-optimal sample complexity of
$O({\sf log}(k)/\alpha^2)$ when tailored for node-wise-sparse Markov random
fields. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our estimator via numerical
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Performance portability is a major concern on current architectures. One way
to achieve it is by using autotuning. In this paper, we are presenting how we
exten ded a just-in-time compilation infrastructure to introduce autotuning
capabiliti es triggered at run-time. When a function is executed, the first
iterations optimize it, and once the best solution has been found, it is used
for subsequent calls to the function. This just-in-time autotuning
infrastructure is relevant for optimizing computation kernels that will be
called numerous times with similar parameters through the execution,
re-optimizes kernels when they are called with other parameters, and the
programmer can obtain the optimal parameters to use them for other kernels. We
present an experimental performance evaluation of our approach. Compiling the
code introduces an overhead on the first iterations, and this overhead is
compensated for during subsequent iterations. We also determined that the
optimum found seems stable and accurate.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning and data analytics applications increasingly suffer from the
high latency and energy consumption of conventional von Neumann architectures.
Recently, several in-memory and near-memory systems have been proposed to
remove this von Neumann bottleneck. Platforms based on content-addressable
memories (CAMs) are particularly interesting due to their efficient support for
the search-based operations that form the foundation for many applications,
including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), high-dimensional computing (HDC),
recommender systems, and one-shot learning among others. Today, these platforms
are designed by hand and can only be programmed with low-level code, accessible
only to hardware experts. In this paper, we introduce C4CAM, the first compiler
framework to quickly explore CAM configurations and to seamlessly generate code
from high-level TorchScript code. C4CAM employs a hierarchy of abstractions
that progressively lowers programs, allowing code transformations at the most
suitable abstraction level. Depending on the type and technology, CAM arrays
exhibit varying latencies and power profiles. Our framework allows analyzing
the impact of such differences in terms of system-level performance and energy
consumption, and thus supports designers in selecting appropriate designs for a
given application.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces Radiology-Llama2, a large language model specialized
for radiology through a process known as instruction tuning. Radiology-Llama2
is based on the Llama2 architecture and further trained on a large dataset of
radiology reports to generate coherent and clinically useful impressions from
radiological findings. Quantitative evaluations using ROUGE metrics on the
MIMIC-CXR and OpenI datasets demonstrate that Radiology-Llama2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other generative language models, with
a Rouge-1 score of 0.4834 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.4185 on OpenI. Additional
assessments by radiology experts highlight the model's strengths in
understandability, coherence, relevance, conciseness, and clinical utility. The
work illustrates the potential of localized language models designed and tuned
for specialized domains like radiology. When properly evaluated and deployed,
such models can transform fields like radiology by automating rote tasks and
enhancing human expertise.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement
learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to
accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The
framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov
decision process, which is used to plan and analyze compositions of subsystems,
and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. The subsystems are
implemented as deep RL agents operating under partial observability. By
defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic
decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with
a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e.
achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability,
given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the
independent training and testing of the subsystems. We present theoretical
results guaranteeing that if each subsystem learns a policy satisfying its
subtask specification, then their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the
overall task specification. Conversely, if the subtask specifications cannot
all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated as
the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the high-level model, to
automatically update the subtask specifications to account for the observed
shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for defining subtask
specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them. Experimental
results demonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities in
environments with both full and partial observability, discrete and continuous
state and action spaces, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic and Cross-language code clone generation may be useful for code
reuse, code comprehension, refactoring and benchmarking. OpenAI's GPT model has
potential in such clone generation as GPT is used for text generation. When
developers copy/paste codes from Stack Overflow (SO) or within a system, there
might be inconsistent changes leading to unexpected behaviours. Similarly, if
someone possesses a code snippet in a particular programming language but seeks
equivalent functionality in a different language, a semantic cross-language
code clone generation approach could provide valuable assistance.In this study,
using SemanticCloneBench as a vehicle, we evaluated how well the GPT-3 model
could help generate semantic and cross-language clone variants for a given
fragment.We have comprised a diverse set of code fragments and assessed GPT-3s
performance in generating code variants.Through extensive experimentation and
analysis, where 9 judges spent 158 hours to validate, we investigate the
model's ability to produce accurate and semantically correct variants. Our
findings shed light on GPT-3's strengths in code generation, offering insights
into the potential applications and challenges of using advanced language
models in software development. Our quantitative analysis yields compelling
results. In the realm of semantic clones, GPT-3 attains an impressive accuracy
of 62.14% and 0.55 BLEU score, achieved through few-shot prompt engineering.
Furthermore, the model shines in transcending linguistic confines, boasting an
exceptional 91.25% accuracy in generating cross-language clones

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks can be easily fooled by small and imperceptible
perturbations. The query-based black-box attack (QBBA) is able to create the
perturbations using model output probabilities of image queries requiring no
access to the underlying models. QBBA poses realistic threats to real-world
applications. Recently, various types of robustness have been explored to
defend against QBBA. In this work, we first taxonomize the stochastic defense
strategies against QBBA. Following our taxonomy, we propose to explore
non-additive randomness in models to defend against QBBA. Specifically, we
focus on underexplored Vision Transformers based on their flexible
architectures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed defense approach
achieves effective defense, without much sacrifice in performance.

<p class="mathjax">We propose DiRL, a Diversity-inducing Representation Learning technique for
histopathology imaging. Self-supervised learning techniques, such as
contrastive and non-contrastive approaches, have been shown to learn rich and
effective representations of digitized tissue samples with limited pathologist
supervision. Our analysis of vanilla SSL-pretrained models' attention
distribution reveals an insightful observation: sparsity in attention, i.e,
models tends to localize most of their attention to some prominent patterns in
the image. Although attention sparsity can be beneficial in natural images due
to these prominent patterns being the object of interest itself, this can be
sub-optimal in digital pathology; this is because, unlike natural images,
digital pathology scans are not object-centric, but rather a complex phenotype
of various spatially intermixed biological components. Inadequate
diversification of attention in these complex images could result in crucial
information loss. To address this, we leverage cell segmentation to densely
extract multiple histopathology-specific representations, and then propose a
prior-guided dense pretext task for SSL, designed to match the multiple
corresponding representations between the views. Through this, the model learns
to attend to various components more closely and evenly, thus inducing adequate
diversification in attention for capturing context rich representations.
Through quantitative and qualitative analysis on multiple tasks across cancer
types, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method and observe that the attention
is more globally distributed.

<p class="mathjax">Dexterous manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. While
machine learning techniques have shown some promise, results have largely been
currently limited to simulation. This can be mostly attributed to the lack of
suitable hardware. In this paper, we present LEAP Hand, a low-cost dexterous
and anthropomorphic hand for machine learning research. In contrast to previous
hands, LEAP Hand has a novel kinematic structure that allows maximal dexterity
regardless of finger pose. LEAP Hand is low-cost and can be assembled in 4
hours at a cost of 2000 USD from readily available parts. It is capable of
consistently exerting large torques over long durations of time. We show that
LEAP Hand can be used to perform several manipulation tasks in the real world
-- from visual teleoperation to learning from passive video data and sim2real.
LEAP Hand significantly outperforms its closest competitor Allegro Hand in all
our experiments while being 1/8th of the cost. We release detailed assembly
instructions, the Sim2Real pipeline and a development platform with useful APIs
on our website at https://leap-hand.github.io/

<p class="mathjax">Tremendous efforts have been made to learn animatable and photorealistic
human avatars. Towards this end, both explicit and implicit 3D representations
are heavily studied for a holistic modeling and capture of the whole human
(e.g., body, clothing, face and hair), but neither representation is an optimal
choice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human
avatar have different modeling desiderata. For example, meshes are generally
not suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present
Disentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit
3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a
human avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we
demonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we
consider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,
we disentangle the face and hair. To do so, DELTA represents the body or face
with an explicit mesh-based parametric 3D model and the clothing or hair with
an implicit neural radiance field. To make this possible, we design an
end-to-end differentiable renderer that integrates meshes into volumetric
rendering, enabling DELTA to learn directly from monocular videos without any
3D supervision. Finally, we show that how these two applications can be easily
combined to model full-body avatars, such that the hair, face, body and
clothing can be fully disentangled yet jointly rendered. Such a disentanglement
enables hair and clothing transfer to arbitrary body shapes. We empirically
validate the effectiveness of DELTA's disentanglement by demonstrating its
promising performance on disentangled reconstruction, virtual clothing try-on
and hairstyle transfer. To facilitate future research, we also release an
open-sourced pipeline for the study of hybrid human avatar modeling.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel methodology that leverages the strength of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to address the counterdiabatic (CD)
protocol in the optimization of quantum circuits comprised of systems with
$N_{Q}$ qubits. The primary objective is to utilize physics-inspired deep
learning techniques to accurately solve the time evolution of the different
physical observables within the quantum system. To accomplish this objective,
we embed the necessary physical information into an underlying neural network
to effectively tackle the problem. In particular, we impose the hermiticity
condition on all physical observables and make use of the principle of least
action, guaranteeing the acquisition of the most appropriate counterdiabatic
terms based on the underlying physics. The proposed approach offers a
dependable alternative to address the CD driving problem, free from the
constraints typically encountered in previous methodologies relying on
classical numerical approximations. Our method provides a general framework to
obtain optimal results from the physical observables relevant to the problem,
including the external parameterization in time known as scheduling function,
the gauge potential or operator involving the non-adiabatic terms, as well as
the temporal evolution of the energy levels of the system, among others. The
main applications of this methodology have been the $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ and
$\mathrm{LiH}$ molecules, represented by a 2-qubit and 4-qubit systems
employing the STO-3G basis. The presented results demonstrate the successful
derivation of a desirable decomposition for the non-adiabatic terms, achieved
through a linear combination utilizing Pauli operators. This attribute confers
significant advantages to its practical implementation within quantum computing
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have been extensively studied in medical image segmentation to
build pairwise long-range dependence. Yet, relatively limited well-annotated
medical image data makes transformers struggle to extract diverse global
features, resulting in attention collapse where attention maps become similar
or even identical. Comparatively, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
better convergence properties on small-scale training data but suffer from
limited receptive fields. Existing works are dedicated to exploring the
combinations of CNN and transformers while ignoring attention collapse, leaving
the potential of transformers under-explored. In this paper, we propose to
build CNN-style Transformers (ConvFormer) to promote better attention
convergence and thus better segmentation performance. Specifically, ConvFormer
consists of pooling, CNN-style self-attention (CSA), and convolutional
feed-forward network (CFFN) corresponding to tokenization, self-attention, and
feed-forward network in vanilla vision transformers. In contrast to positional
embedding and tokenization, ConvFormer adopts 2D convolution and max-pooling
for both position information preservation and feature size reduction. In this
way, CSA takes 2D feature maps as inputs and establishes long-range dependency
by constructing self-attention matrices as convolution kernels with adaptive
sizes. Following CSA, 2D convolution is utilized for feature refinement through
CFFN. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of ConvFormer working as a plug-and-play module for consistent performance
improvement of transformer-based frameworks. Code is available at
https://github.com/xianlin7/ConvFormer.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce unsupervised machine learning techniques in order to identify
toric phases of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to the same
toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. These 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories are
worldvolume theories of a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and are
realized in terms of a Type IIB brane configuration known as a brane tiling. It
corresponds to the skeleton graph of the coamoeba projection of the mirror
curve associated to the toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. When we vary the complex
structure moduli of the mirror Calabi-Yau 3-fold, the coamoeba and the
corresponding brane tilings change their shape, giving rise to different toric
phases related by Seiberg duality. We illustrate that by employing techniques
such as principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding (t-SNE), we can project the space of coamoeba labelled by
complex structure moduli down to a lower dimensional phase space with phase
boundaries corresponding to Seiberg duality. In this work, we illustrate this
technique by obtaining a 2-dimensional phase diagram for brane tilings
corresponding to the cone over the zeroth Hirzebruch surface F0.

<p class="mathjax">Fast simulation of the energy depositions in high-granular detectors is
needed for future collider experiments with ever increasing luminosities.
Generative machine learning (ML) models have been shown to speed up and augment
the traditional simulation chain in physics analysis. However, the majority of
previous efforts were limited to models relying on fixed, regular detector
readout geometries. A major advancement is the recently introduced CaloClouds
model, a geometry-independent diffusion model, which generates calorimeter
showers as point clouds for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the envisioned
International Large Detector (ILD).
<br />In this work, we introduce CaloClouds II which features a number of key
improvements. This includes continuous time score-based modelling, which allows
for a 25 step sampling with comparable fidelity to CaloClouds while yielding a
$6\times$ speed-up over Geant4 on a single CPU ($5\times$ over CaloClouds). We
further distill the diffusion model into a consistency model allowing for
accurate sampling in a single step and resulting in a $46\times$ ($37\times$)
speed-up. This constitutes the first application of consistency distillation
for the generation of calorimeter showers.

<p class="mathjax">We explore a link between complexity and physics for circuits of given
functionality. Taking advantage of the connection between circuit counting
problems and the derivation of ensembles in statistical mechanics, we tie the
entropy of circuits of a given functionality and fixed number of gates to
circuit complexity. We use thermodynamic relations to connect the quantity
analogous to the equilibrium temperature to the exponent describing the
exponential growth of the number of distinct functionalities as a function of
complexity. This connection is intimately related to the finite compressibility
of typical circuits. Finally, we use the thermodynamic approach to formulate a
framework for the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important
problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of
neighboring sections of a circuit, which can viewed as the mixing of two
containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the
average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while
preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments
hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to
disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation
has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies
that there are circuits with same size and functionality that cannot be
connected via local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is
unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement
that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of complexity theory to
its first level.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of subtle deficits in everyday functioning due to cognitive
impairment is important for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases,
particularly Alzheimer's disease. However, current standards for assessment of
everyday functioning are based on qualitative, subjective ratings. Speech has
been shown to provide good objective markers for cognitive impairments, but the
association with cognition-relevant everyday functioning remains
uninvestigated. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a
smartwatch-based application to collect acoustic features as objective markers
for detecting deficits in everyday functioning. We collected voice data during
the performance of cognitive tasks and daily conversation, as possible
application scenarios, from 54 older adults, along with a measure of everyday
functioning. Machine learning models using acoustic features could detect
individuals with deficits in everyday functioning with up to 77.8% accuracy,
which was higher than the 68.5% accuracy with standard neuropsychological
tests. We also identified common acoustic features for robustly discriminating
deficits in everyday functioning across both types of voice data (cognitive
tasks and daily conversation). Our results suggest that common acoustic
features extracted from different types of voice data can be used as markers
for deficits in everyday functioning.

<p class="mathjax">The retina is the only part of the human body in which blood vessels can be
accessed non-invasively using imaging techniques such as digital fundus images
(DFI). The spatial distribution of the retinal microvasculature may change with
cardiovascular diseases and thus the eyes may be regarded as a window to our
hearts. Computerized segmentation of the retinal arterioles and venules (A/V)
is essential for automated microvasculature analysis. Using active learning, we
created a new DFI dataset containing 240 crowd-sourced manual A/V segmentations
performed by fifteen medical students and reviewed by an ophthalmologist, and
developed LUNet, a novel deep learning architecture for high resolution A/V
segmentation. LUNet architecture includes a double dilated convolutional block
that aims to enhance the receptive field of the model and reduce its parameter
count. Furthermore, LUNet has a long tail that operates at high resolution to
refine the segmentation. The custom loss function emphasizes the continuity of
the blood vessels. LUNet is shown to significantly outperform two
state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the local test set as well as on
four external test sets simulating distribution shifts across ethnicity,
comorbidities, and annotators. We make the newly created dataset open access
(upon publication).

<p class="mathjax">The objective of generative model inversion is to identify a size-$n$ latent
vector that produces a generative model output that closely matches a given
target. This operation is a core computational primitive in numerous modern
applications involving computer vision and NLP. However, the problem is known
to be computationally challenging and NP-hard in the worst case. This paper
aims to provide a fine-grained view of the landscape of computational hardness
for this problem. We establish several new hardness lower bounds for both exact
and approximate model inversion. In exact inversion, the goal is to determine
whether a target is contained within the range of a given generative model.
Under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH), we demonstrate that the
computational complexity of exact inversion is lower bounded by $\Omega(2^n)$
via a reduction from $k$-SAT; this is a strengthening of known results. For the
more practically relevant problem of approximate inversion, the goal is to
determine whether a point in the model range is close to a given target with
respect to the $\ell_p$-norm. When $p$ is a positive odd integer, under SETH,
we provide an $\Omega(2^n)$ complexity lower bound via a reduction from the
closest vectors problem (CVP). Finally, when $p$ is even, under the exponential
time hypothesis (ETH), we provide a lower bound of $2^{\Omega (n)}$ via a
reduction from Half-Clique and Vertex-Cover.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately quantifying the impact of radiation feedback in star formation is
challenging. To address this complex problem, we employ deep learning
techniques, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), to predict the
interstellar radiation field (ISRF) strength based on three-band dust emission
at 4.5 \um, 24 \um, and 250 \um. We adopt magnetohydrodynamic simulations from
the STARFORGE (STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments) project that model star
formation and giant molecular cloud (GMC) evolution. We generate synthetic dust
emission maps matching observed spectral energy distributions in the Monoceros
R2 (MonR2) GMC. We train DDPMs to estimate the ISRF using synthetic three-band
dust emission. The dispersion between the predictions and true values is within
a factor of 0.1 for the test set. We extended our assessment of the diffusion
model to include new simulations with varying physical parameters. While there
is a consistent offset observed in these out-of-distribution simulations, the
model effectively constrains the relative intensity to within a factor of 2.
Meanwhile, our analysis reveals weak correlation between the ISRF solely
derived from dust temperature and the actual ISRF. We apply our trained model
to predict the ISRF in MonR2, revealing a correspondence between intense ISRF,
bright sources, and high dust emission, confirming the model's ability to
capture ISRF variations. Our model robustly predicts radiation feedback
distribution, even in complex, poorly constrained ISRF environments like those
influenced by nearby star clusters. However, precise ISRF predictions require
an accurate training dataset mirroring the target molecular cloud's unique
physical conditions.

critical challenge across all areas of science and engineering. It is broadly
believed that even with today's computer advances resolving all spatiotemporal
scales described by the governing equations remains a remote target. This
realization has prompted intense efforts to develop model order reduction
techniques. In recent years, techniques based on deep recurrent neural networks
have produced promising results for the modeling and simulation of complex
spatiotemporal systems and offer large flexibility in model development as they
can incorporate experimental and computational data. However, neural networks
lack interpretability, which limits their utility and generalizability across
complex systems. Here we propose a novel framework of Interpretable Learning
Effective Dynamics (iLED) that offers comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art
recurrent neural network-based approaches while providing the added benefit of
interpretability. The iLED framework is motivated by Mori-Zwanzig and Koopman
operator theory, which justifies the choice of the specific architecture. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in simulations of three
benchmark multiscale systems. Our results show that the iLED framework can
generate accurate predictions and obtain interpretable dynamics, making it a
promising approach for solving high-dimensional multiscale systems.

<p class="mathjax">The ongoing modernization of the power system, involving new equipment
installations and upgrades, exposes the power system to the introduction of
malware into its operation through supply chain attacks. Supply chain attacks
present a significant threat to power systems, allowing cybercriminals to
bypass network defenses and execute deliberate attacks at the physical layer.
Given the exponential advancements in machine intelligence, cybercriminals will
leverage this technology to create sophisticated and adaptable attacks that can
be incorporated into supply chain attacks. We demonstrate the use of
reinforcement learning for developing intelligent attacks incorporated into
supply chain attacks against generation control devices. We simulate potential
disturbances impacting frequency and voltage regulation. The presented method
can provide valuable guidance for defending against supply chain attacks.

arborescences of the matrix digraph. We then show that it is possible, when the
source and target vertices of an arc are not strongly connected, to move the

determinant unchanged, as long as the source and target vertices are not

<p class="mathjax">Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) cysts are pre-malignant
pancreas lesions, and they can progress into pancreatic cancer. Therefore,
detecting and stratifying their risk level is of ultimate importance for
effective treatment planning and disease control. However, this is a highly
challenging task because of the diverse and irregular shape, texture, and size
of the IPMN cysts as well as the pancreas. In this study, we propose a novel
computer-aided diagnosis pipeline for IPMN risk classification from
multi-contrast MRI scans. Our proposed analysis framework includes an efficient
volumetric self-adapting segmentation strategy for pancreas delineation,
followed by a newly designed deep learning-based classification scheme with a
radiomics-based predictive approach. We test our proposed decision-fusion model
in multi-center data sets of 246 multi-contrast MRI scans and obtain superior
performance to the state of the art (SOTA) in this field. Our ablation studies
demonstrate the significance of both radiomics and deep learning modules for
achieving the new SOTA performance compared to international guidelines and
published studies (81.9\% vs 61.3\% in accuracy). Our findings have important
implications for clinical decision-making. In a series of rigorous experiments
on multi-center data sets (246 MRI scans from five centers), we achieved
unprecedented performance (81.9\% accuracy).

<p class="mathjax">Most sub-grid scale (SGS) models employed in LES (large eddy simulation)
formulations were originally developed for incompressible, single phase, inert
flows and assume transfer of energy based on the classical energy cascade
mechanism. Although they have been extended to numerically study compressible
and reactive flows involving deflagrations and detonations, their accuracy in
such sensitive and challenging flows is an open question. Therefore, there is a
need for both assessing these existing SGS models and identifying the
opportunities for proposing new ones, which properly characterize reacting
flows in complex engine configurations such as those characterizing rotating
detonation engines (RDEs). Accordingly, accounting for the decay of free
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), this work provides a comparison of four
different SGS models when compressibility effects are present, (i) the
classical Smagorinsky model, (ii) the dynamic Smagorinsky model, (iii) the
wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, and (iv) the Vreman model.
More specifically, SGS models are firstly implemented in the open-source
computational tool PeleC, which is a high-fidelity finite-volume solver for
compressible flows, and then numerical simulations are carried out using them.
In terms of results, turbulent spectra, and the decay of physical quantities
such as kinetic energy, enstrophy, temperature, and dilatation are computed for
each SGS LES model and compared with direct numerical simulations (DNS) results
available in literature. The LES numerical results obtained here highlight that
the studied SGS models are capable of capturing the overall trends of all
physical quantities accounted for. However, they also emphasize the need of
improved SGS models capable of adequately describing turbulence dynamics in
compressible flows.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of the interaction between a moving plane shock wave and an
inclined wall (wedge), it is possible to distinguish four distinct shock
reflection configurations. These shock wave reflections, which depend on the
characteristics of the incident shock wave and the geometry of the surface that
it interacts with, are (i) regular reflection (RR), (ii) simple Mach reflection
(SMR), (iii) transition Mach reflection (TMR), and (iv) double Mach reflection
(DMR). The impact of these shock reflections on flow properties can be
significant so understanding them is important when predicting the behavior of
shock waves in more complex flow configurations. Previous research works have
explored the referred shock reflections through both numerical and experimental
approaches, employing various gases and different flow and geometrical
configurations. The present study involves the use of a high-fidelity
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool, known as PeleC, which is a
compressible solver based on AMReX specifically designed to handle complex flow
configurations. Accordingly, by solving the time-dependent Euler equations for
various 2D flow configurations, this work studies shock wave reflections
accounting for four different Mach-based operating conditions and compares and
analyzes the resulting density profiles on the wedge wall with experimental
data. To strike a balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency,
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is incorporated, and a mesh independence study
is performed by varying the number of AMR levels. The results of this study
demonstrate the capabilities of the CFD tool employed as it accurately predicts
the sensitivity of wave characteristics to different operating conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the dynamics of premixed flames that propagates in confined
systems is important in a wide range of applications. The study of premixed
flames propagating in a closed channel covers a variety of complexities related
to flame ignition, laminar flame development, and strong non-linear interaction
between the flame and the surrounding walls. Accordingly, to study the dynamics
of premixed flames propagating in closed channels, numerical simulations of the
propagation of distorted tulip flames are carried out in this work. More
specifically, a set of fully reactive compressible transport equations are
solved here using the high-order PPM. A 21-step chemical kinetic mechanism is
employed to model the chemical kinetics and the energy release in an
air-hydrogen mixture. Computational mesh independence studies are carried out
in this work by both refining grid elements and employing different levels of
adaptive mesh refinements (AMR). The main results show that the classic tulip
flame behavior evolves into a distorted one. Indeed, two consecutive collapses
on the flame front are observed, which are related to wave pressure and the
presence of reverse flow. It is particularly found that the pressure wave
produced by the interaction of the flame skirt with the side walls reduces the
flame velocity and contributes to the formation of tulip flames. This is
consistent with the reduction in both flame area and pressure gradient at the
flame tip. Furthermore, the collapse of flame cups is associated with the
formation of the vortex near the channel side walls and the increase of
pressure waves.

<p class="mathjax">Single-modality medical images generally do not contain enough information to
reach an accurate and reliable diagnosis. For this reason, physicians generally
diagnose diseases based on multimodal medical images such as, e.g., PET/CT. The
effective fusion of multimodal information is essential to reach a reliable
decision and explain how the decision is made as well. In this paper, we
propose a fusion framework for multimodal medical image segmentation based on
deep learning and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In this framework,
the reliability of each single modality image when segmenting different objects
is taken into account by a contextual discounting operation. The discounted
pieces of evidence from each modality are then combined by Dempster's rule to
reach a final decision. Experimental results with a PET-CT dataset with
lymphomas and a multi-MRI dataset with brain tumors show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and reliability.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation is critical for diagnosing and treating spinal
disorders. However, the presence of high noise, ambiguity, and uncertainty
makes this task highly challenging. Factors such as unclear anatomical
boundaries, inter-class similarities, and irrational annotations contribute to
this challenge. Achieving both accurate and diverse segmentation templates is
essential to support radiologists in clinical practice. In recent years,
denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) has emerged as a prominent
research topic in computer vision. It has demonstrated effectiveness in various
vision tasks, including image deblurring, super-resolution, anomaly detection,
and even semantic representation generation at the pixel level. Despite the
robustness of existing diffusion models in visual generation tasks, they still
struggle with discrete masks and their various effects. To address the need for
accurate and diverse spine medical image segmentation templates, we propose an
end-to-end framework called VerseDiff-UNet, which leverages the denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our approach integrates the diffusion
model into a standard U-shaped architecture. At each step, we combine the
noise-added image with the labeled mask to guide the diffusion direction
accurately towards the target region. Furthermore, to capture specific
anatomical a priori information in medical images, we incorporate a shape a
priori module. This module efficiently extracts structural semantic information
from the input spine images. We evaluate our method on a single dataset of
spine images acquired through X-ray imaging. Our results demonstrate that
VerseDiff-UNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in
terms of accuracy while preserving the natural features and variations of
anatomy.

<p class="mathjax">We propose MatSci ML, a novel benchmark for modeling MATerials SCIence using
Machine Learning (MatSci ML) methods focused on solid-state materials with
periodic crystal structures. Applying machine learning methods to solid-state
materials is a nascent field with substantial fragmentation largely driven by
the great variety of datasets used to develop machine learning models. This
fragmentation makes comparing the performance and generalizability of different
methods difficult, thereby hindering overall research progress in the field.
Building on top of open-source datasets, including large-scale datasets like
the OpenCatalyst, OQMD, NOMAD, the Carolina Materials Database, and Materials
Project, the MatSci ML benchmark provides a diverse set of materials systems
and properties data for model training and evaluation, including simulated
energies, atomic forces, material bandgaps, as well as classification data for
crystal symmetries via space groups. The diversity of properties in MatSci ML
makes the implementation and evaluation of multi-task learning algorithms for
solid-state materials possible, while the diversity of datasets facilitates the
development of new, more generalized algorithms and methods across multiple

to combine observations from multiple datasets to perform joint prediction of
common properties, such as energy and forces. Using MatSci ML, we evaluate the
performance of different graph neural networks and equivariant point cloud

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the potential of near-field localization using
widely-spaced multi-subarrays (WSMSs) and analyzing the corresponding angle and
range Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs). By employing the Riemann sum, closed-form CRB
expressions are derived for the spherical wavefront-based WSMS (SW-WSMS). We
find that the CRBs can be characterized by the angular span formed by the line
connecting the array's two ends to the target, and the different WSMSs with
same angular spans but different number of subarrays have identical normalized
CRBs. We provide a theoretical proof that, in certain scenarios, the CRB of
WSMSs is smaller than that of uniform arrays. We further yield the closed-form
CRBs for the hybrid spherical and planar wavefront-based WSMS (HSPW-WSMS), and
its components can be seen as decompositions of the parameters from the CRBs
for the SW-WSMS. Simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the
derived closed-form CRBs and provide further insights into various system
characteristics. Basically, this paper underscores the high resolution of
utilizing WSMS for localization, reinforces the validity of adopting the HSPW
assumption, and, considering its applications in communications, indicates a
promising outlook for integrated sensing and communications based on
HSPW-WSMSs.

<p class="mathjax">A speech spoofing countermeasure (CM) that discriminates between unseen
spoofed and bona fide data requires diverse training data. While many datasets
use spoofed data generated by speech synthesis systems, it was recently found
that data vocoded by neural vocoders were also effective as the spoofed
training data. Since many neural vocoders are fast in building and generation,
this study used multiple neural vocoders and created more than 9,000 hours of
vocoded data on the basis of the VoxCeleb2 corpus. This study investigates how
this large-scale vocoded data can improve spoofing countermeasures that use
data-hungry self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Experiments demonstrated
that the overall CM performance on multiple test sets improved when using
features extracted by an SSL model continually trained on the vocoded data.
Further improvement was observed when using a new SSL distilled from the two
SSLs before and after the continual training. The CM with the distilled SSL
outperformed the previous best model on challenging unseen test sets, including
the ASVspoof 2019 logical access, WaveFake, and In-the-Wild.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed learning on edge devices has attracted increased attention with
the advent of federated learning (FL). Notably, edge devices often have limited
battery and heterogeneous energy availability, while multiple rounds are
required in FL for convergence, intensifying the need for energy efficiency.
Energy depletion may hinder the training process and the efficient utilization
of the trained model. To solve these problems, this letter considers the
integration of energy harvesting (EH) devices into a FL network with
multi-channel ALOHA, while proposing a method to ensure both low energy outage
probability and successful execution of future tasks. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, particularly in critical setups
where the average energy income fails to cover the iteration cost. The method
outperforms a norm based solution in terms of convergence time and battery
level.

<p class="mathjax">We experimentally explored novel behaviors of non-reciprocal absorption and
almost zero reflection in a dual photon resonator system, which is physically
separated and composed of two inverted split ring resonators (ISRRs) with
varying inter-distances. We also found that an
electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT)-like peak at a specific
inter-distance of d = 18 mm through traveling waves flowing along a shared
microstrip line to which the dual ISRRs are dissipatively coupled. With the aid
of CST-simulations and analytical modeling, we found that destructive and/or
constructive interferences in traveling waves, indirectly coupled to each ISRR,
result in a traveling-wave-induced transparency peak within a narrow window.
Furthermore, we observed not only strong non-reciprocal responses of
reflectivity and absorptivity at individual inter-distances exactly at the
corresponding EIT-like peak positions, but also nearly zero reflection and
almost perfect absorption for a specific case of d = 20 mm. Finally, the
unidirectional absorptions with zero reflection at d = 20 mm are found to be
ascribed to a non-Hermitian origin. This work not only provides a better
understanding of traveling-wave-induced indirect coupling between two photonic
resonators without magnetic coupling, but also suggests potential implications
for the resulting non-reciprocal behaviors of absorption and reflection in
microwave circuits and quantum information devices.

<p class="mathjax">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) always suffered from the problem of long
acquisition time. MRI reconstruction is one solution to reduce scan time by
skipping certain phase-encoding lines and then restoring high-quality images
from undersampled measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR)
has emerged as a new deep learning method that represents an object as a
continuous function of spatial coordinates, and this function is normally
parameterized by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we propose a
novel MRI reconstruction method based on INR, which represents the
fully-sampled images as the function of pixel coordinates and prior feature
vectors of undersampled images for overcoming the generalization problem of
INR. Specifically, we introduce a scale-embedded encoder to produce
scale-independent pixel-specific features from MR images with different
undersampled scales and then concatenate with coordinates vectors to recover
fully-sampled MR images via an MLP, thus achieving arbitrary scale
reconstruction. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by
experimenting on publicly available MRI datasets and compared with other
reconstruction methods. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed method over alternative reconstruction methods.

<p class="mathjax">Given a positive integer $d$, the class $d$-DIR is defined as all those
intersection graphs formed from a finite collection of line segments in
${\mathbb R}^2$ having at most $d$ slopes. Since each slope induces an interval
graph, it easily follows for every $G$ in $d$-DIR with clique number at most
$\omega$ that the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ is at most $d\omega$. We
show for every even value of $\omega$ how to construct a graph in $d$-DIR that
meets this bound exactly. This partially confirms a conjecture of Bhattacharya,
Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Noorizadeh. Furthermore, we show that the $\chi$-binding
function of $d$-DIR is $\omega \mapsto d\omega$ for $\omega$ even and $\omega
\mapsto d(\omega-1)+1$ for $\omega$ odd. This refutes said conjecture of

<p class="mathjax">We present a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for brain vessel
segmentation from different image modalities. Existing state-of-the-art methods
focus on a single modality, despite the wide range of available cerebrovascular
imaging techniques. This can lead to significant distribution shifts that
negatively impact the generalization across modalities. By relying on annotated
angiographies and a limited number of annotated venographies, our framework
accomplishes image-to-image translation and semantic segmentation, leveraging a
disentangled and semantically rich latent space to represent heterogeneous data
and perform image-level adaptation from source to target domains. Moreover, we
reduce the typical complexity of cycle-based architectures and minimize the use
of adversarial training, which allows us to build an efficient and intuitive
model with stable training. We evaluate our method on magnetic resonance
angiographies and venographies. While achieving state-of-the-art performance in
the source domain, our method attains a Dice score coefficient in the target
domain that is only 8.9% lower, highlighting its promising potential for robust
cerebrovascular image segmentation across different modalities.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an innovative method that can be used to produce
deterministic channel models for 5G industrial internet-of-things (IIoT)
scenarios. Ray-tracing (RT) channel emulation can capture many of the specific
properties of a propagation scenario, which is incredibly beneficial when
facing various industrial environments and deployment setups. But the
environment's complexity, composed of many metallic objects of different sizes
and shapes, pushes the RT tool to its limits. In particular, the scattering or
diffusion phenomena can bring significant components. Thus, in this article,
the Volcano RT channel simulation is tuned and benchmarked against field
measurements found in the literature at two frequencies relevant to 5G
industrial networks: 3.7 GHz (mid-band) and 28 GHz (millimeter-wave (mmWave)
band), to produce calibrated ray-based channel model. Both specular and diffuse
scattering contributions are calculated. Finally, the tuned RT data is compared
to measured large-scale parameters, such as the power delay profile (PDP), the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of delay spreads (DSs), both in
line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) situations and relevant IIoT channel
properties are further explored.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning techniques are attractive options for developing
highly-accurate automated analysis tools for nanomaterials characterization,
including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). However,
successfully implementing such machine learning tools can be difficult due to
the challenges in procuring sufficiently large, high-quality training datasets
from experiments. In this work, we introduce Construction Zone, a Python
package for rapidly generating complex nanoscale atomic structures, and develop
an end-to-end workflow for creating large simulated databases for training
neural networks. Construction Zone enables fast, systematic sampling of
realistic nanomaterial structures, and can be used as a random structure
generator for simulated databases, which is important for generating large,
diverse synthetic datasets. Using HRTEM imaging as an example, we train a
series of neural networks on various subsets of our simulated databases to
segment nanoparticles and holistically study the data curation process to
understand how various aspects of the curated simulated data -- including
simulation fidelity, the distribution of atomic structures, and the
distribution of imaging conditions -- affect model performance across several
experimental benchmarks. Using our results, we are able to achieve
state-of-the-art segmentation performance on experimental HRTEM images of
nanoparticles from several experimental benchmarks and, further, we discuss
robust strategies for consistently achieving high performance with machine
learning in experimental settings using purely synthetic data.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models excel in many human-language tasks but often falter in
highly specialized domains like scholarly astronomy. To bridge this gap, we
introduce AstroLLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter model fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 using
over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. Optimized for traditional causal
language modeling, AstroLLaMA achieves a 30% lower perplexity than Llama-2,
showing marked domain adaptation. Our model generates more insightful and
scientifically relevant text completions and embedding extraction than
state-of-the-arts foundation models despite having significantly fewer
parameters. AstroLLaMA serves as a robust, domain-specific model with broad
fine-tuning potential. Its public release aims to spur astronomy-focused
research, including automatic paper summarization and conversational agent
development.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of digital pathology and microscopic systems that can scan
and save whole slide histological images automatically, there is a growing
trend to use computerized methods to analyze acquired images. Among different
histopathological image analysis tasks, nuclei instance segmentation plays a
fundamental role in a wide range of clinical and research applications. While
many semi- and fully-automatic computerized methods have been proposed for
nuclei instance segmentation, deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been
shown to deliver the best performances. However, the performance of such
approaches usually degrades when tested on unseen datasets.
<br />In this work, we propose a novel approach to improve the generalization
capability of a DL-based automatic segmentation approach. Besides utilizing one
of the state-of-the-art DL-based models as a baseline, our method incorporates
non-deterministic train time and deterministic test time stain normalization.
We trained the model with one single training set and evaluated its
segmentation performance on seven test datasets. Our results show that the
proposed method provides up to 5.77%, 5.36%, and 5.27% better performance in
segmenting nuclei based on Dice score, aggregated Jaccard index, and panoptic
quality score, respectively, compared to the baseline segmentation model.

<p class="mathjax">The acoustic variability of noisy and reverberant speech mixtures is
influenced by multiple factors, such as the spectro-temporal characteristics of
the target speaker and the interfering noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and the room characteristics. This large variability poses a major challenge
for learning-based speech enhancement systems, since a mismatch between the
training and testing conditions can substantially reduce the performance of the
system. Generalization to unseen conditions is typically assessed by testing
the system with a new speech, noise or binaural room impulse response (BRIR)
database different from the one used during training. However, the difficulty
of the speech enhancement task can change across databases, which can
substantially influence the results. The present study introduces a
generalization assessment framework that uses a reference model trained on the
test condition, such that it can be used as a proxy for the difficulty of the
test condition. This allows to disentangle the effect of the change in task
difficulty from the effect of dealing with new data, and thus to define a new
measure of generalization performance termed the generalization gap. The
procedure is repeated in a cross-validation fashion by cycling through multiple
speech, noise, and BRIR databases to accurately estimate the generalization
gap. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate the generalization potential
of a feedforward neural network (FFNN), Conv-TasNet, DCCRN and MANNER. We find
that for all models, the performance degrades the most in speech mismatches,
while good noise and room generalization can be achieved by training on
multiple databases. Moreover, while recent models show higher performance in
matched conditions, their performance substantially decreases in mismatched
conditions and can become inferior to that of the FFNN-based system.

<p class="mathjax">Analysis of high-dimensional data has led to increased interest in both
single index models (SIMs) and best subset selection. SIMs provide an
interpretable and flexible modeling framework for high-dimensional data, while
best subset selection aims to find a sparse model from a large set of
predictors. However, best subset selection in high-dimensional models is known
to be computationally intractable. Existing methods tend to relax the
selection, but do not yield the best subset solution. In this paper, we
directly tackle the intractability by proposing the first provably scalable
algorithm for best subset selection in high-dimensional SIMs. Our algorithmic
solution enjoys the subset selection consistency and has the oracle property
with a high probability. The algorithm comprises a generalized information
criterion to determine the support size of the regression coefficients,
eliminating the model selection tuning. Moreover, our method does not assume an
error distribution or a specific link function and hence is flexible to apply.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method is not only
computationally efficient but also able to exactly recover the best subset in
various settings (e.g., linear regression, Poisson regression, heteroscedastic
models).

<p class="mathjax">Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML) regression
tasks is becoming the focus of many studies in materials and chemical science.
It is now well understood that average calibration is insufficient, and most
studies implement additional methods testing the conditional calibration with
respect to uncertainty, i.e. consistency. Consistency is assessed mostly by
so-called reliability diagrams. There exists however another way beyond average
calibration, which is conditional calibration with respect to input features,
i.e. adaptivity. In practice, adaptivity is the main concern of the final users
of a ML-UQ method, seeking for the reliability of predictions and uncertainties
for any point in features space. This article aims to show that consistency and
adaptivity are complementary validation targets, and that a good consistency
does not imply a good adaptivity. Adapted validation methods are proposed and
illustrated on a representative example.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel method for developing discretization-consistent closure
schemes for implicitly filtered Large Eddy Simulation (LES). In implicitly
filtered LES, the induced filter kernel, and thus the closure terms, are
determined by the properties of the grid and the discretization operator,
leading to additional computational subgrid terms that are generally unknown in
a priori analysis. Therefore, the task of adapting the coefficients of LES
closure models is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved in an a
posteriori manner with Reinforcement Learning (RL). This allows to adjust the
model to the actual discretization as it also incorporates the interaction
between the discretization and the model itself. This optimization framework is
applied to both explicit and implicit closure models. An element-local eddy
viscosity model is optimized as the explicit model. For the implicit modeling,
RL is applied to identify an optimal blending strategy for a hybrid
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite volume scheme. All newly derived models
achieve accurate and consistent results, either matching or outperforming
classical state-of-the-art models for different discretizations and
resolutions. Moreover, the explicit model is demonstrated to adapt its
distribution of viscosity within the DG elements to the inhomogeneous
discretization properties of the operator. In the implicit case, the optimized
hybrid scheme renders itself as a viable modeling ansatz that could initiate a
new class of high order schemes for compressible turbulence. Overall, the
results demonstrate that the proposed RL optimization can provide
discretization-consistent closures that could reduce the uncertainty in
implicitly filtered LES.

<p class="mathjax">MRI is increasingly being used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa),
with diffusion MRI (dMRI) playing an integral role. When combined with
computational models, dMRI can estimate microstructural information such as
cell size. Conventionally, such models are fit with a nonlinear least squares
(NLLS) curve fitting approach, associated with a high computational cost.
Supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) are an efficient alternative, however
their performance is significantly affected by the underlying distribution of
the synthetic training data. Self-supervised learning is an attractive
alternative, where instead of using a separate training dataset, the network
learns the features of the input data itself. This approach has only been
applied to fitting of trivial dMRI models thus far. Here, we introduce a
self-supervised DNN to estimate the parameters of the VERDICT (Vascular,
Extracellular and Restricted DIffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) model for
prostate. We demonstrate, for the first time, fitting of a complex
three-compartment biophysical model with machine learning without the
requirement of explicit training labels. We compare the estimation performance
to baseline NLLS and supervised DNN methods, observing improvement in
estimation accuracy and reduction in bias with respect to ground truth values.
Our approach also achieves a higher confidence level for discrimination between
cancerous and benign prostate tissue in comparison to the other methods on a
dataset of 20 PCa patients, indicating potential for accurate tumour
characterisation.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an inexact decentralized dual gradient tracking method (iDDGT) for
distributed optimization problems with a globally coupled equality constraint.
Unlike existing algorithms that rely on either the exact dual gradient or an
inexact one obtained through single-step gradient descent, iDDGT introduces a
new approach: utilizing an inexact dual gradient with controllable levels of
inexactness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that iDDGT achieves
significantly higher computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, it is proved that iDDGT can achieve linear convergence
over directed graphs without imposing any conditions on the constraint matrix.
This expands its applicability beyond existing algorithms that require the
constraint matrix to have full row rank and undirected graphs for achieving
linear convergence.

density functional theory data from the AFLOW database as being metallic or
semiconducting/insulating. We then perform a neural-architecture search to
explore the model architecture and hyperparameter space of MPNNs to predict the
band gaps of the materials identified as non-metals. The parameters in the
search include the number of message-passing steps, latent size, and
activation-function, among others. The top-performing models from the search
are pooled into an ensemble that significantly outperforms existing models from
the literature. Uncertainty quantification is evaluated with Monte-Carlo
Dropout and ensembling, with the ensemble method proving superior. The domain
of applicability of the ensemble model is analyzed with respect to the crystal
systems, the inclusion of a Hubbard parameter in the density functional
calculations, and the atomic species building up the materials.

<p class="mathjax">Thompson sampling (TS) is one of the most popular and earliest algorithms to
solve stochastic multi-armed bandit problems. We consider a variant of TS,
named $\alpha$-TS, where we use a fractional or $\alpha$-posterior
($\alpha\in(0,1)$) instead of the standard posterior distribution. To compute
an $\alpha$-posterior, the likelihood in the definition of the standard
posterior is tempered with a factor $\alpha$. For $\alpha$-TS we obtain both
instance-dependent $\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{k \neq i^*}
\Delta_k\left(\frac{\log(T)}{C(\alpha)\Delta_k^2} + \frac{1}{2} \right)\right)$
and instance-independent $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{KT\log K})$ frequentist regret
bounds under very mild conditions on the prior and reward distributions, where
$\Delta_k$ is the gap between the true mean rewards of the $k^{th}$ and the
best arms, and $C(\alpha)$ is a known constant. Both the sub-Gaussian and
exponential family models satisfy our general conditions on the reward
distribution. Our conditions on the prior distribution just require its density
to be positive, continuous, and bounded. We also establish another
instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches (up to constants) to that of
improved UCB [Auer and Ortner, 2010]. Our regret analysis carefully combines
recent theoretical developments in the non-asymptotic concentration analysis
and Bernstein-von Mises type results for the $\alpha$-posterior distribution.
Moreover, our analysis does not require additional structural properties such
as closed-form posteriors or conjugate priors.

<p class="mathjax">We present an effective application of quantum machine learning in
histopathological cancer detection. The study here emphasizes two primary
applications of hybrid classical-quantum Deep Learning models. The first
application is to build a classification model for histopathological cancer
detection using the quantum transfer learning strategy. The second application
is to test the performance of this model for various adversarial attacks.
Rather than using a single transfer learning model, the hybrid
classical-quantum models are tested using multiple transfer learning models,
especially ResNet18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet as feature extractors
and integrate it with several quantum circuit-based variational quantum
circuits (VQC) with high expressibility. As a result, we provide a comparative
analysis of classical models and hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning
models for histopathological cancer detection under several adversarial
attacks. We compared the performance accuracy of the classical model with the
hybrid classical-quantum model using pennylane default quantum simulator. We
also observed that for histopathological cancer detection under several
adversarial attacks, Hybrid Classical-Quantum (HCQ) models provided better
accuracy than classical image classification models.

<p class="mathjax">Lung diseases are a leading cause of child mortality in the developing world,
with India accounting for approximately half of global pneumonia deaths
(370,000) in 2016. Timely diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality rates.
This paper introduces a low-density neural network structure to mitigate
topological challenges in deep networks. The network incorporates parameters
into a feature pyramid, enhancing data extraction and minimizing information
loss. Soft Non-Maximal Suppression optimizes regional proposals generated by
the Region Proposal Network. The study evaluates the model on chest X-ray
images, computing a confusion matrix to determine accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, and specificity. We analyze loss functions, highlighting their
trends during training. The regional proposal loss and classification loss
assess model performance during training and classification phases. This paper
analysis lung disease detection and neural network structures.

<p class="mathjax">In recent decades, traditional drug research and development have been facing
challenges such as high cost, long timelines, and high risks. To address these
issues, many computational approaches have been suggested for predicting the
relationship between drugs and diseases through drug repositioning, aiming to
reduce the cost, development cycle, and risks associated with developing new
drugs. Researchers have explored different computational methods to predict
drug-disease associations, including drug side effects-disease associations,
drug-target associations, and miRNAdisease associations. In this comprehensive
review, we focus on recent advances in predicting drug-disease association
methods for drug repositioning. We first categorize these methods into several
groups, including neural network-based algorithms, matrixbased algorithms,
recommendation algorithms, link-based reasoning algorithms, and text mining and
semantic reasoning. Then, we compare the prediction performance of existing
drug-disease association prediction algorithms. Lastly, we delve into the
present challenges and future prospects concerning drug-disease associations.

<p class="mathjax">Renal pathology, as the gold standard of kidney disease diagnosis, requires
doctors to analyze a serial of tissue slices stained by H\&amp;E staining and
special staining like Masson, PASM, and PAS, respectively. These special
staining methods are costly, time-consuming, and hard to standardize for wide
use especially in primary hospitals. Advances of supervised learning methods
can virtually convert H\&amp;E images into special staining images, but the
pixel-to-pixel alignment is hard to achieve for training. As contrast,
unsupervised learning methods regarding different stains as different style
transferring domains can use unpaired data, but they ignore the spatial
inter-domain correlations and thus decrease the trustworthiness of structural
details for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual staining
framework AGMDT to translate images into other domains by avoiding pixel-level
alignment and meanwhile utilizing the correlations among adjacent tissue
slices. We first build a high-quality multi-domain renal histological dataset
where each specimen case comprises a series of slices stained in various ways.
Based on it, the proposed framework AGMDT discovers patch-level aligned pairs
across the serial slices of multi-domains through glomerulus detection and
bipartite graph matching, and utilizes such correlations to supervise the
end-to-end model for multi-domain staining transformation. Experimental results
show that the proposed AGMDT achieves a good balance between the precise
pixel-level alignment and unpaired domain transfer by exploiting correlations
across multi-domain serial pathological slices, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative measure and morphological
details.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a growing interest in parallel strategies for solving
trajectory optimization problems. One key step in many algorithmic approaches
to trajectory optimization is the solution of moderately-large and sparse
linear systems. Iterative methods are particularly well-suited for parallel
solves of such systems. However, fast and stable convergence of iterative
methods is reliant on the application of a high-quality preconditioner that
reduces the spread and increase the clustering of the eigenvalues of the target
matrix. To improve the performance of these approaches, we present a new
parallel-friendly symmetric stair preconditioner. We prove that our
preconditioner has advantageous theoretical properties when used in conjunction
with iterative methods for trajectory optimization such as a more clustered
eigenvalue spectrum. Numerical experiments with typical trajectory optimization
problems reveal that as compared to the best alternative parallel
preconditioner from the literature, our symmetric stair preconditioner provides
up to a 34% reduction in condition number and up to a 25% reduction in the
number of resulting linear system solver iterations.
