<p class="mathjax">Utilizing state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic code
generation models play a pivotal role in enhancing the productivity and
efficiency of software development coding procedures. As the adoption of LLMs
becomes more widespread in software coding ecosystems, a pressing issue has
emerged: does the generated code contain social biases, such as those related
to age, gender, and race? This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and
ethical foundation of software applications that depend on the code generated
by these models, yet is under-explored in the literature. This paper presents a
novel bias assessment framework that is specifically designed for code
generation tasks. Based on this framework, we conduct an extensive evaluation
on the bias of nine state-of-the-art LLM-based code generation models. Our
findings reveal that first, 31.45\% to 79.93\% code functions generated by our
evaluated code generation models are biased, and 9.68\% to 37.37\% code
functions' functionality are affected by the bias, which means biases not only
exist in code generation models but in some cases, directly affect the
functionality of the generated code, posing risks of unintended and possibly
harmful software behaviors. To mitigate bias from code generation models, we
propose three mitigation strategies, which can decrease the biased code ratio
to a very low level of 0.4\% to 4.57\%.

<p class="mathjax">The principal aim of this Master's thesis is to propel the optimization of
the membrane wing structure of the Northeastern Aerobat through origami
techniques and enhancing its capacity for secure hovering within confined
spaces. Bio-inspired drones offer distinctive capabilities that pave the way
for innovative applications, encompassing wildlife monitoring, precision
agriculture, search and rescue operations, as well as the augmentation of
residential safety. The evolved noise-reduction mechanisms of birds and insects
prove advantageous for drones utilized in tasks like surveillance and wildlife
observation, ensuring operation devoid of disturbances. Traditional flying
drones equipped with rotary or fixed wings encounter notable constraints when
navigating narrow pathways. While rotary and fixed-wing systems are
conventionally harnessed for surveillance and reconnaissance, the integration
of onboard sensor suites within micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) has garnered
interest in vigilantly monitoring hazardous scenarios in residential settings.
Notwithstanding the agility and commendable fault tolerance exhibited by
systems such as quadrotors in demanding conditions, their inflexible body
structures impede collision tolerance, necessitating operational spaces free of
collisions. Recent years have witnessed an upsurge in integrating soft and
pliable materials into the design of such systems; however, the pursuit of
aerodynamic efficiency curtails the utilization of excessively flexible
materials for rotor blades or propellers. This thesis introduces a design that
integrates polyimide flexible PCBs into the wings of the Aerobat and employs
guard design incorporating feedback-driven stabilizers, enabling stable
hovering flights within Northeastern's Robotics-Inspired Study and
Experimentation (RISE) cage.

<p class="mathjax">Signal temporal logic (STL) has gained popularity in robotics for expressing
complex specifications that may involve timing requirements or deadlines. While
the control synthesis for STL specifications without nested temporal operators
has been studied in the literature, the case of nested temporal operators is
substantially more challenging and requires new theoretical advancements. In
this work, we propose an efficient continuous-time control synthesis framework
for nonlinear systems under nested STL specifications. The framework is based
on the notions of signal temporal logic tree (sTLT) and control barrier
function (CBF). In particular, we detail the construction of an sTLT from a
given STL formula and a continuous-time dynamical system, the sTLT semantics
(i.e., satisfaction condition), and the equivalence or under-approximation
relation between sTLT and STL. Leveraging the fact that the satisfaction
condition of an sTLT is essentially keeping the state within certain sets
during certain time intervals, it provides explicit guidelines for the CBF
design. The resulting controller is obtained through the utilization of an
online CBF-based program coupled with an event-triggered scheme for online
updating the activation time interval of each CBF, with which the correctness
of the system behavior can be established by construction. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method for single-integrator and unicycle models under
nested STL formulas.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and
are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately, there has been a
rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious
content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human
values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such
alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking
attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In
this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against
potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon
an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without
requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM.
Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its
effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through
real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate
that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial
prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack
success rates from nearly 100\% to around 10\% or less.

<p class="mathjax">Many infrastructure managers have the goal to increase the capacity of their
railway infrastructure due to an increasing demand. While methods for
performance calculations of railway line infrastructure are already well
established, the determination of railway junction capacity remains a
challenge. This work utilizes the concept of queueing theory to develop a
method for the capacity calculation of railway junctions, solely depending on
their infrastructure layout along with arrival and service rates. The
implementation of the introduced approach is based on advanced model-checking
techniques. It can be used to decide which infrastructure layout to build, i.e.
whether an overpass for the analysed railway junction is needed. The developed
method hence addresses the need for fast and reliable timetable independent
junction evaluation in the long-term railway capacity calculation landscape.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of populism concerns many political scientists and practitioners,
yet the detection of its underlying language remains fragmentary. This paper
aims to provide a reliable, valid, and scalable approach to measure populist
stances. For that purpose, we created an annotated dataset based on
parliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag (2013 to 2021). Following the
ideational definition of populism, we label moralizing references to the
virtuous people or the corrupt elite as core dimensions of populist language.
To identify, in addition, how the thin ideology of populism is thickened, we
annotate how populist statements are attached to left-wing or right-wing host
ideologies. We then train a transformer-based model (PopBERT) as a multilabel
classifier to detect and quantify each dimension. A battery of validation
checks reveals that the model has a strong predictive accuracy, provides high
qualitative face validity, matches party rankings of expert surveys, and
detects out-of-sample text snippets correctly. PopBERT enables dynamic analyses
of how German-speaking politicians and parties use populist language as a
strategic device. Furthermore, the annotator-level data may also be applied in
cross-domain applications or to develop related classifiers.

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactual examples have proven to be valuable in the field of natural
language processing (NLP) for both evaluating and improving the robustness of
language models to spurious correlations in datasets. Despite their
demonstrated utility for NLP, multimodal counterfactual examples have been
relatively unexplored due to the difficulty of creating paired image-text data
with minimal counterfactual changes. To address this challenge, we introduce a
scalable framework for automatic generation of counterfactual examples using
text-to-image diffusion models. We use our framework to create
COCO-Counterfactuals, a multimodal counterfactual dataset of paired image and
text captions based on the MS-COCO dataset. We validate the quality of
COCO-Counterfactuals through human evaluations and show that existing
multimodal models are challenged by our counterfactual image-text pairs.
Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of COCO-Counterfactuals for
improving out-of-domain generalization of multimodal vision-language models via
training data augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Limited transferability hinders the performance of deep learning models when
applied to new application scenarios. Recently, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) has achieved significant progress in addressing this issue via learning
domain-invariant features. However, the performance of existing UDA methods is
constrained by the large domain shift and limited target domain data. To
alleviate these issues, we propose DomAin-guided Conditional Diffusion Model
(DACDM) to generate high-fidelity and diversity samples for the target domain.
In the proposed DACDM, by introducing class information, the labels of
generated samples can be controlled, and a domain classifier is further
introduced in DACDM to guide the generated samples for the target domain. The
generated samples help existing UDA methods transfer from the source domain to
the target domain more easily, thus improving the transfer performance.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DACDM brings a
large improvement to the performance of existing UDA methods.

<p class="mathjax">Previous methods on knowledge base question generation (KBQG) primarily focus
on enhancing the quality of a single generated question. Recognizing the
remarkable paraphrasing ability of humans, we contend that diverse texts should
convey the same semantics through varied expressions. The above insights make
diversifying question generation an intriguing task, where the first challenge
is evaluation metrics for diversity. Current metrics inadequately assess the
above diversity since they calculate the ratio of unique n-grams in the
generated question itself, which leans more towards measuring duplication
rather than true diversity. Accordingly, we devise a new diversity evaluation
metric, which measures the diversity among top-k generated questions for each
instance while ensuring their relevance to the ground truth. Clearly, the
second challenge is how to enhance diversifying question generation. To address
this challenge, we introduce a dual model framework interwoven by two selection
strategies to generate diverse questions leveraging external natural questions.
The main idea of our dual framework is to extract more diverse expressions and
integrate them into the generation model to enhance diversifying question
generation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks for KBQG
demonstrate that our proposed approach generates highly diverse questions and
improves the performance of question answering tasks.

<p class="mathjax">We study life over the course of video game history as represented by their
mechanics. While there have been some variations depending on genre or
"character type", we find that most games converge to a similar representation.
We also examine the development of Conway's Game of Life (one of the first zero
player games) and related automata that have developed over the years. With
this history in mind, we investigate the viability of one popular form of
automata, namely Neural Cellular Automata, as a way to more fully express life
within video game settings and innovate new game mechanics or gameplay loops.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the powerful capabilities demonstrated by large language model (LLM),
there has been a recent surge in efforts to integrate them with AI agents to
enhance their performance. In this paper, we have explored the core differences
and characteristics between LLM-based AI agents and traditional AI agents.
Specifically, we first compare the fundamental characteristics of these two
types of agents, clarifying the significant advantages of LLM-based agents in
handling natural language, knowledge storage, and reasoning capabilities.
Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the key components of AI
agents, including planning, memory, and tool use. Particularly, for the crucial
component of memory, this paper introduced an innovative classification scheme,
not only departing from traditional classification methods but also providing a
fresh perspective on the design of an AI agent's memory system. We firmly
believe that in-depth research and understanding of these core components will
lay a solid foundation for the future advancement of AI agent technology. At
the end of the paper, we provide directional suggestions for further research
in this field, with the hope of offering valuable insights to scholars and
researchers in the field.

<p class="mathjax">High quality transcription data is crucial for training automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems. However, the existing industry-level data collection
pipelines are expensive to researchers, while the quality of crowdsourced
transcription is low. In this paper, we propose a reliable method to collect
speech transcriptions. We introduce two mechanisms to improve transcription
quality: confidence estimation based reprocessing at labeling stage, and
automatic word error correction at post-labeling stage. We collect and release
LibriCrowd - a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of audio transcriptions on 100
hours of English speech. Experiment shows the Transcription WER is reduced by
over 50%. We further investigate the impact of transcription error on ASR model
performance and found a strong correlation. The transcription quality
improvement provides over 10% relative WER reduction for ASR models. We release
the dataset and code to benefit the research community.

<p class="mathjax">Interpreting regulatory documents or building codes into computer-processable
formats is essential for the intelligent design and construction of buildings
and infrastructures. Although automated rule interpretation (ARI) methods have
been investigated for years, most of them highly depend on the early and manual
filtering of interpretable clauses from a building code. While few of them
considered machine interpretability, which represents the potential to be
transformed into a computer-processable format, from both clause- and
document-level. Therefore, this research aims to propose a novel approach to
automatically evaluate and enhance the machine interpretability of single
clause and building codes. First, a few categories are introduced to classify
each clause in a building code considering the requirements for rule
interpretation, and a dataset is developed for model training. Then, an
efficient text classification model is developed based on a pretrained
domain-specific language model and transfer learning techniques. Finally, a
quantitative evaluation method is proposed to assess the overall
interpretability of building codes. Experiments show that the proposed text
classification algorithm outperforms the existing CNN- or RNN-based methods,
improving the F1-score from 72.16% to 93.60%. It is also illustrated that the
proposed classification method can enhance downstream ARI methods with an
improvement of 4%. Furthermore, analyzing the results of more than 150 building
codes in China showed that their average interpretability is 34.40%, which
implies that it is still hard to fully transform the entire regulatory document
into computer-processable formats. It is also argued that the interpretability
of building codes should be further improved both from the human side and the
machine side.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an
unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and
social sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks
previously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution proposes a
systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise,
machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to
transparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased
as proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical
semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference
and text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre
composition in literature and film; social network inference, automated
lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural
analytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM
applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving
smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In
all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs
can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human)
annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and
should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping
approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how
tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex
computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in
a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace,
but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in
sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have
arguably never been more critical.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) models,
particularly transformer-based pre-trained models, has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) fields. However, researchers
have discovered that these models can inadvertently capture and reinforce
social biases present in their training datasets, leading to potential social
harms, such as uneven resource allocation and unfair representation of specific
social groups. Addressing these biases and ensuring fairness in artificial
intelligence (AI) systems has become a critical concern in the ML community.
<br />The recent introduction of pre-trained vision-and-language (VL) models in the
emerging multimodal field demands attention to the potential social biases
present in these models as well. Although VL models are susceptible to social
bias, there is a limited understanding compared to the extensive discussions on
bias in NLP and CV. This survey aims to provide researchers with a high-level
insight into the similarities and differences of social bias studies in
pre-trained models across NLP, CV, and VL. By examining these perspectives, the
survey aims to offer valuable guidelines on how to approach and mitigate social
bias in both unimodal and multimodal settings. The findings and recommendations
presented here can benefit the ML community, fostering the development of
fairer and non-biased AI models in various applications and research endeavors.

<p class="mathjax">Cough acoustics contain multitudes of vital information about
pathomorphological alterations in the respiratory system. Reliable and accurate
detection of cough events by investigating the underlying cough latent features
and disease diagnosis can play an indispensable role in revitalizing the
healthcare practices. The recent application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and advances of ubiquitous computing for respiratory disease prediction has
created an auspicious trend and myriad of future possibilities in the medical
domain. In particular, there is an expeditiously emerging trend of Machine
learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based diagnostic algorithms exploiting
cough signatures. The enormous body of literature on cough-based AI algorithms
demonstrate that these models can play a significant role for detecting the
onset of a specific respiratory disease. However, it is pertinent to collect
the information from all relevant studies in an exhaustive manner for the
medical experts and AI scientists to analyze the decisive role of AI/ML. This
survey offers a comprehensive overview of the cough data-driven ML/DL detection
and preliminary diagnosis frameworks, along with a detailed list of significant
features. We investigate the mechanism that causes cough and the latent cough
features of the respiratory modalities. We also analyze the customized cough
monitoring application, and their AI-powered recognition algorithms. Challenges
and prospective future research directions to develop practical, robust, and
ubiquitous solutions are also discussed in detail.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models have recently attracted a
great deal of interest from a variety of application sectors. Despite
significant developments in this area, there are still no standardized methods
or approaches for understanding AI model outputs. A systematic and cohesive
framework is also increasingly necessary to incorporate new techniques like
discriminative and generative models to close the gap. This paper contributes
to the discourse on XAI by presenting an empirical evaluation based on a novel
framework: Sampling - Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) - Ensemble Anomaly
Detection (SVEAD). It is a hybrid architecture where VAE combined with ensemble
stacking and SHapley Additive exPlanations are used for imbalanced
classification. The finding reveals that combining ensemble stacking, VAE, and
SHAP can. not only lead to better model performance but also provide an easily
explainable framework. This work has used SHAP combined with Permutation
Importance and Individual Conditional Expectations to create a powerful
interpretability of the model. The finding has an important implication in the
real world, where the need for XAI is paramount to boost confidence in AI
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary robotics offers a powerful framework for designing and evolving
robot morphologies, particularly in the context of modular robots. However, the
role of query mechanisms during the genotype-to-phenotype mapping process has
been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by conducting a
comparative analysis of query mechanisms in the brain-body co-evolution of
modular robots. Using two different query mechanisms, Breadth-First Search
(BFS) and Random Query, within the context of evolving robot morphologies using
CPPNs and robot controllers using tensors, and testing them in two evolutionary
frameworks, Lamarckian and Darwinian systems, this study investigates their
influence on evolutionary outcomes and performance. The findings demonstrate
the impact of the two query mechanisms on the evolution and performance of
modular robot bodies, including morphological intelligence, diversity, and
morphological traits. This study suggests that BFS is both more effective and
efficient in producing highly performing robots. It also reveals that
initially, robot diversity was higher with BFS compared to Random Query, but in
the Lamarckian system, it declines faster, converging to superior designs,
while in the Darwinian system, BFS led to higher end-process diversity.

<p class="mathjax">Recent document question answering models consist of two key components: the
vision encoder, which captures layout and visual elements in images, and a
Large Language Model (LLM) that helps contextualize questions to the image and
supplements them with external world knowledge to generate accurate answers.
However, the relative contributions of the vision encoder and the language
model in these tasks remain unclear. This is especially interesting given the
effectiveness of instruction-tuned LLMs, which exhibit remarkable adaptability
to new tasks. To this end, we explore the following aspects in this work: (1)
The efficacy of an LLM-only approach on document question answering tasks (2)
strategies for serializing textual information within document images and
feeding it directly to an instruction-tuned LLM, thus bypassing the need for an
explicit vision encoder (3) thorough quantitative analysis on the feasibility
of such an approach. Our comprehensive analysis encompasses six diverse
benchmark datasets, utilizing LLMs of varying scales. Our findings reveal that
a strategy exclusively reliant on the LLM yields results that are on par with
or closely approach state-of-the-art performance across a range of datasets. We
posit that this evaluation framework will serve as a guiding resource for
selecting appropriate datasets for future research endeavors that emphasize the
fundamental importance of layout and image content information.

<p class="mathjax">User churn, characterized by customers ending their relationship with a
business, has profound economic consequences across various
Business-to-Customer scenarios. For numerous system-to-user actions, such as
promotional discounts and retention campaigns, predicting potential churners
stands as a primary objective. In volatile sectors like fantasy sports,
unpredictable factors such as international sports events can influence even
regular spending habits. Consequently, while transaction history and
user-product interaction are valuable in predicting churn, they demand deep
domain knowledge and intricate feature engineering. Additionally, feature
development for churn prediction systems can be resource-intensive,
particularly in production settings serving 200m+ users, where inference
pipelines largely focus on feature engineering. This paper conducts an
exhaustive study on predicting user churn using historical data. We aim to
create a model forecasting customer churn likelihood, facilitating businesses
in comprehending attrition trends and formulating effective retention plans.
Our approach treats churn prediction as multivariate time series
classification, demonstrating that combining user activity and deep neural
networks yields remarkable results for churn prediction in complex
business-to-customer contexts.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is increasingly used to cope with the
open-world assumption in service-oriented systems. Deep RL was successfully
applied to problems such as dynamic service composition, job scheduling, and
offloading, as well as service adaptation. While Deep RL offers many benefits,
understanding the decision-making of Deep RL is challenging because its learned
decision-making policy essentially appears as a black box. Yet, understanding
the decision-making of Deep RL is key to help service developers perform
debugging, support service providers to comply with relevant legal frameworks,
and facilitate service users to build trust. We introduce Chat4XAI to
facilitate the understanding of the decision-making of Deep RL by providing
natural-language explanations. Compared with visual explanations, the reported
benefits of natural-language explanations include better understandability for
non-technical users, increased user acceptance and trust, as well as more
efficient explanations. Chat4XAI leverages modern AI chatbot technology and
dedicated prompt engineering. Compared to earlier work on natural-language
explanations using classical software-based dialogue systems, using an AI
chatbot eliminates the need for eliciting and defining potential questions and
answers up-front. We prototypically realize Chat4XAI using OpenAI's ChatGPT API
and evaluate the fidelity and stability of its explanations using an adaptive
service exemplar.

<p class="mathjax">The carbon footprint associated with large language models (LLMs) is a
significant concern, encompassing emissions from their training, inference,
experimentation, and storage processes, including operational and embodied
carbon emissions. An essential aspect is accurately estimating the carbon
impact of emerging LLMs even before their training, which heavily relies on GPU
usage. Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but
only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks
prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It
cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs,
disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and
cannot model embodied carbon footprints. Addressing these gaps, we introduce
\textit{LLMCarbon}, an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model designed
for both dense and MoE LLMs. Compared to mlco2, LLMCarbon significantly
enhances the accuracy of carbon footprint estimations for various LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Domain-to-domain translation involves generating a target domain sample given
a condition in the source domain. Most existing methods focus on fixed input
and output domains, i.e. they only work for specific configurations (i.e. for
two domains, either $D_1\rightarrow{}D_2$ or $D_2\rightarrow{}D_1$). This paper
proposes Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a conditional diffusion framework for
multi-domain translation in a semi-supervised context. Unlike previous methods,
MDD does not require defining input and output domains, allowing translation
between any partition of domains within a set (such as $(D_1,
D_2)\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\rightarrow{}D_1$,
etc. for 3 domains), without the need to train separate models for each domain
configuration. The key idea behind MDD is to leverage the noise formulation of
diffusion models by incorporating one noise level per domain, which allows
missing domains to be modeled with noise in a natural way. This transforms the
training task from a simple reconstruction task to a domain translation task,
where the model relies on less noisy domains to reconstruct more noisy domains.
We present results on a multi-domain (with more than two domains) synthetic
image translation dataset with challenging semantic domain inversion.

<p class="mathjax">A sudden roadblock on highways due to many reasons such as road maintenance,
accidents, and car repair is a common situation we encounter almost daily.
Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) equipped with sensors that can acquire vehicle
dynamics such as speed, acceleration, and location can make intelligent
decisions to change lanes before reaching a roadblock. A number of literature
studies have examined car-following models and lane-changing models. However,
only a few studies proposed an integrated car-following and lane-changing
model, which has the potential to model practical driving maneuvers. Hence, in
this paper, we present an integrated car-following and lane-changing
decision-control system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address
this issue. Specifically, we consider a scenario where sudden construction work
will be carried out along a highway. We model the scenario as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) and employ the well-known DQN algorithm to train the RL agent to
make the appropriate decision accordingly (i.e., either stay in the same lane
or change lanes). To overcome the delay and computational requirement of DRL
algorithms, we adopt an MEC-assisted architecture where the RL agents are
trained on MEC servers. We utilize the highly reputable SUMO simulator and
OPENAI GYM to evaluate the performance of the proposed model under two
policies; {\epsilon}-greedy policy and Boltzmann policy. The results
unequivocally demonstrate that the DQN agent trained using the
{\epsilon}-greedy policy significantly outperforms the one trained with the
Boltzmann policy.

<p class="mathjax">Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering
hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer
machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans
to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness,
but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in
question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an
alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic
program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to
longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid
rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about
a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce
plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed
correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic
solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code.
Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since
assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable
to the use of symbolic methods. Guess &amp; Sketch extracts alignment and
confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic
solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output.
We test Guess &amp; Sketch on three different test sets of assembly transpilation
tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6%
more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler.
We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.

<p class="mathjax">The biggest Breast cancer is increasingly a major factor in female
fatalities, overtaking heart disease. While genetic factors are important in
the growth of breast cancer, new research indicates that environmental factors
also play a substantial role in its occurrence and progression. The literature
on the various environmental factors that may affect breast cancer risk,
incidence, and outcomes is thoroughly reviewed in this study report. The study
starts by looking at how lifestyle decisions, such as eating habits, exercise
routines, and alcohol consumption, may affect hormonal imbalances and
inflammation, two important factors driving the development of breast cancer.
Additionally, it explores the part played by environmental contaminants such
pesticides, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and industrial emissions,
all of which have been linked to a higher risk of developing breast cancer due
to their interference with hormone signaling and DNA damage. Algorithms for
machine learning are used to express predictions. Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, KNN Algorithm, SVC and extra tree classifier. Metrics including the
confusion matrix correlation coefficient, F1-score, Precision, Recall, and ROC
curve were used to evaluate the models. The best accuracy among all the
classifiers is Random Forest with 0.91% accuracy and ROC curve 0.901% of
Logistic Regression. The accuracy of the multiple algorithms for machine
learning utilized in this research was good, which is important and indicates
that these techniques could serve as replacement forecasting techniques in
breast cancer survival analysis, notably in the Asia region.

<p class="mathjax">Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an approach to therapy that emphasizes
collaboration and encourages behavioral change. To evaluate the quality of an
MI conversation, client utterances can be classified using the MISC code as
either change talk, sustain talk, or follow/neutral talk. The proportion of
change talk in a MI conversation is positively correlated with therapy
outcomes, making accurate classification of client utterances essential. In
this paper, we present a classifier that accurately distinguishes between the
three MISC classes (change talk, sustain talk, and follow/neutral talk)
leveraging multimodal features such as text, prosody, facial expressivity, and
body expressivity. To train our model, we perform annotations on the publicly
available AnnoMI dataset to collect multimodal information, including text,
audio, facial expressivity, and body expressivity. Furthermore, we identify the
most important modalities in the decision-making process, providing valuable
insights into the interplay of different modalities during a MI conversation.

<p class="mathjax">Regular expressions are widely used in software. Various regular expression
engines support different combinations of extensions to classical regular
constructs such as Kleene star, concatenation, nondeterministic choice (union
in terms of match semantics). The extensions include e.g. anchors, lookarounds,
counters, backreferences. The properties of combinations of such extensions
have been subject of active recent research.
<br />In the current paper we present a symbolic derivatives based approach to
finding matches to regular expressions that, in addition to the classical
regular constructs, also support complement, intersection and lookarounds (both
negative and positive lookaheads and lookbacks). The theory of computing
symbolic derivatives and determining nullability given an input string is
presented that shows that such a combination of extensions yields a match
semantics that corresponds to an effective Boolean algebra, which in turn opens
up possibilities of applying various Boolean logic rewrite rules to optimize
the search for matches.
<br />In addition to the theoretical framework we present an implementation of the
combination of extensions to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach
accompanied with practical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Language models can store vast amounts of factual knowledge, but their
ability to use this knowledge for logical reasoning remains questionable. This
paper explores a language model's ability to manipulate its stored knowledge
during inference. We focus on four manipulation types: retrieval (e.g., "What
is person A's attribute X"), classification (e.g., "Is A's attribute X even or
odd?"), comparison (e.g., "Is A greater than B in attribute X?") and inverse
search (e.g., "Which person's attribute X equals T?")
<br />We observe that pre-trained language models like GPT2/3/4 excel in knowledge
retrieval but struggle with simple classification or comparison tasks unless
Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) are employed during both training and inference. They
also perform poorly in inverse knowledge search, irrespective of the prompts.
Our primary contribution is a synthetic dataset for a controlled experiment
that confirms these inherent weaknesses: a language model cannot efficiently
manipulate knowledge from pre-training data, even when such knowledge is
perfectly stored and fully extractable in the models, and despite adequate
instruct fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Humans are surrounded by audio signals that include both speech and
non-speech sounds. The recognition and understanding of speech and non-speech
audio events, along with a profound comprehension of the relationship between
them, constitute fundamental cognitive capabilities. For the first time, we
build a machine learning model, called LTU-AS, that has a conceptually similar
universal audio perception and advanced reasoning ability. Specifically, by
integrating Whisper as a perception module and LLaMA as a reasoning module,
LTU-AS can simultaneously recognize and jointly understand spoken text, speech
paralinguistics, and non-speech audio events - almost everything perceivable
from audio signals.

<p class="mathjax">A general-purpose service robot (GPSR), which can execute diverse tasks in
various environments, requires a system with high generalizability and
adaptability to tasks and environments. In this paper, we first developed a
top-level GPSR system for worldwide competition (RoboCup@Home 2023) based on
multiple foundation models. This system is both generalizable to variations and
adaptive by prompting each model. Then, by analyzing the performance of the
developed system, we found three types of failure in more realistic GPSR
application settings: insufficient information, incorrect plan generation, and
plan execution failure. We then propose the self-recovery prompting pipeline,
which explores the necessary information and modifies its prompts to recover
from failure. We experimentally confirm that the system with the self-recovery
mechanism can accomplish tasks by resolving various failure cases.

<p class="mathjax">The AHU algorithm has been the state of the art since the 1970s for
determining in linear time whether two unordered rooted trees are isomorphic or
not. However, it has been criticized (by Campbell and Radford) for the way it
is written, which requires several (re)readings to be understood, and does not
facilitate its analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative version of
the AHU algorithm, which addresses this issue by being designed to be clearer
to understand and implement, with the same theoretical complexity and equally
fast in practice.. Whereas the key to the linearity of the original algorithm
lay on the careful sorting of lists of integers, we replace this step by the
multiplication of lists of prime numbers, and prove that this substitution
causes no loss in the final complexity of the new algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Technological innovations are a major driver of economic development that
depend on the exchange of knowledge and ideas among those with unique but
complementary specialized knowledge and knowhow. However, measurement of
specialized knowledge embedded in technologists, scientists and entrepreneurs
in the knowledge economy presents an empirical challenge as both the exchange
of knowledge and knowledge itself remain difficult to observe. We develop novel
measures of specialized knowledge using a unique dataset of longitudinal
records of participation at technology-focused meetup events in two regional
knowledge economics. Our measures of specialized knowledge can be further used
to quantify the extend of knowledge spillover and network rewiring and uncover
underlying social mechanisms that contribute to the development of increasingly
complex and differentiated networks in maturing knowledge economies. We apply
these methods in the context of the rapid morphogenesis of emerging regional
technology economies in New York City and Los Angeles.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT has entered classrooms, but not via the typical route of other
educational technology, which includes comprehensive training, documentation,
and vetting. Consequently, teachers are urgently tasked to assess its
capabilities to determine potential effects on student learning and instruct
their use of ChatGPT. However, it is unclear what support teachers have and
need and whether existing documentation, such as model cards, provides adequate
direction for educators in this new paradigm. By interviewing 22 middle- and
high-school teachers, we connect the discourse on AI transparency and
documentation with educational technology integration, highlighting the
critical information needs of teachers. Our findings reveal that teachers
confront significant information gaps, lacking clarity on exploring ChatGPT's
capabilities for bespoke learning tasks and ensuring its fit with the needs of
diverse learners. As a solution, we propose a framework for interactive model
documentation that empowers teachers to navigate the interplay between
pedagogical and technical knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) exhibit dynamic capabilities and appear to
comprehend complex and ambiguous natural language prompts. However, calibrating
LLM interactions is challenging for interface designers and end-users alike. A
central issue is our limited grasp of how human cognitive processes begin with
a goal and form intentions for executing actions, a blindspot even in
established interaction models such as Norman's gulfs of execution and
evaluation. To address this gap, we theorize how end-users 'envision'
translating their goals into clear intentions and craft prompts to obtain the
desired LLM response. We define a process of Envisioning by highlighting three
misalignments: (1) knowing whether LLMs can accomplish the task, (2) how to
instruct the LLM to do the task, and (3) how to evaluate the success of the
LLM's output in meeting the goal. Finally, we make recommendations to narrow
the envisioning gulf in human-LLM interactions.

<p class="mathjax">Shape servoing, a robotic task dedicated to controlling objects to desired
goal shapes, is a promising approach to deformable object manipulation. An
issue arises, however, with the reliance on the specification of a goal shape.
This goal has been obtained either by a laborious domain knowledge engineering
process or by manually manipulating the object into the desired shape and
capturing the goal shape at that specific moment, both of which are impractical
in various robotic applications. In this paper, we solve this problem by
developing a novel neural network DefGoalNet, which learns deformable object
goal shapes directly from a small number of human demonstrations. We
demonstrate our method's effectiveness on various robotic tasks, both in
simulation and on a physical robot. Notably, in the surgical retraction task,
even when trained with as few as 10 demonstrations, our method achieves a
median success percentage of nearly 90%. These results mark a substantial
advancement in enabling shape servoing methods to bring deformable object
manipulation closer to practical, real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">The stochastic block model (SBM) is extensively used to model networks in
which users belong to certain communities. In recent years, the study of
information-theoretic compression of such networks has gained attention, with
works primarily focusing on lossless compression. In this work, we address the
lossy compression of SBM graphs by characterizing the rate-distortion function
under a Hamming distortion constraint. Specifically, we derive the conditional
rate-distortion function of the SBM with community membership as side
information. We approach this problem as the classical Wyner-Ziv lossy problem
by minimising mutual information of the graph and its reconstruction
conditioned on community labels. Lastly, we also derive the rate-distortion
function of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random graph model.

<p class="mathjax">While professional integrated programming environments support developers
with advanced debugging functionality, block-based programming environments for
young learners often provide no support for debugging at all, thus inhibiting
debugging and preventing debugging education. In this paper we introduce
NuzzleBug, an extension of the popular block-based programming environment
Scratch that provides the missing debugging support. NuzzleBug allows
controlling the executions of Scratch programs with classical debugging
functionality such as stepping and breakpoints, and it is an omniscient
debugger that also allows reverse stepping. To support learners in deriving
hypotheses that guide debugging, NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger that
enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the
behavior in question. In order to evaluate NuzzleBug, we survey the opinions of
teachers, and study the effects on learners in terms of debugging effectiveness
and efficiency. We find that teachers consider NuzzleBug to be useful, and
children can use it to debug faulty programs effectively. However, systematic
debugging requires dedicated training, and even when NuzzleBug can provide
correct answers learners may require further help to comprehend faults and
necessary fixes, thus calling for further research on improving debugging
techniques and the information they provide.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating the speed of vehicles using traffic cameras is a crucial task for
traffic surveillance and management, enabling more optimal traffic flow,
improved road safety, and lower environmental impact. Transportation-dependent
systems, such as for navigation and logistics, have great potential to benefit
from reliable speed estimation. While there is prior research in this area
reporting competitive accuracy levels, their solutions lack reproducibility and
robustness across different datasets. To address this, we provide a novel
framework for automatic real-time vehicle speed calculation, which copes with
more diverse data from publicly available traffic cameras to achieve greater
robustness. Our model employs novel techniques to estimate the length of road
segments via depth map prediction. Additionally, our framework is capable of
handling realistic conditions such as camera movements and different video
stream inputs automatically. We compare our model to three well-known models in
the field using their benchmark datasets. While our model does not set a new
state of the art regarding prediction performance, the results are competitive
on realistic CCTV videos. At the same time, our end-to-end pipeline offers more
consistent results, an easier implementation, and better compatibility. Its
modular structure facilitates reproducibility and future improvements.

<p class="mathjax">To reduce their environmental impact, cloud datacenters' are increasingly
focused on optimizing applications' carbon-efficiency, or work done per mass of
carbon emitted. To facilitate such optimizations, we present Carbon Containers,
a simple system-level facility, which extends prior work on power containers,
that automatically regulates applications' carbon emissions in response to
variations in both their workload's intensity and their energy's
carbon-intensity. Specifically, \carbonContainerS enable applications to
specify a maximum carbon emissions rate (in g$\cdot$CO$_2$e/hr), and then
transparently enforce this rate via a combination of vertical scaling,
container migration, and suspend/resume while maximizing either
energy-efficiency or performance.
<br />Carbon Containers are especially useful for applications that i) must
continue running even during high-carbon periods, and ii) execute in regions
with few variations in carbon-intensity. These low-variability regions also
tend to have high average carbon-intensity, which increases the importance of
regulating carbon emissions. We implement a Carbon Containers prototype by
extending Linux Containers to incorporate the mechanisms above and evaluate it
using real workload traces and carbon-intensity data from multiple regions. We
compare Carbon Containers with prior work that regulates carbon emissions by
suspending/resuming applications during high/low carbon periods. We show that
Carbon Containers are more carbon-efficient and improve performance while
maintaining similar carbon emissions.

that human eyes cannot differentiate between natural and colorized images.
However, this poses a potential security concern, as forged or illegally
manipulated images can be used illegally. There is a growing need for effective
detection methods to distinguish between natural color and computer-colorized
images. This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of
transfer and ensemble learning approaches to help reduce training time and
resource requirements while proposing a model to classify natural color and
computer-colorized images. The proposed model uses pre-trained branches VGG16
and Resnet50, along with Mobile Net v2 or Efficientnet feature vectors. The
proposed model showed promising results, with accuracy ranging from 94.55% to
99.13% and very low Half Total Error Rate values. The proposed model
outperformed existing state-of-the-art models regarding classification
performance and generalization capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting system anomalies based on log data is important for ensuring the
security and reliability of computer systems. Recently, deep learning models
have been widely used for log anomaly detection. The core idea is to model the
log sequences as natural language and adopt deep sequential models, such as
LSTM or Transformer, to encode the normal patterns in log sequences via
language modeling. However, there is a gap between language modeling and
anomaly detection as the objective of training a sequential model via a
language modeling loss is not directly related to anomaly detection. To fill up
the gap, we propose LogGPT, a novel framework that employs GPT for log anomaly
detection. LogGPT is first trained to predict the next log entry based on the
preceding sequence. To further enhance the performance of LogGPT, we propose a
novel reinforcement learning strategy to finetune the model specifically for
the log anomaly detection task. The experimental results on three datasets show
that LogGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">There has recently been an increased scientific interest in the
de-anonymization of users in anonymized databases containing user-level
microdata via multifarious matching strategies utilizing publicly available
correlated data. Existing literature has either emphasized practical aspects
where underlying data distribution is not required, with limited or no
theoretical guarantees, or theoretical aspects with the assumption of complete
availability of underlying distributions. In this work, we take a step towards
reconciling these two lines of work by providing theoretical guarantees for the
de-anonymization of random correlated databases without prior knowledge of data
distribution. Motivated by time-indexed microdata, we consider database
de-anonymization under both synchronization errors (column repetitions) and
obfuscation (noise). By modifying the previously used replica detection
algorithm to accommodate for the unknown underlying distribution, proposing a
new seeded deletion detection algorithm, and employing statistical and
information-theoretic tools, we derive sufficient conditions on the database
growth rate for successful matching. Our findings demonstrate that a
double-logarithmic seed size relative to row size ensures successful deletion
detection. More importantly, we show that the derived sufficient conditions are
the same as in the distribution-aware setting, negating any asymptotic loss of
performance due to unknown underlying distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Joint intent detection and slot filling, which is also termed as joint NLU
(Natural Language Understanding) is invaluable for smart voice assistants.
Recent advancements in this area have been heavily focusing on improving
accuracy using various techniques. Explainability is undoubtedly an important
aspect for deep learning-based models including joint NLU models. Without
explainability, their decisions are opaque to the outside world and hence, have
tendency to lack user trust. Therefore to bridge this gap, we transform the
full joint NLU model to be `inherently' explainable at granular levels without
compromising on accuracy. Further, as we enable the full joint NLU model
explainable, we show that our extension can be successfully used in other
general classification tasks. We demonstrate this using sentiment analysis and
named entity recognition.

<p class="mathjax">The use of machine learning (ML) models to assess and score textual data has
become increasingly pervasive in an array of contexts including natural
language processing, information retrieval, search and recommendation, and
credibility assessment of online content. A significant disruption at the
intersection of ML and text are text-generating large-language models such as
generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). We empirically assess the
differences in how ML-based scoring models trained on human content assess the
quality of content generated by humans versus GPTs. To do so, we propose an
analysis framework that encompasses essay scoring ML-models, human and
ML-generated essays, and a statistical model that parsimoniously considers the
impact of type of respondent, prompt genre, and the ML model used for
assessment model. A rich testbed is utilized that encompasses 18,460
human-generated and GPT-based essays. Results of our benchmark analysis reveal
that transformer pretrained language models (PLMs) more accurately score human
essay quality as compared to CNN/RNN and feature-based ML methods.
Interestingly, we find that the transformer PLMs tend to score GPT-generated
text 10-15\% higher on average, relative to human-authored documents.
Conversely, traditional deep learning and feature-based ML models score human
text considerably higher. Further analysis reveals that although the
transformer PLMs are exclusively fine-tuned on human text, they more
prominently attend to certain tokens appearing only in GPT-generated text,
possibly due to familiarity/overlap in pre-training. Our framework and results
have implications for text classification settings where automated scoring of
text is likely to be disrupted by generative AI.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual Reality (VR) broadcasting has seen widespread adoption in major
sports events, attributed to its ability to generate a sense of presence,
curiosity, and excitement among viewers. However, we have noticed that still
shots reveal a limitation in the movement of VR cameras and hinder the VR
viewing experience in current VR sports broadcasts. This paper aims to bridge
this gap by engaging in a quantitative user analysis to explore the design and
impact of dynamic VR shots on viewing experiences. We conducted two user
studies in a digital hockey game twin environment and asked participants to
evaluate their viewing experience through two questionnaires. Our findings
suggested that the viewing experiences demonstrated no notable disparity
between still and moving shots for single clips. However, when considering
entire events, moving shots improved the viewer's immersive experience, with no
notable increase in sickness compared to still shots. We further discuss the
benefits of integrating moving shots into VR sports broadcasts and present a
set of design considerations and potential improvements for future VR sports
broadcasting.

<p class="mathjax">Closed-set 3D perception models trained on only a pre-defined set of object
categories can be inadequate for safety critical applications such as
autonomous driving where new object types can be encountered after deployment.
In this paper, we present a multi-modal auto labeling pipeline capable of
generating amodal 3D bounding boxes and tracklets for training models on
open-set categories without 3D human labels. Our pipeline exploits motion cues
inherent in point cloud sequences in combination with the freely available 2D
image-text pairs to identify and track all traffic participants. Compared to
the recent studies in this domain, which can only provide class-agnostic auto
labels limited to moving objects, our method can handle both static and moving
objects in the unsupervised manner and is able to output open-vocabulary
semantic labels thanks to the proposed vision-language knowledge distillation.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our approach outperforms the
prior work by significant margins on various unsupervised 3D perception tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-video is a rapidly growing research area that aims to generate a
semantic, identical, and temporal coherence sequence of frames that accurately
align with the input text prompt. This study focuses on zero-shot text-to-video
generation considering the data- and cost-efficient. To generate a
semantic-coherent video, exhibiting a rich portrayal of temporal semantics such
as the whole process of flower blooming rather than a set of "moving images",
we propose a novel Free-Bloom pipeline that harnesses large language models
(LLMs) as the director to generate a semantic-coherence prompt sequence, while
pre-trained latent diffusion models (LDMs) as the animator to generate the high
fidelity frames. Furthermore, to ensure temporal and identical coherence while
maintaining semantic coherence, we propose a series of annotative modifications
to adapting LDMs in the reverse process, including joint noise sampling,
step-aware attention shift, and dual-path interpolation. Without any video data
and training requirements, Free-Bloom generates vivid and high-quality videos,
awe-inspiring in generating complex scenes with semantic meaningful frame
sequences. In addition, Free-Bloom is naturally compatible with LDMs-based
extensions.

<p class="mathjax">Angular Minkowski $p$-distance is a dissimilarity measure that is obtained by
replacing Euclidean distance in the definition of cosine dissimilarity with
other Minkowski $p$-distances. Cosine dissimilarity is frequently used with
datasets containing token frequencies, and angular Minkowski $p$-distance may
potentially be an even better choice for certain tasks. In a case study based
on the 20-newsgroups dataset, we evaluate clasification performance for
classical weighted nearest neighbours, as well as fuzzy rough nearest
neighbours. In addition, we analyse the relationship between the hyperparameter
$p$, the dimensionality $m$ of the dataset, the number of neighbours $k$, the
choice of weights and the choice of classifier. We conclude that it is possible
to obtain substantially higher classification performance with angular
Minkowski $p$-distance with suitable values for $p$ than with classical cosine
dissimilarity.

<p class="mathjax">Real life machine learning problems exhibit distributional shifts in the data
from one time to another or from on place to another. This behavior is beyond
the scope of the traditional empirical risk minimization paradigm, which
assumes i.i.d. distribution of data over time and across locations. The
emerging field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization addresses this
reality with new theory and algorithms which incorporate environmental, or
era-wise information into the algorithms. So far, most research has been
focused on linear models and/or neural networks. In this research we develop
two new splitting criteria for decision trees, which allow us to apply ideas
from OOD generalization research to decision tree models, including random
forest and gradient-boosting decision trees. The new splitting criteria use
era-wise information associated with each data point to allow tree-based models
to find split points that are optimal across all disjoint eras in the data,
instead of optimal over the entire data set pooled together, which is the
default setting. We describe the new splitting criteria in detail and develop
unique experiments to showcase the benefits of these new criteria, which
improve metrics in our experiments out-of-sample. The new criteria are
incorporated into the a state-of-the-art gradient boosted decision tree model
in the Scikit-Learn code base, which is made freely available.

for an autonomous vehicle to successfully accomplish its driving tasks in
complex traffic scenarios such as highway forced merging. In this paper, we
consider a behavioral model that incorporates both social behaviors and
personal objectives of the interacting drivers. Leveraging this model, we
develop a receding-horizon control-based decision-making strategy, that
estimates online the other drivers' intentions using Bayesian filtering and
incorporates predictions of nearby vehicles' behaviors under uncertain
intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed decision-making strategy is
demonstrated and evaluated based on simulation studies in comparison with a

<p class="mathjax">When giving directions to a lost-looking tourist, would you first reference
the street-names, cardinal directions, landmarks, or simply tell them to walk
five hundred metres in one direction then turn left? Depending on the
circumstances, one could reasonably make use of any of these direction giving
styles. However, research on direction giving with a robot does not often look
at how these different direction styles impact perceptions of the robots
intelligence, nor does it take into account how users prior dispositions may
impact ratings. In this work, we look at generating natural language for two
navigation styles using a created system for a Furhat robot, before measuring
perceived intelligence and animacy alongside users prior dispositions to robots
in a small preliminary study (N=7). Our results confirm findings by previous
work that prior negative attitudes towards robots correlates negatively with
propensity to trust robots, and also suggests avenues for future research. For
example, more data is needed to explore the link between perceived intelligence
and direction style. We end by discussing our plan to run a larger scale
experiment, and how to improve our existing study design.

<p class="mathjax">Vision foundation models are a new frontier in GeoAI research because of
their potential to enable powerful image analysis by learning and extracting
important image features from vast amounts of geospatial data. This paper
evaluates the performance of the first-of-its-kind geospatial foundation model,
IBM-NASA's Prithvi, to support a crucial geospatial analysis task: flood
inundation mapping. This model is compared with popular convolutional neural
network and vision transformer-based architectures in terms of mapping accuracy
for flooded areas. A benchmark dataset, Sen1Floods11, is used in the
experiments, and the models' predictability, generalizability, and
transferability are evaluated based on both a test dataset and a dataset that
is completely unseen by the model. Results show the impressive transferability
of the Prithvi model, highlighting its performance advantages in segmenting
flooded areas in previously unseen regions. The findings also suggest areas for
improvement for the Prithvi model in terms of adopting multi-scale
representation learning, developing more end-to-end pipelines for high-level
image analysis tasks, and offering more flexibility in terms of input data
bands.

<p class="mathjax">Standard deep learning models for classification and regression applications
are ideal for capturing complex system dynamics. However, their predictions can
be arbitrarily inaccurate when the input samples are not similar to the
training data. Implementation of distance aware uncertainty estimation can be
used to detect these scenarios and provide a level of confidence associated
with their predictions. In this paper, we present results from using Deep
Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) methods for errant beam prediction at
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator (classification) and we provide an
uncertainty aware surrogate model for the Fermi National Accelerator Lab (FNAL)

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have brought breakthroughs in tasks including
translation, summarization, information retrieval, and language generation,
gaining growing interest in the CHI community. Meanwhile, the literature shows
researchers' controversial perceptions about the efficacy, ethics, and
intellectual abilities of LLMs. However, we do not know how lay people perceive
LLMs that are pervasive in everyday tools, specifically regarding their
experience with LLMs around bias, stereotypes, social norms, or safety. In this
study, we conducted a systematic review to understand what empirical insights
papers have gathered about people's perceptions toward LLMs. From a total of
231 retrieved papers, we full-text reviewed 15 papers that recruited human
evaluators to assess their experiences with LLMs. We report different biases
and related concepts investigated by these studies, four broader LLM
application areas, the evaluators' perceptions toward LLMs' performances
including advantages, biases, and conflicting perceptions, factors influencing
these perceptions, and concerns about LLM applications.

<p class="mathjax">Training and preparing first responders and humanitarian robots for Mass
Casualty Incidents (MCIs) often poses a challenge owing to the lack of
realistic and easily accessible test facilities. While such facilities can
offer realistic scenarios post an MCI that can serve training and educational
purposes for first responders and humanitarian robots, they are often hard to
access owing to logistical constraints. To overcome this challenge, we present
HEROES- a versatile Unreal Engine simulator for designing novel training
simulations for humans and emergency robots for such urban search and rescue
operations. The proposed HEROES simulator is capable of generating synthetic
datasets for machine learning pipelines that are used for training robot
navigation. This work addresses the necessity for a comprehensive training
platform in the robotics community, ensuring pragmatic and efficient
preparation for real-world emergency scenarios. The strengths of our simulator
lie in its adaptability, scalability, and ability to facilitate collaboration
between robot developers and first responders, fostering synergy in developing
effective strategies for search and rescue operations in MCIs. We conducted a
preliminary user study with an 81% positive response supporting the ability of
HEROES to generate sufficiently varied environments, and a 78% positive
response affirming the usefulness of the simulation environment of HEROES.

<p class="mathjax">Computation in a typical Transformer-based large language model (LLM) can be
characterized by batch size, hidden dimension, number of layers, and sequence
length. Until now, system works for accelerating LLM training have focused on
the first three dimensions: data parallelism for batch size, tensor parallelism
for hidden size and pipeline parallelism for model depth or layers. These
widely studied forms of parallelism are not targeted or optimized for long
sequence Transformer models. Given practical application needs for long
sequence LLM, renewed attentions are being drawn to sequence parallelism.
However, existing works in sequence parallelism are constrained by
memory-communication inefficiency, limiting their scalability to long sequence
large models. In this work, we introduce DeepSpeed-Ulysses, a novel, portable
and effective methodology for enabling highly efficient and scalable LLM
training with extremely long sequence length. DeepSpeed-Ulysses at its core
partitions input data along the sequence dimension and employs an efficient
all-to-all collective communication for attention computation. Theoretical
communication analysis shows that whereas other methods incur communication
overhead as sequence length increases, DeepSpeed-Ulysses maintains constant
communication volume when sequence length and compute devices are increased
proportionally. Furthermore, experimental evaluations show that
DeepSpeed-Ulysses trains 2.5X faster with 4X longer sequence length than the
existing method SOTA baseline.

<p class="mathjax">The "privacy paradox" describes the discrepancy between users' privacy
attitudes and their actual behaviors. Mitigating this discrepancy requires
solutions that account for both system opaqueness and users' hesitations in
testing different privacy settings due to fears of unintended data exposure. We
introduce an empathy-based approach that allows users to experience how privacy
behaviors may alter system outcomes in a risk-free sandbox environment from the
perspective of artificially generated personas. To generate realistic personas,
we introduce a novel pipeline that augments the outputs of large language
models using few-shot learning, contextualization, and chain of thoughts. Our
empirical studies demonstrated the adequate quality of generated personas and
highlighted the changes in privacy-related applications (e.g., online
advertising) caused by different personas. Furthermore, users demonstrated
cognitive and emotional empathy towards the personas when interacting with our
sandbox. We offered design implications for downstream applications in
improving user privacy literacy and promoting behavior changes.

whose solution has reduced regularity properties. We analyze the existence of
optimal solutions and derive first and, necessary and sufficient, second order

Navier--Stokes equations. We develop two discretization strategies: a
semidiscrete strategy in which the control variable is not discretized, and a
fully discrete scheme in which the control variable is discretized with
piecewise constant functions. For each solution technique, we analyze
convergence properties of discretizations and derive a priori error estimates.

(span of the top r singular vectors) of a symmetric matrix in a federated
setting, when each node has access to estimates of this matrix. We study how to
make this problem Byzantine resilient. We introduce a novel provably
Byzantine-resilient, communication-efficient, and private algorithm, called
Subspace-Median, to solve it. We also study the most natural solution for this
problem, a geometric median based modification of the federated power method,
and explain why it is not useful. We consider two special cases of the
resilient subspace estimation meta-problem - federated principal components
analysis (PCA) and the spectral initialization step of horizontally federated
low rank column-wise sensing (LRCCS) in this work. For both these problems we
show how Subspace Median provides a resilient solution that is also
communication-efficient. Median of Means extensions are developed for both
problems. Extensive simulation experiments are used to corroborate our
theoretical guarantees. Our second contribution is a complete AltGDmin based
algorithm for Byzantine-resilient horizontally federated LRCCS and guarantees
for it. We do this by developing a geometric median of means estimator for
aggregating the partial gradients computed at each node, and using Subspace
Median for initialization.

<p class="mathjax">Visual-Inertial (VI) sensors are popular in robotics, self-driving vehicles,
and augmented and virtual reality applications. In order to use them for any
computer vision or state-estimation task, a good calibration is essential.
However, collecting informative calibration data in order to render the
calibration parameters observable is not trivial for a non-expert. In this
work, we introduce a novel VI calibration pipeline that guides a non-expert
with the use of a graphical user interface and information theory in collecting
informative calibration data with Next-Best-View and Next-Best-Trajectory
suggestions to calibrate the intrinsics, extrinsics, and temporal misalignment
of a VI sensor. We show through experiments that our method is faster, more
accurate, and more consistent than state-of-the-art alternatives. Specifically,
we show how calibrations with our proposed method achieve higher accuracy
estimation results when used by state-of-the-art VI Odometry as well as VI-SLAM
approaches. The source code of our software can be found on:

<p class="mathjax">Multi-sensor object detection is an active research topic in automated
driving, but the robustness of such detection models against missing sensor
input (modality missing), e.g., due to a sudden sensor failure, is a critical
problem which remains under-studied. In this work, we propose UniBEV, an
end-to-end multi-modal 3D object detection framework designed for robustness
against missing modalities: UniBEV can operate on LiDAR plus camera input, but
also on LiDAR-only or camera-only input without retraining. To facilitate its
detector head to handle different input combinations, UniBEV aims to create
well-aligned Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps from each available modality.
Unlike prior BEV-based multi-modal detection methods, all sensor modalities
follow a uniform approach to resample features from the native sensor
coordinate systems to the BEV features. We furthermore investigate the
robustness of various fusion strategies w.r.t. missing modalities: the commonly
used feature concatenation, but also channel-wise averaging, and a
generalization to weighted averaging termed Channel Normalized Weights. To
validate its effectiveness, we compare UniBEV to state-of-the-art BEVFusion and
MetaBEV on nuScenes over all sensor input combinations. In this setting, UniBEV
achieves $52.5 \%$ mAP on average over all input combinations, significantly
improving over the baselines ($43.5 \%$ mAP on average for BEVFusion, $48.7 \%$
mAP on average for MetaBEV). An ablation study shows the robustness benefits of
fusing by weighted averaging over regular concatenation, and of sharing queries
between the BEV encoders of each modality. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have exploded in popularity due to their ability
to perform a wide array of natural language tasks. Text-based content
moderation is one LLM use case that has received recent enthusiasm, however,
there is little research investigating how LLMs perform in content moderation
settings. In this work, we evaluate a suite of modern, commercial LLMs (GPT-3,
GPT-3.5, GPT-4) on two common content moderation tasks: rule-based community
moderation and toxic content detection. For rule-based community moderation, we
construct 95 LLM moderation-engines prompted with rules from 95 Reddit
subcommunities and find that LLMs can be effective at rule-based moderation for
many communities, achieving a median accuracy of 64% and a median precision of
83%. For toxicity detection, we find that LLMs significantly outperform
existing commercially available toxicity classifiers. However, we also find
that recent increases in model size add only marginal benefit to toxicity
detection, suggesting a potential performance plateau for LLMs on toxicity
detection tasks. We conclude by outlining avenues for future work in studying
LLMs and content moderation.

<p class="mathjax">Time series classification is essential in many fields, such as medicine,
finance, environmental science, and manufacturing, enabling tasks like disease
diagnosis, anomaly detection, and stock price prediction. Machine learning
models like Recurrent Neural Networks and InceptionTime, while successful in
numerous applications, can face scalability limitations due to intensive
training requirements. To address this, random convolutional kernel models such
as Rocket and its derivatives have emerged, simplifying training and achieving
state-of-the-art performance by utilizing a large number of randomly generated
features from time series data. However, due to their random nature, most of
the generated features are redundant or non-informative, adding unnecessary
computational load and compromising generalization. Here, we introduce
Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) as a method to identify and prune these
non-essential features. SFD uses model coefficients to estimate feature
importance and, unlike previous algorithms, can handle large feature sets
without the need for complex hyperparameter tuning. Testing on the UCR archive
demonstrates that SFD can produce models with $10\%$ of the original features
while improving $0.2\%$ the accuracy on the test set. We also present an
end-to-end procedure for determining an optimal balance between the number of
features and model accuracy, called Detach-ROCKET. When applied to the largest
binary UCR dataset, Detach-ROCKET is capable of reduce model size by $98.9\%$
and increases test accuracy by $0.6\%$.

<p class="mathjax">This study explores the problem solving capabilities of ChatGPT and its
prospective applications in standardized test preparation, focusing on the GRE
quantitative exam. Prior research has shown great potential for the utilization
of ChatGPT for academic purposes in revolutionizing the approach to studying
across various disciplines. We investigate how ChatGPT performs across various
question types in the GRE quantitative domain, and how modifying question
prompts impacts its accuracy. More specifically this study addressed two
research questions: 1. How does ChatGPT perform in answering GRE-based
quantitative questions across various content areas? 2. How does the accuracy
of ChatGPT vary with modifying the question prompts? The dataset consisting of
100 randomly selected GRE quantitative questions was collected from the ETS
official guide to GRE test preparation. We used quantitative evaluation to
answer our first research question, and t-test to examine the statistical
association between prompt modification and ChatGPT's accuracy. Results show a
statistical improvement in the ChatGPT's accuracy after applying instruction
priming and contextual prompts to the original questions. ChatGPT showed 84%
accuracy with the modified prompts compared to 69% with the original data. The
study discusses the areas where ChatGPT struggled with certain questions and
how modifications can be helpful for preparing for standardized tests like GRE
and provides future directions for prompt modifications.

<p class="mathjax">Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the
misalignment between two modalities can result in "hallucination", generating
textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context.
To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of
vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two
responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model
is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment
algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with
additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth
multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF
and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated
training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available
human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our
model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a
new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing
hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves
remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance
level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the
87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We
opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">This paper examines the properties of the lower and upper bounds established
by Maurer, Ahlswede and Csiszar (MAC) for secret-key capacity in the case of
channel probing over single-input and single-output (SISO) channels. Inspired
by the insights into MAC's bounds, a scheme called secret-message transmission
by echoing encrypted probes (STEEP) is proposed. STEEP consists of two phases:
in phase 1, Alice sends random probes over a probing channel to Bob; in phase
2, Bob echoes back an estimated version of the probes, but encrypted by a
secret, over a high-quality return channel. Provided that Eve is unable to
obtain the exact probes transmitted by Alice in phase 1, STEEP guarantees a
positive secrecy rate from Bob to Alice over the return channel even if Eve's
channel strength during channel probing is stronger than Bob's. STEEP is
applicable to both physical layer and upper layers in connected networks.

<p class="mathjax">Prototypical part neural networks (ProtoPartNNs), namely PROTOPNET and its
derivatives, are an intrinsically interpretable approach to machine learning.
Their prototype learning scheme enables intuitive explanations of the form,
this (prototype) looks like that (testing image patch). But, does this actually
look like that? In this work, we delve into why object part localization and
associated heat maps in past work are misleading. Rather than localizing to
object parts, existing ProtoPartNNs localize to the entire image, contrary to
generated explanatory visualizations. We argue that detraction from these
underlying issues is due to the alluring nature of visualizations and an
over-reliance on intuition. To alleviate these issues, we devise new receptive
field-based architectural constraints for meaningful localization and a
principled pixel space mapping for ProtoPartNNs. To improve interpretability,
we propose additional architectural improvements, including a simplified
classification head. We also make additional corrections to PROTOPNET and its
derivatives, such as the use of a validation set, rather than a test set, to
evaluate generalization during training. Our approach, PIXPNET (Pixel-grounded
Prototypical part Network), is the only ProtoPartNN that truly learns and
localizes to prototypical object parts. We demonstrate that PIXPNET achieves
quantifiably improved interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">This work investigates large language models (LLMs) as teachable agents for
learning by teaching (LBT). LBT with teachable agents helps learners identify
their knowledge gaps and discover new knowledge. However, teachable agents
require expensive programming of subject-specific knowledge. While LLMs as
teachable agents can reduce the cost, LLMs' over-competence as tutees
discourages learners from teaching. We propose a prompting pipeline that
restrains LLMs' competence and makes them initiate "why" and "how" questions
for effective knowledge-building. We combined these techniques into TeachYou,
an LBT environment for algorithm learning, and AlgoBo, an LLM-based tutee
chatbot that can simulate misconceptions and unawareness prescribed in its
knowledge state. Our technical evaluation confirmed that our prompting pipeline
can effectively configure AlgoBo's problem-solving performance. Through a
between-subject study with 40 algorithm novices, we also observed that AlgoBo's
questions led to knowledge-dense conversations (effect size=0.73). Lastly, we
discuss design implications, cost-efficiency, and personalization of LLM-based
teachable agents.

<p class="mathjax">Surgical videos captured from microscopic or endoscopic imaging devices are
rich but complex sources of information, depicting different tools and
anatomical structures utilized during an extended amount of time. Despite
containing crucial workflow information and being commonly recorded in many
procedures, usage of surgical videos for automated surgical workflow
understanding is still limited.
<br />In this work, we exploit scene graphs as a more holistic, semantically
meaningful and human-readable way to represent surgical videos while encoding
all anatomical structures, tools, and their interactions. To properly evaluate
the impact of our solutions, we create a scene graph dataset from semantic
segmentations from the CaDIS and CATARACTS datasets. We demonstrate that scene
graphs can be leveraged through the use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs)
to tackle surgical downstream tasks such as surgical workflow recognition with
competitive performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of surgical
scene graphs regarding the explainability and robustness of model decisions,
which are crucial in the clinical setting.

<p class="mathjax">This research aims to evaluate the performance of the rotors and study the
behavior of the human driver in interacting with the rotors. In recent years,
rotors have been increasingly used between countries due to their safety,
capacity, and environmental advantages, and because they provide safe and fluid
flows of vehicles for transit and integration. It turns out that roundabouts
can significantly reduce speed at twisting intersections, entry speed and the
resulting effect on speed depends on the rating of road users. In our research,
(bus, car, truck) drivers were given special attention and their behavior was
categorized into (conservative, normal, aggressive). Anticipating and
recognizing driver behavior is an important challenge. Therefore, the aim of
this research is to study the effect of roundabouts on these classifiers and to
develop a method for predicting the behavior of road users at roundabout
intersections. Safety is primarily due to two inherent features of the rotor.
First, by comparing the data collected and processed in order to classify and
evaluate drivers' behavior, and comparing the speeds of the drivers (bus, car
and truck), the speed of motorists at crossing the roundabout was more fit than
that of buses and trucks. We looked because the car is smaller and all parts of
the rotor are visible to it. So drivers coming from all directions have to slow
down, giving them more time to react and mitigating the consequences in the
event of an accident. Second, with fewer conflicting flows (and points of
conflict), drivers only need to look to their left (in right-hand traffic) for
other vehicles, making their job of crossing the roundabout easier as there is
less need to split attention between different directions.

<p class="mathjax">Modern sampling-based motion planning algorithms typically take between
hundreds of milliseconds to dozens of seconds to find collision-free motions
for high degree-of-freedom problems. This paper presents performance
improvements of more than 500x over the state-of-the-art, bringing planning
times into the range of microseconds and solution rates into the range of
kilohertz, without specialized hardware. Our key insight is how to exploit
fine-grained parallelism within sampling-based planners, providing
generality-preserving algorithmic improvements to any such planner and
significantly accelerating critical subroutines, such as forward kinematics and
collision checking. We demonstrate our approach over a diverse set of
challenging, realistic problems for complex robots ranging from 7 to 14
degrees-of-freedom. Moreover, we show that our approach does not require
high-power hardware by also evaluating on a low-power single-board computer.
The planning speeds demonstrated are fast enough to reside in the range of
control frequencies and open up new avenues of motion planning research.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel approach to fall prediction for bipedal robots,
specifically targeting the detection of potential falls while standing caused
by abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults. Leveraging a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN), our method aims to maximize lead time for fall prediction
while minimizing false positive rates. The proposed algorithm uniquely
integrates the detection of various fault types and estimates the lead time for
potential falls. Our contributions include the development of an algorithm
capable of detecting abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults in full-sized
robots, its implementation using both simulation and hardware data for a
humanoid robot, and a method for estimating lead time. Evaluation metrics,
including false positive rate, lead time, and response time, demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach. Particularly, our model achieves impressive lead
times and response times across different fault scenarios with a false positive
rate of 0. The findings of this study hold significant implications for
enhancing the safety and reliability of bipedal robotic systems.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of distributed resource allocation for multicast
communication in device-to-device (D2D) enabled underlay cellular networks. The
optimal resource allocation is crucial for maximizing the performance of such
networks, which are limited by the severe co-channel interference between
cellular users (CU) and D2D multicast groups. However, finding such optimal
allocation for networks with large number of CUs and D2D users is challenging.
Therefore, we propose a pragmatic scheme that allocates resources
distributively, reducing signaling overhead and improving network scalability.
Numerical simulations establish the efficacy of the proposed solution in

<p class="mathjax">Recent academic research has extensively examined algorithmic collusion
resulting from the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based dynamic
pricing algorithms. Nevertheless, e-commerce platforms employ recommendation
algorithms to allocate exposure to various products, and this important aspect
has been largely overlooked in previous studies on algorithmic collusion. Our
study bridges this important gap in the literature and examines how
recommendation algorithms can determine the competitive or collusive dynamics
of AI-based pricing algorithms. Specifically, two commonly deployed
recommendation algorithms are examined: (i) a recommender system that aims to
maximize the sellers' total profit (profit-based recommender system) and (ii) a
recommender system that aims to maximize the demand for products sold on the
platform (demand-based recommender system). We construct a repeated game
framework that incorporates both pricing algorithms adopted by sellers and the
platform's recommender system. Subsequently, we conduct experiments to observe
price dynamics and ascertain the final equilibrium. Experimental results reveal
that a profit-based recommender system intensifies algorithmic collusion among
sellers due to its congruence with sellers' profit-maximizing objectives.
Conversely, a demand-based recommender system fosters price competition among
sellers and results in a lower price, owing to its misalignment with sellers'
goals. Extended analyses suggest the robustness of our findings in various
market scenarios. Overall, we highlight the importance of platforms'
recommender systems in delineating the competitive structure of the digital
marketplace, providing important insights for market participants and
corresponding policymakers.

<p class="mathjax">A principal vulnerability of a proof-of-work ("PoW") blockchain is that an
attacker can re-write the history of transactions by forking a previously
published block and build a new chain segment containing a different sequence
of transactions. If the attacker's chain has the most cumulative mining puzzle
difficulty, nodes will recognize it as canonical. We propose a modification to
PoW protocols, called ADESS, that contains two novel features. The first
modification enables a node to identify the attacker chain by comparing the
temporal sequence of blocks on competing chains. The second modification
penalizes the attacker by requiring it to apply exponentially increasing
hashrate in order to make its chain canonical. We demonstrate two things; (i)
the expected cost of carrying out a double-spend attack is weakly higher under
ADESS compared to the current PoW protocols and (ii) for any value of
transaction, there is a penalty setting in ADESS that renders the expected
profit of a double-spend attack negative.

<p class="mathjax">Precise perception of contact interactions is essential for the fine-grained
manipulation skills for robots. In this paper, we present the design of
feedback skills for robots that must learn to stack complex-shaped objects on
top of each other. To design such a system, a robot should be able to reason
about the stability of placement from very gentle contact interactions. Our
results demonstrate that it is possible to infer the stability of object
placement based on tactile readings during contact formation between the object
and its environment. In particular, we estimate the contact patch between a
grasped object and its environment using force and tactile observations to
estimate the stability of the object during a contact formation. The contact
patch could be used to estimate the stability of the object upon the release of
the grasp. The proposed method is demonstrated on various pairs of objects that
are used in a very popular board game.

<p class="mathjax">Despite having the same basic prophet inequality setup and model of loss
aversion, conclusions in our multi-dimensional model differs considerably from
the one-dimensional model of Kleinberg et al. For example, Kleinberg et al.
gives a tight closed-form on the competitive ratio that an online
decision-maker can achieve as a function of $\lambda$, for any $\lambda \geq
0$. In our multi-dimensional model, there is a sharp phase transition: if $k$
denotes the number of dimensions, then when $\lambda \cdot (k-1) \geq 1$, no
non-trivial competitive ratio is possible. On the other hand, when $\lambda
\cdot (k-1) &lt; 1$, we give a tight bound on the achievable competitive ratio
(similar to Kleinberg et al.). As another example, Kleinberg et al. uncovers an
exponential improvement in their competitive ratio for the random-order vs.
worst-case prophet inequality problem. In our model with $k\geq 2$ dimensions,
the gap is at most a constant-factor. We uncover several additional key
differences in the multi- and single-dimensional models.

high-quality writing capabilities from blogs to stories. However, evaluating
objectively the creativity of a piece of writing is challenging. Inspired by
the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), which measures creativity as a
process, we use the Consensual Assessment Technique [3] and propose the
Torrance Test of Creative Writing (TTCW) to evaluate creativity as a product.
TTCW consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of
Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative
writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by
professional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated
stories pass 3-10X less TTCW tests than stories written by professionals. In
addition, we explore the use of LLMs as assessors to automate the TTCW
evaluation, revealing that none of the LLMs positively correlate with the
expert assessments.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Recent disruptive events, such as COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine
conflict, had a significant impact of global supply chains. Digital supply
chain twins have been proposed in order to provide decision makers with an
effective and efficient tool to mitigate disruption impact. Methods: This paper
introduces a hybrid deep learning approach for disruption detection within a
cognitive digital supply chain twin framework to enhance supply chain
resilience. The proposed disruption detection module utilises a deep
autoencoder neural network combined with a one-class support vector machine
algorithm. In addition, long-short term memory neural network models are
developed to identify the disrupted echelon and predict time-to-recovery from
the disruption effect. Results: The obtained information from the proposed
approach will help decision-makers and supply chain practitioners make
appropriate decisions aiming at minimizing negative impact of disruptive events
based on real-time disruption detection data. The results demonstrate the
trade-off between disruption detection model sensitivity, encountered delay in
disruption detection, and false alarms. This approach has seldom been used in
recent literature addressing this issue.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider the optimization problem Submodular Cover (SCP),
which is to find a minimum cardinality subset of a finite universe $U$ such
that the value of a submodular function $f$ is above an input threshold $\tau$.
In particular, we consider several variants of SCP including the general case,
the case where $f$ is additionally assumed to be monotone, and finally the case
where $f$ is a regularized monotone submodular function. Our most significant
contributions are that: (i) We propose a scalable algorithm for monotone SCP
that achieves nearly the same approximation guarantees as the standard greedy
algorithm in significantly faster time; (ii) We are the first to develop an
algorithm for general SCP that achieves a solution arbitrarily close to being
feasible; and finally (iii) we are the first to develop algorithms for
regularized SCP. Our algorithms are then demonstrated to be effective in an
extensive experimental section on data summarization and graph cut, two
applications of SCP.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a fully-automatic, text-guided generative method for
producing periodic, repeating, tile-able 2D art, such as the one seen on
floors, mosaics, ceramics, and the work of M.C. Escher. In contrast to the
standard concept of a seamless texture, i.e., square images that are seamless
when tiled, our method generates non-square tilings which comprise solely of
repeating copies of the same object. It achieves this by optimizing both
geometry and color of a 2D mesh, in order to generate a non-square tile in the
shape and appearance of the desired object, with close to no additional
background details. We enable geometric optimization of tilings by our key
technical contribution: an unconstrained, differentiable parameterization of
the space of all possible tileable shapes for a given symmetry group. Namely,
we prove that modifying the laplacian used in a 2D mesh-mapping technique -
Orbifold Tutte Embedding - can achieve all possible tiling configurations for a
chosen planar symmetry group. We thus consider both the mesh's tile-shape and
its texture as optimizable parameters, rendering the textured mesh via a
differentiable renderer. We leverage a trained image diffusion model to define
a loss on the resulting image, thereby updating the mesh's parameters based on
its appearance matching the text prompt. We show our method is able to produce
plausible, appealing results, with non-trivial tiles, for a variety of
different periodic tiling patterns.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the advancements in on-road trajectory planning for
Autonomous Passenger Vehicles (APV). Trajectory planning aims to produce a
globally optimal route for APVs, considering various factors such as vehicle
dynamics, constraints, and detected obstacles. Traditional techniques involve a
combination of sampling methods followed by optimization algorithms, where the
former ensures global awareness and the latter refines for local optima.
Notably, the Constrained Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (CILQR)
optimization algorithm has recently emerged, adapted for APV systems,
emphasizing improved safety and comfort. However, existing implementations
utilizing the vehicle bicycle kinematic model may not guarantee controllable
trajectories. We augment this model by incorporating higher-order terms,
including the first and second-order derivatives of curvature and longitudinal
jerk. This inclusion facilitates a richer representation in our cost and
constraint design. We also address roadway compliance, emphasizing adherence to
lane boundaries and directions, which past work often overlooked. Lastly, we
adopt a relaxed logarithmic barrier function to address the CILQR's dependency
on feasible initial trajectories. The proposed methodology is then validated
through simulation and real-world experiment driving scenes in real time.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers contrastive training for cross-modal 0-shot transfer
wherein a pre-trained model in one modality is used for representation learning
in another domain using pairwise data. The learnt models in the latter domain
can then be used for a diverse set of tasks in a zero-shot way, similar to
``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)'' and ``Locked-image Tuning
(LiT)'' that have recently gained considerable attention. Most existing works
for cross-modal representation alignment (including CLIP and LiT) use the
standard contrastive training objective, which employs sets of positive and
negative examples to align similar and repel dissimilar training data samples.
However, similarity amongst training examples has a more continuous nature,
thus calling for a more `non-binary' treatment. To address this, we propose a
novel loss function called Continuously Weighted Contrastive Loss (CWCL) that
employs a continuous measure of similarity. With CWCL, we seek to align the
embedding space of one modality with another. Owing to the continuous nature of
similarity in the proposed loss function, these models outperform existing
methods for 0-shot transfer across multiple models, datasets and modalities.
Particularly, we consider the modality pairs of image-text and speech-text and
our models achieve 5-8% (absolute) improvement over previous state-of-the-art
methods in 0-shot image classification and 20-30% (absolute) improvement in
0-shot speech-to-intent classification and keyword classification.

(AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods.
Eventually, DifAttack iteratively optimizes the adversarial feature according
to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated,
while keeping the visual feature unaltered. In addition, due to the avoidance
of using surrogate models' gradient information when optimizing AEs for
black-box models, our proposed DifAttack inherently possesses better attack
capability in the open-set scenario, where the training dataset of the victim
model is unknown. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in ASR and query efficiency simultaneously,
especially in the targeted attack and open-set scenarios. The code will be
available at https://github.com/csjunjun/DifAttack.git soon.

<p class="mathjax">The tongue's intricate 3D structure, comprising localized functional units,
plays a crucial role in the production of speech. When measured using tagged
MRI, these functional units exhibit cohesive displacements and derived
quantities that facilitate the complex process of speech production.
Non-negative matrix factorization-based approaches have been shown to estimate
the functional units through motion features, yielding a set of building blocks
and a corresponding weighting map. Investigating the link between weighting
maps and speech acoustics can offer significant insights into the intricate
process of speech production. To this end, in this work, we utilize
two-dimensional spectrograms as a proxy representation, and develop an
end-to-end deep learning framework for translating weighting maps to their
corresponding audio waveforms. Our proposed plastic light transformer (PLT)
framework is based on directional product relative position bias and
single-level spatial pyramid pooling, thus enabling flexible processing of
weighting maps with variable size to fixed-size spectrograms, without input
information loss or dimension expansion. Additionally, our PLT framework
efficiently models the global correlation of wide matrix input. To improve the
realism of our generated spectrograms with relatively limited training samples,
we apply pair-wise utterance consistency with Maximum Mean Discrepancy
constraint and adversarial training. Experimental results on a dataset of 29
subjects speaking two utterances demonstrated that our framework is able to
synthesize speech audio waveforms from weighting maps, outperforming
conventional convolution and transformer models.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research efforts on semantic communication have mostly considered
accuracy as a main problem for optimizing goal-oriented communication systems.
However, these approaches introduce a paradox: the accuracy of artificial
intelligence (AI) tasks should naturally emerge through training rather than
being dictated by network constraints. Acknowledging this dilemma, this work
introduces an innovative approach that leverages the rate-distortion theory to
analyze distortions induced by communication and semantic compression, thereby
analyzing the learning process. Specifically, we examine the distribution shift
between the original data and the distorted data, thus assessing its impact on
the AI model's performance. Founding upon this analysis, we can preemptively
estimate the empirical accuracy of AI tasks, making the goal-oriented semantic
communication problem feasible. To achieve this objective, we present the
theoretical foundation of our approach, accompanied by simulations and
experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results
indicate that our proposed method enables accurate AI task performance while
adhering to network constraints, establishing it as a valuable contribution to
the field of signal processing. Furthermore, this work advances research in
goal-oriented semantic communication and highlights the significance of
data-driven approaches in optimizing the performance of intelligent systems.

<p class="mathjax">Place recognition is crucial for robotic localization and loop closure in
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Recently, LiDARs have gained
popularity due to their robust sensing capability and measurement consistency,
even in the illumination-variant environment, offering an advantage over
traditional imaging sensors. Spinning LiDARs are widely accepted among many
types, while non-repetitive scanning patterns have recently been utilized in
robotic applications. Beyond the range measurements, some LiDARs offer
additional measurements, such as reflectivity, Near Infrared (NIR), and
velocity (e.g., FMCW LiDARs). Despite these advancements, a noticeable dearth
of datasets comprehensively reflects the broad spectrum of LiDAR configurations
optimized for place recognition. To tackle this issue, our paper proposes the
HeLiPR dataset, curated especially for place recognition with heterogeneous
LiDAR systems, embodying spatial-temporal variations. To the best of our
knowledge, the HeLiPR dataset is the first heterogeneous LiDAR dataset designed
to support inter-LiDAR place recognition with both non-repetitive and spinning
LiDARs, accommodating different field of view (FOV) and varying numbers of
rays. Encompassing the distinct LiDAR configurations, it captures varied
environments ranging from urban cityscapes to high-dynamic freeways over a
month, designed to enhance the adaptability and robustness of place recognition
across diverse scenarios. Notably, the HeLiPR dataset also includes
trajectories that parallel sequences from MulRan, underscoring its utility for
research in heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition and long-term studies. The
dataset is accessible at https: //sites.google.com/view/heliprdataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in deep learning methods such as LLMs and Diffusion models
have created a need for improved quantization methods that can meet the
computational demands of these modern architectures while maintaining accuracy.
Towards this goal, we study the advantages of FP8 data formats for
post-training quantization across 75 unique network architectures covering a
wide range of tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, text
generation, image classification, generation, and segmentation. We examine
three different FP8 representations (E5M2, E4M3, and E3M4) to study the effects
of varying degrees of trade-off between dynamic range and precision on model
accuracy. Based on our extensive study, we developed a quantization workflow
that generalizes across different network architectures. Our empirical results
show that FP8 formats outperform INT8 in multiple aspects, including workload
coverage (92.64% vs. 65.87%), model accuracy and suitability for a broader
range of operations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that E4M3 is better
suited for NLP models, whereas E3M4 performs marginally better than E4M3 on
computer vision tasks. The code is publicly available on Intel Neural
Compressor: https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) for bipedal locomotion has recently demonstrated
robust gaits over moderate terrains using only proprioceptive sensing. However,
such blind controllers will fail in environments where robots must anticipate
and adapt to local terrain, which requires visual perception. In this paper, we
propose a fully-learned system that allows bipedal robots to react to local
terrain while maintaining commanded travel speed and direction. Our approach
first trains a controller in simulation using a heightmap expressed in the
robot's local frame. Next, data is collected in simulation to train a heightmap
predictor, whose input is the history of depth images and robot states. We
demonstrate that with appropriate domain randomization, this approach allows
for successful sim-to-real transfer with no explicit pose estimation and no
fine-tuning using real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first example of sim-to-real learning for vision-based bipedal locomotion over
challenging terrains.

<p class="mathjax">Sampling-based planning algorithms like Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)
are versatile in solving path planning problems. RRT* offers asymptotical
optimality but requires growing the tree uniformly over the free space, which
leaves room for efficiency improvement. To accelerate convergence, informed
approaches sample states in an ellipsoidal subset of the search space
determined by current path cost during iteration. Learning-based alternatives
model the topology of the search space and infer the states close to the
optimal path to guide planning. We combine the strengths from both sides and
propose Neural Informed RRT* with Point-based Network Guidance. We introduce
Point-based Network to infer the guidance states, and integrate the network
into Informed RRT* for guidance state refinement. We use Neural Connect to
build connectivity of the guidance state set and further boost performance in
challenging planning problems. Our method surpasses previous works in path
planning benchmarks while preserving probabilistic completeness and
asymptotical optimality. We demonstrate the deployment of our method on mobile
robot navigation in the real world.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning agents for continuous control are known to
exhibit significant instability in their performance over time. In this work,
we provide a fresh perspective on these behaviors by studying the return
landscape: the mapping between a policy and a return. We find that popular
algorithms traverse noisy neighborhoods of this landscape, in which a single
update to the policy parameters leads to a wide range of returns. By taking a
distributional view of these returns, we map the landscape, characterizing
failure-prone regions of policy space and revealing a hidden dimension of
policy quality. We show that the landscape exhibits surprising structure by
finding simple paths in parameter space which improve the stability of a
policy. To conclude, we develop a distribution-aware procedure which finds such
paths, navigating away from noisy neighborhoods in order to improve the
robustness of a policy. Taken together, our results provide new insight into
the optimization, evaluation, and design of agents.

inverse problem of reconstructing the zero-order coefficient in a parabolic
equation using partial boundary data. This technique is called the "reduced
dimensional method". Initially, we use the polynomial-exponential basis to
approximate the inverse problem as a system of 1D nonlinear equations. We then
employ a Picard iteration based on the quasi-reversibility method and a
Carleman weight function. We will rigorously prove that the sequence derived
from this iteration converges to the accurate solution for that 1D system
without requesting a good initial guess of the true solution. The key tool for
the proof is a Carleman estimate. We will also show some numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-3D generation is to craft a 3D object according to a natural language
description. This can significantly reduce the workload for manually designing
3D models and provide a more natural way of interaction for users. However,
this problem remains challenging in recovering the fine-grained details
effectively and optimizing a large-size 3D output efficiently. Inspired by the
success of progressive learning, we propose a Multi-Scale Triplane Network
(MTN) and a new progressive learning strategy. As the name implies, the
Multi-Scale Triplane Network consists of four triplanes transitioning from low
to high resolution. The low-resolution triplane could serve as an initial shape
for the high-resolution ones, easing the optimization difficulty. To further
enable the fine-grained details, we also introduce the progressive learning
strategy, which explicitly demands the network to shift its focus of attention
from simple coarse-grained patterns to difficult fine-grained patterns. Our
experiment verifies that the proposed method performs favorably against
existing methods. For even the most challenging descriptions, where most
existing methods struggle to produce a viable shape, our proposed method
consistently delivers. We aspire for our work to pave the way for automatic 3D
prototyping via natural language descriptions.

principal component analysis, have become widely used as they intuitively help
researchers study neural networks and their training process. However, these
linear methods suffer from limitations and drawbacks due to their lack of
flexibility and low fidelity at representing the high dimensional landscape. In
this paper, we present a novel auto-encoder-based non-linear landscape
visualization method called Neuro-Visualizer that addresses these shortcoming
and provides useful insights about neural network loss landscapes. To
demonstrate its potential, we run experiments on a variety of problems in two
separate applications of knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML). Our findings
show that Neuro-Visualizer outperforms other linear and non-linear baselines
and helps corroborate, and sometime challenge, claims proposed by machine

<p class="mathjax">Industrial demand response (IDR) plays an important role in promoting the
utilization of renewable energy (RE) in power systems. However, it will lead to
power adjustments on the supply side, which is also a non-negligible factor in
affecting RE utilization. To comprehensively analyze this impact while
enhancing RE utilization, this paper proposes a power demand-supply cooperative
response (PDSCR) strategy based on both day-ahead and intraday time scales. The
day-ahead PDSCR determines a long-term scheme for responding to the predictable
trends in RE supply. However, this long-term scheme may not be suitable when
uncertain RE fluctuations occur on an intraday basis. Regarding intraday PDSCR,
we formulate a profit-driven cooperation approach to address the issue of RE
fluctuations. In this context, unreasonable profit distributions on the
demand-supply side would lead to the conflict of interests and diminish the
effectiveness of cooperative responses. To mitigate this issue, we derive
multi-individual profit distribution marginal solutions (MIPDMSs) based on
satisfactory profit distributions, which can also maximize cooperative profits.
Case studies are conducted on an modified IEEE 24-bus system and an actual
power system in China. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
strategy for enhancing RE utilization, via optimizing the coordination of IDR
flexibility with generation resources.

<p class="mathjax">Urban flood risk emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among
multiple features related to flood hazard, flood exposure, and social and
physical vulnerabilities, along with the complex spatial flood dependence
relationships. Existing approaches for characterizing urban flood risk,
however, are primarily based on flood plain maps, focusing on a limited number
of features, primarily hazard and exposure features, without consideration of
feature interactions or the dependence relationships among spatial areas. To
address this gap, this study presents an integrated urban flood-risk rating
model based on a novel unsupervised graph deep learning model (called
FloodRisk-Net). FloodRisk-Net is capable of capturing spatial dependence among
areas and complex and nonlinear interactions among flood hazards and urban
features for specifying emergent flood risk. Using data from multiple
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, the model
characterizes their flood risk into six distinct city-specific levels. The
model is interpretable and enables feature analysis of areas within each
flood-risk level, allowing for the identification of the three archetypes
shaping the highest flood risk within each MSA. Flood risk is found to be
spatially distributed in a hierarchical structure within each MSA, where the
core city disproportionately bears the highest flood risk. Multiple cities are
found to have high overall flood-risk levels and low spatial inequality,
indicating limited options for balancing urban development and flood-risk
reduction. Relevant flood-risk reduction strategies are discussed considering
ways that the highest flood risk and uneven spatial distribution of flood risk
are formed.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has drawn more and more attention
in recent years. Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for
accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The first category
needs more cost for inference and the second one may be easily influenced by
noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize
multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge
transfer, enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking
during testing by using only event signals. Specifically, a teacher
Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding
the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then, we design a new
hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise
similarity, feature representation, and response maps-based knowledge
distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network.
Moreover, since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution
($346 \times 260$), we propose the first large-scale high-resolution ($1280
\times 720$) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide
range of categories such as pedestrians, vehicles, UAVs, ping pongs, etc.
Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT), and
our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The dataset, evaluation toolkit, and
source code are available on

<p class="mathjax">Due to low power consumption and high-speed performance, superconductor
circuit technology has emerged as an attractive and compelling post-CMOS
technology candidate. However, the design of dense memory circuits presents a
significant challenge, especially for tasks that demand substantial memory
resources. While superconductor memory cells offer impressive speed, their
limited density is the primary yet-to-be-solved challenge. This study tackles
this challenge head-on by introducing a novel design for a Non-Destructive
Readout (NDRO) memory unit with single or multi-fluxon storage capabilities
within the same circuit architecture. Notably, single storage demonstrates a
critical margin exceeding 20\%, and multi-fluxon storage demonstrates 64\%,
ensuring reliable and robust operation even in the face of process variations.
These memory units exhibit high clock frequencies of 10GHz. The proposed
circuits offer compelling characteristics, including rapid data propagation and
minimal data refreshment requirements, while effectively addressing the density
concerns associated with superconductor memory, doubling the memory capacity
while maintaining the high throughput speed.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been successfully
implemented as a smart agent in many systems such as complex games,
self-driving cars, and chat-bots. One of the interesting use cases of Deep RL
is its application as an automated stock trading agent. In general, any
automated trading agent is prone to manipulations by adversaries in the trading
environment. Thus studying their robustness is vital for their success in
practice. However, typical mechanism to study RL robustness, which is based on
white-box gradient-based adversarial sample generation techniques (like FGSM),
is obsolete for this use case, since the models are protected behind secure
international exchange APIs, such as NASDAQ. In this research, we demonstrate
that a "gray-box" approach for attacking a Deep RL-based trading agent is
possible by trading in the same stock market, with no extra access to the
trading agent. In our proposed approach, an adversary agent uses a hybrid Deep
Neural Network as its policy consisting of Convolutional layers and
fully-connected layers. On average, over three simulated trading market
configurations, the adversary policy proposed in this research is able to
reduce the reward values by 214.17%, which results in reducing the potential
profits of the baseline by 139.4%, ensemble method by 93.7%, and an automated
trading software developed by our industrial partner by 85.5%, while consuming
significantly less budget than the victims (427.77%, 187.16%, and 66.97%,
respectively).

<p class="mathjax">Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has garnered significant
attention in recent years due to its potential to predict complex semantics and
geometry shapes from a single image, requiring no 3D inputs. In this paper, we
identify several critical issues in current state-of-the-art methods, including
the Feature Ambiguity of projected 2D features in the ray to the 3D space, the
Pose Ambiguity of the 3D convolution, and the Computation Imbalance in the 3D
convolution across different depth levels. To address these problems, we devise
a novel Normalized Device Coordinates scene completion network (NDC-Scene) that
directly extends the 2D feature map to a Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)
space, rather than to the world space directly, through progressive restoration
of the dimension of depth with deconvolution operations. Experiment results
demonstrate that transferring the majority of computation from the target 3D
space to the proposed normalized device coordinates space benefits monocular
SSC tasks. Additionally, we design a Depth-Adaptive Dual Decoder to
simultaneously upsample and fuse the 2D and 3D feature maps, further improving
overall performance. Our extensive experiments confirm that the proposed method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both outdoor SemanticKITTI
and indoor NYUv2 datasets. Our code are available at
https://github.com/Jiawei-Yao0812/NDCScene.

aiding clinical decision support. Overcoming the challenges related to the
design of ethical AI will enable clinicians, physicians, healthcare
professionals, and other stakeholders to use and trust AI in healthcare
settings. This study attempts to identify the major ethical principles
influencing the utility performance of AI at different technological levels

observed that justice, privacy, bias, lack of regulations, risks, and
interpretability are the most important principles to consider for ethical AI.
This data-driven study has analyzed secondary survey data from the Pew Research

<p class="mathjax">Video anomaly detection is a complex task, and the principle of "divide and
conquer" is often regarded as an effective approach to tackling intricate
issues. It's noteworthy that recent methods in video anomaly detection have
revealed the application of the divide and conquer philosophy (albeit with
distinct perspectives from traditional usage), yielding impressive outcomes.
This paper systematically reviews these literatures from six dimensions, aiming
to enhance the use of the divide and conquer strategy in video anomaly
detection. Furthermore, based on the insights gained from this review, a novel
approach is presented, which integrates human skeletal frameworks with video
data analysis techniques. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the ShanghaiTech dataset, surpassing all existing advanced methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the substantial progress of large-scale models
across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer
vision, facilitating the expression of concrete concepts. Unlike concrete
concepts that are usually directly associated with physical objects, expressing
abstract concepts through natural language requires considerable effort, which
results from their intricate semantics and connotations. An alternative
approach is to leverage images to convey rich visual information as a
supplement. Nevertheless, existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models are primarily
trained on concrete physical objects and tend to fail to visualize abstract
concepts. Inspired by the three-layer artwork theory that identifies critical
factors, intent, object and form during artistic creation, we propose a
framework of Text-to-Image generation for Abstract Concepts (TIAC). The
abstract concept is clarified into a clear intent with a detailed definition to
avoid ambiguity. LLMs then transform it into semantic-related physical objects,
and the concept-dependent form is retrieved from an LLM-extracted form pattern
set. Information from these three aspects will be integrated to generate
prompts for T2I models via LLM. Evaluation results from human assessments and
our newly designed metric concept score demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in creating images that can sufficiently express abstract concepts.

<p class="mathjax">The aviation sector is challenging to decarbonize since aircraft require high
power and energy per unit of weight. Liquid hydrogen is an interesting solution
due to its high gravimetric energy density, minimal warming impact, and
low-carbon production potential. We quantify the performance targets for fuel
cell systems and on-board storage to enable hydrogen-powered regional aviation.
We then explore the energy infrastructure impacts of meeting this additional H2
demand in the European context under deep decarbonization scenarios. We find
that minimal payload reduction would be needed for powering regional aviation
up to 1000 nmi if fuel cell system specific power of 2 kW/kg and tank
gravimetric index of 50% can be achieved. The energy systems analysis
highlights the importance of utilizing multiple technology options: such as
nuclear expansion and natural gas reforming with CCS for hydrogen production.
Levelized cost of liquid hydrogen as low as 3.5 Euros/kg demonstrates pathways
for Europe to achieve cost-competitive production.

<p class="mathjax">With privacy-preserving and traceability properties, group signature is a
cryptosystem with central role in cryptography. And there are lots of
application scenarios. A new extension concept of group signature is presented,
namely group signature with self-proof capacity. For a legitimate group
signature, the real signer can prove that the signature is indeed signed by
him/her. While for the other members of the group, they can prove that the
signature is not signed by him/her. The former can be used for claiming money
reward from the police, while the latter can be used for proving one's innocent
in a criminal investigation.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the design of energy-efficient artificial noise (AN)
schemes in the context of physical layer security in visible light
communications (VLC). Two different transmission schemes termed
$\textit{selective AN-aided single-input single-output (SISO)}$ and
$\textit{AN-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO)}$ are examined and
compared in terms of secrecy energy efficiency (SEE). In the former, the
closest LED luminaire to the legitimate user (Bob) is the information-bearing
signal's transmitter. At the same time, the rest of the luminaries act as
jammers transmitting AN to degrade the channels of eavesdroppers (Eves). In the
latter, the information-bearing signal and AN are combined and transmitted by
all luminaries. When Eves' CSI is unknown, an indirect design to improve the
SEE is formulated by maximizing Bob's channel's energy efficiency. A
low-complexity design based on the zero-forcing criterion is also proposed. In
the case of known Eves' CSI, we study the design that maximizes the minimum SEE
among those corresponding to all eavesdroppers. At their respective optimal
SEEs, simulation results reveal that when Eves' CSI is unknown, the selective
AN-aided SISO transmission can archive twice better SEE as the AN-aided MISO
does. In contrast, when Eves' CSI is known, the AN-aided MISO outperforms by
30%.

<p class="mathjax">The flexibility of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in
various environments has consistently been a significant challenge. To address
the issue of LiDAR odometry drift in high-noise settings, integrating
clustering methods to filter out unstable features has become an effective
module of SLAM frameworks. However, reducing the amount of point cloud data can
lead to potential loss of information and possible degeneration. As a result,
this research proposes a LiDAR odometry that can dynamically assess the point
cloud's reliability. The algorithm aims to improve adaptability in diverse
settings by selecting important feature points with sensitivity to the level of
environmental degeneration. Firstly, a fast adaptive Euclidean clustering
algorithm based on range image is proposed, which, combined with depth
clustering, extracts the primary structural points of the environment defined
as ambient skeleton points. Then, the environmental degeneration level is
computed through the dense normal features of the skeleton points, and the
point cloud cleaning is dynamically adjusted accordingly. The algorithm is
validated on the KITTI benchmark and real environments, demonstrating higher
accuracy and robustness in different environments.

<p class="mathjax">Motion graphics videos are widely used in Web design, digital advertising,
animated logos and film title sequences, to capture a viewer's attention. But
editing such video is challenging because the video provides a low-level
sequence of pixels and frames rather than higher-level structure such as the
objects in the video with their corresponding motions and occlusions. We
present a motion vectorization pipeline for converting motion graphics video
into an SVG motion program that provides such structure. The resulting SVG
program can be rendered using any SVG renderer(e.g. most Web browsers) and
edited using any SVG editor. We also introduce a program transformation API
that facilitates editing of a SVG motion program to create variations that
adjust the timing, motions and/or appearances of objects. We show how the API
can be used to create a variety of effects including retiming object motion to
match a music beat, adding motion textures to objects, and collision preserving
appearance changes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a nonparametric learning solution framework for a generic
internal model design of nonlinear robust output regulation. The global robust
output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems with output feedback
subject to a nonlinear exosystem can be tackled by constructing a linear
generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. An
explicit continuous nonlinear mapping was constructed recently in [1] under the
assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal.
We further relax such an assumption to a relaxed assumption that the
steady-state generator is polynomial in the exogenous signal. A nonparametric
learning framework is proposed to solve a linear time-varying equation to make
the nonlinear continuous mapping always exist. With the help of the proposed
framework, the nonlinear robust output regulation problem can be converted into
a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with
integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic
gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to
achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the
uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. We
further apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and
estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without using
adaptive techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the
estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown
frequencies. As a result, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the
output regulation using our nonparametric learning framework.

<p class="mathjax">With the slowdown of Moore's law, CPU-oriented packet processing in software
will be significantly outpaced by emerging line speeds of network interface
cards (NICs). Single-core packet-processing throughput has saturated.
<br />We consider the problem of high-speed packet processing with multiple CPU
cores. The key challenge is state--memory that multiple packets must read and
update. The prevailing method to scale throughput with multiple cores involves
state sharding, processing all packets that update the same state, i.e., flow,
at the same core. However, given the heavy-tailed nature of realistic flow size
distributions, this method will be untenable in the near future, since total
throughput is severely limited by single core performance.
<br />This paper introduces state-compute replication, a principle to scale the
throughput of a single stateful flow across multiple cores using replication.
Our design leverages a packet history sequencer running on a NIC or
top-of-the-rack switch to enable multiple cores to update state without
explicit synchronization. Our experiments with realistic data center and
wide-area Internet traces shows that state-compute replication can scale total
packet-processing throughput linearly with cores, deterministically and
independent of flow size distributions, across a range of realistic
packet-processing programs.

<p class="mathjax">Given a set of $n\geq 1$ autonomous, anonymous, indistinguishable, silent,
and possibly disoriented mobile unit disk (i.e., fat) robots operating
following Look-Compute-Move cycles in the Euclidean plane, we consider the
Pattern Formation problem: from arbitrary starting positions, the robots must
reposition themselves to form a given target pattern. This problem arises under
obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a
third robot on the straight line segment between the two robots. We assume that
a robot's movement cannot be interrupted by an adversary and that robots have a
small $O(1)$-sized memory that they can use to store information, but that
cannot be communicated to the other robots. To solve this problem, we present
an algorithm that works in three steps. First it establishes mutual visibility,
then it elects one robot to be the leader, and finally it forms the required
pattern. The whole algorithm runs in $O(n) + O(q \log n)$ rounds, where $q&gt;0$
is related to leader election, which takes $O(q \log n)$ rounds with
probability at least $1-n^{-q}$. The algorithms are collision-free and do not
require the knowledge of the number of robots.

<p class="mathjax">Constant function market makers (CFMMs) are a popular decentralized exchange
mechanism and have recently been the subject of much research, but major CFMMs
give traders no privacy. Prior work proposes randomly splitting and shuffling
trades to give some privacy to all users [Chitra et al. 2022], or adding noise
to the market state after each trade and charging a fixed `privacy fee' to all
traders [Frongillo and Waggoner 2018]. In contrast, we propose a noisy CFMM
mechanism where users specify personal privacy requirements and pay
personalized fees. We show that the noise added for privacy protection creates
additional arbitrage opportunities. We call a mechanism priceable if there
exists a privacy fee that always matches the additional arbitrage loss in
expectation. We show that a mechanism is priceable if and only if the noise
added is zero-mean in the asset amount. We also show that priceability and
setting the right fee are necessary for a mechanism to be truthful, and that
this fee is inversely proportional to the CFMM's liquidity.

<p class="mathjax">Current state-of-the-art autonomous driving vehicles mainly rely on each
individual sensor system to perform perception tasks. Such a framework's
reliability could be limited by occlusion or sensor failure. To address this
issue, more recent research proposes using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication to share perception information with others. However, most
relevant works focus only on cooperative detection and leave cooperative
tracking an underexplored research field. A few recent datasets, such as
V2V4Real, provide 3D multi-object cooperative tracking benchmarks. However,
their proposed methods mainly use cooperative detection results as input to a
standard single-sensor Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithm. In their
approach, the measurement uncertainty of different sensors from different
connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) may not be properly estimated to utilize
the theoretical optimality property of Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a novel 3D multi-object cooperative tracking
algorithm for autonomous driving via a differentiable multi-sensor Kalman
Filter. Our algorithm learns to estimate measurement uncertainty for each
detection that can better utilize the theoretical property of Kalman
Filter-based tracking methods. The experiment results show that our algorithm
improves the tracking accuracy by 17% with only 0.037x communication costs
compared with the state-of-the-art method in V2V4Real.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a multi-sensor navigation system for autonomous surface vessels
(ASV) intended for water-quality monitoring in freshwater lakes. Our mission
planner uses satellite imagery as a prior map, formulating offline a
mission-level policy for global navigation of the ASV and enabling autonomous
online execution via local perception and local planning modules. A significant
challenge is posed by the inconsistencies in traversability estimation between
satellite images and real lakes, due to environmental effects such as wind,
aquatic vegetation, shallow waters, and fluctuating water levels. Hence, we
specifically modelled these traversability uncertainties as stochastic edges in
a graph and optimized for a mission-level policy that minimizes the expected
total travel distance. To execute the policy, we propose a modern local planner
architecture that processes sensor inputs and plans paths to execute the
high-level policy under uncertain traversability conditions. Our system was
tested on three km-scale missions on a Northern Ontario lake, demonstrating
that our GPS-, vision-, and sonar-enabled ASV system can effectively execute
the mission-level policy and disambiguate the traversability of stochastic
edges. Finally, we provide insights gained from practical field experience and
offer several future directions to enhance the overall reliability of ASV
navigation systems.

NF refers to Network Functions. 5G-SBA-PKI is designed to include multiple
certificate authorities (with different scopes of operation and capabilities)
at different PLMN levels for certification operations and key exchange between
communicating NFs, where PLMN refers to a Public Land Mobile Network. We
conduct a formal analysis of 5G-SBA-PKI with respect to the desired security
properties using TAMARIN prover. Finally, we evaluate 5G-SBA-PKI's performance
with "pre-quantum" as well as quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task in the fields
of robot navigation and mobile mapping. Existing I2P registration works
estimate correspondences at the point-to-pixel level, neglecting the global
alignment. However, I2P matching without high-level guidance from global
constraints may converge to the local optimum easily. To solve the problem,
this paper proposes CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts
correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner for the global optimal solution.
First, the image and point cloud are fed into a Siamese encoder-decoder network
for hierarchical feature extraction. Then, a coarse-to-fine matching module is
designed to exploit features and establish resilient feature correspondences.
Specifically, in the coarse matching block, a novel I2P transformer module is
employed to capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from
image and point cloud. With the discriminate descriptors, coarse
super-point-to-super-pixel matching pairs are estimated. In the fine matching
module, point-to-pixel pairs are established with the
super-point-to-super-pixel correspondence supervision. Finally, based on
matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC
algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset have
demonstrated that CoFiI2P achieves a relative rotation error (RRE) of 2.25
degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.61 meters. These results
represent a significant improvement of 14% in RRE and 52% in RTE compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. The demo video for the experiments
is available at https://youtu.be/TG2GBrJTuW4. The source code will be public at

<p class="mathjax">The need for skilled medical support is growing in the era of digital
healthcare. This research presents an innovative strategy, utilising the RuBERT
model, for categorising user inquiries in the field of medical consultation
with a focus on expert specialisation. By harnessing the capabilities of
transformers, we fine-tuned the pre-trained RuBERT model on a varied dataset,
which facilitates precise correspondence between queries and particular medical
specialisms. Using a comprehensive dataset, we have demonstrated our approach's
superior performance with an F1-score of over 92%, calculated through both
cross-validation and the traditional split of test and train datasets. Our
approach has shown excellent generalisation across medical domains such as
cardiology, neurology and dermatology. This methodology provides practical
benefits by directing users to appropriate specialists for prompt and targeted
medical advice. It also enhances healthcare system efficiency, reduces
practitioner burden, and improves patient care quality. In summary, our
suggested strategy facilitates the attainment of specific medical knowledge,
offering prompt and precise advice within the digital healthcare field.

<p class="mathjax">When researching robot swarms, many studies observe complex group behavior
emerging from the individual agents' simple local actions. However, the task of
learning an individual policy to produce a desired emergent behavior remains a
challenging and largely unsolved problem. We present a method of training
distributed robotic swarm algorithms to produce emergent behavior. Inspired by
the biological evolution of emergent behavior in animals, we use an
evolutionary algorithm to train a 'population' of individual behaviors to
approximate a desired group behavior. We perform experiments using simulations
of the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimps (GT-MABs) aerial robotics
platforms conducted in the CoppeliaSim simulator. Additionally, we test on
simulations of Anki Vector robots to display our algorithm's effectiveness on
various modes of actuation. We evaluate our algorithm on various tasks where a
somewhat complex group behavior is required for success. These tasks include an
Area Coverage task, a Surround Target task, and a Wall Climb task. We compare
behaviors evolved using our algorithm against 'designed policies', which we
create in order to exhibit the emergent behaviors we desire.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches propose novel
training-free metrics called zero-shot proxies to substantially reduce the
search time compared to the traditional training-based NAS. Despite the success
on image classification, the effectiveness of zero-shot proxies is rarely
evaluated on complex vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and object
detection. Moreover, existing zero-shot proxies are shown to be biased towards
certain model characteristics which restricts their broad applicability. In
this paper, we empirically study the bias of state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot
proxy ZiCo across multiple vision tasks and observe that ZiCo is biased towards
thinner and deeper networks, leading to sub-optimal architectures. To solve the
problem, we propose a novel bias correction on ZiCo, called ZiCo-BC. Our
extensive experiments across various vision tasks (image classification, object
detection and semantic segmentation) show that our approach can successfully
search for architectures with higher accuracy and significantly lower latency
on Samsung Galaxy S10 devices.

<p class="mathjax">With the growing demand for vision applications and deployment across edge
devices, the development of hardware-friendly architectures that maintain
performance during device deployment becomes crucial. Neural architecture
search (NAS) techniques explore various approaches to discover efficient
architectures for diverse learning tasks in a computationally efficient manner.
In this paper, we present the next-generation neural architecture design for
computationally efficient neural architecture distillation - DONNAv2 .
Conventional NAS algorithms rely on a computationally extensive stage where an
accuracy predictor is learned to estimate model performance within search
space. This building of accuracy predictors helps them predict the performance
of models that are not being finetuned. Here, we have developed an elegant
approach to eliminate building the accuracy predictor and extend DONNA to a
computationally efficient setting. The loss metric of individual blocks forming
the network serves as the surrogate performance measure for the sampled models
in the NAS search stage. To validate the performance of DONNAv2 we have
performed extensive experiments involving a range of diverse vision tasks
including classification, object detection, image denoising, super-resolution,
and panoptic perception network (YOLOP). The hardware-in-the-loop experiments
were carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile platform. Notably, DONNAv2
reduces the computational cost of DONNA by 10x for the larger datasets.
Furthermore, to improve the quality of NAS search space, DONNAv2 leverages a
block knowledge distillation filter to remove blocks with high inference costs.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered considerable interest due to their
exceptional performance in a wide range of graph machine learning tasks.
Nevertheless, the majority of GNN-based approaches have been examined using
well-annotated benchmark datasets, leading to suboptimal performance in
real-world graph learning scenarios. To bridge this gap, the present paper
investigates the problem of graph transfer learning in the presence of label
noise, which transfers knowledge from a noisy source graph to an unlabeled
target graph. We introduce a novel technique termed Balance Alignment and
Information-aware Examination (ALEX) to address this challenge. ALEX first
employs singular value decomposition to generate different views with crucial
structural semantics, which help provide robust node representations using
graph contrastive learning. To mitigate both label shift and domain shift, we
estimate a prior distribution to build subgraphs with balanced label
distributions. Building on this foundation, an adversarial domain discriminator
is incorporated for the implicit domain alignment of complex multi-modal
distributions. Furthermore, we project node representations into a different
space, optimizing the mutual information between the projected features and
labels. Subsequently, the inconsistency of similarity structures is evaluated
to identify noisy samples with potential overfitting. Comprehensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets substantiate the outstanding superiority of the
proposed ALEX in different settings.

significant morbidity and, in severe cases, mortality. Accurate forecasting of
daily admissions of pediatric HFMD patients is therefore crucial for aiding the
hospital in preparing for potential outbreaks and mitigating nosocomial
transmissions. To address this pressing need, we propose a novel
transformer-based model with a U-net shape, utilizing the patching strategy and
the joint prediction strategy that capitalizes on insights from herpangina, a
disease closely correlated with HFMD. This model also integrates representation
learning by introducing reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss. The results
show that our U-net Patching Time Series Transformer (UPTST) model outperforms
existing approaches in both long- and short-arm prediction accuracy of HFMD at
hospital-level. Furthermore, the exploratory extension experiments show that
the model's capabilities extend beyond prediction of infectious disease,
suggesting broader applicability in various domains.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-silo federated learning offers a promising solution to collaboratively
train robust and generalized AI models without compromising the privacy of
local datasets, e.g., healthcare, financial, as well as scientific projects
that lack a centralized data facility. Nonetheless, because of the disparity of
computing resources among different clients (i.e., device heterogeneity),
synchronous federated learning algorithms suffer from degraded efficiency when
waiting for straggler clients. Similarly, asynchronous federated learning
algorithms experience degradation in the convergence rate and final model
accuracy on non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID)
heterogeneous datasets due to stale local models and client drift. To address
these limitations in cross-silo federated learning with heterogeneous clients
and data, we propose FedCompass, an innovative semi-asynchronous federated
learning algorithm with a computing power aware scheduler on the server side,
which adaptively assigns varying amounts of training tasks to different clients
using the knowledge of the computing power of individual clients. FedCompass
ensures that multiple locally trained models from clients are received almost
simultaneously as a group for aggregation, effectively reducing the staleness
of local models. At the same time, the overall training process remains
asynchronous, eliminating prolonged waiting periods from straggler clients.
Using diverse non-IID heterogeneous distributed datasets, we demonstrate that
FedCompass achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy than other
asynchronous algorithms while remaining more efficient than synchronous
algorithms when performing federated learning on heterogeneous clients.

<p class="mathjax">With the advancement of deep learning (DL) in various fields, there are many
attempts to reveal software vulnerabilities by data-driven approach.
Nonetheless, such existing works lack the effective representation that can
retain the non-sequential semantic characteristics and contextual relationship
of source code attributes. Hence, in this work, we propose XGV-BERT, a
framework that combines the pre-trained CodeBERT model and Graph Neural Network
(GCN) to detect software vulnerabilities. By jointly training the CodeBERT and
GCN modules within XGV-BERT, the proposed model leverages the advantages of
large-scale pre-training, harnessing vast raw data, and transfer learning by
learning representations for training data through graph convolution. The
research results demonstrate that the XGV-BERT method significantly improves

VulDeePecker and SySeVR. For the VulDeePecker dataset, XGV-BERT achieves an
impressive F1-score of 97.5%, significantly outperforming VulDeePecker, which
achieved an F1-score of 78.3%. Again, with the SySeVR dataset, XGV-BERT

<p class="mathjax">Despite the promising few-shot ability of large language models (LLMs), the
standard paradigm of In-context Learning (ICL) suffers the disadvantages of
susceptibility to selected demonstrations and the intricacy to generate these
demonstrations. In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether
human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question,
we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from
human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using
hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create
demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC
is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the
chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process
of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in
arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding,
and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require
hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning
strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted
demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs
possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own
capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.

<p class="mathjax">We present a general and simple text to video model based on Transformer.
Since both text and video are sequential data, we encode both texts and images
into the same hidden space, which are further fed into Transformer to capture
the temporal consistency and then decoder to generate either text or images.
Considering the image signal may become weak in the long sequence, we introduce
the U-Net to reconstruct image from its noised version. Specifically, we
increase the noise level to the original image in the long sequence, then use
the $down$ module from U-Net to encode noised images, which are further input
to transformer to predict next clear images. We also add a constraint to
promote motion between any generated image pair in the video. We use GPT2 and
test our approach on UCF101 dataset and show it can generate promising videos.

<p class="mathjax">Realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in large quantities are crucial for
the development and validation of autonomous driving systems. However, owing to
numerous difficulties in the data collection process and the reliance on
intensive annotations, real-world datasets lack sufficient quantity and
diversity to support the increasing demand for data. This work introduces
DriveSceneGen, a data-driven driving scenario generation method that learns
from the real-world driving dataset and generates entire dynamic driving
scenarios from scratch. DriveSceneGen is able to generate novel driving
scenarios that align with real-world data distributions with high fidelity and
diversity. Experimental results on 5k generated scenarios highlight the
generation quality, diversity, and scalability compared to real-world datasets.
To the best of our knowledge, DriveSceneGen is the first method that generates
novel driving scenarios involving both static map elements and dynamic traffic
participants from scratch.

<p class="mathjax">The popular robotic simulator, Gazebo, lacks the feature of simulating the
effects of control latency that would make it a fully-fledged cyber-physical
system (CPS) simulator. The CPS that we address to measure is a robotic arm
(UR5) controlled remotely with velocity commands. The main goal is to measure
Quality of Control (QoC) related KPIs during various network conditions in a
simulated environment. We propose a Gazebo plugin to make the above measurement
feasible by making Gazebo capable to delay internal control and status messages
and also to interface with external network simulators to derive even more
advanced network effects. Our preliminary evaluation shows that there is
certainly an effect on the behavior of the robotic arm with the introduced
network latency in line with our expectations, but a more detailed further
study is needed.

<p class="mathjax">In rapidly sprawling urban areas and booming intercity express rail networks,
efficiently designed feeder bus systems are more essential than ever to
transport passengers to and from trunk-line rail terminals. When the feeder
service region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand
distribution must be considered. This paper develops continuous approximation
models for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a
rectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous
studies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings
and headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on
bus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii)
examining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder
schedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling
complexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically
derived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm.
Local transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real
fixed-route feeder system. This paper reveals many findings and insights not
previously reported. For instance, integrating the heterogeneous stop spacing
optimization further reduces the system cost (by 4% under specific operating
conditions). The cost savings increase with demand heterogeneity but decrease
with the demand rate and service region size. Choosing the layout of feeder
lines where buses pick up and drop off passengers along the service region's
shorter side also significantly lowers the system cost (by 6% when the service
region's aspect ratio is 1 to 2). Furthermore, coordinating trunk and feeder
schedules in both service directions yields an additional cost saving of up to
20%.

<p class="mathjax">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers have been shown to be
Turing-complete, but this result assumes infinite precision in their hidden
representations, positional encodings for transformers, and unbounded
computation time in general. In practical applications, however, it is crucial
to have real-time models that can recognize Turing complete grammars in a
single pass. To address this issue and to better understand the true
computational power of artificial neural networks (ANNs), we introduce a new
class of recurrent models called the neural state Turing machine (NSTM). The
NSTM has bounded weights and finite-precision connections and can simulate any
Turing Machine in real-time. In contrast to prior work that assumes unbounded
time and precision in weights, to demonstrate equivalence with TMs, we prove
that a $13$-neuron bounded tensor RNN, coupled with third-order synapses, can
model any TM class in real-time. Furthermore, under the Markov assumption, we
provide a new theoretical bound for a non-recurrent network augmented with
memory, showing that a tensor feedforward network with $25$th-order finite
precision weights is equivalent to a universal TM.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with recurrence and self-attention have
been shown to be Turing-complete (TC). However, existing work has shown that
these ANNs require multiple turns or unbounded computation time, even with
unbounded precision in weights, in order to recognize TC grammars. However,
under constraints such as fixed or bounded precision neurons and time, ANNs
without memory are shown to struggle to recognize even context-free languages.
In this work, we extend the theoretical foundation for the $2^{nd}$-order
recurrent network ($2^{nd}$ RNN) and prove there exists a class of a $2^{nd}$
RNN that is Turing-complete with bounded time. This model is capable of
directly encoding a transition table into its recurrent weights, enabling
bounded time computation and is interpretable by design. We also demonstrate
that $2$nd order RNNs, without memory, under bounded weights and time
constraints, outperform modern-day models such as vanilla RNNs and gated
recurrent units in recognizing regular grammars. We provide an upper bound and
a stability analysis on the maximum number of neurons required by $2$nd order
RNNs to recognize any class of regular grammar. Extensive experiments on the
Tomita grammars support our findings, demonstrating the importance of tensor
connections in crafting computationally efficient RNNs. Finally, we show
$2^{nd}$ order RNNs are also interpretable by extraction and can extract state
machines with higher success rates as compared to first-order RNNs. Our results
extend the theoretical foundations of RNNs and offer promising avenues for
future explainable AI research.

<p class="mathjax">Total variation distance (TV distance) is an important measure for the
difference between two distributions. Recently, there has been progress in
approximating the TV distance between product distributions: a deterministic
algorithm for a restricted class of product distributions (Bhattacharyya,
Gayen, Meel, Myrisiotis, Pavan and Vinodchandran 2023) and a randomized
algorithm for general product distributions (Feng, Guo, Jerrum and Wang 2023).
We give a deterministic fully polynomial-time approximation algorithm (FPTAS)
for the TV distance between product distributions. Given two product
distributions $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ over $[q]^n$, our algorithm
approximates their TV distance with relative error $\varepsilon$ in time
$O\bigl( \frac{qn^2}{\varepsilon} \log q \log \frac{n}{\varepsilon
\Delta_{\text{TV}}(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{Q}) } \bigr)$.
<br />Our algorithm is built around two key concepts: 1) The likelihood ratio as a
distribution, which captures sufficient information to compute the TV distance.
2) We introduce a metric between likelihood ratio distributions, called the
minimum total variation distance. Our algorithm computes a sparsified
likelihood ratio distribution that is close to the original one w.r.t. the new
metric. The approximated TV distance can be computed from the sparsified
likelihood ratio.
<br />Our technique also implies deterministic FPTAS for the TV distance between
Markov chains.

<p class="mathjax">Given the severe vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against
adversarial examples, there is an urgent need for an effective adversarial
attack to identify the deficiencies of DNNs in security-sensitive applications.
As one of the prevalent black-box adversarial attacks, the existing
transfer-based attacks still cannot achieve comparable performance with the
white-box attacks. Among these, input transformation based attacks have shown
remarkable effectiveness in boosting transferability. In this work, we find
that the existing input transformation based attacks transform the input image
globally, resulting in limited diversity of the transformed images. We
postulate that the more diverse transformed images result in better
transferability. Thus, we investigate how to locally apply various
transformations onto the input image to improve such diversity while preserving
the structure of image. To this end, we propose a novel input transformation
based attack, called Structure Invariant Attack (SIA), which applies a random
image transformation onto each image block to craft a set of diverse images for
gradient calculation. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that SIA exhibits much better transferability than the existing
SOTA input transformation based attacks on CNN-based and transformer-based
models, showing its generality and superiority in boosting transferability.

<p class="mathjax">Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming
system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also
oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between
different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this
paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with
Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes
transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each
modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined
impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport
selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user
interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most
user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing
future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better
robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct
extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average
prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Learning-based methods have attracted a lot of research attention and led to
significant improvements in low-light image enhancement. However, most of them
still suffer from two main problems: expensive computational cost in high
resolution images and unsatisfactory performance in simultaneous enhancement
and denoising. To address these problems, we propose BDCE, a bootstrap
diffusion model that exploits the learning of the distribution of the curve
parameters instead of the normal-light image itself. Specifically, we adopt the
curve estimation method to handle the high-resolution images, where the curve
parameters are estimated by our bootstrap diffusion model. In addition, a
denoise module is applied in each iteration of curve adjustment to denoise the
intermediate enhanced result of each iteration. We evaluate BDCE on commonly
used benchmark datasets, and extensive experiments show that it achieves
state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative performance.

<p class="mathjax">Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models
(LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the
heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially
when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a
quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies
in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the
solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of
quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily
implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with
two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized
(e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the
LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model
without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model
families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and
downstream scenarios. Code will be made available at

<p class="mathjax">In the context of humans operating with artificial or autonomous agents in a
hybrid team, it is essential to accurately identify when to authorize those
team members to perform actions. Given past examples where humans and
autonomous systems can either succeed or fail at tasks, we seek to train a
delegating manager agent to make delegation decisions with respect to these
potential performance deficiencies. Additionally, we cannot always expect the
various agents to operate within the same underlying model of the environment.
It is possible to encounter cases where the actions and transitions would vary
between agents. Therefore, our framework provides a manager model which learns
through observations of team performance without restricting agents to matching
dynamics. Our results show our manager learns to perform delegation decisions
with teams of agents operating under differing representations of the
environment, significantly outperforming alternative methods to manage the
team.

<p class="mathjax">One of the typical purposes of using lower-limb exoskeleton robots is to
provide assistance to the wearer by supporting their weight and augmenting
their physical capabilities according to a given task and human motion
intentions. The generalizability of robots across different wearers in multiple
tasks is important to ensure that the robot can provide correct and effective
assistance in actual implementation. However, most lower-limb exoskeleton
robots exhibit only limited generalizability. Therefore, this paper proposes a
human-in-the-loop learning and adaptation framework for exoskeleton robots to
improve their performance in various tasks and for different wearers. To suit
different wearers, an individualized walking trajectory is generated online
using dynamic movement primitives and Bayes optimization. To accommodate
various tasks, a task translator is constructed using a neural network to
generalize a trajectory to more complex scenarios. These generalization
techniques are integrated into a unified variable impedance model, which
regulates the exoskeleton to provide assistance while ensuring safety. In
addition, an anomaly detection network is developed to quantitatively evaluate
the wearer's comfort, which is considered in the trajectory learning procedure
and contributes to the relaxation of conflicts in impedance control. The
proposed framework is easy to implement, because it requires proprioceptive
sensors only to perform and deploy data-efficient learning schemes. This makes
the exoskeleton practical for deployment in complex scenarios, accommodating
different walking patterns, habits, tasks, and conflicts. Experiments and
comparative studies on a lower-limb exoskeleton robot are performed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by Federated Learning, in this paper, we propose personal large
models that are distilled from traditional large language models but more
adaptive to local users' personal information such as education background and
hobbies. We classify the large language models into three levels: the personal
level, expert level and traditional level. The personal level models are
adaptive to users' personal information. They encrypt the users' input and
protect their privacy. The expert level models focus on merging specific
knowledge such as finance, IT and art. The traditional models focus on the
universal knowledge discovery and upgrading the expert models. In such
classifications, the personal models directly interact with the user. For the
whole system, the personal models have users' (encrypted) personal information.
Moreover, such models must be small enough to be performed on personal
computers or mobile devices. Finally, they also have to response in real-time
for better user experience and produce high quality results. The proposed
personal large models can be applied in a wide range of applications such as
language and vision tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a novel Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach,
Multi-Agent Continuous Dynamic Policy Gradient (MACDPP) was proposed to tackle
the issues of limited capability and sample efficiency in various scenarios
controlled by multiple agents. It alleviates the inconsistency of multiple
agents' policy updates by introducing the relative entropy regularization to
the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework with the
Actor-Critic (AC) structure. Evaluated by multi-agent cooperation and
competition tasks and traditional control tasks including OpenAI benchmarks and
robot arm manipulation, MACDPP demonstrates significant superiority in learning
capability and sample efficiency compared with both related multi-agent and
widely implemented signal-agent baselines and therefore expands the potential
of MARL in effectively learning challenging control scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">While automated vehicle (AV) research has grown steadily in recent years, the
impact of automated lane changing behavior on transportation systems remains a
largely understudied topic. The present work aims to explore the effects of
automated lane changing behavior on urban network efficiency as the penetration
rate of AVs increases. To the best of the authors knowledge, this represents
the first attempt to do so by isolating the effects of the lane changing
behavior; this was obtained by considering AVs with automated lateral control,
yet retaining the same longitudinal control characteristics of conventional
vehicles (CV). An urban road network located in Hannover, Germany, was modeled
with the microsimulation software SUMO, and several scenarios were analyzed,
starting from a baseline with only CVs and then progressively increasing the AV
penetration rate with 10% increments. Results highlight a modest, but
statistically significant, decrease in system performance, with travel times
increasing, and average speed and network capacity decreasing, as penetration
rates increase. This was likely caused by a more prudent behavior of AVs, which
accepted larger gaps than CVs when performing lane changing maneuvers.

<p class="mathjax">Legal question-answering (QA) systems have the potential to revolutionize the
way legal professionals interact with case law documents. This paper conducts a
comparative analysis of existing artificial intelligence models for their
utility in answering legal questions within the Indian legal system,
specifically focusing on Indian Legal Question Answering (AILQA) and our study
investigates the efficacy of different retrieval and QA algorithms currently
available. Utilizing the OpenAI GPT model as a benchmark, along with query
prompts, our investigation shows that existing AILQA systems can automatically
interpret natural language queries from users and generate highly accurate
responses. This research is particularly focused on applications within the
Indian criminal justice domain, which has its own set of challenges due to its
complexity and resource constraints. In order to rigorously assess the
performance of these models, empirical evaluations are complemented by feedback
from practicing legal professionals, thereby offering a multifaceted view on
the capabilities and limitations of AI in the context of Indian legal
question-answering.

<p class="mathjax">Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) embedded in IoT devices provide a
deployable solution to secure IoT applications at the hardware level. By
design, in TEEs, the Trusted Operating System (Trusted OS) is the primary
component. It enables the TEE to use security-based design techniques, such as
data encryption and identity authentication. Once a Trusted OS has been
exploited, the TEE can no longer ensure security. However, Trusted OSes for IoT
devices have received little security analysis, which is challenging from
several perspectives: (1) Trusted OSes are closed-source and have an
unfavorable environment for sending test cases and collecting feedback. (2)
Trusted OSes have complex data structures and require a stateful workflow,
which limits existing vulnerability detection tools. To address the challenges,
we present SyzTrust, the first state-aware fuzzing framework for vetting the
security of resource-limited Trusted OSes. SyzTrust adopts a hardware-assisted
framework to enable fuzzing Trusted OSes directly on IoT devices as well as
tracking state and code coverage non-invasively. SyzTrust utilizes composite
feedback to guide the fuzzer to effectively explore more states as well as to
increase the code coverage. We evaluate SyzTrust on Trusted OSes from three
major vendors: Samsung, Tsinglink Cloud, and Ali Cloud. These systems run on
Cortex M23/33 MCUs, which provide the necessary abstraction for embedded TEEs.
We discovered 70 previously unknown vulnerabilities in their Trusted OSes,
receiving 10 new CVEs so far. Furthermore, compared to the baseline, SyzTrust
has demonstrated significant improvements, including 66% higher code coverage,
651% higher state coverage, and 31% improved vulnerability-finding capability.
We report all discovered new vulnerabilities to vendors and open source
SyzTrust.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity and
ill-posed nature, yet it is quite important to many applications. While recent
works achieve limited accuracy by designing increasingly complicated networks
to extract features with limited spatial geometric cues from a single RGB
image, we intend to introduce spatial cues by training a teacher network that
leverages left-right image pairs as inputs and transferring the learned 3D
geometry-aware knowledge to the monocular student network. Specifically, we
present a novel knowledge distillation framework, named ADU-Depth, with the
goal of leveraging the well-trained teacher network to guide the learning of
the student network, thus boosting the precise depth estimation with the help
of extra spatial scene information. To enable domain adaptation and ensure
effective and smooth knowledge transfer from teacher to student, we apply both
attention-adapted feature distillation and focal-depth-adapted response
distillation in the training stage. In addition, we explicitly model the
uncertainty of depth estimation to guide distillation in both feature space and
result space to better produce 3D-aware knowledge from monocular observations
and thus enhance the learning for hard-to-predict image regions. Our extensive
experiments on the real depth estimation datasets KITTI and DrivingStereo
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which ranked 1st on the
challenging KITTI online benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing learning-based infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) methods
exhibit massive redundant information in the fusion images, i.e., yielding
edge-blurring effect or unrecognizable for object detectors. To alleviate these
issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving approach for IVIF, namely
SSPFusion. At first, we design a Structural Feature Extractor (SFE) to extract
the structural features of infrared and visible images. Then, we introduce a
multi-scale Structure-Preserving Fusion (SPF) module to fuse the structural
features of infrared and visible images, while maintaining the consistency of
semantic structures between the fusion and source images. Owing to these two
effective modules, our method is able to generate high-quality fusion images
from pairs of infrared and visible images, which can boost the performance of
downstream computer-vision tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art image fusion
methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code for
our method, along with additional comparison results, will be made available
at: https://github.com/QiaoYang-CV/SSPFUSION.

<p class="mathjax">Third-party cookies have been a privacy concern since cookies were first
developed in the mid 1990s, but more strict cookie policies were only
introduced by Internet browser vendors in the early 2010s. More recently, due
to regulatory changes, browser vendors have started to completely block
third-party cookies, with both Firefox and Safari already compliant.
<br />The Topics API is being proposed by Google as an additional and less
intrusive source of information for interest-based advertising (IBA), following
the upcoming deprecation of third-party cookies. Initial results published by
Google estimate the probability of a correct re-identification of a random
individual would be below 3% while still supporting IBA.
<br />In this paper, we analyze the re-identification risk for individual Internet
users introduced by the Topics API from the perspective of Quantitative
Information Flow (QIF), an information- and decision-theoretic framework. Our
model allows a theoretical analysis of both privacy and utility aspects of the
API and their trade-off, and we show that the Topics API does have better
privacy than third-party cookies. We leave the utility analyses for future
work.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake images are fast becoming a serious concern due to their realism.
Diffusion models have recently demonstrated highly realistic visual content
generation, which makes them an excellent potential tool for Deepfake
generation. To curb their exploitation for Deepfakes, it is imperative to first
explore the extent to which diffusion models can be used to generate realistic
content that is controllable with convenient prompts. This paper devises and
explores a novel method in that regard. Our technique alters the popular stable
diffusion model to generate a controllable high-quality Deepfake image with
text and image prompts. In addition, the original stable model lacks severely
in generating quality images that contain multiple persons. The modified
diffusion model is able to address this problem, it add input anchor image's
latent at the beginning of inferencing rather than Gaussian random latent as
input. Hence, we focus on generating forged content for celebrity interactions,
which may be used to spread rumors. We also apply Dreambooth to enhance the
realism of our fake images. Dreambooth trains the pairing of center words and
specific features to produce more refined and personalized output images. Our
results show that with the devised scheme, it is possible to create fake visual
content with alarming realism, such that the content can serve as believable
evidence of meetings between powerful political figures.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents PathFinder and PathFinderPlus, two novel end-to-end
computer vision frameworks designed specifically for advanced setting strategy
classification in volleyball matches from a single camera view. Our frameworks
combine setting ball trajectory recognition with a novel set trajectory
classifier to generate comprehensive and advanced statistical data. This
approach offers a fresh perspective for in-game analysis and surpasses the
current level of granularity in volleyball statistics. In comparison to
existing methods used in our baseline PathFinder framework, our proposed ball
trajectory detection methodology in PathFinderPlus exhibits superior
performance for classifying setting tactics under various game conditions. This
robustness is particularly advantageous in handling complex game situations and
accommodating different camera angles. Additionally, our study introduces an
innovative algorithm for automatic identification of the opposing team's
right-side (opposite) hitter's current row (front or back) during gameplay,
providing critical insights for tactical analysis. The successful demonstration
of our single-camera system's feasibility and benefits makes high-level
technical analysis accessible to volleyball enthusiasts of all skill levels and
resource availability. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of our system
allows for real-time deployment, enabling in-game strategy analysis and
on-the-spot gameplan adjustments.

<p class="mathjax">Image denoising is a fundamental task in low-level computer vision. While
recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have achieved impressive
performance, they are black-box models and the underlying denoising principle
remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image denoising
that offers both clear denoising mechanism and good performance. We view noise
as a type of image style and remove it by incorporating noise-free styles
derived from clean images. To achieve this, we design novel losses and network
modules to extract noisy styles from noisy images and noise-free styles from
clean images. The noise-free style induces low-response activations for noise
features and high-response activations for content features in the feature
space. This leads to the separation of clean contents from noise, effectively
denoising the image. Unlike disentanglement-based image editing tasks that edit
semantic-level attributes using styles, our main contribution lies in editing
pixel-level attributes through global noise-free styles. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic noise removal and real-world image denoising datasets
(SIDD and DND), demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in terms of both
PSNR and SSIM metrics. Moreover, we experimentally validate that our method
offers good interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in diffusion models have led to a quantum leap in the quality
of generative visual content. However, quantification of realism of the content
is still challenging. Existing evaluation metrics, such as Inception Score and
Fr\'echet inception distance, fall short on benchmarking diffusion models due
to the versatility of the generated images. Moreover, they are not designed to
quantify realism of an individual image. This restricts their application in
forensic image analysis, which is becoming increasingly important in the
emerging era of generative models. To address that, we first propose a metric,
called Image Realism Score (IRS), computed from five statistical measures of a
given image. This non-learning based metric not only efficiently quantifies
realism of the generated images, it is readily usable as a measure to classify
a given image as real or fake. We experimentally establish the model- and
data-agnostic nature of the proposed IRS by successfully detecting fake images
generated by Stable Diffusion Model (SDM), Dalle2, Midjourney and BigGAN.
<br />We further leverage this attribute of our metric to minimize an IRS-augmented
generative loss of SDM, and demonstrate a convenient yet considerable quality
improvement of the SDM-generated content with our modification. Our efforts
have also led to Gen-100 dataset, which provides 1,000 samples for 100 classes
generated by four high-quality models. We will release the dataset and code.

<p class="mathjax">In many massive IoT communication scenarios, the IoT devices require coverage
from dynamic units that can move close to the IoT devices and reduce the uplink
energy consumption. A robust solution is to deploy a large number of UAVs (UAV
swarm) to provide coverage and a better line of sight (LoS) for the IoT
network. However, the study of these massive IoT scenarios with a massive
number of serving units leads to high dimensional problems with high
complexity. In this paper, we apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to
address the high-dimensional problem that results from deploying a swarm of
UAVs to collect fresh information from IoT devices. The target is to minimize
the overall age of information in the IoT network. The results reveal that both
cooperative and partially cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
approaches are able to outperform the high-complexity centralized deep
reinforcement learning approach, which stands helpless in large-scale networks.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel framework for rectifying occlusions and distortions in
degraded texture samples from natural images. Traditional texture synthesis
approaches focus on generating textures from pristine samples, which
necessitate meticulous preparation by humans and are often unattainable in most
natural images. These challenges stem from the frequent occlusions and
distortions of texture samples in natural images due to obstructions and
variations in object surface geometry. To address these issues, we propose a
framework that synthesizes holistic textures from degraded samples in natural
images, extending the applicability of exemplar-based texture synthesis
techniques. Our framework utilizes a conditional Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)
with a novel occlusion-aware latent transformer. This latent transformer not
only effectively encodes texture features from partially-observed samples
necessary for the generation process of the LDM, but also explicitly captures
long-range dependencies in samples with large occlusions. To train our model,
we introduce a method for generating synthetic data by applying geometric
transformations and free-form mask generation to clean textures. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods both quantitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the different components of our
proposed framework. Results are corroborated by a perceptual user study which
highlights the efficiency of our proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Programmers often struggle to identify and fix bugs in their programs. In
recent years, many language models (LMs) have been proposed to fix erroneous
programs and support error recovery. However, the LMs tend to generate
solutions that differ from the original input programs. This leads to potential
comprehension difficulties for users. In this paper, we propose an approach to
suggest a correct program with minimal repair edits using CodeT5. We fine-tune
a pre-trained CodeT5 on code pairs of wrong and correct programs and evaluate
its performance with several baseline models. The experimental results show
that the fine-tuned CodeT5 achieves a pass@100 of 91.95% and an average edit
distance of the most similar correct program of 6.84, which indicates that at
least one correct program can be suggested by generating 100 candidate
programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LMs in suggesting program repair
with minimal edits for solving introductory programming problems.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning necessitates the continual adaptation of models to newly
emerging tasks while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting of old ones. This
is extremely challenging for large language models (LLMs) with vanilla
full-parameter tuning due to high computation costs, memory consumption, and
forgetting issue. Inspired by the success of parameter-efficient tuning (PET),
we propose Continual Parameter-Efficient Tuning (ConPET), a generalizable
paradigm for continual task adaptation of LLMs with task-number-independent
training complexity. ConPET includes two versions with different application
scenarios. First, Static ConPET can adapt former continual learning methods
originally designed for relatively smaller models to LLMs through PET and a
dynamic replay strategy, which largely reduces the tuning costs and alleviates
the over-fitting and forgetting issue. Furthermore, to maintain scalability,
Dynamic ConPET adopts separate PET modules for different tasks and a PET module
selector for dynamic optimal selection. In our extensive experiments, the
adaptation of Static ConPET helps multiple former methods reduce the scale of
tunable parameters by over 3,000 times and surpass the PET-only baseline by at
least 5 points on five smaller benchmarks, while Dynamic ConPET gains its
advantage on the largest dataset. The codes and datasets are available at
https://github.com/Raincleared-Song/ConPET.

<p class="mathjax">Most current gait recognition methods suffer from poor interpretability and
high computational cost. To improve interpretability, we investigate gait
features in the embedding space based on Koopman operator theory. The
transition matrix in this space captures complex kinematic features of gait
cycles, namely the Koopman operator. The diagonal elements of the operator
matrix can represent the overall motion trend, providing a physically
meaningful descriptor. To reduce the computational cost of our algorithm, we
use a reversible autoencoder to reduce the model size and eliminate
convolutional layers to compress its depth, resulting in fewer floating-point
operations. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method
reduces computational cost to 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods while
achieving competitive recognition accuracy 98% on non-occlusion datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-label learning has emerged as a crucial paradigm in data analysis,
addressing scenarios where instances are associated with multiple class labels
simultaneously. With the growing prevalence of multi-label data across diverse
applications, such as text and image classification, the significance of
multi-label feature selection has become increasingly evident. This paper
presents a novel information-theoretical filter-based multi-label feature
selection, called ATR, with a new heuristic function. Incorporating a
combinations of algorithm adaptation and problem transformation approaches, ATR
ranks features considering individual labels as well as abstract label space
discriminative powers. Our experimental studies encompass twelve benchmarks
spanning various domains, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over
ten state-of-the-art information-theoretical filter-based multi-label feature
selection methods across six evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our experiments
affirm the scalability of ATR for benchmarks characterized by extensive feature
and label spaces. The codes are available at https://github.com/Sadegh28/ATR

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graph completion is a task that revolves around filling in missing
triples based on the information available in a knowledge graph. Among the
current studies, text-based methods complete the task by utilizing textual
descriptions of triples. However, this modeling approach may encounter
limitations, particularly when the description fails to accurately and
adequately express the intended meaning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose the augmentation of data through two additional mechanisms. Firstly, we
employ ChatGPT as an external knowledge base to generate coherent descriptions
to bridge the semantic gap between the queries and answers. Secondly, we
leverage inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby creating extra
labeling and providing supplementary information for link prediction. This
approach offers additional insights into the relationships between entities.
Through these efforts, we have observed significant improvements in knowledge
graph completion, as these mechanisms enhance the richness and diversity of the
available data, leading to more accurate results.

paper, we demonstrate that factual knowledge is imperative for the performance

factual knowledge derived from the selected in-context examples, and the
knowledge biases in LLMs for output generation. To unleash the power of LLMs in

factual knowledge to LLMs during continual self-supervised pre-training, 2)
judiciously selecting the examples with high knowledge relevance, and 3)
calibrating the prediction results based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the
proposed approaches on auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., GPT-style models) over
multiple text classification and question answering tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that KICT substantially outperforms strong baselines, and improves

<p class="mathjax">This study aims to explore efficient tuning methods for the screenshot
captioning task. Recently, image captioning has seen significant advancements,
but research in captioning tasks for mobile screens remains relatively scarce.
Current datasets and use cases describing user behaviors within product
screenshots are notably limited. Consequently, we sought to fine-tune
pre-existing models for the screenshot captioning task. However, fine-tuning
large pre-trained models can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable
time, computational power, and storage due to the vast number of parameters in
image captioning models. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a
combination of adapter methods, which necessitates tuning only the additional
modules on the model. These methods are originally designed for vision or
language tasks, and our intention is to apply them to address similar
challenges in screenshot captioning. By freezing the parameters of the image
caption models and training only the weights associated with the methods,
performance comparable to fine-tuning the entire model can be achieved, while
significantly reducing the number of parameters. This study represents the
first comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of combining adapters
within the context of the screenshot captioning task. Through our experiments
and analyses, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the application
of adapters in vision-language models and contribute to the development of
efficient tuning techniques for the screenshot captioning task. Our study is

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic optimization methods such as mirror descent have wide applications
due to low computational cost. Those methods have been well studied under
assumption of the independent and identical distribution, and usually achieve
sublinear rate of convergence. However, this assumption may be too strong and
unpractical in real application scenarios. Recent researches investigate
stochastic gradient descent when instances are sampled from a Markov chain.
Unfortunately, few results are known for stochastic mirror descent. In the
paper, we propose a new version of stochastic mirror descent termed by MarchOn
in the scenario of the federated learning. Given a distributed network, the
model iteratively travels from a node to one of its neighbours randomly.
Furthermore, we propose a new framework to analyze MarchOn, which yields best
rates of convergence for convex, strongly convex, and non-convex loss. Finally,
we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the convergence of MarchOn, and
validate theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Domain-specific text classification faces the challenge of scarce labeled
data due to the high cost of manual labeling. Prompt-learning, known for its
efficiency in few-shot scenarios, is proposed as an alternative to traditional
fine-tuning methods. And besides, although large language models (LLMs) have
gained prominence, small language models (SLMs, with under 1B parameters) offer
significant customizability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness for
domain-specific tasks, given industry constraints. In this study, we
investigate the potential of SLMs combined with prompt-learning paradigm for
domain-specific text classification, specifically within customer-agent
interactions in retail. Our evaluations show that, in few-shot settings when
prompt-based model fine-tuning is possible, T5-base, a typical SLM with 220M
parameters, achieve approximately 75% accuracy with limited labeled data (up to
15% of full data), which shows great potentials of SLMs with prompt-learning.
Based on this, We further validate the effectiveness of active few-shot
sampling and the ensemble strategy in the prompt-learning pipeline that
contribute to a remarkable performance gain. Besides, in zero-shot settings
with a fixed model, we underscore a pivotal observation that, although the
GPT-3.5-turbo equipped with around 154B parameters garners an accuracy of
55.16%, the power of well designed prompts becomes evident when the
FLAN-T5-large, a model with a mere 0.5% of GPT-3.5-turbo's parameters, achieves
an accuracy exceeding 31% with the optimized prompt, a leap from its sub-18%
performance with an unoptimized one. Our findings underscore the promise of
prompt-learning in classification tasks with SLMs, emphasizing the benefits of
active few-shot sampling, and ensemble strategies in few-shot settings, and the
importance of prompt engineering in zero-shot settings.

<p class="mathjax">Change detection in satellite imagery seeks to find occurrences of targeted
changes in a given scene taken at different instants. This task has several
applications ranging from land-cover mapping, to anthropogenic activity
monitory as well as climate change and natural hazard damage assessment.
However, change detection is highly challenging due to the acquisition
conditions and also to the subjectivity of changes. In this paper, we devise a
novel algorithm for change detection based on active learning. The proposed
method is based on a question and answer model that probes an oracle (user)
about the relevance of changes only on a small set of critical images (referred
to as virtual exemplars), and according to oracle's responses updates deep
neural network (DNN) classifiers. The main contribution resides in a novel
adversarial model that allows learning the most representative, diverse and
uncertain virtual exemplars (as inverted preimages of the trained DNNs) that
challenge (the most) the trained DNNs, and this leads to a better re-estimate
of these networks in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experiments
show the out-performance of our proposed deep-net inversion against the related
work.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) is a task that aims to detect
the most salient object in a video without external guidance about the object.
To leverage the property that salient objects usually have distinctive
movements compared to the background, recent methods collaboratively use motion
cues extracted from optical flow maps with appearance cues extracted from RGB
images. However, as optical flow maps are usually very relevant to segmentation
masks, the network is easy to be learned overly dependent on the motion cues
during network training. As a result, such two-stream approaches are vulnerable
to confusing motion cues, making their prediction unstable. To relieve this
issue, we design a novel motion-as-option network by treating motion cues as
optional. During network training, RGB images are randomly provided to the
motion encoder instead of optical flow maps, to implicitly reduce motion
dependency of the network. As the learned motion encoder can deal with both RGB
images and optical flow maps, two different predictions can be generated
depending on which source information is used as motion input. In order to
fully exploit this property, we also propose an adaptive output selection
algorithm to adopt optimal prediction result at test time. Our proposed
approach affords state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmark datasets,
even maintaining real-time inference speed.

<p class="mathjax">We study the online variant of the language distance problem for two
classical formal languages, the language of palindromes and the language of
squares, and for the two most fundamental distances, the Hamming distance and
the edit (Levenshtein) distance. In this problem, defined for a fixed formal
language $L$, we are given a string $T$ of length $n$, and the task is to
compute the minimal distance to $L$ from every prefix of $T$. We focus on the
low-distance regime, where one must compute only the distances smaller than a
given threshold $k$. In this work, our contribution is twofold:
<br />- First, we show streaming algorithms, which access the input string $T$ only
through a single left-to-right scan. Both for palindromes and squares, our
algorithms use $O(k \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time per character in
the Hamming-distance case and $O(k^2 \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time
per character in the edit-distance case. These algorithms are randomised by
necessity, and they err with probability inverse-polynomial in $n$.
<br />- Second, we show deterministic read-only online algorithms, which are also
provided with read-only random access to the already processed characters of
$T$. Both for palindromes and squares, our algorithms use $O(k
\cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time per character in the
Hamming-distance case and $O(k^4 \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and
amortised time per character in the edit-distance case.

<p class="mathjax">In many multi-agent and high-dimensional robotic tasks, the controller can be
designed in either a centralized or decentralized way. Correspondingly, it is
possible to use either single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) or
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods to learn such controllers.
However, the relationship between these two paradigms remains under-studied in
the literature. This work explores research questions in terms of robustness
and performance of SARL and MARL approaches to the same task, in order to gain
insight into the most suitable methods. We start by analytically showing the
equivalence between these two paradigms under the full-state observation
assumption. Then, we identify a broad subclass of \textit{Dec-POMDP} tasks
where the agents are weakly or partially interacting. In these tasks, we show
that partial observations of each agent are sufficient for near-optimal
decision-making. Furthermore, we propose to exploit such partially observable
MARL to improve the robustness of robots when joint or agent failures occur.
Our experiments on both simulated multi-agent tasks and a real robot task with
a mobile manipulator validate the presented insights and the effectiveness of
the proposed robust robot learning method via partially observable MARL.

intersections safely. Autonomous vehicles commonly rely on High Definition (HD)
maps that contain information about the assignment of traffic lights to lanes.
The manual provisioning of this information is tedious, expensive, and not
scalable. To remedy these issues, our novel approach derives the assignments
from traffic light states and the corresponding motion patterns of vehicle
traffic. This works in an automated way and independently of the geometric
arrangement. We show the effectiveness of basic statistical approaches for this
task by implementing and evaluating a pattern-based contribution method. In
addition, our novel rejection method includes accompanying safety
considerations by leveraging statistical hypothesis testing. Finally, we
propose a dataset transformation to re-purpose available motion prediction

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to track proficiency based on a question-solving
history, allowing us to offer a streamlined curriculum. Recent studies actively
utilize attention-based mechanisms to capture the correlation between questions
and combine it with the learner's characteristics for responses. However, our
empirical study shows that existing attention-based KT models neglect the
learner's forgetting behavior, especially as the interaction history becomes
longer. This problem arises from the bias that overprioritizes the correlation
of questions while inadvertently ignoring the impact of forgetting behavior.
This paper proposes a simple-yet-effective solution, namely Forgetting-aware
Linear Bias (FoLiBi), to reflect forgetting behavior as a linear bias. Despite
its simplicity, FoLiBi is readily equipped with existing attentive KT models by
effectively decomposing question correlations with forgetting behavior. FoLiBi
plugged with several KT models yields a consistent improvement of up to 2.58%
in AUC over state-of-the-art KT models on four benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Generating geometric 3D reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
is of great interest. However, accurate and complete reconstructions based on
the density values are challenging. The network output depends on input data,
NeRF network configuration and hyperparameter. As a result, the direct usage of
density values, e.g. via filtering with global density thresholds, usually
requires empirical investigations. Under the assumption that the density
increases from non-object to object area, the utilization of density gradients
from relative values is evident. As the density represents a position-dependent
parameter it can be handled anisotropically, therefore processing of the
voxelized 3D density field is justified. In this regard, we address geometric
3D reconstructions based on density gradients, whereas the gradients result
from 3D edge detection filters of the first and second derivatives, namely
Sobel, Canny and Laplacian of Gaussian. The gradients rely on relative
neighboring density values in all directions, thus are independent from
absolute magnitudes. Consequently, gradient filters are able to extract edges
along a wide density range, almost independent from assumptions and empirical
investigations. Our approach demonstrates the capability to achieve geometric
3D reconstructions with high geometric accuracy on object surfaces and
remarkable object completeness. Notably, Canny filter effectively eliminates
gaps, delivers a uniform point density, and strikes a favorable balance between
correctness and completeness across the scenes.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the flow of a fluid whose response characteristics change due the
value of the norm of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient, behaving as
an Euler fluid below a critical value and as a Navier-Stokes fluid at and above
the critical value, the norm being determined by the external stimuli. We show
that such a fluid, while flowing past a bluff body, develops boundary layers
which are practically identical to those that one encounters within the context
of the classical boundary layer theory propounded by Prandtl. Unlike the
classical boundary layer theory that arises as an approximation within the
context of the Navier-Stokes theory, here the development of boundary layers is
due to a change in the response characteristics of the constitutive relation.
We study the flow of such a fluid past an airfoil and compare the same against
the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We find that the results are in
excellent agreement with regard to the velocity and vorticity fields for the
two cases.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has boosted performance and
possibilities in various NLP tasks. While the usage of generative AI models
like ChatGPT opens up new opportunities for several business use cases, their
current tendency to hallucinate fake content strongly limits their
applicability to document analysis, such as information retrieval from
documents. In contrast, extractive language models like question answering (QA)
or passage retrieval models guarantee query results to be found within the
boundaries of an according context document, which makes them candidates for
more reliable information extraction in productive environments of companies.
In this work we propose an approach that uses and integrates extractive QA
models for improved feature extraction of German business documents such as
insurance reports or medical leaflets into a document analysis solution. We
further show that fine-tuning existing German QA models boosts performance for
tailored extraction tasks of complex linguistic features like damage cause
explanations or descriptions of medication appearance, even with using only a
small set of annotated data. Finally, we discuss the relevance of scoring
metrics for evaluating information extraction tasks and deduce a combined
metric from Levenshtein distance, F1-Score, Exact Match and ROUGE-L to mimic
the assessment criteria from human experts.

<p class="mathjax">Finger vein pattern recognition is an emerging biometric with a good
resistance to presentation attacks and low error rates. One problem is that it
is hard to obtain ground truth finger vein patterns from live fingers. In this
paper we propose an advanced method to create finger vein phantoms using 3D
printing where we mimic the optical properties of the various tissues inside
the fingers, like bone, veins and soft tissues using different printing
materials and parameters. We demonstrate that we are able to create finger
phantoms that result in realistic finger vein images and precisely known vein
patterns. These phantoms can be used to develop and evaluate finger vein
extraction and recognition methods. In addition, we show that the finger vein
phantoms can be used to spoof a finger vein recognition system. This paper is

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models have become increasingly popular for predicting the
results of soccer matches, however, the lack of publicly-available benchmark
datasets has made model evaluation challenging. The 2023 Soccer Prediction
Challenge required the prediction of match results first in terms of the exact
goals scored by each team, and second, in terms of the probabilities for a win,
draw, and loss. The original training set of matches and features, which was
provided for the competition, was augmented with additional matches that were
played between 4 April and 13 April 2023, representing the period after which
the training set ended, but prior to the first matches that were to be
predicted (upon which the performance was evaluated). A CatBoost model was
employed using pi-ratings as the features, which were initially identified as
the optimal choice for calculating the win/draw/loss probabilities. Notably,
deep learning models have frequently been disregarded in this particular task.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the performance of a deep learning
model and determine the optimal feature set for a gradient-boosted tree model.
The model was trained using the most recent five years of data, and three
training and validation sets were used in a hyperparameter grid search. The
results from the validation sets show that our model had strong performance and
stability compared to previously published models from the 2017 Soccer
Prediction Challenge for win/draw/loss prediction.

<p class="mathjax">In continual learning, many classifiers use softmax function to learn
confidence. However, numerous studies have pointed out its inability to
accurately determine confidence distributions for outliers, often referred to
as epistemic uncertainty. This inherent limitation also curtails the accurate
decisions for selecting what to forget and keep in previously trained
confidence distributions over continual learning process. To address the issue,
we revisit the effects of masking softmax function. While this method is both
simple and prevalent in literature, its implication for retaining confidence
distribution during continual learning, also known as stability, has been
under-investigated. In this paper, we revisit the impact of softmax masking,
and introduce a methodology to utilize its confidence preservation effects. In
class- and task-incremental learning benchmarks with and without memory replay,
our approach significantly increases stability while maintaining sufficiently
large plasticity. In the end, our methodology shows better overall performance
than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the use with zero or small
memory. This lays a simple and effective foundation of strongly stable
replay-based continual learning.

Academia and industry are focusing their effort on the development and
standardization of the next generations of mobile networks, i.e., 5G-Advance
and 6G. Beyond 5G networks will revolutionize communications systems providing
seamless connectivity, both in time and in space, to a unique ecosystem
consisting of the convergence of the digital, physical, and human domains. In
this scenario, NonTerrestrial Networks (NTN) will play a crucial role by
providing ubiquitous, secure, and resilient infrastructure fully integrated
into the overall system. The additional network complexity introduced by the
third dimension of the architecture requires the interoperability of different
network elements, enabled by the disaggregation and virtualization of network
components, their interconnection by standard interfaces and orchestration by
data-driven network artificial intelligence. The disaggregation paradigm
foresees the division of the radio access network in different virtualized
block of functions, introducing the concept of functional split. Wisely
selecting the RAN functional split is possible to better exploit the system
resources, obtaining costs saving, and to increase the system performances. In
this paper, we firstly provide a discussion of the current 6G NTN development
in terms of architectural solutions and then, we thoroughly analyze the impact
of the typical NTN channel impairments on the available functional splits.
Finally, the benefits of introducing the dynamic optimization of the functional

<p class="mathjax">The difference between the chronological and biological brain age of a
subject can be an important biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, thus
brain age estimation can be crucial in clinical settings. One way to
incorporate multimodal information into this estimation is through population
graphs, which combine various types of imaging data and capture the
associations among individuals within a population. In medical imaging,
population graphs have demonstrated promising results, mostly for
classification tasks. In most cases, the graph structure is pre-defined and
remains static during training. However, extracting population graphs is a
non-trivial task and can significantly impact the performance of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), which are sensitive to the graph structure. In this work, we
highlight the importance of a meaningful graph construction and experiment with
different population-graph construction methods and their effect on GNN
performance on brain age estimation. We use the homophily metric and graph
visualizations to gain valuable quantitative and qualitative insights on the
extracted graph structures. For the experimental evaluation, we leverage the UK
Biobank dataset, which offers many imaging and non-imaging phenotypes. Our
results indicate that architectures highly sensitive to the graph structure,
such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT),
struggle with low homophily graphs, while other architectures, such as
GraphSage and Chebyshev, are more robust across different homophily ratios. We
conclude that static graph construction approaches are potentially insufficient
for the task of brain age estimation and make recommendations for alternative
research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proven beneficial for mitigating the
issue of limited labeled data especially on the task of volumetric medical
image segmentation. Unlike previous SSL methods which focus on exploring highly
confident pseudo-labels or developing consistency regularization schemes, our
empirical findings suggest that inconsistent decoder features emerge naturally
when two decoders strive to generate consistent predictions. Based on the
observation, we first analyze the treasure of discrepancy in learning towards
consistency, under both pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization
settings, and subsequently propose a novel SSL method called LeFeD, which
learns the feature-level discrepancy obtained from two decoders, by feeding the
discrepancy as a feedback signal to the encoder. The core design of LeFeD is to
enlarge the difference by training differentiated decoders, and then learn from
the inconsistent information iteratively. We evaluate LeFeD against eight
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public datasets. Experiments show
LeFeD surpasses competitors without any bells and whistles such as uncertainty
estimation and strong constraints, as well as setting a new state-of-the-art
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Three-dimensional tracking of multiple objects from multiple views has a wide
range of applications, especially in the study of bio-cluster behavior which
requires precise trajectories of research objects. However, there are
significant temporal-spatial association uncertainties when the objects are
similar to each other, frequently maneuver, and cluster in large numbers.
Aiming at such a multi-view multi-object 3D tracking scenario, a current
statistical model based Kalman particle filter (CSKPF) method is proposed
following the Bayesian tracking-while-reconstruction framework. The CSKPF
algorithm predicts the objects' states and estimates the objects' state
covariance by the current statistical model to importance particle sampling
efficiency, and suppresses the measurement noise by the Kalman filter. The
simulation experiments prove that the CSKPF method can improve the tracking
integrity, continuity, and precision compared with the existing constant
velocity based particle filter (CVPF) method. The real experiment on fruitfly
clusters also confirms the effectiveness of the CSKPF method.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing has emerged as a popular cloud deployment paradigm. In
serverless, the developers implement their application as a set of chained
functions that form a workflow in which functions invoke each other. The cloud
providers are responsible for automatically scaling the number of instances for
each function on demand and forwarding the requests in a workflow to the
appropriate function instance. Problematically, today's serverless clouds lack
efficient support for cross-function data transfers in a workflow, preventing
the efficient execution of data-intensive serverless applications. In
production clouds, functions transmit intermediate, i.e., ephemeral, data to
other functions either as part of invocation HTTP requests (i.e., inline) or
via third-party services, such as AWS S3 storage or AWS ElastiCache in-memory
cache. The former approach is restricted to small transfer sizes, while the
latter supports arbitrary transfers but suffers from performance and cost
overheads. This work introduces Expedited Data Transfers (XDT), an
API-preserving high-performance data communication method for serverless that
enables direct function-to-function transfers. With XDT, a trusted component of
the sender function buffers the payload in its memory and sends a secure
reference to the receiver, which is picked by the load balancer and autoscaler
based on the current load. Using the reference, the receiver instance pulls the
transmitted data directly from the sender's memory. XDT is natively compatible
with existing autoscaling infrastructure, preserves function invocation
semantics, is secure, and avoids the cost and performance overheads of using an
intermediate service for data transfers. We prototype our system in
vHive/Knative deployed on a cluster of AWS EC2 nodes, showing that XDT improves
latency, bandwidth, and cost over AWS S3 and ElasticCache.

<p class="mathjax">Streaming Machine Translation (MT) is the task of translating an unbounded
input text stream in real-time. The traditional cascade approach, which
combines an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and an MT system, relies on an
intermediate segmentation step which splits the transcription stream into
sentence-like units. However, the incorporation of a hard segmentation
constrains the MT system and is a source of errors. This paper proposes a
Segmentation-Free framework that enables the model to translate an unsegmented
source stream by delaying the segmentation decision until the translation has
been generated. Extensive experiments show how the proposed Segmentation-Free
framework has better quality-latency trade-off than competing approaches that
use an independent segmentation model. Software, data and models will be
released upon paper acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Active stereo technique using single pattern projection, a.k.a. one-shot 3D
scan, have drawn a wide attention from industry, medical purposes, etc. One
severe drawback of one-shot 3D scan is sparse reconstruction. In addition,
since spatial pattern becomes complicated for the purpose of efficient
embedding, it is easily affected by noise, which results in unstable decoding.
To solve the problems, we propose a pixel-wise interpolation technique for
one-shot scan, which is applicable to any types of static pattern if the
pattern is regular and periodic. This is achieved by U-net which is pre-trained
by CG with efficient data augmentation algorithm. In the paper, to further
overcome the decoding instability, we propose a robust correspondence finding
algorithm based on Markov random field (MRF) optimization. We also propose a
shape refinement algorithm based on b-spline and Gaussian kernel interpolation
using explicitly detected laser curves. Experiments are conducted to show the
effectiveness of the proposed method using real data with strong noises and
textures.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a structured prediction approach for robot imitation learning from
demonstrations. Among various tools for robot imitation learning, supervised
learning has been observed to have a prominent role. Structured prediction is a
form of supervised learning that enables learning models to operate on output
spaces with complex structures. Through the lens of structured prediction, we
show how robots can learn to imitate trajectories belonging to not only
Euclidean spaces but also Riemannian manifolds. Exploiting ideas from
information theory, we propose a class of loss functions based on the
f-divergence to measure the information loss between the demonstrated and
reproduced probabilistic trajectories. Different types of f-divergence will
result in different policies, which we call imitation modes. Furthermore, our
approach enables the incorporation of spatial and temporal trajectory
modulation, which is necessary for robots to be adaptive to the change in
working conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods
in terms of trajectory reproduction and adaptation. The quantitative evaluation
shows that our approach outperforms other algorithms regarding both accuracy
and efficiency. We also report real-world experimental results on learning
manifold trajectories in a polishing task with a KUKA LWR robot arm,
illustrating the effectiveness of our algorithmic framework.

<p class="mathjax">IC3 is a famous bit-level framework for safety verification. By incorporating
datapath abstraction, a notable enhancement in the efficiency of hardware
verification can be achieved. However, datapath abstraction entails a coarse
level of abstraction where all datapath operations are approximated as
uninterpreted functions. This level of abstraction, albeit useful, can lead to
an increased computational burden during the verification process as it
necessitates extensive exploration of redundant abstract state space.
<br />In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called datapath propagation. Our
method involves leveraging concrete constant values to iteratively compute the
outcomes of relevant datapath operations and their associated uninterpreted
functions. Meanwhile, we generate potentially useful datapath propagation
lemmas in abstract state space and tighten the datapath abstraction. With this
technique, the abstract state space can be reduced, and the verification
efficiency is significantly improved. We implemented the proposed approach and
conducted extensive experiments. The results show promising improvements of our
approach compared to the state-of-the-art verifiers.

<p class="mathjax">To support humans in their daily lives, robots are required to autonomously
learn, adapt to objects and environments, and perform the appropriate actions.
We tackled on the task of cooking scrambled eggs using real ingredients, in
which the robot needs to perceive the states of the egg and adjust stirring
movement in real time, while the egg is heated and the state changes
continuously. In previous works, handling changing objects was found to be
challenging because sensory information includes dynamical, both important or
noisy information, and the modality which should be focused on changes every
time, making it difficult to realize both perception and motion generation in
real time. We propose a predictive recurrent neural network with an attention
mechanism that can weigh the sensor input, distinguishing how important and
reliable each modality is, that realize quick and efficient perception and
motion generation. The model is trained with learning from the demonstration,
and allows the robot to acquire human-like skills. We validated the proposed
technique using the robot, Dry-AIREC, and with our learning model, it could
perform cooking eggs with unknown ingredients. The robot could change the
method of stirring and direction depending on the status of the egg, as in the
beginning it stirs in the whole pot, then subsequently, after the egg started
being heated, it starts flipping and splitting motion targeting specific areas,
although we did not explicitly indicate them.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge distillation (KD) is used to enhance automatic speaker verification
performance by ensuring consistency between large teacher networks and
lightweight student networks at the embedding level or label level. However,
the conventional label-level KD overlooks the significant knowledge from
non-target speakers, particularly their classification probabilities, which can
be crucial for automatic speaker verification. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that leveraging a larger number of training non-target speakers
improves the performance of automatic speaker verification models. Inspired by
this finding about the importance of non-target speakers' knowledge, we
modified the conventional label-level KD by disentangling and emphasizing the
classification probabilities of non-target speakers during knowledge
distillation. The proposed method is applied to three different student model
architectures and achieves an average of 13.67% improvement in EER on the
VoxCeleb dataset compared to embedding-level and conventional label-level KD

particularly in high-dimensional state space. Among the whole process of the
path planning, collision detection is the most time-consuming operation. In
this paper, we propose a learning-based path planning method that aims to
reduce the number of collision detection. We develop an efficient neural
network model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and use the environment map
as input. The model outputs weights for each neighbor based on the input and
current vertex information, which are used to guide the planner in avoiding
obstacles. We evaluate the proposed method's efficiency through simulated
random worlds and real-world experiments, respectively. The results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of collision
detection and improves the path planning speed in high-dimensional
environments.

<p class="mathjax">Tor, one of the most popular censorship circumvention systems, faces regular
blocking attempts by censors. Thus, to facilitate access, it relies on
"pluggable transports" (PTs) that disguise Tor's traffic and make it hard for
the adversary to block Tor. However, these are not yet well studied and
compared for the performance they provide to the users. Thus, we conduct a
first comparative performance evaluation of a total of 12 PTs -- the ones
currently supported by the Tor project and those that can be integrated in the
future.
<br />Our results reveal multiple facets of the PT ecosystem. (1) PTs' download
time significantly varies even under similar network conditions. (2) All PTs
are not equally reliable. Thus, clients who regularly suffer censorship may
falsely believe that such PTs are blocked. (3) PT performance depends on the
underlying communication primitive. (4) PTs performance significantly depends
on the website access method (browser or command-line). Surprisingly, for some
PTs, website access time was even less than vanilla Tor.
<br />Based on our findings from more than 1.25M measurements, we provide
recommendations about selecting PTs and believe that our study can facilitate
access for users who face censorship.

regarding the dataset under consideration. We propose a novel method to
generate informative embeddings which not only factor out the structure
associated with different kinds of prior knowledge but also aim to reveal any
remaining underlying structure. To achieve this, we employ a linear combination
of two objectives: firstly, contrastive PCA that discounts the structure
associated with the prior information, and secondly, kurtosis projection
pursuit which ensures meaningful data separation in the obtained embeddings. We
formulate this task as a manifold optimization problem and validate it
empirically across a variety of datasets considering three distinct types of
prior knowledge. Lastly, we provide an automated framework to perform iterative
visual exploration of high-dimensional data.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image generative models have garnered immense attention for their
ability to produce high-fidelity images from text prompts. Among these, Stable
Diffusion distinguishes itself as a leading open-source model in this
fast-growing field. However, the intricacies of fine-tuning these models pose
multiple challenges from new methodology integration to systematic evaluation.
Addressing these issues, this paper introduces LyCORIS (Lora beYond
Conventional methods, Other Rank adaptation Implementations for Stable
diffusion) [https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS], an open-source library
that offers a wide selection of fine-tuning methodologies for Stable Diffusion.
Furthermore, we present a thorough framework for the systematic assessment of
varied fine-tuning techniques. This framework employs a diverse suite of
metrics and delves into multiple facets of fine-tuning, including
hyperparameter adjustments and the evaluation with different prompt types
across various concept categories. Through this comprehensive approach, our
work provides essential insights into the nuanced effects of fine-tuning
parameters, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art research and practical
application.

<p class="mathjax">Dexterous manipulation through imitation learning has gained significant
attention in robotics research. The collection of high-quality expert data
holds paramount importance when using imitation learning. The existing
approaches for acquiring expert data commonly involve utilizing a data glove to
capture hand motion information. However, this method suffers from limitations
as the collected information cannot be directly mapped to the robotic hand due
to discrepancies in their degrees of freedom or structures. Furthermore,it
fails to accurately capture force feedback information between the hand and
objects during the demonstration process. To overcome these challenges, this
paper presents a novel solution in the form of a wearable dexterous hand,
namely Hand-over-hand Imitation learning wearable RObotic Hand (HIRO
Hand),which integrates expert data collection and enables the implementation of
dexterous operations. This HIRO Hand empowers the operator to utilize their own
tactile feedback to determine appropriate force, position, and actions,
resulting in more accurate imitation of the expert's actions. We develop both
non-learning and visual behavior cloning based controllers allowing HIRO Hand
successfully achieves grasping and in-hand manipulation ability.

acoustic reflections collected from an Autonomous Underwater Robot is
investigated in this paper. In field surveys of Cobalt-rich Manganese Crusts
(Mn-crusts), existing methods relies on visual confirmation of seafloor from
images and thickness measurements using the sub-bottom probe. Using these
visual classification results as ground truth, an autoencoder is trained to
extract latent features from bundled acoustic reflections. A Support Vector
Machine classifier is then trained to classify the latent space to idetify
seafloor classes. Results from data collected from seafloor at 1500m deep

<p class="mathjax">Current unsupervised 2D-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods do not work in
multi-person scenarios due to perspective ambiguity in monocular images.
Therefore, we present one of the first studies investigating the feasibility of
unsupervised multi-person 2D-3D HPE from just 2D poses alone, focusing on
reconstructing human interactions. To address the issue of perspective
ambiguity, we expand upon prior work by predicting the cameras' elevation angle
relative to the subjects' pelvis. This allows us to rotate the predicted poses
to be level with the ground plane, while obtaining an estimate for the vertical
offset in 3D between individuals. Our method involves independently lifting
each subject's 2D pose to 3D, before combining them in a shared 3D coordinate
system. The poses are then rotated and offset by the predicted elevation angle
before being scaled. This by itself enables us to retrieve an accurate 3D
reconstruction of their poses. We present our results on the CHI3D dataset,
introducing its use for unsupervised 2D-3D pose estimation with three new
quantitative metrics, and establishing a benchmark for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless time synchronization is one of the most important services in a
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are often used
in these WSNs in healthcare-related treatments. We present a low-power,
wirelessly synchronized multi-IMU platform. The proposed approach synchronously
captures packets from different IMUs and transmits the data over Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) to a central Data Capturing Unit (DCU). The contribution of this
work is, rather than focussing on the highest possible accuracy, to provide a
low-power accurate enough solution for use in a multi-IMU WSN. We examine key
factors affecting synchronization accuracy and elaborate on the implementation
challenges. An accuracy of sub 1 us can be achieved with the approach using
74.8 J/h of energy, while a power-optimized implementation is presented with an
accuracy of 200 us and an energy consumption of only 198 mJ/h. This approach
suits the required accuracy and low-power requirements for a multi-IMU system.

<p class="mathjax">Although many effective models and real-world datasets have been presented
for blind image quality assessment (BIQA), recent BIQA models usually tend to
fit specific training set. Hence, it is still difficult to accurately and
robustly measure the visual quality of an arbitrary real-world image. In this
paper, a robust BIQA method, is designed based on three aspects, i.e., robust
training strategy, large-scale real-world dataset, and powerful backbone.
First, many individual models based on popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA)
Swin-Transformer (SwinT) are trained on different real-world BIQA datasets
respectively. Then, these biased SwinT-based models are jointly used to
generate pseudo-labels, which adopts the probability of relative quality of two
random images instead of fixed quality score. A large-scale real-world image
dataset with 1,000,000 image pairs and pseudo-labels is then proposed for
training the final cross-dataset-robust model. Experimental results on
cross-dataset tests show that the performance of the proposed method is even
better than some SOTA methods that are directly trained on these datasets, thus
verifying the robustness and generalization of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Texture editing is a crucial task in 3D modeling that allows users to
automatically manipulate the surface materials of 3D models. However, the
inherent complexity of 3D models and the ambiguous text description lead to the
challenge in this task. To address this challenge, we propose ITEM3D, an
illumination-aware model for automatic 3D object editing according to the text
prompts. Leveraging the diffusion models and the differentiable rendering,
ITEM3D takes the rendered images as the bridge of text and 3D representation,
and further optimizes the disentangled texture and environment map. Previous
methods adopt the absolute editing direction namely score distillation sampling
(SDS) as the optimization objective, which unfortunately results in the noisy
appearance and text inconsistency. To solve the problem caused by the ambiguous
text, we introduce a relative editing direction, an optimization objective
defined by the noise difference between the source and target texts, to release
the semantic ambiguity between the texts and images. Additionally, we gradually
adjust the direction during optimization to further address the unexpected
deviation in the texture domain. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show
that our ITEM3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various 3D objects.
We also perform text-guided relighting to show explicit control over lighting.

serious attempt to contain its less desired effects. Among others the act
proposes audit as a mechanism and compliance products as tools for
organizations to demonstrate compliance. In this paper, a framework for
managing AI compliance, APPRAISE, is proposed. The framework is built upon the
rationale that driving a balance between generating shareholder value through
innovation in AI systems and managing compliance through organizational
processes will eventually result in value that is responsible. By adhering to
AIA compliance products, the framework operationalizes and hence safeguards
compliance. Furthermore, a two-phase experiment with a limited scope is
presented. The experiment aims to measure the extent to which companies
coordinate technical elements of AI systems to ultimately comply with the AIA.
In the first phase a survey is conducted and in the second phase the survey
results are validated with a couple of respondents to generate additional

<p class="mathjax">In an increasingly digitalized commerce landscape, the proliferation of
credit card fraud and the evolution of sophisticated fraudulent techniques have
led to substantial financial losses. Automating credit card fraud detection is
a viable way to accelerate detection, reducing response times and minimizing
potential financial losses. However, addressing this challenge is complicated
by the highly imbalanced nature of the datasets, where genuine transactions
vastly outnumber fraudulent ones. Furthermore, the high number of dimensions
within the feature set gives rise to the ``curse of dimensionality". In this
paper, we investigate subspace learning-based approaches centered on One-Class
Classification (OCC) algorithms, which excel in handling imbalanced data
distributions and possess the capability to anticipate and counter the
transactions carried out by yet-to-be-invented fraud techniques. The study
highlights the potential of subspace learning-based OCC algorithms by
investigating the limitations of current fraud detection strategies and the
specific challenges of credit card fraud detection. These algorithms integrate
subspace learning into the data description; hence, the models transform the
data into a lower-dimensional subspace optimized for OCC. Through rigorous
experimentation and analysis, the study validated that the proposed approach
helps tackle the curse of dimensionality and the imbalanced nature of credit
card data for automatic fraud detection to mitigate financial losses caused by
fraudulent activities.

<p class="mathjax">We present a locality-aware method for interpreting the latent space of
wavelet-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), that can well capture the
large spatial and spectral variability that is characteristic to satellite
imagery. By focusing on preserving locality, the proposed method is able to
decompose the weight-space of pre-trained GANs and recover interpretable
directions that correspond to high-level semantic concepts (such as
urbanization, structure density, flora presence) - that can subsequently be
used for guided synthesis of satellite imagery. In contrast to typically used
approaches that focus on capturing the variability of the weight-space in a
reduced dimensionality space (i.e., based on Principal Component Analysis,
PCA), we show that preserving locality leads to vectors with different angles,
that are more robust to artifacts and can better preserve class information.
Via a set of quantitative and qualitative examples, we further show that the
proposed approach can outperform both baseline geometric augmentations, as well
as global, PCA-based approaches for data synthesis in the context of data
augmentation for satellite scene classification.

<p class="mathjax">State machines are used ubiquitously in engineering software-intensive
systems. UML State Machines extend simple finite state machines with powerful
constructs. Among the many extensions, there is one seemingly simple and
innocent language construct that fundamentally changes state machines' reactive
model of computation: doActivity behaviors. DoActivity behaviors describe
behavior that is executed independently from the state machine once entered in
a given state, typically modeling complex computation or communication as
background tasks. However, the UML specification or textbooks are vague about
how the doActivity behavior construct should be appropriately used. This lack
of guidance is a severe issue as, when improperly used, doActivities can cause
concurrent, non-deterministic bugs that are especially challenging to find and
could ruin a seemingly correct software design. The Precise Semantics of UML
State Machines (PSSM) specification introduced detailed operational semantics
for state machines. To the best of our knowledge, there is no rigorous review
yet of doActivity's semantics as specified in PSSM. We analyzed the semantics
by collecting evidence from cross-checking the text of the specification, its
semantic model and executable test cases, and the simulators supporting PSSM.
We synthesized insights about subtle details and emergent behaviors relevant to
tool developers and advanced modelers. We reported inconsistencies and missing
clarifications in more than 20 issues to the standardization committee. Based
on these insights, we studied 11 patterns for doActivities detailing the
consequences of using a doActivity in a given situation and discussing
countermeasures or alternative design choices. We hope that our analysis of the
semantics and the patterns help vendors develop conformant simulators or
verification tools and engineers design better state machine models.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are crucial for machine learning
models deployed in open-world environments. Classifier-based scores are a
standard approach for OOD detection due to their fine-grained detection
capability. However, these scores often suffer from overconfidence issues,
misclassifying OOD samples distant from the in-distribution region. To address
this challenge, we propose a method called Nearest Neighbor Guidance (NNGuide)
that guides the classifier-based score to respect the boundary geometry of the
data manifold. NNGuide reduces the overconfidence of OOD samples while
preserving the fine-grained capability of the classifier-based score. We
conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet OOD detection benchmarks under
diverse settings, including a scenario where the ID data undergoes natural
distribution shift. Our results demonstrate that NNGuide provides a significant
performance improvement on the base detection scores, achieving
state-of-the-art results on both AUROC, FPR95, and AUPR metrics. The code is

<p class="mathjax">Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in online advertising
and recommendation systems, as accurate predictions are essential for user
targeting and personalized recommendations. Most recent cutting-edge methods
primarily focus on investigating complex implicit and explicit feature
interactions. However, these methods neglect the issue of false correlations
caused by confounding factors or selection bias. This problem is further
magnified by the complexity and redundancy of these interactions. We propose a
CTR prediction framework that removes false correlation in multi-level feature
interaction, termed REFORM. The proposed REFORM framework exploits a wide range
of multi-level high-order feature representations via a two-stream stacked
recurrent structure while eliminating false correlations. The framework has two
key components: I. The multi-level stacked recurrent (MSR) structure enables
the model to efficiently capture diverse nonlinear interactions from feature
spaces of different levels, and the richer representations lead to enhanced CTR
prediction accuracy. II. The false correlation elimination (FCE) module further
leverages Laplacian kernel mapping and sample reweighting methods to eliminate
false correlations concealed within the multi-level features, allowing the
model to focus on the true causal effects. Extensive experiments based on four
challenging CTR datasets and our production dataset demonstrate that the
proposed REFORM model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes, models and
our dataset will be released at https://github.com/yansuoyuli/REFORM.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of telehealth, robotic approaches have proven a valuable
solution to in-person visits in remote areas, with decreased costs for patients
and infection risks. In particular, in ultrasonography, robots have the
potential to reproduce the skills required to acquire high-quality images while
reducing the sonographer's physical efforts. In this paper, we address the
control of the interaction of the probe with the patient's body, a critical
aspect of ensuring safe and effective ultrasonography. We introduce a novel
approach based on variable impedance control, allowing real-time optimisation
of a compliant controller parameters during ultrasound procedures. This
optimisation is formulated as a quadratic programming problem and incorporates
physical constraints derived from viscoelastic parameter estimations. Safety
and passivity constraints, including an energy tank, are also integrated to
minimise potential risks during human-robot interaction. The proposed method's
efficacy is demonstrated through experiments on a patient dummy torso,
highlighting its potential for achieving safe behaviour and accurate force
control during ultrasound procedures, even in cases of contact loss.

<p class="mathjax">A robotic behavior model that can reliably generate behaviors from natural
language inputs in real time would substantially expedite the adoption of
industrial robots due to enhanced system flexibility. To facilitate these
efforts, we construct a framework in which learned behaviors, created by a
natural language abstractor, are verifiable by construction. Leveraging recent
advancements in motion primitives and probabilistic verification, we construct
a natural-language behavior abstractor that generates behaviors by synthesizing
a directed graph over the provided motion primitives. If these component motion
primitives are constructed according to the criteria we specify, the resulting
behaviors are probabilistically verifiable. We demonstrate this verifiable
behavior generation capacity in both simulation on an exploration task and on
hardware with a robot scooping granular media.

<p class="mathjax">Visual effects commonly requires both the creation of realistic synthetic
humans as well as retargeting actors' performances to humanoid characters such
as aliens and monsters. Achieving the expressive performances demanded in
entertainment requires manipulating complex models with hundreds of parameters.
Full creative control requires the freedom to make edits at any stage of the
production, which prohibits the use of a fully automatic ``black box'' solution
with uninterpretable parameters. On the other hand, producing realistic
animation with these sophisticated models is difficult and laborious. This
paper describes FDLS (Facial Deep Learning Solver), which is Weta Digital's
solution to these challenges. FDLS adopts a coarse-to-fine and
human-in-the-loop strategy, allowing a solved performance to be verified and
edited at several stages in the solving process. To train FDLS, we first
transform the raw motion-captured data into robust graph features. Secondly,
based on the observation that the artists typically finalize the jaw pass
animation before proceeding to finer detail, we solve for the jaw motion first
and predict fine expressions with region-based networks conditioned on the jaw
position. Finally, artists can optionally invoke a non-linear finetuning
process on top of the FDLS solution to follow the motion-captured virtual
markers as closely as possible. FDLS supports editing if needed to improve the
results of the deep learning solution and it can handle small daily changes in
the actor's face shape. FDLS permits reliable and production-quality
performance solving with minimal training and little or no manual effort in
many cases, while also allowing the solve to be guided and edited in unusual
and difficult cases. The system has been under development for several years
and has been used in major movies.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Image Manipulation Localization (IML) models suffer from training data
insufficiency and thus heavily rely on pre-training. We argue that contrastive
learning is more suitable to tackle the data insufficiency problem for IML.
Crafting mutually exclusive positives and negatives is the prerequisite for
contrastive learning. However, when adopting contrastive learning in IML, we
encounter three categories of image patches: tampered, authentic, and contour
patches. Tampered and authentic patches are naturally mutually exclusive, but
contour patches containing both tampered and authentic pixels are non-mutually
exclusive to them. Simply abnegating these contour patches results in a drastic
performance loss since contour patches are decisive to the learning outcomes.
Hence, we propose the Non-mutually exclusive Contrastive Learning (NCL)
framework to rescue conventional contrastive learning from the above dilemma.
In NCL, to cope with the non-mutually exclusivity, we first establish a pivot
structure with dual branches to constantly switch the role of contour patches
between positives and negatives while training. Then, we devise a
pivot-consistent loss to avoid spatial corruption caused by the role-switching
process. In this manner, NCL both inherits the self-supervised merits to
address the data insufficiency and retains a high manipulation localization
accuracy. Extensive experiments verify that our NCL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on all five benchmarks without any pre-training and is more robust
on unseen real-life samples. The code is available at:

reduce the amount of time and effort required to develop code and increase
productivity since the emergence of the discipline. Generative language models
are just another step in this journey, but it will probably not be the last

<p class="mathjax">Projection-based Controllers (PBCs) are currently gaining traction in both
scientific and engineering communities. In PBCs, the input-output signals of
the controller are kept in sector-bounded sets by means of projection. In this
paper, we will show how this projection operation can be used to induce useful
passivity or general dissipativity properties on broad classes of (unprojected)
nonlinear controllers that otherwise would not have these properties. The
induced dissipativity properties of PBC will be exploited to guarantee
asymptotic stability of negative feedback interconnections of passive nonlinear
plants and suitably designed PBC, under mild conditions. Proper generalizations
to so-called $(q,s,r)$-dissipativity will be presented as well. For
illustrating the effectiveness of PBC control design via these passivity-based
techniques, two numerical examples are provided.

<p class="mathjax">Node representation learning on attributed graphs -- whose nodes are
associated with rich attributes (e.g., texts and protein sequences) -- plays a
crucial role in many important downstream tasks. To encode the attributes and
graph structures simultaneously, recent studies integrate pre-trained models
with graph neural networks (GNNs), where pre-trained models serve as node
encoders (NEs) to encode the attributes. As jointly training large NEs and GNNs
on large-scale graphs suffers from severe scalability issues, many methods
propose to train NEs and GNNs separately. Consequently, they do not take
feature convolutions in GNNs into consideration in the training phase of NEs,
leading to a significant learning bias from that by the joint training. To
address this challenge, we propose an efficient label regularization technique,
namely Label Deconvolution (LD), to alleviate the learning bias by a novel and
highly scalable approximation to the inverse mapping of GNNs. The inverse
mapping leads to an objective function that is equivalent to that by the joint
training, while it can effectively incorporate GNNs in the training phase of
NEs against the learning bias. More importantly, we show that LD converges to
the optimal objective function values by thejoint training under mild
assumptions. Experiments demonstrate LD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on Open Graph Benchmark datasets.

while preserving the original identity and accommodating various poses. Unlike
previous methods in this field that relied on conditional-GANs, which posed
challenges related to dataset requirements and pose training, our approach
leverages the expressive latent space of StyleGAN. We achieve this by
introducing an encoder that captures both pose and identity information from
images and generates a corresponding embedding within the StyleGAN latent
space. By subsequently passing this embedding through a pre-trained generator,
we obtain the desired cartoonised output. While many other approaches based on
StyleGAN necessitate a dedicated and fine-tuned StyleGAN model, our method
stands out by utilizing an already-trained StyleGAN designed to produce
realistic facial images. We show by extensive experimentation how our encoder
adapts the StyleGAN output to better preserve identity when the objective is
cartoonisation.

<p class="mathjax">We propose PHRIT, a novel approach for parametric hand mesh modeling with an
implicit template that combines the advantages of both parametric meshes and
implicit representations. Our method represents deformable hand shapes using
signed distance fields (SDFs) with part-based shape priors, utilizing a
deformation field to execute the deformation. The model offers efficient
high-fidelity hand reconstruction by deforming the canonical template at
infinite resolution. Additionally, it is fully differentiable and can be easily
used in hand modeling since it can be driven by the skeleton and shape latent
codes. We evaluate PHRIT on multiple downstream tasks, including
skeleton-driven hand reconstruction, shapes from point clouds, and single-view
3D reconstruction, demonstrating that our approach achieves realistic and
immersive hand modeling with state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce and study a family of rate-compatible Low-Density Parity-Check
(LDPC) codes characterized by very simple encoders. The design of these codes
starts from simplex codes, which are defined by parity-check matrices having a
straightforward form stemming from the coefficients of a primitive polynomial.
For this reason, we call the new codes Primitive Rate-Compatible LDPC
(PRC-LDPC) codes. By applying puncturing to these codes, we obtain a bit-level
granularity of their code rates. We show that, in order to achieve good LDPC
codes, the underlying polynomials, besides being primitive, must meet some more
stringent conditions with respect to those of classical punctured simplex
codes. We leverage non-modular Golomb rulers to take the new requirements into
account. We characterize the minimum distance properties of PRC-LDPC codes, and
study and discuss their encoding and decoding complexity. Finally, we assess
their error rate performance under iterative decoding.

<p class="mathjax">Gamification is a technological, economic, cultural, and societal development
toward promoting a more game-like reality. As this emergent phenomenon has been
gradually consolidated into our daily lives, especially in educational
settings, many scholars and practitioners face a major challenge ahead: how to
understand and mitigate the unethical impacts of gamification when researching
and developing such educational technologies? Thus, this study explores ethical
challenges in gamified educational applications and proposes potential
solutions to address them based on an umbrella review. After analysing
secondary studies, this study details and proposes recommendations on
addressing some ethical challenges in gamified education, such as power
dynamics and paternalism, lack of voluntarity and confidentiality, cognitive
manipulation, and social comparison. Research and development decision-making
processes affected by such challenges are also elaborated, and potential
actions to mitigate their effects in gamification planning, conducting and
communication are further introduced. Thus, this chapter provides an
understanding of ethical challenges posed by the literature in gamified
education and a set of guidelines for future research and development.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, especially generative AI technologies
are becoming more relevant in our society. Tools like ChatGPT are being used by
members of the disabled community e.g., Autistic people may use it to help
compose emails. The growing impact and popularity of generative AI tools have
prompted us to examine their relevance within the disabled community. The
design and development phases often neglect this marginalized group, leading to
inaccurate predictions and unfair discrimination directed towards them. This
could result from bias in data sets, algorithms, and systems at various phases
of creation and implementation. This workshop paper proposes a platform to
involve the disabled community while building generative AI systems. With this
platform, our aim is to gain insight into the factors that contribute to bias
in the outputs generated by generative AI when used by the disabled community.
Furthermore, we expect to comprehend which algorithmic factors are the main
contributors to the output's incorrectness or irrelevancy. The proposed
platform calls on both disabled and non-disabled people from various
geographical and cultural backgrounds to collaborate asynchronously and
remotely in a democratic approach to decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved very
impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While
prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing
few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target
samples, which greatly degrades their scalability while handling various visual
recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that
allows learning superior target models with few-shot unlabelled target samples.
NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted
pseudo-labels of the few-shot unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It
consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation
that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to
their prediction confidence. The second is pseudo-label rectification, which
corrects both pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging
knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive
experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across
multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning for autonomous robots in tight, interaction-rich, and mixed
human-robot environments is challenging. State-of-the-art methods typically
separate prediction and planning, predicting other agents' trajectories first
and then planning the ego agent's motion in the remaining free space. However,
agents' lack of awareness of their influence on others can lead to the freezing
robot problem. We build upon Interaction-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral
(IA-MPPI) control and combine it with learning-based trajectory predictions,
thereby relaxing its reliance on communicated short-term goals for other
agents. We apply this framework to Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) navigating
urban canals. By generating an artificial dataset in real sections of
Amsterdam's canals, adapting and training a prediction model for our domain,
and proposing heuristics to extract local goals, we enable effective
cooperation in planning. Our approach improves autonomous robot navigation in
complex, crowded environments, with potential implications for multi-agent
systems and human-robot interaction.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of advanced multi-sensor fusion models, there has been a
notable enhancement in the performance of perception tasks within in terms of
autonomous driving. Despite these advancements, the challenges persist,
particularly in the fusion of data from cameras and LiDAR sensors. A critial
concern is the accurate alignment of data from these disparate sensors. Our
observations indicate that the projected positions of LiDAR points often
misalign on the corresponding image. Furthermore, fusion models appear to
struggle in accurately segmenting these misaligned points. In this paper, we
would like to address this problem carefully, with a specific focus on the
nuScenes dataset and the SOTA of fusion models 2DPASS, and providing the
possible solutions or potential improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Text-conditional image editing is a very useful task that has recently
emerged with immeasurable potential. Most current real image editing methods
first need to complete the reconstruction of the image, and then editing is
carried out by various methods based on the reconstruction. Most methods use
DDIM Inversion for reconstruction, however, DDIM Inversion often fails to
guarantee reconstruction performance, i.e., it fails to produce results that
preserve the original image content. To address the problem of reconstruction
failure, we propose FEC, which consists of three sampling methods, each
designed for different editing types and settings. Our three methods of FEC
achieve two important goals in image editing task: 1) ensuring successful
reconstruction, i.e., sampling to get a generated result that preserves the
texture and features of the original real image. 2) these sampling methods can
be paired with many editing methods and greatly improve the performance of
these editing methods to accomplish various editing tasks. In addition, none of
our sampling methods require fine-tuning of the diffusion model or
time-consuming training on large-scale datasets. Hence the cost of time as well
as the use of computer memory and computation can be significantly reduced.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) methods offer a wide range of configurable
hyperparameters that have a significant influence on their performance. While
accuracy is a commonly used performance objective, in many settings, it is not
sufficient. Optimizing the ML models with respect to multiple objectives such
as accuracy, confidence, fairness, calibration, privacy, latency, and memory
consumption is becoming crucial. To that end, hyperparameter optimization, the
approach to systematically optimize the hyperparameters, which is already
challenging for a single objective, is even more challenging for multiple
objectives. In addition, the differences in objective scales, the failures, and
the presence of outlier values in objectives make the problem even harder. We
propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MoBO) algorithm that addresses
these problems through uniform objective normalization and randomized weights
in scalarization. We increase the efficiency of our approach by imposing
constraints on the objective to avoid exploring unnecessary configurations
(e.g., insufficient accuracy). Finally, we leverage an approach to parallelize
the MoBO which results in a 5x speed-up when using 16x more workers.

are discussed, such as a controllable environment, the possibility to
manipulate the variables related to the robot and the human-robot interaction,
flexibility in the design of the robot and the environment, and advanced
measurement methods related e.g. to eye tracking and physiological data. At the
same time, the challenges of researching diversity and inclusion in HRI are
described, especially in accessibility, cyber sickness and bias when developing

<p class="mathjax">Multi-behavioral sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing
attention. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations.
Firstly, user preferences and intents can be described in fine-grained detail
from multiple perspectives; yet, these methods fail to capture their
multi-aspect nature. Secondly, user behaviors may contain noises, and most
existing methods could not effectively deal with noises. In this paper, we
present an attentive recurrent model with multiple projections to capture
Multi-Aspect preferences and INTents (MAINT in short). To extract multi-aspect
preferences from target behaviors, we propose a multi-aspect projection
mechanism for generating multiple preference representations from multiple
aspects. To extract multi-aspect intents from multi-typed behaviors, we propose
a behavior-enhanced LSTM and a multi-aspect refinement attention mechanism. The
attention mechanism can filter out noises and generate multiple intent
representations from different aspects. To adaptively fuse user preferences and
intents, we propose a multi-aspect gated fusion mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our model.

which the standard Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model is enriched by a
functional correction to the thrust that is learned from data. The method

<p class="mathjax">The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased recently, not only
due to the significant improvements in their accuracy but also because of the
use of the quantization that allows running these models without intense
hardware requirements. As a result, the LLMs have proliferated. It implies the
creation of a great variety of LLMs with different capabilities. This way, this
paper proposes the integration of LLMs in cognitive architectures for
autonomous robots. Specifically, we present the design, development and
deployment of the llama\_ros tool that allows the easy use and integration of
LLMs in ROS 2-based environments, afterward integrated with the
state-of-the-art cognitive architecture MERLIN2 for updating a PDDL-based
planner system. This proposal is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively,
measuring the impact of incorporating the LLMs in the cognitive architecture.

Existing works mainly consider real-world test-time adaptation under non-i.i.d.
data stream and continual domain shift. In this work, we first complement the
existing real-world TTA protocol with a globally class imbalanced testing set.
We demonstrate that combining all settings together poses new challenges to
existing methods. We argue the failure of state-of-the-art methods is first
caused by indiscriminately adapting normalization layers to imbalanced testing
data. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose a balanced batchnorm layer to swap
out the regular batchnorm at inference stage. The new batchnorm layer is
capable of adapting without biasing towards majority classes. We are further
inspired by the success of self-training~(ST) in learning from unlabeled data
and adapt ST for test-time adaptation. However, ST alone is prone to over
adaption which is responsible for the poor performance under continual domain
shift. Hence, we propose to improve self-training under continual domain shift
by regularizing model updates with an anchored loss. The final TTA model,
termed as TRIBE, is built upon a tri-net architecture with balanced batchnorm
layers. We evaluate TRIBE on four datasets representing real-world TTA
settings. TRIBE consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance across
multiple evaluation protocols. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Adapting visual object detectors to operational target domains is a
challenging task, commonly achieved using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
methods. When the labeled dataset is coming from multiple source domains,
treating them as separate domains and performing a multi-source domain
adaptation (MSDA) improves the accuracy and robustness over mixing these source
domains and performing a UDA, as observed by recent studies in MSDA. Existing
MSDA methods learn domain invariant and domain-specific parameters (for each
source domain) for the adaptation. However, unlike single-source UDA methods,
learning domain-specific parameters makes them grow significantly proportional
to the number of source domains used. This paper proposes a novel MSDA method
called Prototype-based Mean-Teacher (PMT), which uses class prototypes instead
of domain-specific subnets to preserve domain-specific information. These
prototypes are learned using a contrastive loss, aligning the same categories
across domains and separating different categories far apart. Because of the
use of prototypes, the parameter size of our method does not increase
significantly with the number of source domains, thus reducing memory issues
and possible overfitting. Empirical studies show PMT outperforms
state-of-the-art MSDA methods on several challenging object detection datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory prediction (TP) plays an important role in supporting the
decision-making of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs). Traditional TP methods are
deterministic and physics-based, with parameters that are calibrated using
aircraft surveillance data harvested across the world. These models are,
therefore, agnostic to the intentions of the pilots and ATCOs, which can have a
significant effect on the observed trajectory, particularly in the lateral
plane. This work proposes a generative method for lateral TP, using
probabilistic machine learning to model the effect of the epistemic uncertainty
arising from the unknown effect of pilot behaviour and ATCO intentions. The
models are trained to be specific to a particular sector, allowing local
procedures such as coordinated entry and exit points to be modelled. A dataset
comprising a week's worth of aircraft surveillance data, passing through a busy
sector of the United Kingdom's upper airspace, was used to train and test the
models. Specifically, a piecewise linear model was used as a functional,
low-dimensional representation of the ground tracks, with its control points
determined by a generative model conditioned on partial context. It was found
that, of the investigated models, a Bayesian Neural Network using the Laplace
approximation was able to generate the most plausible trajectories in order to
emulate the flow of traffic through the sector.

<p class="mathjax">All tables can be represented as grids. Based on this observation, we propose
GridFormer, a novel approach for interpreting unconstrained table structures by
predicting the vertex and edge of a grid. First, we propose a flexible table
representation in the form of an MXN grid. In this representation, the vertexes
and edges of the grid store the localization and adjacency information of the
table. Then, we introduce a DETR-style table structure recognizer to
efficiently predict this multi-objective information of the grid in a single
shot. Specifically, given a set of learned row and column queries, the
recognizer directly outputs the vertexes and edges information of the
corresponding rows and columns. Extensive experiments on five challenging
benchmarks which include wired, wireless, multi-merge-cell, oriented, and
distorted tables demonstrate the competitive performance of our model over
other methods.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of social media has enabled the widespread propagation of fake news,
text that is published with an intent to spread misinformation and sway
beliefs. Rapidly detecting fake news, especially as new events arise, is
important to prevent misinformation.
<br />While prior works have tackled this problem using supervised learning
systems, automatedly modeling the complexities of the social media landscape
that enables the spread of fake news is challenging. On the contrary, having
humans fact check all news is not scalable. Thus, in this paper, we propose to
approach this problem interactively, where humans can interact to help an
automated system learn a better social media representation quality. On real
world events, our experiments show performance improvements in detecting
factuality of news sources, even after few human interactions.

<p class="mathjax">In preparation for observing holographic 3D content, acquiring a set of RGB
color and depth map images per scene is necessary to generate
computer-generated holograms (CGHs) when using the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithm. However, in real-world situations, these paired formats of RGB color
and depth map images are not always fully available. We propose a deep
learning-based method to synthesize the volumetric digital holograms using only
the given RGB image, so that we can overcome environments where RGB color and
depth map images are partially provided. The proposed method uses only the
input of RGB image to estimate its depth map and then generate its CGH

generated through our proposed model is more accurate than that of competitive
models, under the situation that only RGB color data can be provided.

<p class="mathjax">Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is notoriously impractical to deploy due to
sample inefficiency. Meta-RL directly addresses this sample inefficiency by
learning to perform few-shot learning when a distribution of related tasks is
available for meta-training. While many specialized meta-RL methods have been
proposed, recent work suggests that end-to-end learning in conjunction with an
off-the-shelf sequential model, such as a recurrent network, is a surprisingly
strong baseline. However, such claims have been controversial due to limited
supporting evidence, particularly in the face of prior work establishing
precisely the opposite. In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation.
While we likewise find that a recurrent network can achieve strong performance,
we demonstrate that the use of hypernetworks is crucial to maximizing their
potential. Surprisingly, when combined with hypernetworks, the recurrent
baselines that are far simpler than existing specialized methods actually
achieve the strongest performance of all methods evaluated.

<p class="mathjax">In 5G New Radio (NR), beam management entails periodic and continuous
transmission and reception of control signals in the form of synchronization
signal blocks (SSBs), used to perform initial access and/or channel estimation.
However, this procedure demands continuous energy consumption, which is
particularly challenging to handle for low-cost, low-complexity, and
battery-constrained devices, such as RedCap devices to support mid-market
Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. In this context, this work aims at reducing
the energy consumption during beam management for RedCap devices, while
ensuring that the desired Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. To do
so, we formalize an optimization problem in an Indoor Factory (InF) scenario to
select the best beam management parameters, including the beam update
periodicity and the beamwidth, to minimize energy consumption based on users'
distribution and their speed. The analysis yields the regions of feasibility,
i.e., the upper limit(s) on the beam management parameters for RedCap devices,
that we use to provide design guidelines accordingly.

<p class="mathjax">Programs offer compactness and structure that makes them an attractive
representation for visual data. We explore how code rewriting can be used to
improve systems for inferring programs from visual data. We first propose
Sparse Intermittent Rewrite Injection (SIRI), a framework for unsupervised
bootstrapped learning. SIRI sparsely applies code rewrite operations over a
dataset of training programs, injecting the improved programs back into the
training set. We design a family of rewriters for visual programming domains:
parameter optimization, code pruning, and code grafting. For three shape
programming languages in 2D and 3D, we show that using SIRI with our family of
rewriters improves performance: better reconstructions and faster convergence
rates, compared with bootstrapped learning methods that do not use rewriters or
use them naively. Finally, we demonstrate that our family of rewriters can be
effectively used at test time to improve the output of SIRI predictions. For 2D
and 3D CSG, we outperform or match the reconstruction performance of recent
domain-specific neural architectures, while producing more parsimonious
programs that use significantly fewer primitives.

different input embedding layers, and show that all consistently outperform
simple token-based searches. We explore the integration of idiolectal and
sociolectal metadata embeddings (centuries, author, type of writing), but find
that it leads to overfitting. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach, achieving high precision and true positive rates (TPR) of
respectively 70.60% and 86.33% using HAN. We evaluate the impact of the dataset
size on the model performances (420 instead of 2013), and show that, while our

<p class="mathjax">While humans can use parts of their arms other than the hands for
manipulations like gathering and supporting, whether robots can effectively
learn and perform the same type of operations remains relatively unexplored. As
these manipulations require joint-level control to regulate the complete poses
of the robots, we develop AirExo, a low-cost, adaptable, and portable dual-arm
exoskeleton, for teleoperation and demonstration collection. As collecting
teleoperated data is expensive and time-consuming, we further leverage AirExo
to collect cheap in-the-wild demonstrations at scale. Under our in-the-wild
learning framework, we show that with only 3 minutes of the teleoperated
demonstrations, augmented by diverse and extensive in-the-wild data collected
by AirExo, robots can learn a policy that is comparable to or even better than
one learned from teleoperated demonstrations lasting over 20 minutes.
Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the model to learn a more
general and robust policy across the various stages of the task, enhancing the
success rates in task completion even with the presence of disturbances.

combine different object detectors to obtain a Mixture of Experts (MoE) that
has a superior accuracy to the individual experts in the mixture. We find that
naively combining these experts in a similar way to the well-known Deep
Ensembles (DEs), does not result in an effective MoE. We identify the
incompatibility between the confidence score distribution of different
detectors to be the primary reason for such failure cases. Therefore, to
construct the MoE, our proposal is to first calibrate each individual detector
against a target calibration function. Then, filter and refine all the
predictions from different detectors in the mixture. We term this approach as
MoCaE and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on object
detection, instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks.
Specifically, MoCaE improves (i) three strong object detectors on COCO test-dev
by $2.4$ $\mathrm{AP}$ by reaching $59.0$ $\mathrm{AP}$; (ii) instance
segmentation methods on the challenging long-tailed LVIS dataset by $2.3$
$\mathrm{AP}$; and (iii) all existing rotated object detectors by reaching
$82.62$ $\mathrm{AP_{50}}$ on DOTA dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA). Code will be made public.

<p class="mathjax">In the extensive recommender systems literature, novelty and diversity have
been identified as key properties of useful recommendations. However, these
properties have received limited attention in the specific sub-field of
research paper recommender systems. In this work, we argue for the importance
of offering novel and diverse research paper recommendations to scientists.
This approach aims to reduce siloed reading, break down filter bubbles, and
promote interdisciplinary research. We propose a novel framework for evaluating
the novelty and diversity of research paper recommendations that leverages
methods from network analysis and natural language processing. Using this
framework, we show that the choice of representational method within a larger
research paper recommendation system can have a measurable impact on the nature
of downstream recommendations, specifically on their novelty and diversity. We
introduce a novel paper embedding method, which we demonstrate offers more
innovative and diverse recommendations without sacrificing precision, compared
to other state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Developing and maintaining software commonly requires (1) adding new data
type constructors to existing applications, but also (2) adding new functions
that work on existing data. Most programming languages have native support for
defining data types and functions in a way that supports either (1) or (2), but
not both. This lack of native support makes it difficult to use and extend
libraries. A theoretically well-studied solution is to define data types and
functions using initial algebra semantics. While it is possible to encode this
solution in existing programming languages, such encodings add syntactic and
interpretive overhead, and commonly fail to take advantage of the map and fold
fusion laws of initial algebras which compilers could exploit to generate more
efficient code. A solution to these is to provide native support for initial
algebra semantics. In this paper, we develop such a solution and present a type
discipline and core calculus for a language with native support for initial
algebra semantics.

<p class="mathjax">We first raise and tackle ``time synchronization'' issue between the agent
and the environment in non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL), a crucial
factor hindering its real-world applications. In reality, environmental changes
occur over wall-clock time ($\mathfrak{t}$) rather than episode progress ($k$),
where wall-clock time signifies the actual elapsed time within the fixed
duration $\mathfrak{t} \in [0, T]$. In existing works, at episode $k$, the
agent rollouts a trajectory and trains a policy before transitioning to episode
$k+1$. In the context of the time-desynchronized environment, however, the
agent at time $\mathfrak{t}_k$ allocates $\Delta \mathfrak{t}$ for trajectory
generation and training, subsequently moves to the next episode at
$\mathfrak{t}_{k+1}=\mathfrak{t}_{k}+\Delta \mathfrak{t}$. Despite a fixed
total episode ($K$), the agent accumulates different trajectories influenced by
the choice of \textit{interaction times}
($\mathfrak{t}_1,\mathfrak{t}_2,...,\mathfrak{t}_K$), significantly impacting
the sub-optimality gap of policy. We propose a Proactively Synchronizing Tempo
(ProST) framework that computes optimal $\{
\mathfrak{t}_1,\mathfrak{t}_2,...,\mathfrak{t}_K \} (= \{ \mathfrak{t}
\}_{1:K})$. Our main contribution is that we show optimal $\{ \mathfrak{t}
\}_{1:K}$ trades-off between the policy training time (agent tempo) and how
fast the environment changes (environment tempo). Theoretically, this work
establishes an optimal $\{ \mathfrak{t} \}_{1:K}$ as a function of the degree
of the environment's non-stationarity while also achieving a sublinear dynamic
regret. Our experimental evaluation on various high dimensional non-stationary
environments shows that the ProST framework achieves a higher online return at
optimal $\{ \mathfrak{t} \}_{1:K}$ than the existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Since photorealistic faces can be readily generated by facial manipulation
technologies nowadays, potential malicious abuse of these technologies has
drawn great concerns. Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed.
However, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation.
As the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can
easily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential
manner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial
manipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering
original faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need
and propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake
Manipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only
demanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation
requires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation
operations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first
Seq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with
corresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on
this new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific
image-to-sequence task and propose a concise yet effective Seq-DeepFake
Transformer (SeqFakeFormer). To better reflect real-world deepfake data
distributions, we further apply various perturbations on the original
Seq-DeepFake dataset and construct the more challenging Sequential DeepFake
dataset with perturbations (Seq-DeepFake-P). To exploit deeper correlation
between images and sequences when facing Seq-DeepFake-P, a dedicated
Seq-DeepFake Transformer with Image-Sequence Reasoning (SeqFakeFormer++) is
devised, which builds stronger correspondence between image-sequence pairs for
more robust Seq-DeepFake detection.

solutions to the bidirectional traceability problem through a case study. The
findings indicate that ChatGPT is capable of generating design models and code

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we investigated the relationship between sailboat technical
specifications and their prices, as well as regional pricing influences.
Utilizing a dataset encompassing characteristics like length, beam, draft,
displacement, sail area, and waterline, we applied multiple machine learning
models to predict sailboat prices. The gradient descent model demonstrated
superior performance, producing the lowest MSE and MAE. Our analysis revealed
that monohulled boats are generally more affordable than catamarans, and that
certain specifications such as length, beam, displacement, and sail area
directly correlate with higher prices. Interestingly, lower draft was
associated with higher listing prices. We also explored regional price
determinants and found that the United States tops the list in average sailboat
prices, followed by Europe, Hong Kong, and the Caribbean. Contrary to our
initial hypothesis, a country's GDP showed no direct correlation with sailboat
prices. Utilizing a 50% cross-validation method, our models yielded consistent
results across test groups. Our research offers a machine learning-enhanced
perspective on sailboat pricing, aiding prospective buyers in making informed
decisions.

<p class="mathjax">Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is used to generate fusion images
with comprehensive features of both images, which is beneficial for downstream
vision tasks. However, current methods rarely consider the illumination
condition in low-light environments, and the targets in the fused images are
often not prominent. To address the above issues, we propose an
Illumination-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Network, named as IAIFNet.
In our framework, an illumination enhancement network first estimates the
incident illumination maps of input images. Afterwards, with the help of
proposed adaptive differential fusion module (ADFM) and salient target aware
module (STAM), an image fusion network effectively integrates the salient
features of the illumination-enhanced infrared and visible images into a fusion
image of high visual quality. Extensive experimental results verify that our
method outperforms five state-of-the-art methods of fusing infrared and visible
images.

<p class="mathjax">The task of open-vocabulary object-centric image retrieval involves the
retrieval of images containing a specified object of interest, delineated by an
open-set text query. As working on large image datasets becomes standard,
solving this task efficiently has gained significant practical importance.
Applications include targeted performance analysis of retrieved images using
ad-hoc queries and hard example mining during training. Recent advancements in
contrastive-based open vocabulary systems have yielded remarkable
breakthroughs, facilitating large-scale open vocabulary image retrieval.
However, these approaches use a single global embedding per image, thereby
constraining the system's ability to retrieve images containing relatively
small object instances. Alternatively, incorporating local embeddings from
detection pipelines faces scalability challenges, making it unsuitable for
retrieval from large databases.
<br />In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach to object-centric
open-vocabulary image retrieval. Our approach aggregates dense embeddings
extracted from CLIP into a compact representation, essentially combining the
scalability of image retrieval pipelines with the object identification
capabilities of dense detection methods. We show the effectiveness of our
scheme to the task by achieving significantly better results than global
feature approaches on three datasets, increasing accuracy by up to 15 mAP
points. We further integrate our scheme into a large scale retrieval framework
and demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of scalability and
interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by a class of nonlinear imaging inverse problems, for instance,
multispectral computed tomography (MSCT), this paper studies the convergence
theory of the nonlinear Kaczmarz method (NKM) for solving systems of nonlinear
equations with component-wise convex mapping, namely, the function
corresponding to each equation being convex. Although the tangential cone
condition (TCC) is often used to prove the convergence of NKM, it may be
impossible or difficult to verify/satisfy this condition for such kind of
nonlinear systems. We propose a novel condition named relative gradient
discrepancy condition (RGDC), and make use of it to prove the convergence and
even the convergence rate of NKM with several general index selection
strategies, where these strategies include the cyclic strategy and maximum
residual strategy. Particularly, we investigate the application of NKM for
solving nonlinear systems in MSCT image reconstruction. We prove that the
nonlinear mapping of interest fulfills the proposed RGDC rather than the
component-wise local TCC, and provide the global convergence of NKM based on
the previously obtained results. Numerical experiments further illustrate the
numerical convergence of NKM for MSCT image reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">The use of question-based activities (QBAs) is wide-spread in education,
traditionally forming an integral part of the learning and assessment process.
In this paper, we design and evaluate an automated question generation tool for
formative and summative assessment in schools. We present an expert survey of
one hundred and four teachers, demonstrating the need for automated generation
of QBAs, as a tool that can significantly reduce the workload of teachers and
facilitate personalized learning experiences. Leveraging the recent
advancements in generative AI, we then present a modular framework employing
transformer based language models for automatic generation of multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) from textual content. The presented solution, with distinct
modules for question generation, correct answer prediction, and distractor
formulation, enables us to evaluate different language models and generation
techniques. Finally, we perform an extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation, demonstrating trade-offs in the use of different techniques and
models.

<p class="mathjax">The vast majority of ASR research uses corpora in which both the training and
test data have been pre-segmented into utterances. In most real-word ASR
use-cases, however, test audio is not segmented, leading to a mismatch between
inference-time conditions and models trained on segmented utterances. In this
paper, we re-release three standard ASR corpora - TED-LIUM 3, Gigapeech, and
VoxPopuli-en - with updated transcription and alignments to enable their use
for long-form ASR research. We use these reconstituted corpora to study the
train-test mismatch problem for transducers and attention-based
encoder-decoders (AEDs), confirming that AEDs are more susceptible to this
issue. Finally, we benchmark a simple long-form training for these models,
showing its efficacy for model robustness under this domain shift.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional evaluation metrics like ROUGE compare lexical overlap between the
reference and generated summaries without taking argumentative structure into
account, which is important for legal summaries. In this paper, we propose a
novel legal summarization evaluation framework that utilizes GPT-4 to generate
a set of question-answer pairs that cover main points and information in the
reference summary. GPT-4 is then used to generate answers based on the
generated summary for the questions from the reference summary. Finally, GPT-4
grades the answers from the reference summary and the generated summary. We
examined the correlation between GPT-4 grading with human grading. The results
suggest that this question-answering approach with GPT-4 can be a useful tool
for gauging the quality of the summary.

<p class="mathjax">The development of open-source software (OSS) projects usually have been
driven through collaborations among contributors and strongly relies on
volunteering. Thus, allocating software practitioners (e.g., contributors) to a
particular task is non-trivial and draws attention away from the development.
Therefore, a number of bug bounty platforms have emerged to address this
problem through bounty rewards. Especially, Gitcoin, a new bounty platform,
introduces a bounty reward mechanism that allows individual issue owners
(backers) to define a reward value using cryptocurrencies rather than using
crowdfunding mechanisms. Although a number of studies have investigated the
phenomenon on bounty platforms, those rely on different bounty reward systems.
Our study thus investigates the association between the Gitcoin bounties and
their outcomes (i.e., success and non-success). We empirically study over 4,000
issues with Gitcoin bounties using statistical analysis and machine learning
techniques. We also conducted a comparative study with the Bountysource
platform to gain insights into the usage of both platforms. Our study
highlights the importance of factors such as the length of the project, issue
description, type of bounty issue, and the bounty value, which are found to be
highly correlated with the outcome of bounty issues. These findings can provide
useful guidance to practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">While significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have catalyzed
progress across various domains, its full potential in understanding visual
perception remains underexplored. We propose an artificial neural network
dubbed VISION, an acronym for "Visual Interface System for Imaging Output of
Neural activity," to mimic the human brain and show how it can foster
neuroscientific inquiries. Using visual and contextual inputs, this multimodal
model predicts the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan
response to natural images. VISION successfully predicts human hemodynamic
responses as fMRI voxel values to visual inputs with an accuracy exceeding
state-of-the-art performance by 45%. We further probe the trained networks to
reveal representational biases in different visual areas, generate
experimentally testable hypotheses, and formulate an interpretable metric to
associate these hypotheses with cortical functions. With both a model and
evaluation metric, the cost and time burdens associated with designing and
implementing functional analysis on the visual cortex could be reduced. Our
work suggests that the evolution of computational models may shed light on our
fundamental understanding of the visual cortex and provide a viable approach
toward reliable brain-machine interfaces.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to reconstruct ghost-free
images with photo-realistic details from content-complementary but spatially
misaligned low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR algorithms are prone to
producing ghosting artifacts as their methods fail to capture long-range
dependencies between LDR frames with large motion in dynamic scenes. To address
this issue, we propose a novel image fusion transformer, referred to as IFT,
which presents a fast global patch searching (FGPS) module followed by a
self-cross fusion module (SCF) for ghost-free HDR imaging. The FGPS searches
the patches from supporting frames that have the closest dependency to each
patch of the reference frame for long-range dependency modeling, while the SCF
conducts intra-frame and inter-frame feature fusion on the patches obtained by
the FGPS with linear complexity to input resolution. By matching similar
patches between frames, objects with large motion ranges in dynamic scenes can
be aligned, which can effectively alleviate the generation of artifacts. In
addition, the proposed FGPS and SCF can be integrated into various deep HDR
methods as efficient plug-in modules. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant advancements in deep learning for vision and natural
language, unsupervised domain adaptation in audio remains relatively
unexplored. We, in part, attribute this to the lack of an appropriate benchmark
dataset. To address this gap, we present Synthia's melody, a novel audio data
generation framework capable of simulating an infinite variety of 4-second
melodies with user-specified confounding structures characterised by musical
keys, timbre, and loudness. Unlike existing datasets collected under
observational settings, Synthia's melody is free of unobserved biases, ensuring
the reproducibility and comparability of experiments. To showcase its utility,
we generate two types of distribution shifts-domain shift and sample selection
bias-and evaluate the performance of acoustic deep learning models under these
shifts. Our evaluations reveal that Synthia's melody provides a robust testbed
for examining the susceptibility of these models to varying levels of
distribution shift.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress made in large language models
(LLMs). Such advancements, while garnering significant attention, have
concurrently elicited various concerns. The potential of these models is
undeniably vast; however, they may yield texts that are imprecise, misleading,
or even detrimental. Consequently, it becomes paramount to employ alignment
techniques to ensure these models to exhibit behaviors consistent with human
values.
<br />This survey endeavors to furnish an extensive exploration of alignment
methodologies designed for LLMs, in conjunction with the extant capability
research in this domain. Adopting the lens of AI alignment, we categorize the
prevailing methods and emergent proposals for the alignment of LLMs into outer
and inner alignment. We also probe into salient issues including the models'
interpretability, and potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. To
assess LLM alignment, we present a wide variety of benchmarks and evaluation
methodologies. After discussing the state of alignment research for LLMs, we
finally cast a vision toward the future, contemplating the promising avenues of
research that lie ahead.
<br />Our aspiration for this survey extends beyond merely spurring research
interests in this realm. We also envision bridging the gap between the AI
alignment research community and the researchers engrossed in the capability
exploration of LLMs for both capable and safe LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">In the area of query complexity of Boolean functions, the most widely studied
cost measure of an algorithm is the worst-case number of queries made by it on
an input. Motivated by the most natural cost measure studied in online
algorithms, the competitive ratio, we consider a different cost measure for
query algorithms for Boolean functions that captures the ratio of the cost of
the algorithm and the cost of an optimal algorithm that knows the input in
advance. The cost of an algorithm is its largest cost over all inputs.
Grossman, Komargodski and Naor [ITCS'20] introduced this measure for Boolean
functions, and dubbed it instance complexity. Grossman et al. showed, among
other results, that monotone Boolean functions with instance complexity 1 are
precisely those that depend on one or two variables.
<br />We complement the above-mentioned result of Grossman et al. by completely
characterizing the instance complexity of symmetric Boolean functions. As a
corollary we conclude that the only symmetric Boolean functions with instance
complexity 1 are the Parity function and its complement. We also study the
instance complexity of some graph properties like Connectivity and k-clique
containment.
<br />In all the Boolean functions we study above, and those studied by Grossman et
al., the instance complexity turns out to be the ratio of query complexity to
minimum certificate complexity. It is a natural question to ask if this is the
correct bound for all Boolean functions. We show a negative answer in a very
strong sense, by analyzing the instance complexity of the Greater-Than and
Odd-Max-Bit functions. We show that the above-mentioned ratio is linear in the
input size for both of these functions, while we exhibit algorithms for which
the instance complexity is a constant.

<p class="mathjax">Inference-time search algorithms such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) may
seem unnecessary when generating natural language text based on
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning such as Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to get extra mileage
out of PPO by integrating MCTS on top. The key idea is not to throw out the
value network, a byproduct of PPO training for evaluating partial output
sequences, when decoding text out of the policy network. More concretely, we
present a novel value-guided decoding algorithm called PPO-MCTS, which can
integrate the value network from PPO to work closely with the policy network
during inference-time generation. Compared to prior approaches based on MCTS
for controlled text generation, the key strength of our approach is to reduce
the fundamental mismatch of the scoring mechanisms of the partial outputs
between training and test. Evaluation on four text generation tasks demonstrate
that PPO-MCTS greatly improves the preferability of generated text compared to
the standard practice of using only the PPO policy. Our results demonstrate the
promise of search algorithms even on top of the aligned language models from
PPO, and the under-explored benefit of the value network.

<p class="mathjax">With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless
communications for industrial internet of things (IIoT), this paper studies the
use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single input multiple
output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with
correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise. We first provide a
theoretical analysis on the limitations of non-negative pulse-amplitude
modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood
detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy
levels, when no (statistical) channel state information is available at the
transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for
quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better
exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design
receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit
lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic

<p class="mathjax">Variation in nuclear size and shape is an important criterion of malignancy
for many tumor types; however, categorical estimates by pathologists have poor
reproducibility. Measurements of nuclear characteristics (morphometry) can
improve reproducibility, but manual methods are time consuming. In this study,
we evaluated fully automated morphometry using a deep learning-based algorithm
in 96 canine cutaneous mast cell tumors with information on patient survival.
Algorithmic morphometry was compared with karyomegaly estimates by 11
pathologists, manual nuclear morphometry of 12 cells by 9 pathologists, and the
mitotic count as a benchmark. The prognostic value of automated morphometry was
high with an area under the ROC curve regarding the tumor-specific survival of
0.943 (95% CI: 0.889 - 0.996) for the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear area,
which was higher than manual morphometry of all pathologists combined (0.868,
95% CI: 0.737 - 0.991) and the mitotic count (0.885, 95% CI: 0.765 - 1.00). At
the proposed thresholds, the hazard ratio for algorithmic morphometry (SD of
nuclear area $\geq 9.0 \mu m^2$) was 18.3 (95% CI: 5.0 - 67.1), for manual
morphometry (SD of nuclear area $\geq 10.9 \mu m^2$) 9.0 (95% CI: 6.0 - 13.4),
for karyomegaly estimates 7.6 (95% CI: 5.7 - 10.1), and for the mitotic count
30.5 (95% CI: 7.8 - 118.0). Inter-rater reproducibility for karyomegaly
estimates was fair ($\kappa$ = 0.226) with highly variable
sensitivity/specificity values for the individual pathologists. Reproducibility
for manual morphometry (SD of nuclear area) was good (ICC = 0.654). This study
supports the use of algorithmic morphometry as a prognostic test to overcome
the limitations of estimates and manual measurements.

<p class="mathjax">Different from conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), a
recent innovation called simultaneous transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged, aimed at achieving
complete 360-degree coverage in communication networks. Additionally,
fullduplex (FD) technology is recognized as a potent approach for enhancing
spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception within
the same time and frequency resources. In this study, we investigate the
performance of a STAR-RIS-assisted FD communication system. The STAR-RIS is
strategically placed at the cell-edge to facilitate communication for users
located in this challenging region, while cell-center users can communicate
directly with the FD base station (BS). We employ a non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) pairing scheme and account for system impairments, such as
self-interference at the BS and imperfect successive interference cancellation
(SIC). We derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic rates in both the
up-link and down-link communications and extend our analysis to bidirectional
communication between cell-center and cell-edge users. Furthermore, we
formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the ergodic sum-rate.
This optimization involves adjusting the amplitudes and phase-shifts of the
STAR-RIS elements and allocating total transmit power efficiently. To gain
deeper insights into the achievable rates of STAR-RIS-aided FD systems, we
explore the impact of various system parameters through numerical results.

<p class="mathjax">Online continual learning (OCL) aims to continuously learn new data from a
single pass over the online data stream. It generally suffers from the
catastrophic forgetting issue. Existing replay-based methods effectively
alleviate this issue by replaying part of old data in a proxy-based or
contrastive-based replay manner. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of these two replay manners and find they can be complementary.
Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel replay-based method called
proxy-based contrastive replay (PCR), which replaces anchor-to-sample pairs
with anchor-to-proxy pairs in the contrastive-based loss to alleviate the
phenomenon of forgetting. Based on PCR, we further develop a more advanced
method named holistic proxy-based contrastive replay (HPCR), which consists of
three components. The contrastive component conditionally incorporates
anchor-to-sample pairs to PCR, learning more fine-grained semantic information
with a large training batch. The second is a temperature component that
decouples the temperature coefficient into two parts based on their impacts on
the gradient and sets different values for them to learn more novel knowledge.
The third is a distillation component that constrains the learning process to
keep more historical knowledge. Experiments on four datasets consistently
demonstrate the superiority of HPCR over various state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Purely medical cancer screening methods are often costly, time-consuming, and
weakly applicable on a large scale. Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)
methods greatly help cancer detection but require specific or deep medical
data. These aspects affect the mass implementation of cancer screening methods.
For these reasons, it is a disruptive change for healthcare to apply AI methods
for mass personalized assessment of the cancer risk among patients based on the
existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) volume.
<br />This paper presents a novel method for mass cancer risk prediction using EHR
data. Among other methods, our one stands out by the minimum data greedy
policy, requiring only a history of medical service codes and diagnoses from
EHR. We formulate the problem as a binary classification. This dataset contains
175 441 de-identified patients (2 861 diagnosed with cancer). As a baseline, we
implement a solution based on a recurrent neural network (RNN). We propose a
method that combines machine learning and survival analysis since these
approaches are less computationally heavy, can be combined into an ensemble
(the Survival Ensemble), and can be reproduced in most medical institutions.
<br />We test the Survival Ensemble in some studies. Firstly, we obtain a
significant difference between values of the primary metric (Average Precision)
with 22.8% (ROC AUC 83.7%, F1 17.8%) for the Survival Ensemble versus 15.1%
(ROC AUC 84.9%, F1 21.4%) for the Baseline. Secondly, the performance of the
Survival Ensemble is also confirmed during the ablation study. Thirdly, our
method exceeds age baselines by a significant margin. Fourthly, in the blind
retrospective out-of-time experiment, the proposed method is reliable in cancer
patient detection (9 out of 100 selected). Such results exceed the estimates of
medical screenings, e.g., the best Number Needed to Screen (9 out of 1000
screenings).

<p class="mathjax">Ambient backscatter communication technology (AmBC) and a novel device
category called zero-energy devices (ZED) have recently emerged as potential
components for the forthcoming 6th generation (6G) networks. A ZED communicates
with a smartphone without emitting additional radio waves, by backscattering
ambient waves from base stations. Thanks to its very low consumption, a ZED
powers itself by harvesting ambient light energy. However, the time variations
of data traffic in cellular networks prevents AmBC to work properly. Recent
works have demonstrated experimentally that a backscatter device could be
detected by listening only ambient pilot signals (which are steady) instead of
the whole ambient signal (which is bursty) of 4G. However, these experiments
were run with a 4G base station emulator and a bulky energy greedy backscatter
device. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate real-time AmBC on the
field, with Orange commercial 4G network as ambient source and Orange
Zero-Energy Device.

<p class="mathjax">Class incremental learning (CIL) is a challenging setting of continual
learning, which learns a series of tasks sequentially. Each task consists of a
set of unique classes. The key feature of CIL is that no task identifier (or
task-id) is provided at test time for each test sample. Predicting the task-id
for each test sample is a challenging problem. An emerging theoretically
justified and effective approach is to train a task-specific model for each
task in a shared network for all tasks based on a task-incremental learning
(TIL) method to deal with forgetting. The model for each task in this approach
is an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector rather than a conventional classifier.
The OOD detector can perform both within-task (in-distribution (IND)) class
prediction and OOD detection. The OOD detection capability is the key for
task-id prediction during inference for each test sample. However, this paper
argues that using a traditional OOD detector for task-id prediction is
sub-optimal because additional information (e.g., the replay data and the
learned tasks) available in CIL can be exploited to design a better and
principled method for task-id prediction. We call the new method TPLR (Task-id
Prediction based on Likelihood Ratio}). TPLR markedly outperforms strong CIL
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">During the evacuation of a building, the rapid and accurate tracking of human
evacuees can be used by a guide robot to increase the effectiveness of the
evacuation [1],[2]. This paper introduces a near real-time human position
tracking solution tailored for evacuation robots. Using a pose detector, our
system first identifies human joints in the camera frame in near real-time and
then translates the position of these pixels into real-world coordinates via a
simple calibration process. We run multiple trials of the system in action in
an indoor lab environment and show that the system can achieve an accuracy of
0.55 meters when compared to ground truth. The system can also achieve an
average of 3 frames per second (FPS) which was sufficient for our study on
robot-guided human evacuation. The potential of our approach extends beyond
mere tracking, paving the way for evacuee motion prediction, allowing the robot
to proactively respond to human movements during an evacuation.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of wireless mobile networks towards cloudification, where Radio
Access Network (RAN) functions can be hosted at either a central or distributed
locations, offers many benefits like low cost deployment, higher capacity, and
improved hardware utilization. The flexibility in the functional deployment
comes at the cost of stringent fronthaul (FH) capacity and latency
requirements. One possible approach to deal with these rigorous constraints is
to use FH compression techniques. Due to varying FH load, FH compression needs
to be adaptive, i.e., apply more FH compression in high load to meet FH
capacity and latency requirements and less compression in medium and low load
to improve FH utilization and throughput performance. In this paper, a
model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based FH compression (DRL-FC)
framework is proposed that dynamically controls FH compression through various
configuration parameters such as modulation order, precoder granularity, and
precoder weight quantization that affect both FH load and throughput
performance. Simulation results show that DRL-FC exhibits significantly higher
FH utilization (70.2% on average) and throughput than a reference scheme across
different FH load levels. At the same time, the proposed DRL-FC framework is
able to meet the predefined FH latency constraints under various FH loads.

<p class="mathjax">Versatile and adaptive semantic understanding would enable autonomous systems
to comprehend and interact with their surroundings. Existing fixed-class models
limit the adaptability of indoor mobile and assistive autonomous systems. In
this work, we introduce LEXIS, a real-time indoor Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) system that harnesses the open-vocabulary nature of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to create a unified approach to scene understanding and
place recognition. The approach first builds a topological SLAM graph of the
environment (using visual-inertial odometry) and embeds Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features in the graph nodes. We use this
representation for flexible room classification and segmentation, serving as a
basis for room-centric place recognition. This allows loop closure searches to
be directed towards semantically relevant places. Our proposed system is
evaluated using both public, simulated data and real-world data, covering
office and home environments. It successfully categorizes rooms with varying
layouts and dimensions and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA). For place
recognition and trajectory estimation tasks we achieve equivalent performance
to the SOTA, all also utilizing the same pre-trained model. Lastly, we
demonstrate the system's potential for planning.

<p class="mathjax">Logic locking and hardware Trojans are two fields in hardware security that
have been mostly developed independently from each other. In this paper, we
identify the relationship between these two fields. We find that a common
structure that exists in many logic locking techniques has desirable properties
of hardware Trojans (HWT). We then construct a novel type of HWT, called
Trojans based on Logic Locking (TroLL), in a way that can evade
state-of-the-art ATPG-based HWT detection techniques. In an effort to detect
TroLL, we propose customization of existing state-of-the-art ATPG-based HWT
detection approaches as well as adapting the SAT-based attacks on logic locking
to HWT detection. In our experiments, we use random sampling as reference. It
is shown that the customized ATPG-based approaches are the best performing but
only offer limited improvement over random sampling. Moreover, their efficacy
also diminishes as TroLL's triggers become longer, i.e., have more bits
specified). We thereby highlight the need to find a scalable HWT detection
approach for TroLL.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have become phenomenally surging, since
2018--two decades after introducing context-awareness into computing systems.
Through taking into account the situations of ubiquitous devices, users and the
societies, context-aware computing has enabled a wide spectrum of innovative
applications, such as assisted living, location-based social network services
and so on. To recognize contexts and make decisions for actions accordingly,
various artificial intelligence technologies, such as Ontology and OWL, have
been adopted as representations for context modeling and reasoning. Recently,
with the rise of LLMs and their improved natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, it has become feasible to model contexts using natural
language and perform context reasoning by interacting with LLMs such as ChatGPT
and GPT-4. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the use of texts, prompts, and
autonomous agents (AutoAgents) that enable LLMs to perform context modeling and
reasoning without requiring fine-tuning of the model. We organize and introduce
works in the related field, and name this computing paradigm as the LLM-driven
Context-aware Computing (LCaC). In the LCaC paradigm, users' requests, sensors
reading data, and the command to actuators are supposed to be represented as
texts. Given the text of users' request and sensor data, the AutoAgent models
the context by prompting and sends to the LLM for context reasoning. LLM
generates a plan of actions and responds to the AutoAgent, which later follows
the action plan to foster context-awareness. To prove the concepts, we use two
showcases--(1) operating a mobile z-arm in an apartment for assisted living,
and (2) planning a trip and scheduling the itinerary in a context-aware and
personalized manner.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving holds promise for increased safety, optimized traffic
management, and a new level of convenience in transportation. While model-based
reinforcement learning approaches such as MuZero enables long-term planning,
the exponentially increase of the number of search nodes as the tree goes
deeper significantly effect the searching efficiency.To deal with this problem,
in this paper we proposed the expert-guided motion-encoding tree search (EMTS)
algorithm. EMTS extends the MuZero algorithm by representing possible motions
with a comprehensive motion primitives latent space and incorporating expert
policies toimprove the searching efficiency. The comprehensive motion
primitives latent space enables EMTS to sample arbitrary trajectories instead
of raw action to reduce the depth of the search tree. And the incorporation of
expert policies guided the search and training phases the EMTS algorithm to
enable early convergence. In the experiment section, the EMTS algorithm is
compared with other four algorithms in three challenging scenarios. The
experiment result verifies the effectiveness and the searching efficiency of
the proposed EMTS algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the RGB images and point clouds fusion methods have been proposed
to jointly estimate 2D optical flow and 3D scene flow. However, as both
conventional RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors adopt a frame-based data acquisition
mechanism, their performance is limited by the fixed low sampling rates,
especially in highly-dynamic scenes. By contrast, the event camera can
asynchronously capture the intensity changes with a very high temporal
resolution, providing complementary dynamic information of the observed scenes.
In this paper, we incorporate RGB images, Point clouds and Events for joint
optical flow and scene flow estimation with our proposed multi-stage multimodal
fusion model, RPEFlow. First, we present an attention fusion module with a
cross-attention mechanism to implicitly explore the internal cross-modal
correlation for 2D and 3D branches, respectively. Second, we introduce a mutual
information regularization term to explicitly model the complementary
information of three modalities for effective multimodal feature learning. We
also contribute a new synthetic dataset to advocate further research.
Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our model outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Code and dataset is available
at https://npucvr.github.io/RPEFlow.

<p class="mathjax">A rapidly growing number of voices have argued that AI research, and computer
vision in particular, is closely tied to mass surveillance. Yet the direct path
from computer vision research to surveillance has remained obscured and
difficult to assess. This study reveals the Surveillance AI pipeline. We obtain
three decades of computer vision research papers and downstream patents (more
than 20,000 documents) and present a rich qualitative and quantitative
analysis. This analysis exposes the nature and extent of the Surveillance AI
pipeline, its institutional roots and evolution, and ongoing patterns of
obfuscation. We first perform an in-depth content analysis of computer vision
papers and downstream patents, identifying and quantifying key features and the
many, often subtly expressed, forms of surveillance that appear. On the basis
of this analysis, we present a topology of Surveillance AI that characterizes
the prevalent targeting of human data, practices of data transferal, and
institutional data use. We find stark evidence of close ties between computer
vision and surveillance. The majority (68%) of annotated computer vision papers
and patents self-report their technology enables data extraction about human
bodies and body parts and even more (90%) enable data extraction about humans
in general.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieving adverbs that describe an action in a video poses a crucial step
towards fine-grained video understanding. We propose a framework for
video-to-adverb retrieval (and vice versa) that aligns video embeddings with
their matching compositional adverb-action text embedding in a joint embedding
space. The compositional adverb-action text embedding is learned using a
residual gating mechanism, along with a novel training objective consisting of
triplet losses and a regression target. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on five recent benchmarks for video-adverb retrieval. Furthermore,
we introduce dataset splits to benchmark video-adverb retrieval for unseen
adverb-action compositions on subsets of the MSR-VTT Adverbs and ActivityNet
Adverbs datasets. Our proposed framework outperforms all prior works for the
generalisation task of retrieving adverbs from videos for unseen adverb-action
compositions. Code and dataset splits are available at

<p class="mathjax">In contemporary society, voice-controlled devices, such as smartphones and
home assistants, have become pervasive due to their advanced capabilities and
functionality. The always-on nature of their microphones offers users the
convenience of readily accessing these devices. However, recent research and
events have revealed that such voice-controlled devices are prone to various
forms of malicious attacks, hence making it a growing concern for both users
and researchers to safeguard against such attacks. Despite the numerous studies
that have investigated adversarial attacks and privacy preservation for images,
a conclusive study of this nature has not been conducted for the audio domain.
Therefore, this paper aims to examine existing approaches for
privacy-preserving and privacy-attacking strategies for audio and speech. To
achieve this goal, we classify the attack and defense scenarios into several
categories and provide detailed analysis of each approach. We also interpret
the dissimilarities between the various approaches, highlight their
contributions, and examine their limitations. Our investigation reveals that
voice-controlled devices based on neural networks are inherently susceptible to
specific types of attacks. Although it is possible to enhance the robustness of
such models to certain forms of attack, more sophisticated approaches are
required to comprehensively safeguard user privacy.

<p class="mathjax">Although recent text-to-video (T2V) generation methods have seen significant
advancements, most of these works focus on producing short video clips of a
single event with a single background (i.e., single-scene videos). Meanwhile,
recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in
generating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules such as
image generation models. This raises an important question: can we leverage the
knowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video
generation? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for
consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for
video content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a
single text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it
into a 'video plan', which involves generating the scene descriptions, the
entities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and
consistency groupings of the entities and backgrounds. Next, guided by this
output from the video planner, our video generator, Layout2Vid, has explicit
control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of
entities/backgrounds across scenes, while only trained with image-level
annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoDirectorGPT framework
substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and
multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with visual
consistency across scenes, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs
in open-domain single-scene T2V generation. We also demonstrate that our
framework can dynamically control the strength for layout guidance and can also
generate videos with user-provided images. We hope our framework can inspire
future work on better integrating the planning ability of LLMs into consistent
long video generation.

<p class="mathjax">This scientific paper explores two distinct approaches for identifying and
approximating the simulation model, particularly in the context of the snap
process crucial to medical device assembly. Simulation models play a pivotal
role in providing engineers with insights into industrial processes, enabling
experimentation and troubleshooting before physical assembly. However, their
complexity often results in time-consuming computations.
<br />To mitigate this complexity, we present two distinct methods for identifying
simulation models: one utilizing Spline functions and the other harnessing
Machine Learning (ML) models. Our goal is to create adaptable models that
accurately represent the snap process and can accommodate diverse scenarios.
Such models hold promise for enhancing process understanding and aiding in
decision-making, especially when data availability is limited.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, theoretical analyses of deep neural networks have broadly focused
on two directions: 1) Providing insight into neural network training by SGD in
the limit of infinite hidden-layer width and infinitesimally small learning
rate (also known as gradient flow) via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and 2)
Globally optimizing the regularized training objective via cone-constrained
convex reformulations of ReLU networks. The latter research direction also
yielded an alternative formulation of the ReLU network, called a gated ReLU
network, that is globally optimizable via efficient unconstrained convex
programs. In this work, we interpret the convex program for this gated ReLU
network as a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) model with a weighted data masking
feature map and establish a connection to the NTK. Specifically, we show that
for a particular choice of mask weights that do not depend on the learning
targets, this kernel is equivalent to the NTK of the gated ReLU network on the
training data. A consequence of this lack of dependence on the targets is that
the NTK cannot perform better than the optimal MKL kernel on the training set.
By using iterative reweighting, we improve the weights induced by the NTK to
obtain the optimal MKL kernel which is equivalent to the solution of the exact
convex reformulation of the gated ReLU network. We also provide several
numerical simulations corroborating our theory. Additionally, we provide an
analysis of the prediction error of the resulting optimal kernel via
consistency results for the group lasso.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the internal behavior of Transformer-based Large Language
Models (LLMs) when they generate factually incorrect text. We propose modeling
factual queries as Constraint Satisfaction Problems and use this framework to
investigate how the model interacts internally with factual constraints.
Specifically, we discover a strong positive relation between the model's
attention to constraint tokens and the factual accuracy of its responses. In
our curated suite of 11 datasets with over 40,000 prompts, we study the task of
predicting factual errors with the Llama-2 family across all scales (7B, 13B,
70B). We propose SAT Probe, a method probing self-attention patterns, that can
predict constraint satisfaction and factual errors, and allows early error
identification. The approach and findings demonstrate how using the mechanistic
understanding of factuality in LLMs can enhance reliability.

<p class="mathjax">A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural networks which has a long
history of research and has been studied actively recently in computer vision
and graphics fields. One of the well-known problems of an MLP is the capability
of expressing high-frequency signals from low-dimensional inputs. There are
several studies for input encodings to improve the reconstruction quality of an
MLP by applying pre-processing against the input data. This paper proposes a
novel input encoding method, local positional encoding, which is an extension
of positional and grid encodings. Our proposed method combines these two
encoding techniques so that a small MLP learns high-frequency signals by using
positional encoding with fewer frequencies under the lower resolution of the
grid to consider the local position and scale in each grid cell. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method by applying it to common 2D and 3D
regression tasks where it shows higher-quality results compared to positional
and grid encodings, and comparable results to hierarchical variants of grid
encoding such as multi-resolution grid encoding with equivalent memory
footprint.

<p class="mathjax">This work aims to learn a high-quality text-to-video (T2V) generative model
by leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) model as a basis. It is a
highly desirable yet challenging task to simultaneously a) accomplish the
synthesis of visually realistic and temporally coherent videos while b)
preserving the strong creative generation nature of the pre-trained T2I model.
To this end, we propose LaVie, an integrated video generation framework that
operates on cascaded video latent diffusion models, comprising a base T2V
model, a temporal interpolation model, and a video super-resolution model. Our
key insights are two-fold: 1) We reveal that the incorporation of simple
temporal self-attentions, coupled with rotary positional encoding, adequately
captures the temporal correlations inherent in video data. 2) Additionally, we
validate that the process of joint image-video fine-tuning plays a pivotal role
in producing high-quality and creative outcomes. To enhance the performance of
LaVie, we contribute a comprehensive and diverse video dataset named Vimeo25M,
consisting of 25 million text-video pairs that prioritize quality, diversity,
and aesthetic appeal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of pre-trained LaVie models in various
long video generation and personalized video synthesis applications.

<p class="mathjax">3D perception based on the representations learned from multi-camera
bird's-eye-view (BEV) is trending as cameras are cost-effective for mass
production in autonomous driving industry. However, there exists a distinct
performance gap between multi-camera BEV and LiDAR based 3D object detection.
One key reason is that LiDAR captures accurate depth and other geometry
measurements, while it is notoriously challenging to infer such 3D information
from merely image input. In this work, we propose to boost the representation
learning of a multi-camera BEV based student detector by training it to imitate
the features of a well-trained LiDAR based teacher detector. We propose
effective balancing strategy to enforce the student to focus on learning the
crucial features from the teacher, and generalize knowledge transfer to
multi-scale layers with temporal fusion. We conduct extensive evaluations on
multiple representative models of multi-camera BEV. Experiments reveal that our
approach renders significant improvement over the student models, leading to
the state-of-the-art performance on the popular benchmark nuScenes.

<p class="mathjax">Dense visual correspondence plays a vital role in robotic perception. This
work focuses on establishing the dense correspondence between a pair of images
that captures dynamic scenes undergoing substantial transformations. We
introduce Doduo to learn general dense visual correspondence from in-the-wild
images and videos without ground truth supervision. Given a pair of images, it
estimates the dense flow field encoding the displacement of each pixel in one
image to its corresponding pixel in the other image. Doduo uses flow-based
warping to acquire supervisory signals for the training. Incorporating semantic
priors with self-supervised flow training, Doduo produces accurate dense
correspondence robust to the dynamic changes of the scenes. Trained on an
in-the-wild video dataset, Doduo illustrates superior performance on
point-level correspondence estimation over existing self-supervised
correspondence learning baselines. We also apply Doduo to articulation
estimation and zero-shot goal-conditioned manipulation, underlining its
practical applications in robotics. Code and additional visualizations are
available at https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/Doduo

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we consider the optimization process of minibatch stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) on a 2-layer neural network with data separated by a
quadratic ground truth function. We prove that with data drawn from the
$d$-dimensional Boolean hypercube labeled by the quadratic ``XOR'' function $y
= -x_ix_j$, it is possible to train to a population error $o(1)$ with $d
\:\text{polylog}(d)$ samples. Our result considers simultaneously training both
layers of the two-layer-neural network with ReLU activations via standard
minibatch SGD on the logistic loss. To our knowledge, this work is the first to
give a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d)$ for efficiently learning the XOR
function on isotropic data on a standard neural network with standard training.
Our main technique is showing that the network evolves in two phases: a
$\textit{signal-finding}$ phase where the network is small and many of the
neurons evolve independently to find features, and a $\textit{signal-heavy}$
phase, where SGD maintains and balances the features. We leverage the
simultaneous training of the layers to show that it is sufficient for only a
small fraction of the neurons to learn features, since those neurons will be
amplified by the simultaneous growth of their second layer weights.

<p class="mathjax">We propose InternLM-XComposer, a vision-language large model that enables
advanced image-text comprehension and composition. The innovative nature of our
model is highlighted by three appealing properties: 1) Interleaved Text-Image
Composition: InternLM-XComposer can effortlessly generate coherent and
contextual articles that seamlessly integrate images, providing a more engaging
and immersive reading experience. Simply provide a title, and our system will
generate the corresponding manuscript. It can intelligently identify the areas
in the text where images would enhance the content and automatically insert the
most appropriate visual candidates. 2) Comprehension with Rich Multilingual
Knowledge: The text-image comprehension is empowered by training on extensive
multi-modal multilingual concepts with carefully crafted strategies, resulting
in a deep understanding of visual content. 3) State-of-the-art Performance: Our
model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results across various mainstream
benchmarks for vision-language foundational models, including MME Benchmark,
MMBench, MMBench-CN, Seed-Bench, and CCBench (Chinese Cultural Benchmark).
Collectively, InternLM-XComposer seamlessly blends advanced text-image
comprehension and composition, revolutionizing vision-language interaction and
offering new insights and opportunities. The InternLM-XComposer models with 7B

<p class="mathjax">An emerging line of work has sought to generate plausible imagery from touch.
Existing approaches, however, tackle only narrow aspects of the visuo-tactile
synthesis problem, and lag significantly behind the quality of cross-modal
synthesis methods in other domains. We draw on recent advances in latent
diffusion to create a model for synthesizing images from tactile signals (and
vice versa) and apply it to a number of visuo-tactile synthesis tasks. Using
this model, we significantly outperform prior work on the tactile-driven
stylization problem, i.e., manipulating an image to match a touch signal, and
we are the first to successfully generate images from touch without additional
sources of information about the scene. We also successfully use our model to
address two novel synthesis problems: generating images that do not contain the
touch sensor or the hand holding it, and estimating an image's shading from its
reflectance and touch.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new financial domain large language model, InvestLM, tuned on
LLaMA-65B (Touvron et al., 2023), using a carefully curated instruction dataset
related to financial investment. Inspired by less-is-more-for-alignment (Zhou
et al., 2023), we manually curate a small yet diverse instruction dataset,
covering a wide range of financial related topics, from Chartered Financial
Analyst (CFA) exam questions to SEC filings to Stackexchange quantitative
finance discussions. InvestLM shows strong capabilities in understanding
financial text and provides helpful responses to investment related questions.
Financial experts, including hedge fund managers and research analysts, rate
InvestLM's response as comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial
models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Claude-2). Zero-shot evaluation on a set of
financial NLP benchmarks demonstrates strong generalizability. From a research
perspective, this work suggests that a high-quality domain specific LLM can be
tuned using a small set of carefully curated instructions on a well-trained
foundation model, which is consistent with the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis
(Zhou et al., 2023). From a practical perspective, this work develops a
state-of-the-art financial domain LLM with superior capability in understanding
financial texts and providing helpful investment advice, potentially enhancing
the work efficiency of financial professionals. We release the model parameters
to the research community.

<p class="mathjax">We study the query complexity of slices of Boolean functions. Among other
results we show that there exists a Boolean function for which we need to query
all but 7 input bits to compute its value, even if we know beforehand that the
number of 0's and 1's in the input are the same, i.e. when our input is from
the middle slice. This answers a question of Byramji. Our proof is
non-constructive, but we also propose a concrete candidate function that might
have the above property. Our results are related to certain natural discrepancy
type questions that -- somewhat surprisingly -- have not been studied before.

<p class="mathjax">Satellite altimetry combined with data assimilation and optimal interpolation
schemes have deeply renewed our ability to monitor sea surface dynamics.
Recently, deep learning (DL) schemes have emerged as appealing solutions to
address space-time interpolation problems. The scarcity of real altimetry
dataset, in terms of space-time coverage of the sea surface, however impedes
the training of state-of-the-art neural schemes on real-world case-studies.
Here, we leverage both simulations of ocean dynamics and satellite altimeters
to train simulation-based neural mapping schemes for the sea surface height and
demonstrate their performance for real altimetry datasets. We analyze further
how the ocean simulation dataset used during the training phase impacts this
performance. This experimental analysis covers both the resolution from
eddy-present configurations to eddy-rich ones, forced simulations vs.
reanalyses using data assimilation and tide-free vs. tide-resolving
simulations. Our benchmarking framework focuses on a Gulf Stream region for a
realistic 5-altimeter constellation using NEMO ocean simulations and 4DVarNet
mapping schemes. All simulation-based 4DVarNets outperform the operational
observation-driven and reanalysis products, namely DUACS and GLORYS. The more
realistic the ocean simulation dataset used during the training phase, the
better the mapping. The best 4DVarNet mapping was trained from an eddy-rich and
tide-free simulation datasets. It improves the resolved longitudinal scale from
151 kilometers for DUACS and 241 kilometers for GLORYS to 98 kilometers and
reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 23% and 61%. These results open
research avenues for new synergies between ocean modelling and ocean
observation using learning-based approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed optimization is a fundamental framework for collaborative
inference and decision making in decentralized multi-agent systems. The
operation is modeled as the joint minimization of a shared objective which
typically depends on observations gathered locally by each agent. Distributed
optimization algorithms, such as the common D-ADMM, tackle this task by
iteratively combining local computations and message exchanges. One of the main
challenges associated with distributed optimization, and particularly with
D-ADMM, is that it requires a large number of communications, i.e., messages
exchanged between the agents, to reach consensus. This can make D-ADMM costly
in power, latency, and channel resources. In this work we propose unfolded
D-ADMM, which follows the emerging deep unfolding methodology to enable D-ADMM
to operate reliably with a predefined and small number of messages exchanged by
each agent. Unfolded D-ADMM fully preserves the operation of D-ADMM, while
leveraging data to tune the hyperparameters of each iteration of the algorithm.
These hyperparameters can either be agent-specific, aiming at achieving the
best performance within a fixed number of iterations over a given network, or
shared among the agents, allowing to learn to distributedly optimize over
different networks. For both settings, our unfolded D-ADMM operates with
limited communications, while preserving the interpretability and flexibility
of the original D-ADMM algorithm. We specialize unfolded D-ADMM for two
representative settings: a distributed estimation task, considering a sparse
recovery setup, and a distributed learning scenario, where multiple agents
collaborate in learning a machine learning model. Our numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed approach dramatically reduces the number of
communications utilized by D-ADMM, without compromising on its performance.

<p class="mathjax">Chance constraints are frequently used to limit the probability of constraint
violations in real-world optimization problems where the constraints involve
stochastic components. We study chance-constrained submodular optimization
problems, which capture a wide range of optimization problems with stochastic
constraints. Previous studies considered submodular problems with stochastic
knapsack constraints in the case where uncertainties are the same for each item
that can be selected. However, uncertainty levels are usually variable with
respect to the different stochastic components in real-world scenarios, and
rigorous analysis for this setting is missing in the context of submodular
optimization. This paper provides the first such analysis for this case, where
the weights of items have the same expectation but different dispersion. We
present greedy algorithms that can obtain a high-quality solution, i.e., a
constant approximation ratio to the given optimal solution from the
deterministic setting. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithms
perform effectively on several chance-constrained instances of the maximum
coverage problem and the influence maximization problem.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a polynomial-complexity algorithm to construct a
special orthogonal matrix for the deterministic remote state preparation (DRSP)
of an arbitrary n-qubit state, and prove that if n&gt;3, such matrices do not
exist. Firstly, the construction problem is split into two sub-problems, i.e.,
finding a solution of a semi-orthogonal matrix and generating all
semi-orthogonal matrices. Through giving the definitions and properties of the
matching operators, it is proved that the orthogonality of a special matrix is
equivalent to the cooperation of multiple matching operators, and then the
construction problem is reduced to the problem of solving an XOR linear
equation system, which reduces the construction complexity from exponential to
polynomial level. Having proved that each semi-orthogonal matrix can be
simplified into a unique form, we use the proposed algorithm to confirm that
the unique form does not have any solution when n&gt;3, which means it is
infeasible to construct such a special orthogonal matrix for the DRSP of an
arbitrary n-qubit state.

<p class="mathjax">In order to solve the problem of non-ideal training sets (i.e., the
less-complete or over-complete sets) and implement one-iteration learning, a
novel efficient quantum perceptron algorithm based on unitary weights is
proposed, where the singular value decomposition of the total weight matrix
from the training set is calculated to make the weight matrix to be unitary.
The example validation of quantum gates {H, S, T, CNOT, Toffoli, Fredkin} shows
that our algorithm can accurately implement arbitrary quantum gates within one
iteration. The performance comparison between our algorithm and other quantum
perceptron algorithms demonstrates the advantages of our algorithm in terms of
applicability, accuracy, and availability. For further validating the
applicability of our algorithm, a quantum composite gate which consists of
several basic quantum gates is also illustrated.

<p class="mathjax">The classic forgery attacks on COPA, AES-COPA and Marble authenticated
encryption algorithms need to query about 2^(n/2) times, and their success
probability is not high. To solve this problem, the corresponding quantum
forgery attacks on COPA, AES-COPA and Marble authenticated encryption
algorithms are presented. In the quantum forgery attacks on COPA and AES-COPA,
we use Simon's algorithm to find the period of the tag generation function in
COPA and AES-COPA by querying in superposition, and then generate a forged tag
for a new message. In the quantum forgery attack on Marble, Simon's algorithm
is used to recover the secret parameter L, and the forged tag can be computed
with L. Compared with classic forgery attacks on COPA, AES-COPA and Marble, our
attack can reduce the number of queries from O(2^(n/2)) to O(n) and improve
success probability close to 100%.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) reconstruction particularly of MRI has led to improvements
in image fidelity and reduction of acquisition time. In neuroimaging, DL
methods can reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled data. However, it
is essential to consider fairness in DL algorithms, particularly in terms of
demographic characteristics. This study presents the first fairness analysis in
a DL-based brain MRI reconstruction model. The model utilises the U-Net
architecture for image reconstruction and explores the presence and sources of
unfairness by implementing baseline Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM) and
rebalancing strategies. Model performance is evaluated using image
reconstruction metrics. Our findings reveal statistically significant
performance biases between the gender and age subgroups. Surprisingly, data
imbalance and training discrimination are not the main sources of bias. This
analysis provides insights of fairness in DL-based image reconstruction and
aims to improve equity in medical AI applications.

<p class="mathjax">The paper explores mathematical methods that differentiate regular and
chaotic time series, specifically for identifying pathological fistulas. It
proposes a noise-resistant method for classifying responding rows of normally
and pathologically functioning fistulas. This approach is grounded in the
hypothesis that laminar blood flow signifies normal function, while turbulent
flow indicates pathology. The study explores two distinct methods for
distinguishing chaotic from regular time series. The first method involves
mapping the time series onto the entropy-complexity plane and subsequently
comparing it to established clusters. The second method, introduced by the
authors, constructs a concepts-objects graph using formal concept analysis.
Both of these methods exhibit high efficiency in determining the state of the
fistula.

<p class="mathjax">Functional peptides have the potential to treat a variety of diseases. Their
good therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity make them ideal therapeutic agents.
Artificial intelligence-based computational strategies can help quickly
identify new functional peptides from collections of protein sequences and
discover their different functions.Using protein language model-based
embeddings (ESM-2), we developed a tool called pLMFPPred (Protein Language
Model-based Functional Peptide Predictor) for predicting functional peptides
and identifying toxic peptides. We also introduced SMOTE-TOMEK data synthesis

imbalance issues and reduce computational costs. On a validated independent
test set, pLMFPPred achieved accuracy, Area under the curve - Receiver
Operating Characteristics, and F1-Score values of 0.974, 0.99, and 0.974,
respectively. Comparative experiments show that pLMFPPred outperforms current
methods for predicting functional peptides.The experimental results suggest
that the proposed method (pLMFPPred) can provide better performance in terms of
Accuracy, Area under the curve - Receiver Operating Characteristics, and
F1-Score than existing methods. pLMFPPred has achieved good performance in
predicting functional peptides and represents a new computational method for
predicting functional peptides.

<p class="mathjax">There is an ongoing effort to find quantum speedups for learning problems.
Recently, [Y. Liu et al., Nat. Phys. $\textbf{17}$, 1013--1017 (2021)] have
proven an exponential speedup for quantum support vector machines by leveraging
the speedup of Shor's algorithm. We expand upon this result and identify a
speedup utilizing Grover's algorithm in the kernel of a support vector machine.
To show the practicality of the kernel structure we apply it to a problem
related to pattern matching, providing a practical yet provable advantage.
Moreover, we show that combining quantum computation in a preprocessing step
with classical methods for classification further improves classifier
performance.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most natural connections between quantum and classical machine
learning has been established in the context of kernel methods. Kernel methods
rely on kernels, which are inner products of feature vectors living in large
feature spaces. Quantum kernels are typically evaluated by explicitly
constructing quantum feature states and then taking their inner product, here
called embedding quantum kernels. Since classical kernels are usually evaluated
without using the feature vectors explicitly, we wonder how expressive
embedding quantum kernels are. In this work, we raise the fundamental question:
can all quantum kernels be expressed as the inner product of quantum feature
states? Our first result is positive: Invoking computational universality, we
find that for any kernel function there always exists a corresponding quantum
feature map and an embedding quantum kernel. The more operational reading of
the question is concerned with efficient constructions, however. In a second
part, we formalize the question of universality of efficient embedding quantum
kernels. For shift-invariant kernels, we use the technique of random Fourier
features to show that they are universal within the broad class of all kernels
which allow a variant of efficient Fourier sampling. We then extend this result
to a new class of so-called composition kernels, which we show also contains
projected quantum kernels introduced in recent works. After proving the
universality of embedding quantum kernels for both shift-invariant and
composition kernels, we identify the directions towards new, more exotic, and
unexplored quantum kernel families, for which it still remains open whether
they correspond to efficient embedding quantum kernels.

<p class="mathjax">The computational method of discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), used as a
coarse-grained model of true atomistic dynamics of lattice dislocations, has
become of powerful tool to study metal plasticity arising from the collective
behavior of dislocations. As a mesoscale approach, motion of dislocations in
the DDD model is prescribed via the mobility law; a function which specifies
how dislocation lines should respond to the driving force. However, the
development of traditional hand-crafted mobility laws can be a cumbersome task
and may involve detrimental simplifications. Here we introduce a
machine-learning (ML) framework to streamline the development of data-driven
mobility laws which are modeled as graph neural networks (GNN) trained on
large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of crystal plasticity. We
illustrate our approach on BCC tungsten and demonstrate that our GNN mobility
implemented in large-scale DDD simulations accurately reproduces the
challenging tension/compression asymmetry observed in ground-truth MD
simulations while correctly predicting the flow stress at lower straining rate
conditions unseen during training, thereby demonstrating the ability of our
method to learn relevant dislocation physics. Our DDD+ML approach opens new
promising avenues to improve fidelity of the DDD model and to incorporate more
complex dislocation motion behaviors in an automated way, providing a faithful
proxy for dislocation dynamics several orders of magnitude faster than
ground-truth MD simulations.

<p class="mathjax">In ski jumping, low repetition rates of jumps limit the effectiveness of
training. Thus, increasing learning rate within every single jump is key to
success. A critical element of athlete training is motor learning, which has
been shown to be accelerated by feedback methods. In particular, a fine-grained
control of the center of gravity in the in-run is essential. This is because
the actual takeoff occurs within a blink of an eye ($\sim$300ms), thus any
unbalanced body posture during the in-run will affect flight. This paper
presents a smart, compact, and energy-efficient wireless sensor system for
real-time performance analysis and biofeedback during ski jumping. The system
operates by gauging foot pressures at three distinct points on the insoles of
the ski boot at 100Hz. Foot pressure data can either be directly sent to
coaches to improve their feedback, or fed into a ML model to give athletes
instantaneous in-action feedback using a vibration motor in the ski boot. In
the biofeedback scenario, foot pressures act as input variables for an
optimized XGBoost model. We achieve a high predictive accuracy of 92.7% for
center of mass predictions (dorsal shift, neutral stand, ventral shift).
Subsequently, we parallelized and fine-tuned our XGBoost model for a RISC-V
based low power parallel processor (GAP9), based on the PULP architecture. We
demonstrate real-time detection and feedback (0.0109ms/inference) using our
on-chip deployment. The proposed smart system is unobtrusive with a slim form
factor (13mm baseboard, 3.2mm antenna) and a lightweight build (26g). Power
consumption analysis reveals that the system's energy-efficient design enables
sustained operation over multiple days (up to 300 hours) without requiring
recharge.

<p class="mathjax">Data collection and annotation is a laborious, time-consuming prerequisite
for supervised machine learning tasks. Online Active Learning (OAL) is a
paradigm that addresses this issue by simultaneously minimizing the amount of
annotation required to train a classifier and adapting to changes in the data
over the duration of the data collection process. Prior work has indicated that
fluctuating class distributions and data drift are still common problems for
OAL. This work presents new loss functions that address these challenges when
OAL is applied to Sound Event Detection (SED). Experimental results from the
SONYC dataset and two Voice-Type Discrimination (VTD) corpora indicate that OAL
can reduce the time and effort required to train SED classifiers by a factor of
5 for SONYC, and that the new methods presented here successfully resolve
issues present in existing OAL methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances with self-supervised learning have allowed speech recognition
systems to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) word error rates (WER) while
requiring only a fraction of the labeled training data needed by its
predecessors. Notwithstanding, while such models achieve SOTA performance in
matched train/test conditions, their performance degrades substantially when
tested in unseen conditions. To overcome this problem, strategies such as data
augmentation and/or domain shift training have been explored. Available models,
however, are still too large to be considered for edge speech applications on
resource-constrained devices, thus model compression tools are needed. In this
paper, we explore the effects that train/test mismatch conditions have on
speech recognition accuracy based on compressed self-supervised speech models.
In particular, we report on the effects that parameter quantization and model
pruning have on speech recognition accuracy based on the so-called robust
wav2vec 2.0 model under noisy, reverberant, and noise-plus-reverberation
conditions.

<p class="mathjax">In treating gastrointestinal cancer using radiotherapy, the role of the
radiation oncologist is to administer high doses of radiation, through x-ray
beams, toward the tumor while avoiding the stomach and intestines. With the
advent of precise radiation treatment technology such as the MR-Linac,
oncologists can visualize the daily positions of the tumors and intestines,
which may vary day to day. Before delivering radiation, radio oncologists must
manually outline the position of the gastrointestinal organs in order to
determine position and direction of the x-ray beam. This is a time consuming
and labor intensive process that may substantially prolong a patient's
treatment. A deep learning (DL) method can automate and expedite the process.
However, many deep neural networks approaches currently in use are black-boxes
which lack interpretability which render them untrustworthy and impractical in
a healthcare setting. To address this, an emergent field of AI known as
Explainable AI (XAI) may be incorporated to improve the transparency and
viability of a model. This paper proposes a deep learning pipeline that
incorporates XAI to address the challenges of organ segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Excerpts are widely used to preview and promote musical works. Effective
excerpts induce consumption of the source musical work and thus generate
revenue. Yet, what makes an excerpt effective remains unexplored. We leverage a
policy change by Apple that generates quasi-exogenous variation in the excerpts
of songs in the iTunes Music Store to estimate that having a 60 second longer
excerpt increases songs' unique monthly listeners by 5.4% on average, by 9.7%
for lesser known songs, and by 11.1% for lesser known artists. This is
comparable to the impact of being featured on the Spotify Global Top 50
playlist. We develop measures of musical repetition and unpredictability to
examine information provision as a mechanism, and find that the
demand-enhancing effect of longer excerpts is suppressed when they are
repetitive, too predictable, or too unpredictable. Our findings support
platforms' adoption of longer excerpts to improve content discovery and our
measures can help inform excerpt selection in practice.

<p class="mathjax">This study aims to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in
predicting $\geq$M-class solar flares with a prediction window of 24 hours,
using hourly sampled full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images,
particularly focusing on the often overlooked flare events corresponding to the
near-limb regions (beyond $\pm$70$^{\circ}$ of the solar disk). We trained
three well-known deep learning architectures--AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet34
using transfer learning and compared and evaluated the overall performance of
our models using true skill statistics (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS) and
computed recall scores to understand the prediction sensitivity in central and
near-limb regions for both X- and M-class flares. The following points
summarize the key findings of our study: (1) The highest overall performance
was observed with the AlexNet-based model, which achieved an average
TSS$\sim$0.53 and HSS$\sim$0.37; (2) Further, a spatial analysis of recall
scores disclosed that for the near-limb events, the VGG16- and ResNet34-based
models exhibited superior prediction sensitivity. The best results, however,
were seen with the ResNet34-based model for the near-limb flares, where the
average recall was approximately 0.59 (the recall for X- and M-class was 0.81
and 0.56 respectively) and (3) Our research findings demonstrate that our
models are capable of discerning complex spatial patterns from full-disk
magnetograms and exhibit skill in predicting solar flares, even in the vicinity
of near-limb regions. This ability holds substantial importance for operational
flare forecasting systems.

<p class="mathjax">To date, endovascular surgeries are performed using the golden standard of
Fluoroscopy, which uses ionising radiation to visualise catheters and
vasculature. Prolonged Fluoroscopic exposure is harmful for the patient and the
clinician, and may lead to severe post-operative sequlae such as the
development of cancer. Meanwhile, the use of interventional Ultrasound has
gained popularity, due to its well-known benefits of small spatial footprint,
fast data acquisition, and higher tissue contrast images. However, ultrasound
images are hard to interpret, and it is difficult to localise vessels,
catheters, and guidewires within them. This work proposes a solution using an
adaptation of a state-of-the-art machine learning transformer architecture to
detect and segment catheters in axial interventional Ultrasound image
sequences. The network architecture was inspired by the Attention in Attention
mechanism, temporal tracking networks, and introduced a novel 3D segmentation
head that performs 3D deconvolution across time. In order to facilitate
training of such deep learning networks, we introduce a new data synthesis
pipeline that used physics-based catheter insertion simulations, along with a
convolutional ray-casting ultrasound simulator to produce synthetic ultrasound
images of endovascular interventions. The proposed method is validated on a
hold-out validation dataset, thus demonstrated robustness to ultrasound noise
and a wide range of scanning angles. It was also tested on data collected from
silicon-based aorta phantoms, thus demonstrated its potential for translation
from sim-to-real. This work represents a significant step towards safer and
more efficient endovascular surgery using interventional ultrasound.

<p class="mathjax">Pitch estimation is an essential step of many speech processing algorithms,
including speech coding, synthesis, and enhancement. Recently, pitch estimators
based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have have been outperforming
well-established DSP-based techniques. Unfortunately, these new estimators can
be impractical to deploy in real-time systems, both because of their relatively
high complexity, and the fact that some require significant lookahead. We show
that a hybrid estimator using a small deep neural network (DNN) with
traditional DSP-based features can match or exceed the performance of pure
DNN-based models, with a complexity and algorithmic delay comparable to
traditional DSP-based algorithms. We further demonstrate that this hybrid
approach can provide benefits for a neural vocoding task.

<p class="mathjax">Speech codec enhancement methods are designed to remove distortions added by
speech codecs. While classical methods are very low in complexity and add zero
delay, their effectiveness is rather limited. Compared to that, DNN-based
methods deliver higher quality but they are typically high in complexity and/or
require delay. The recently proposed Linear Adaptive Coding Enhancer (LACE)
addresses this problem by combining DNNs with classical long-term/short-term
postfiltering resulting in a causal low-complexity model. A short-coming of the
LACE model is, however, that quality quickly saturates when the model size is
scaled up. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel adatpive temporal
shaping module that adds high temporal resolution to the LACE model resulting
in the Non-Linear Adaptive Coding Enhancer (NoLACE). We adapt NoLACE to enhance
the Opus codec and show that NoLACE significantly outperforms both the Opus
baseline and an enlarged LACE model at 6, 9 and 12 kb/s. We also show that LACE
and NoLACE are well-behaved when used with an ASR system.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial neural networks are highly successfully trained with
backpropagation. For spiking neural networks, however, a similar gradient
descent scheme seems prohibitive due to the sudden, disruptive (dis-)appearance
of spikes. Here, we demonstrate exact gradient descent learning based on
spiking dynamics that change only continuously. These are generated by neuron
models whose spikes vanish and appear at the end of a trial, where they do not
influence other neurons anymore. This also enables gradient-based spike
addition and removal. We apply our learning scheme to induce and continuously
move spikes to desired times, in single neurons and recurrent networks.
Further, it achieves competitive performance in a benchmark task using deep,
initially silent networks. Our results show how non-disruptive learning is
possible despite discrete spikes.

<p class="mathjax">The measurement of retinal blood flow (RBF) in capillaries can provide a
powerful biomarker for the early diagnosis and treatment of ocular diseases.
However, no single modality can determine capillary flowrates with high
precision. Combining erythrocyte-mediated angiography (EMA) with optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has the potential to achieve this goal,
as EMA can measure the absolute 2D RBF of retinal microvasculature and OCTA can
provide the 3D structural images of capillaries. However, multimodal retinal
image registration between these two modalities remains largely unexplored. To
fill this gap, we establish MEMO, the first public multimodal EMA and OCTA
retinal image dataset. A unique challenge in multimodal retinal image
registration between these modalities is the relatively large difference in
vessel density (VD). To address this challenge, we propose a segmentation-based
deep-learning framework (VDD-Reg) and a new evaluation metric (MSD), which
provide robust results despite differences in vessel density. VDD-Reg consists
of a vessel segmentation module and a registration module. To train the vessel
segmentation module, we further designed a two-stage semi-supervised learning
framework (LVD-Seg) combining supervised and unsupervised losses. We
demonstrate that VDD-Reg outperforms baseline methods quantitatively and
qualitatively for cases of both small VD differences (using the CF-FA dataset)
and large VD differences (using our MEMO dataset). Moreover, VDD-Reg requires
as few as three annotated vessel segmentation masks to maintain its accuracy,
demonstrating its feasibility.

<p class="mathjax">Given a sample of size $N$, it is often useful to select a subsample of
smaller size $n&lt;N$ to be used for statistical estimation or learning. Such a
data selection step is useful to reduce the requirements of data labeling and
the computational complexity of learning. We assume to be given $N$ unlabeled
samples $\{{\boldsymbol x}_i\}_{i\le N}$, and to be given access to a
`surrogate model' that can predict labels $y_i$ better than random guessing.
Our goal is to select a subset of the samples, to be denoted by $\{{\boldsymbol
x}_i\}_{i\in G}$, of size $|G|=n&lt;N$. We then acquire labels for this set and we
use them to train a model via regularized empirical risk minimization.
<br />By using a mixture of numerical experiments on real and synthetic data, and
mathematical derivations under low- and high- dimensional asymptotics, we show
that: $(i)$~Data selection can be very effective, in particular beating
training on the full sample in some cases; $(ii)$~Certain popular choices in
data selection methods (e.g. unbiased reweighted subsampling, or influence
function-based subsampling) can be substantially suboptimal.

<p class="mathjax">Randomized control trials, RCTs, have become a powerful tool for assessing
the impact of interventions and policies in many contexts. They are considered
the gold-standard for inference in the biomedical fields and in many social
sciences. Researchers have published an increasing number of studies that rely
on RCTs for at least part of the inference, and these studies typically include
the response data collected, de-identified and sometimes protected through
traditional disclosure limitation methods. In this paper, we empirically assess
the impact of strong privacy-preservation methodology (with \ac{DP}
guarantees), on published analyses from RCTs, leveraging the availability of
replication packages (research compendia) in economics and policy analysis. We
provide simulations studies and demonstrate how we can replicate the analysis
in a published economics article on privacy-protected data under various
parametrizations. We find that relatively straightforward DP-based methods
allow for inference-valid protection of the published data, though
computational issues may limit more complex analyses from using these methods.
The results have applicability to researchers wishing to share RCT data,
especially in the context of low- and middle-income countries, with strong
privacy protection.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: The aim of this work is to develop a neural network training
framework for continual training of small amounts of medical imaging data and
create heuristics to assess training in the absence of a hold-out validation or
test set.
<br />Materials and Methods: We formulated a retrospective sequential learning
approach that would train and consistently update a model on mini-batches of
medical images over time. We address problems that impede sequential learning
such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and concept drift through PyTorch
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and publicly available Medical MNIST and
NIH Chest X-Ray imaging datasets. We begin by comparing two methods for a
sequentially trained CNN with and without base pre-training. We then transition
to two methods of unique training and validation data recruitment to estimate
full information extraction without overfitting. Lastly, we consider an example
of real-life data that shows how our approach would see mainstream research
implementation.
<br />Results: For the first experiment, both approaches successfully reach a ~95%
accuracy threshold, although the short pre-training step enables sequential
accuracy to plateau in fewer steps. The second experiment comparing two methods
showed better performance with the second method which crosses the ~90%
accuracy threshold much sooner. The final experiment showed a slight advantage
with a pre-training step that allows the CNN to cross ~60% threshold much
sooner than without pre-training.
<br />Conclusion: We have displayed sequential learning as a serviceable
multi-classification technique statistically comparable to traditional CNNs
that can acquire data in small increments feasible for clinically realistic
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional approaches to variational inference rely on parametric families
of variational distributions, with the choice of family playing a critical role
in determining the accuracy of the resulting posterior approximation. Simple
mean-field families often lead to poor approximations, while rich families of
distributions like normalizing flows can be difficult to optimize and usually
do not incorporate the known structure of the target distribution due to their
black-box nature. To expand the space of flexible variational families, we
revisit Variational Rejection Sampling (VRS) [Grover et al., 2018], which
combines a parametric proposal distribution with rejection sampling to define a
rich non-parametric family of distributions that explicitly utilizes the known
target distribution. By introducing a low-variance reparameterized gradient
estimator for the parameters of the proposal distribution, we make VRS an
attractive inference strategy for models with continuous latent variables. We
argue theoretically and demonstrate empirically that the resulting
method--Reparameterized Variational Rejection Sampling (RVRS)--offers an
attractive trade-off between computational cost and inference fidelity. In
experiments we show that our method performs well in practice and that it is
well-suited for black-box inference, especially for models with local latent
variables.

<p class="mathjax">Thresholds in treatment assignments can produce discontinuities in outcomes,
revealing causal insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, these
thresholds are unknown and multivariate. We propose a non-parametric method to
estimate the resulting discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface
into smooth and discontinuous parts. This estimator uses a convex relaxation of
the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish identification and
convergence. Using our method, we estimate that an internet shutdown in India
resulted in a reduction of economic activity by over 50%, greatly surpassing
previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns
for digital economies globally.

<p class="mathjax">Set-membership estimation is commonly used in adaptive/learning-based control
algorithms that require robustness over the model uncertainty sets, e.g.,
online robustly stabilizing control and robust adaptive model predictive
control. Despite having broad applications, non-asymptotic estimation error
bounds in the stochastic setting are limited. This paper provides such a
non-asymptotic bound on the diameter of the uncertainty sets generated by set
membership estimation on linear dynamical systems under bounded, i.i.d.
disturbances. Further, this result is applied to robust adaptive model
predictive control with uncertainty sets updated by set membership. We
numerically demonstrate the performance of the robust adaptive controller,
which rapidly approaches the performance of the offline optimal model
predictive controller, in comparison with the control design based on least
square estimation's confidence regions.

<p class="mathjax">The evolution of computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms has prompted
significant improvements in the performances of holographic displays.
Nonetheless, they start to encounter a limited degree of freedom in CGH
optimization and physical constraints stemming from the coherent nature of
holograms. To surpass the physical limitations, we consider polarization as a
new degree of freedom by utilizing a novel optical platform called metasurface.
Polarization-multiplexing metasurfaces enable incoherent-like behavior in
holographic displays due to the mutual incoherence of orthogonal polarization
states. We leverage this unique characteristic of a metasurface by integrating
it into a holographic display and exploiting polarization diversity to bring an
additional degree of freedom for CGH algorithms. To minimize the speckle noise
while maximizing the image quality, we devise a fully differentiable
optimization pipeline by taking into account the metasurface proxy model,
thereby jointly optimizing spatial light modulator phase patterns and geometric
parameters of metasurface nanostructures. We evaluate the metasurface-enabled
depolarized holography through simulations and experiments, demonstrating its
ability to reduce speckle noise and enhance image quality.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of speaker verification, session or channel variability poses a
significant challenge. While many contemporary methods aim to disentangle
session information from speaker embeddings, we introduce a novel approach
using an additional embedding to represent the session information. This is
achieved by training an auxiliary network appended to the speaker embedding
extractor which remains fixed in this training process. This results in two
similarity scores: one for the speakers information and one for the session
information. The latter score acts as a compensator for the former that might
be skewed due to session variations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
session information can be effectively compensated without retraining of the
embedding extractor.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, self-attention-based transformers and conformers have been
introduced as alternatives to RNNs for ASR acoustic modeling. Nevertheless, the
full-sequence attention mechanism is non-streamable and computationally
expensive, thus requiring modifications, such as chunking and caching, for
efficient streaming ASR. In this paper, we propose to apply RWKV, a variant of
linear attention transformer, to streaming ASR. RWKV combines the superior
performance of transformers and the inference efficiency of RNNs, which is
well-suited for streaming ASR scenarios where the budget for latency and memory
is restricted. Experiments on varying scales (100h - 10000h) demonstrate that
RWKV-Transducer and RWKV-Boundary-Aware-Transducer achieve comparable to or
even better accuracy compared with chunk conformer transducer, with minimal
latency and inference memory cost.

<p class="mathjax">We present a non-supervised approach to optimize and evaluate the synthesis
of non-speech audio effects from a speech production model. We use the Pink
Trombone synthesizer as a case study of a simplified production model of the
vocal tract to target non-speech human audio signals --yawnings. We selected
and optimized the control parameters of the synthesizer to minimize the
difference between real and generated audio. We validated the most common
optimization techniques reported in the literature and a specifically designed
neural network. We evaluated several popular quality metrics as error
functions. These include both objective quality metrics and
subjective-equivalent metrics. We compared the results in terms of total error
and computational demand. Results show that genetic and swarm optimizers
outperform least squares algorithms at the cost of executing slower and that
specific combinations of optimizers and audio representations offer
significantly different results. The proposed methodology could be used in
benchmarking other physical models and audio types.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes a maximum likelihood (ML)-based parameter estimation
framework for a millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system in a multi-static configuration using energy-efficient hybrid
digital-analog arrays. Due to the typically large arrays deployed in the higher
frequency bands to mitigate isotropic path loss, such arrays may operate in the
near-field regime. The proposed parameter estimation in this work consists of a
two-stage estimation process, where the first stage is based on far-field
assumptions, and is used to obtain a first estimate of the target parameters.
In cases where the target is determined to be in the near-field of the arrays,
a second estimation based on near-field assumptions is carried out to obtain
more accurate estimates. In particular, we select beamfocusing array weights
designed to achieve a constant gain over an extended spatial region and
re-estimate the target parameters at the receivers. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in numerous scenarios through numerical
simulations and demonstrate the impact of the custom-designed flat-gain
beamfocusing codewords in increasing the communication performance of the
system.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate climate projections are required for climate adaptation and
mitigation. Earth system model simulations, used to project climate change,
inherently make approximations in their representation of small-scale physical
processes, such as clouds, that are at the root of the uncertainties in global
mean temperature's response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Several
approaches have been developed to use historical observations to constrain
future projections and reduce uncertainties in climate projections and climate
feedbacks. Yet those methods cannot capture the non-linear complexity inherent
in the climate system. Using a Transfer Learning approach, we show that Machine
Learning, in particular Deep Neural Networks, can be used to optimally leverage
and merge the knowledge gained from Earth system model simulations and
historical observations to more accurately project global surface temperature
fields in the 21st century. For the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 2-4.5,
3-7.0 and 5-8.5, we refine regional estimates and the global projection of the
average global temperature in 2081-2098 (with respect to the period 1850-1900)
to 2.73{\deg}C (2.44-3.11{\deg}C), 3.92{\deg}C (3.5-4.47{\deg}C) and
4.53{\deg}C (3.69-5.5{\deg}C), respectively, compared to the unconstrained
2.7{\deg}C (1.65-3.8{\deg}C), 3.71{\deg}C (2.56-4.97{\deg}C) and 4.47{\deg}C
(2.95-6.02{\deg}C). Our findings show that the 1.5{\deg}C threshold of the
Paris' agreement will be crossed in 2031 (2028-2034) for SSP2-4.5, in 2029
(2027-2031) for SSP3-7.0 and in 2028 (2025-2031) for SSP5-8.5. Similarly, the
2{\deg}C threshold will be exceeded in 2051 (2045-2059), 2044 (2040-2047) and
2042 (2038-2047) respectively. Our new method provides more accurate climate
projections urgently required for climate adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">We derive quantitative error bounds for deep neural networks (DNNs)
approximating option prices on a $d$-dimensional risky asset as functions of
the underlying model parameters, payoff parameters and initial conditions. We
cover a general class of stochastic volatility models of Markovian nature as
well as the rough Bergomi model. In particular, under suitable assumptions we
show that option prices can be learned by DNNs up to an arbitrary small error
$\varepsilon \in (0,1/2)$ while the network size grows only sub-polynomially in
the asset vector dimension $d$ and the reciprocal $\varepsilon^{-1}$ of the
accuracy. Hence, the approximation does not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. As quantitative approximation results for DNNs applicable in
our setting are formulated for functions on compact domains, we first consider
the case of the asset price restricted to a compact set, then we extend these
results to the general case by using convergence arguments for the option
prices.

<p class="mathjax">The Collaborative Research Center for Everyday Activity Science &amp; Engineering
(CRC EASE) aims to enable robots to perform environmental interaction tasks
with close to human capacity. It therefore employs a shared ontology to model
the activity of both kinds of agents, empowering robots to learn from human
experiences. To properly describe these human experiences, the ontology will
strongly benefit from incorporating characteristics of neuronal information
processing which are not accessible from a behavioral perspective alone. We,
therefore, propose the analysis of human neuroimaging data for evaluation and
validation of concepts and events defined in the ontology model underlying most
of the CRC projects. In an exploratory analysis, we employed an Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data
from participants who were presented with the same complex video stimuli of
activities as robotic and human agents in different environments and contexts.
We then correlated the activity patterns of brain networks represented by
derived components with timings of annotated event categories as defined by the
ontology model. The present results demonstrate a subset of common networks
with stable correlations and specificity towards particular event classes and
groups, associated with environmental and contextual factors. These neuronal
characteristics will open up avenues for adapting the ontology model to be more
consistent with human information processing.

<p class="mathjax">This paper tackles the challenge of wideband MIMO channel estimation within
indoor millimeter-wave scenarios. Our proposed approach exploits the integrated
sensing and communication paradigm, where sensing information aids in channel
estimation. The key innovation consists of employing both spatial and temporal
sensing modes to significantly reduce the number of required training pilots.
Moreover, our algorithm addresses and corrects potential mismatches between
sensing and communication modes, which can arise from differing sensing and
communication propagation paths. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed method requires 4x less pilots compared to the current
state-of-the-art, marking a substantial advancement in channel estimation
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">The Random Language Model (De Giuli 2019) is an ensemble of stochastic
context-free grammars, quantifying the syntax of human and computer languages.
The model suggests a simple picture of first language learning as a type of
annealing in the vast space of potential languages. In its simplest
formulation, it implies a single continuous transition to grammatical syntax,
at which the symmetry among potential words and categories is spontaneously
broken. Here this picture is scrutinized by considering its robustness against
explicit symmetry breaking, an inevitable component of learning in the real
world. It is shown that the scenario is robust to such symmetry breaking.
Comparison with human data on the clustering coefficient of syntax networks
suggests that the observed transition is equivalent to that normally
experienced by children at age 24 months.

<p class="mathjax">Attention-based encoder-decoder models with autoregressive (AR) decoding have
proven to be the dominant approach for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due
to their superior accuracy. However, they often suffer from slow inference.
This is primarily attributed to the incremental calculation of the decoder.
This work proposes a partially AR framework, which employs segment-level
vectorized beam search for improving the inference speed of an ASR model based
on the hybrid connectionist temporal classification (CTC) attention-based
architecture. It first generates an initial hypothesis using greedy CTC
decoding, identifying low-confidence tokens based on their output
probabilities. We then utilize the decoder to perform segment-level vectorized
beam search on these tokens, re-predicting in parallel with minimal decoder
calculations. Experimental results show that our method is 12 to 13 times
faster in inference on the LibriSpeech corpus over AR decoding whilst
preserving high accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">The single-particle cryo-EM field faces the persistent challenge of preferred
orientation, lacking general computational solutions. We introduce cryoPROS, an
AI-based approach designed to address the above issue. By generating the
auxiliary particles with a conditional deep generative model, cryoPROS
addresses the intrinsic bias in orientation estimation for the observed
particles. We effectively employed cryoPROS in the cryo-EM single particle
analysis of the hemagglutinin trimer, showing the ability to restore the
near-atomic resolution structure on non-tilt data. Moreover, the enhanced
version named cryoPROS-MP significantly improves the resolution of the membrane
protein NaX using the no-tilted data that contains the effects of micelles.
Compared to the classical approaches, cryoPROS does not need special
experimental or image acquisition techniques, providing a purely computational
yet effective solution for the preferred orientation problem. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments that establish the low risk of model bias and the
high robustness of cryoPROS.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have been a promising framework in pursuing
near-term quantum advantage in various fields, where many applications can be
viewed as learning a quantum state that encodes useful data. As a quantum
analog of probability distribution learning, quantum state learning is
theoretically and practically essential in quantum machine learning. In this
paper, we develop a no-go theorem for learning an unknown quantum state with
QNNs even starting from a high-fidelity initial state. We prove that when the
loss value is lower than a critical threshold, the probability of avoiding
local minima vanishes exponentially with the qubit count, while only grows
polynomially with the circuit depth. The curvature of local minima is
concentrated to the quantum Fisher information times a loss-dependent constant,
which characterizes the sensibility of the output state with respect to
parameters in QNNs. These results hold for any circuit structures,
initialization strategies, and work for both fixed ansatzes and adaptive
methods. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to validate our
theoretical results. Our findings place generic limits on good initial guesses
and adaptive methods for improving the learnability and scalability of QNNs,
and deepen the understanding of prior information's role in QNNs.

<p class="mathjax">Renewed interest in the relationship between artificial and biological neural
networks motivates the study of gradient-free methods. Considering the linear
regression model with random design, we theoretically analyze in this work the
biologically motivated (weight-perturbed) forward gradient scheme that is based
on random linear combination of the gradient. If d denotes the number of
parameters and k the number of samples, we prove that the mean squared error of
this method converges for $k\gtrsim d^2\log(d)$ with rate $d^2\log(d)/k.$
Compared to the dimension dependence d for stochastic gradient descent, an
additional factor $d\log(d)$ occurs.

<p class="mathjax">Blockwise determinantal ideals are those generated by the union of all the
minors of specified sizes in certain blocks of a generic matrix, and they are
the natural generalization of many existing determinantal ideals like the
Schubert and ladder ones. In this paper we establish several criteria to verify
whether the Gr\"obner bases of blockwise determinantal ideals with respect to
(anti-)diagonal term orders are minimal or reduced. In particular, for Schubert
determinantal ideals, while all the elusive minors form the reduced Gr\"obner
bases when the defining permutations are vexillary, in the non-vexillary case
we derive an explicit formula for computing the reduced Gr\"obner basis from
elusive minors which avoids all algebraic operations. The fundamental
properties of being normal and strong for W-characteristic sets and
characteristic pairs, which are heavily connected to the reduced Gr\"obner
bases, of Schubert determinantal ideals are also proven.

<p class="mathjax">Estimation of a speaker's direction and head orientation with binaural
recordings can be a critical piece of information in many real-world
applications with emerging `earable' devices, including smart headphones and
AR/VR headsets. However, it requires predicting the mutual head orientations of
both the speaker and the listener, which is challenging in practice. This paper
presents a system for jointly predicting speaker-listener head orientations by
leveraging inherent human voice directivity and listener's head-related
transfer function (HRTF) as perceived by the ear-mounted microphones on the
listener. We propose a convolution neural network model that, given binaural
speech recording, can predict the orientation of both speaker and listener with
respect to the line joining the two. The system builds on the core observation
that the recordings from the left and right ears are differentially affected by
the voice directivity as well as the HRTF. We also incorporate the fact that
voice is more directional at higher frequencies compared to lower frequencies.

<p class="mathjax">The recent success of neural networks in pattern recognition and
classification problems suggests that neural networks possess qualities
distinct from other more classical classifiers such as SVMs or boosting
classifiers. This paper studies the performance of plug-in classifiers based on
neural networks in a binary classification setting as measured by their excess
risks. Compared to the typical settings imposed in the literature, we consider
a more general scenario that resembles actual practice in two respects: first,
the function class to be approximated includes the Barron functions as a proper
subset, and second, the neural network classifier constructed is the minimizer
of a surrogate loss instead of the $0$-$1$ loss so that gradient descent-based
numerical optimizations can be easily applied. While the class of functions we
consider is quite large that optimal rates cannot be faster than
$n^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, it is a regime in which dimension-free rates are possible
and approximation power of neural networks can be taken advantage of. In
particular, we analyze the estimation and approximation properties of neural
networks to obtain a dimension-free, uniform rate of convergence for the excess
risk. Finally, we show that the rate obtained is in fact minimax optimal up to
a logarithmic factor, and the minimax lower bound shows the effect of the
margin assumption in this regime.

<p class="mathjax">This PhD thesis is focused on the central idea that single neurons in the
brain should be regarded as temporally precise and highly complex
spatio-temporal pattern recognizers. This is opposed to the prevalent view of
biological neurons as simple and mainly spatial pattern recognizers by most
neuroscientists today. In this thesis, I will attempt to demonstrate that this
is an important distinction, predominantly because the above-mentioned
computational properties of single neurons have far-reaching implications with
respect to the various brain circuits that neurons compose, and on how
information is encoded by neuronal activity in the brain. Namely, that these
particular "low-level" details at the single neuron level have substantial
system-wide ramifications. In the introduction we will highlight the main
components that comprise a neural microcircuit that can perform useful
computations and illustrate the inter-dependence of these components from a
system perspective. In chapter 1 we discuss the great complexity of the
spatio-temporal input-output relationship of cortical neurons that are the
result of morphological structure and biophysical properties of the neuron. In
chapter 2 we demonstrate that single neurons can generate temporally precise
output patterns in response to specific spatio-temporal input patterns with a
very simple biologically plausible learning rule. In chapter 3, we use the
differentiable deep network analog of a realistic cortical neuron as a tool to
approximate the gradient of the output of the neuron with respect to its input
and use this capability in an attempt to teach the neuron to perform nonlinear
XOR operation. In chapter 4 we expand chapter 3 to describe extension of our
ideas to neuronal networks composed of many realistic biological spiking
neurons that represent either small microcircuits or entire brain regions.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the random number partitioning problem (\texttt{NPP}): given a
list $X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$ of numbers, find a partition
$\sigma\in\{-1,1\}^n$ with a small objective value
$H(\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\left|\langle \sigma,X\rangle\right|$. The
\texttt{NPP} is widely studied in computer science; it is also closely related
to the design of randomized controlled trials. In this paper, we propose a
planted version of the \texttt{NPP}: fix a $\sigma^*$ and generate $X\sim
\mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$ conditional on $H(\sigma^*)\le 3^{-n}$. The \texttt{NPP}
and its planted counterpart are statistically distinguishable as the smallest
objective value under the former is $\Theta(\sqrt{n}2^{-n})$ w.h.p.
<br />Our first focus is on the values of $H(\sigma)$. We show that, perhaps
surprisingly, planting does not induce partitions with an objective value
substantially smaller than $2^{-n}$: $\min_{\sigma \ne \pm \sigma^*}H(\sigma) =
\widetilde{\Theta}(2^{-n})$ w.h.p. Furthermore, we completely characterize the
smallest $H(\sigma)$ achieved at any fixed distance from $\sigma^*$. Our second
focus is on the algorithmic problem of efficiently finding a partition
$\sigma$, not necessarily equal to $\pm\sigma^*$, with a small $H(\sigma)$. We
show that planted \texttt{NPP} exhibits an intricate geometrical property known
as the multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP) for values $2^{-\Theta(n)}$. We
then leverage the $m$-OGP to show that stable algorithms satisfying a certain
anti-concentration property fail to find a $\sigma$ with
$H(\sigma)=2^{-\Theta(n)}$.
<br />Our results are the first instance of the $m$-OGP being established and
leveraged to rule out stable algorithms for a planted model. More importantly,
they show that the $m$-OGP framework can also apply to planted models, if the
algorithmic goal is to return a solution with a small objective value.
