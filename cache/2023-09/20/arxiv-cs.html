<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing have been
grafted onto programming language modeling for advancing code intelligence.
Although it can be represented in the text format, code is syntactically more
rigorous in order to be properly compiled or interpreted to perform a desired
set of behaviors given any inputs. In this case, existing works benefit from
syntactic representations to learn from code less ambiguously in the forms of
abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, etc. However, programs with the same
purpose can be implemented in various ways showing different syntactic
representations while the ones with similar implementations can have distinct
behaviors. Though trivially demonstrated during executions, such semantics
about functionality are challenging to be learned directly from code,
especially in an unsupervised manner. Hence, in this paper, we propose
FuzzPretrain to explore the dynamic information of programs revealed by their
test cases and embed it into the feature representations of code as
complements. The test cases are obtained with the assistance of a customized
fuzzer and are only required during pre-training. FuzzPretrain yielded more
than 6%/9% mAP improvements on code search over its counterparts trained with
only source code or AST, respectively. Our extensive experimental results show
the benefits of learning discriminative code representations with program
executions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an introspective deep metric learning (IDML) framework
for uncertainty-aware comparisons of images. Conventional deep metric learning
methods focus on learning a discriminative embedding to describe the semantic
features of images, which ignore the existence of uncertainty in each image
resulting from noise or semantic ambiguity. Training without awareness of these
uncertainties causes the model to overfit the annotated labels during training
and produce unsatisfactory judgments during inference. Motivated by this, we
argue that a good similarity model should consider the semantic discrepancies
with awareness of the uncertainty to better deal with ambiguous images for more
robust training. To achieve this, we propose to represent an image using not
only a semantic embedding but also an accompanying uncertainty embedding, which
describes the semantic characteristics and ambiguity of an image, respectively.
We further propose an introspective similarity metric to make similarity
judgments between images considering both their semantic differences and
ambiguities. The gradient analysis of the proposed metric shows that it enables
the model to learn at an adaptive and slower pace to deal with the uncertainty
during training. The proposed IDML framework improves the performance of deep
metric learning through uncertainty modeling and attains state-of-the-art
results on the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products
datasets for image retrieval and clustering. We further provide an in-depth
analysis of our framework to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of
IDML. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/IDML.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-view learning techniques have recently gained significant attention in
the machine learning domain for their ability to leverage consistency and
complementary information across multiple views. However, there remains a lack
of sufficient research on generalized multi-view frameworks that unify existing
works into a scalable and robust learning framework, as most current works
focus on specific styles of multi-view models. Additionally, most multi-view
learning works rely heavily on specific-scale scenarios and fail to effectively
comprehend multiple scales holistically. These limitations hinder the effective
fusion of essential information from multiple views, resulting in poor
generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a universal
multi-view representation learning framework named Tensorized Consensus Graph
Framework (TCGF). Specifically, it first provides a unified framework for
existing multi-view works to exploit the representations for individual view,
which aims to be suitable for arbitrary assumptions and different-scales
datasets. Then, stacks them into a tensor under alignment basics as a
high-order representation, allowing for the smooth propagation of consistency
and complementary information across all views. Moreover, TCGF proposes
learning a consensus embedding shared by adaptively collaborating all views to
uncover the essential structure of the multi-view data, which utilizes
view-consensus grouping effect to regularize the view-consensus representation.
To further facilitate related research, we provide a specific implementation of
TCGF for large-scale datasets, which can be efficiently solved by applying the
alternating optimization strategy. Experimental results conducted on seven
different-scales datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed TCGF against
existing state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light a concerning aspect of long-term
neurological complications in post-recovery patients. This study delved into
the investigation of such neurological sequelae in a cohort of 500
post-COVID-19 patients, encompassing individuals with varying illness severity.
The primary aim was to predict outcomes using a machine learning approach based
on diverse clinical data and neuroimaging parameters. The results revealed that
68% of the post-COVID-19 patients reported experiencing neurological symptoms,
with fatigue, headache, and anosmia being the most common manifestations.
Moreover, 22% of the patients exhibited more severe neurological complications,
including encephalopathy and stroke. The application of machine learning models
showed promising results in predicting long-term neurological outcomes.
Notably, the Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of
80%, and specificity of 90% in identifying patients at risk of developing
neurological sequelae. These findings underscore the importance of continuous
monitoring and follow-up care for post-COVID-19 patients, particularly in
relation to potential neurological complications. The integration of machine
learning-based outcome prediction offers a valuable tool for early intervention
and personalized treatment strategies, aiming to improve patient care and
clinical decision-making. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the
prevalence of long-term neurological complications in post-COVID-19 patients
and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting outcomes,
thereby contributing to enhanced patient management and better health outcomes.
Further research and larger studies are warranted to validate and refine these
predictive models and to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of
post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae.

<p class="mathjax">Formal verification of concurrent operating systems (OSs) is challenging, in
particular the verification of the dynamic memory management due to its complex
data structures and allocation algorithm. An incorrect specification and
implementation of the memory management may lead to system crashes or
exploitable attacks. This article presents the first formal specification and
mechanized proof of a concurrent memory management for a real-world OS
concerning a comprehensive set of properties, including functional correctness,
safety and security. To achieve the highest assurance evaluation level, we
develop a fine-grained formal specification of the Zephyr RTOS buddy memory
management, which closely follows the C code easing validation of the
specification and the source code. The rely-guarantee-based compositional
verification technique has been enforced over the formal model. To support
formal verification of the security property, we extend our rely-guarantee
framework PiCore by a compositional reasoning approach for integrity. Whilst
the security verification of the design shows that it preserves the integrity
property, the verification of the functional properties shows several problems.
These verification issues are translated into finding three bugs in the C
implementation of Zephyr, after inspecting the source code corresponding to the
design lines breaking the properties.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting covariate drift in text data is essential for maintaining the
reliability and performance of text analysis models. In this research, we
investigate the effectiveness of different document embeddings, dimensionality
reduction techniques, and drift detection methods for identifying covariate
drift in text data. We explore three popular document embeddings: term
frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) using Latent semantic
analysis(LSA) for dimentionality reduction and Doc2Vec, and BERT embeddings,
with and without using principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality
reduction. To quantify the divergence between training and test data
distributions, we employ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test as drift detection methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that certain combinations of embeddings, dimensionality reduction
techniques, and drift detection methods outperform others in detecting
covariate drift. Our findings contribute to the advancement of reliable text
analysis models by providing insights into effective approaches for addressing
covariate drift in text data.

<p class="mathjax">Skeletal Action recognition from an egocentric view is important for
applications such as interfaces in AR/VR glasses and human-robot interaction,
where the device has limited resources. Most of the existing skeletal action
recognition approaches use 3D coordinates of hand joints and 8-corner
rectangular bounding boxes of objects as inputs, but they do not capture how
the hands and objects interact with each other within the spatial context. In
this paper, we present a new framework called Contact-aware Skeletal Action
Recognition (CaSAR). It uses novel representations of hand-object interaction
that encompass spatial information: 1) contact points where the hand joints
meet the objects, 2) distant points where the hand joints are far away from the
object and nearly not involved in the current action. Our framework is able to
learn how the hands touch or stay away from the objects for each frame of the
action sequence, and use this information to predict the action class. We
demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3%
and 98.4% on two public datasets, H2O and FPHA, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose an energy stable network (EStable-Net) for solving
gradient flow equations. The solution update scheme in our neural network
EStable-Net is inspired by a proposed auxiliary variable based equivalent form
of the gradient flow equation. EStable-Net enables decreasing of a discrete
energy along the neural network, which is consistent with the property in the
evolution process of the gradient flow equation. The architecture of the neural
network EStable-Net consists of a few energy decay blocks, and the output of
each block can be interpreted as an intermediate state of the evolution process
of the gradient flow equation. This design provides a stable, efficient and
interpretable network structure. Numerical experimental results demonstrate
that our network is able to generate high accuracy and stable predictions.

self-information is calculated from the probability of occurrence of that
claim, where the probability is calculated in accordance with a language model.
Five language models are considered, ranging from the simplest models (each
word or character is drawn from a uniform distribution) to intermediate models
(using average word or character frequencies), to a large language model
(GPT2). Interestingly, the simplest language models reduce the scope measure to
the reciprocal of the word or character count, a metric already used in
previous works. Application is made to nine series of patent claims directed to
distinct inventions, where the claims in each series have a gradually
decreasing scope. The performance of the language models is then assessed with
respect to several ad hoc tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better
the results. The GPT2 model outperforms models based on word and character
frequencies, which are themselves ahead of models based on word and character
counts.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a modular and parallelizable multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning framework for imbibing cooperative as well as
competitive behaviors within autonomous vehicles. We introduce AutoDRIVE
Ecosystem as an enabler to develop physically accurate and graphically
realistic digital twins of Nigel and F1TENTH, two scaled autonomous vehicle
platforms with unique qualities and capabilities, and leverage this ecosystem
to train and deploy multi-agent reinforcement learning policies. We first
investigate an intersection traversal problem using a set of cooperative
vehicles (Nigel) that share limited state information with each other in single
as well as multi-agent learning settings using a common policy approach. We
then investigate an adversarial head-to-head autonomous racing problem using a
different set of vehicles (F1TENTH) in a multi-agent learning setting using an
individual policy approach. In either set of experiments, a decentralized
learning architecture was adopted, which allowed robust training and testing of
the approaches in stochastic environments, since the agents were mutually
independent and exhibited asynchronous motion behavior. The problems were
further aggravated by providing the agents with sparse observation spaces and
requiring them to sample control commands that implicitly satisfied the imposed
kinodynamic as well as safety constraints. The experimental results for both
problem statements are reported in terms of quantitative metrics and
qualitative remarks for training as well as deployment phases.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this study was to employ machine learning algorithms based on
sensor behavior data for (1) early-onset detection of digital dermatitis (DD);
and (2) DD prediction in dairy cows. With the ultimate goal to set-up early
warning tools for DD prediction, which would than allow a better monitoring and
management of DD under commercial settings, resulting in a decrease of DD
prevalence and severity, while improving animal welfare. A machine learning
model that is capable of predicting and detecting digital dermatitis in cows
housed under free-stall conditions based on behavior sensor data has been
purposed and tested in this exploratory study. The model for DD detection on
day 0 of the appearance of the clinical signs has reached an accuracy of 79%,
while the model for prediction of DD 2 days prior to the appearance of the
first clinical signs has reached an accuracy of 64%. The proposed machine
learning models could help to develop a real-time automated tool for monitoring
and diagnostic of DD in lactating dairy cows, based on behavior sensor data
under conventional dairy environments. Results showed that alterations in
behavioral patterns at individual levels can be used as inputs in an early
warning system for herd management in order to detect variances in health of
individual cows.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose an Instant Photorealistic Style Transfer (IPST)
approach, designed to achieve instant photorealistic style transfer on
super-resolution inputs without the need for pre-training on pair-wise datasets
or imposing extra constraints. Our method utilizes a lightweight StyleNet to
enable style transfer from a style image to a content image while preserving
non-color information. To further enhance the style transfer process, we
introduce an instance-adaptive optimization to prioritize the photorealism of
outputs and accelerate the convergence of the style network, leading to a rapid
training completion within seconds. Moreover, IPST is well-suited for
multi-frame style transfer tasks, as it retains temporal and multi-view
consistency of the multi-frame inputs such as video and Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF). Experimental results demonstrate that IPST requires less GPU memory
usage, offers faster multi-frame transfer speed, and generates photorealistic
outputs, making it a promising solution for various photorealistic transfer
applications.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we improve the generative replay in a continual learning
setting to perform well on challenging scenarios. Current generative rehearsal
methods are usually benchmarked on small and simple datasets as they are not
powerful enough to generate more complex data with a greater number of classes.
We notice that in VAE-based generative replay, this could be attributed to the
fact that the generated features are far from the original ones when mapped to
the latent space. Therefore, we propose three modifications that allow the
model to learn and generate complex data. More specifically, we incorporate the
distillation in latent space between the current and previous models to reduce
feature drift. Additionally, a latent matching for the reconstruction and
original data is proposed to improve generated features alignment. Further,
based on the observation that the reconstructions are better for preserving
knowledge, we add the cycling of generations through the previously trained
model to make them closer to the original data. Our method outperforms other
generative replay methods in various scenarios. Code available at

<p class="mathjax">Recent research in representation learning has shown that hierarchical data
lends itself to low-dimensional and highly informative representations in
hyperbolic space. However, even if hyperbolic embeddings have gathered
attention in image recognition, their optimization is prone to numerical
hurdles. Further, it remains unclear which applications stand to benefit the
most from the implicit bias imposed by hyperbolicity, when compared to
traditional Euclidean features. In this paper, we focus on prototypical
hyperbolic neural networks. In particular, the tendency of hyperbolic
embeddings to converge to the boundary of the Poincar\'e ball in high
dimensions and the effect this has on few-shot classification. We show that the
best few-shot results are attained for hyperbolic embeddings at a common
hyperbolic radius. In contrast to prior benchmark results, we demonstrate that
better performance can be achieved by a fixed-radius encoder equipped with the
Euclidean metric, regardless of the embedding dimension.

<p class="mathjax">Batteries are an essential component in a deeply decarbonized future.
Understanding battery performance and "useful life" as a function of design and
use is of paramount importance to accelerating adoption. Historically, battery
state of health (SOH) was summarized by a single parameter, the fraction of a
battery's capacity relative to its initial state. A more useful approach,
however, is a comprehensive characterization of its state and complexities,
using an interrelated set of descriptors including capacity, energy, ionic and
electronic impedances, open circuit voltages, and microstructure metrics.
Indeed, predicting across an extensive suite of properties as a function of
battery use is a "holy grail" of battery science; it can provide unprecedented
insights toward the design of better batteries with reduced experimental
effort, and de-risking energy storage investments that are necessary to meet
CO2 reduction targets. In this work, we present a first step in that direction
via deep transformer networks for the prediction of 28 battery state of health
descriptors using two cycling datasets representing six lithium-ion cathode
chemistries (LFP, NMC111, NMC532, NMC622, HE5050, and 5Vspinel), multiple
electrolyte/anode compositions, and different charge-discharge scenarios. The
accuracy of these predictions versus battery life (with an unprecedented mean
absolute error of 19 cycles in predicting end of life for an LFP fast-charging
dataset) illustrates the promise of deep learning towards providing deeper
understanding and control of battery health.

<p class="mathjax">Commonsense reasoning is a critical aspect of human communication. Despite
recent advances in conversational AI driven by large language models,
commonsense reasoning remains a challenging task. In this work, we introduce
SYNDICOM - a method for improving commonsense in dialogue response generation.
SYNDICOM consists of two components. The first component is a dataset composed
of commonsense dialogues created from a knowledge graph and synthesized into
natural language. This dataset includes both valid and invalid responses to
dialogue contexts, along with natural language feedback (NLF) for the invalid
responses. The second contribution is a two-step procedure: training a model to
predict natural language feedback (NLF) for invalid responses, and then
training a response generation model conditioned on the predicted NLF, the
invalid response, and the dialogue. SYNDICOM is scalable and does not require
reinforcement learning. Empirical results on three tasks are evaluated using a
broad range of metrics. SYNDICOM achieves a relative improvement of 53% over
ChatGPT on ROUGE1, and human evaluators prefer SYNDICOM over ChatGPT 57% of the
time. We will publicly release the code and the full dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm in addressing long-tailed
recognition tasks has sparked significant interest since the emergence of large
vision-language models like the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP).
While previous studies have shown promise in adapting pre-trained models for
these tasks, they often undesirably require extensive training epochs or
additional training data to maintain good performance. In this paper, we
propose PEL, a fine-tuning method that can effectively adapt pre-trained models
to long-tailed recognition tasks in fewer than 20 epochs without the need for
extra data. We first empirically find that commonly used fine-tuning methods,
such as full fine-tuning and classifier fine-tuning, suffer from overfitting,
resulting in performance deterioration on tail classes. To mitigate this issue,
PEL introduces a small number of task-specific parameters by adopting the
design of any existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Additionally, to
expedite convergence, PEL presents a novel semantic-aware classifier
initialization technique derived from the CLIP textual encoder without adding
any computational overhead. Our experimental results on four long-tailed
datasets demonstrate that PEL consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art approaches. The source code is available at
https://github.com/shijxcs/PEL.

general-purpose assistants. The research landscape encompasses five core
topics, categorized into two classes. (i) We start with a survey of
well-established research areas: multimodal foundation models pre-trained for
specific purposes, including two topics -- methods of learning vision backbones
for visual understanding and text-to-image generation. (ii) Then, we present
recent advances in exploratory, open research areas: multimodal foundation
models that aim to play the role of general-purpose assistants, including three
topics -- unified vision models inspired by large language models (LLMs),
end-to-end training of multimodal LLMs, and chaining multimodal tools with
LLMs. The target audiences of the paper are researchers, graduate students, and
professionals in computer vision and vision-language multimodal communities who

<p class="mathjax">Clustering techniques have been the key drivers of data mining, machine
learning and pattern recognition for decades. One of the most popular
clustering algorithms is DBSCAN due to its high accuracy and noise tolerance.
Many superior algorithms such as DBSCAN have input parameters that are hard to
estimate. Therefore, finding those parameters is a time consuming process. In
this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm Bacteria-Farm, which
balances the performance and ease of finding the optimal parameters for
clustering. Bacteria- Farm algorithm is inspired by the growth of bacteria in
closed experimental farms - their ability to consume food and grow - which
closely represents the ideal cluster growth desired in clustering algorithms.
In addition, the algorithm features a modular design to allow the creation of
versions of the algorithm for specific tasks / distributions of data. In
contrast with other clustering algorithms, our algorithm also has a provision
to specify the amount of noise to be excluded during clustering.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT is a powerful language model from OpenAI that is arguably able to
comprehend and generate text. ChatGPT is expected to have a large impact on
society, research, and education. An essential step to understand ChatGPT's
expected impact is to study its domain-specific answering capabilities. Here,
we perform a systematic empirical assessment of its abilities to answer
questions across the natural science and engineering domains. We collected 594
questions from 198 faculty members across 5 faculties at Delft University of
Technology. After collecting the answers from ChatGPT, the participants
assessed the quality of the answers using a systematic scheme. Our results show
that the answers from ChatGPT are on average perceived as ``mostly correct''.
Two major trends are that the rating of the ChatGPT answers significantly
decreases (i) as the complexity level of the question increases and (ii) as we
evaluate skills beyond scientific knowledge, e.g., critical attitude.

<p class="mathjax">Information extraction systems often produce hundreds to thousands of strings
on a specific topic. We present a method that facilitates better consumption of
these strings, in an exploratory setting in which a user wants to both get a
broad overview of what's available, and a chance to dive deeper on some
aspects. The system works by grouping similar items together and arranging the
remaining items into a hierarchical navigable DAG structure. We apply the
method to medical information extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Existing data-free model stealing methods use a generator to produce samples
in order to train a student model to match the target model outputs. To this
end, the two main challenges are estimating gradients of the target model
without access to its parameters, and generating a diverse set of training
samples that thoroughly explores the input space. We propose a Dual Student
method where two students are symmetrically trained in order to provide the
generator a criterion to generate samples that the two students disagree on. On
one hand, disagreement on a sample implies at least one student has classified
the sample incorrectly when compared to the target model. This incentive
towards disagreement implicitly encourages the generator to explore more
diverse regions of the input space. On the other hand, our method utilizes
gradients of student models to indirectly estimate gradients of the target
model. We show that this novel training objective for the generator network is
equivalent to optimizing a lower bound on the generator's loss if we had access
to the target model gradients. We show that our new optimization framework
provides more accurate gradient estimation of the target model and better
accuracies on benchmark classification datasets. Additionally, our approach
balances improved query efficiency with training computation cost. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method serves as a better proxy model for transfer-based
adversarial attacks than existing data-free model stealing methods.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce SMART-LLM, an innovative framework designed for
embodied multi-robot task planning. SMART-LLM: Smart Multi-Agent Robot Task
Planning using Large Language Models (LLMs), harnesses the power of LLMs to
convert high-level task instructions provided as input into a multi-robot task
plan. It accomplishes this by executing a series of stages, including task
decomposition, coalition formation, and task allocation, all guided by
programmatic LLM prompts within the few-shot prompting paradigm. We create a
benchmark dataset designed for validating the multi-robot task planning
problem, encompassing four distinct categories of high-level instructions that
vary in task complexity. Our evaluation experiments span both simulation and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed model can achieve
promising results for generating multi-robot task plans. The experimental
videos, code, and datasets from the work can be found at

<p class="mathjax">For drones, as safety-critical systems, there is an increasing need for
onboard detect &amp; avoid (DAA) technology i) to see, sense or detect conflicting
traffic or imminent non-cooperative threats due to their high mobility with
multiple degrees of freedom and the complexity of deployed unstructured
environments, and subsequently ii) to take the appropriate actions to avoid
collisions depending upon the level of autonomy. The safe and efficient
integration of UAV traffic management (UTM) systems with air traffic management
(ATM) systems, using intelligent autonomous approaches, is an emerging
requirement where the number of diverse UAV applications is increasing on a
large scale in dense air traffic environments for completing swarms of multiple
complex missions flexibly and simultaneously. Significant progress over the
past few years has been made in detecting UAVs present in aerospace,
identifying them, and determining their existing flight path. This study makes
greater use of electronic conspicuity (EC) information made available by
PilotAware Ltd in developing an advanced collision management methodology --
Drone Aware Collision Management (DACM) -- capable of determining and executing
a variety of time-optimal evasive collision avoidance (CA) manoeuvres using a
reactive geometric conflict detection and resolution (CDR) technique. The
merits of the DACM methodology have been demonstrated through extensive
simulations and real-world field tests in avoiding mid-air collisions (MAC)
between UAVs and manned aeroplanes. The results show that the proposed
methodology can be employed successfully in avoiding collisions while limiting
the deviation from the original trajectory in highly dynamic aerospace without
requiring sophisticated sensors and prior training.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: To determine if fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) can generate
accurate, personalized impressions for whole-body PET reports. Materials and
Methods: Twelve language models were trained on a corpus of PET reports using
the teacher-forcing algorithm, with the report findings as input and the
clinical impressions as reference. An extra input token encodes the reading
physician's identity, allowing models to learn physician-specific reporting
styles. Our corpus comprised 37,370 retrospective PET reports collected from
our institution between 2010 and 2022. To identify the best LLM, 30 evaluation
metrics were benchmarked against quality scores from two nuclear medicine (NM)
physicians, with the most aligned metrics selecting the model for expert
evaluation. In a subset of data, model-generated impressions and original
clinical impressions were assessed by three NM physicians according to 6
quality dimensions and an overall utility score (5-point scale). Each physician
reviewed 12 of their own reports and 12 reports from other physicians.
Bootstrap resampling was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of all
evaluation metrics, domain-adapted BARTScore and PEGASUSScore showed the
highest Spearman's rho correlations (0.568 and 0.563) with physician
preferences. Based on these metrics, the fine-tuned PEGASUS model was selected
as the top LLM. When physicians reviewed PEGASUS-generated impressions in their
own style, 89% were considered clinically acceptable, with a mean utility score
of 4.08/5. Physicians rated these personalized impressions as comparable in
overall utility to the impressions dictated by other physicians (4.03, P=0.41).
Conclusion: Personalized impressions generated by PEGASUS were clinically
useful, highlighting its potential to expedite PET reporting.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we evaluate the portability of the SYCL programming model on
some of the latest CPUs and GPUs from a wide range of vendors, utilizing the
two main compilers: DPC++ and hipSYCL/OpenSYCL. Both compilers currently
support GPUs from all three major vendors; we evaluate performance on the
Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max 1100, the NVIDIA A100 GPU, and the AMD MI250X GPU.
Support on CPUs currently is less established, with DPC++ only supporting x86
CPUs through OpenCL, however, OpenSYCL does have an OpenMP backend capable of
targeting all modern CPUs; we benchmark the Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y Processor
(Ice Lake), the AMD EPYC 9V33X (Genoa-X), and the Ampere Altra platforms. We
study a range of primarily bandwidth-bound applications implemented using the
OPS and OP2 DSLs, evaluate different formulations in SYCL, and contrast their
performance to "native" programming approaches where available
(CUDA/HIP/OpenMP). On GPU architectures SCYL on average even slightly
outperforms native approaches, while on CPUs it falls behind - highlighting a
continued need for improving CPU performance. While SYCL does not solve all the
challenges of performance portability (e.g. needing different algorithms on
different hardware), it does provide a single programming model and ecosystem
to target most current HPC architectures productively.

<p class="mathjax">The timely identification of mental disorders in adolescents is a global
public health challenge.Single factor is difficult to detect the abnormality
due to its complex and subtle nature. Additionally, the generalized multimodal
Computer-Aided Screening (CAS) systems with interactive robots for adolescent
mental disorders are not available. Here, we design an android application with
mini-games and chat recording deployed in a portable robot to screen 3,783
middle school students and construct the multimodal screening dataset,
including facial images, physiological signs, voice recordings, and textual
transcripts.We develop a model called GAME (Generalized Model with Attention

cross-modal features into the model. GAME evaluates adolescent mental
conditions with high accuracy (73.34%-92.77%) and F1-Score (71.32%-91.06%).We
find each modality contributes dynamically to the mental disorders screening
and comorbidities among various mental disorders, indicating the feasibility of
explainable model. This study provides a system capable of acquiring multimodal

<p class="mathjax">Nature often builds physical structures tailored for specific information
processing tasks with computations encoded using diverse phenomena. These can
sometimes outperform typical general-purpose computers. However, describing the
construction and function of these unconventional computers is often
challenging. Here, we address this by introducing constructor algorithms in the
context of a robotic wire machine that can be programmed to build networks of
connected wires in response to a problem and then act upon these to efficiently
carry out a desired computation. We show how this approach can be used to solve
the NP-complete Subset Sum Problem (SSP) and provide information about the
number of solutions through changes in the voltages and currents measured
across these networks. This work provides a foundation for building
unconventional computers that encode information purely in the lengths and
connections of electrically conductive wires. It also demonstrates the power of
computing paradigms beyond digital logic and opens avenues to more fully
harness the inherent computational capabilities of diverse physical, chemical
and biological substrates.

<p class="mathjax">Orthogonality is a notion based on the duality between programs and their
environments used to determine when they can be safely combined. For instance,
it is a powerful tool to establish termination properties in classical formal
systems. It was given a general treatment with the concept of orthogonality
category, of which numerous models of linear logic are instances, by Hyland and
Schalk. This paper considers the subclass of focused orthogonalities. We
develop a theory of fixpoint constructions in focused orthogonality categories.
Central results are lifting theorems for initial algebras and final coalgebras.
These crucially hinge on the insight that focused orthogonality categories are
relational fibrations. The theory provides an axiomatic categorical framework
for models of linear logic with least and greatest fixpoints of types. We
further investigate domain-theoretic settings, showing how to lift bifree
algebras, used to solve mixed-variance recursive type equations, to focused
orthogonality categories.

<p class="mathjax">Along with the development of large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT,
many existing approaches and tools for software security are changing. It is,
therefore, essential to understand how security-aware these models are and how
these models impact software security practices and education. In exercises of
a software security course at our university, we ask students to identify and
fix vulnerabilities we insert in a web application using state-of-the-art
tools. After ChatGPT, especially the GPT-4 version of the model, we want to
know how the students can possibly use ChatGPT to complete the exercise tasks.
We input the vulnerable code to ChatGPT and measure its accuracy in
vulnerability identification and fixing. In addition, we investigated whether
ChatGPT can provide a proper source of information to support its outputs.
Results show that ChatGPT can identify 20 of the 28 vulnerabilities we inserted
in the web application in a white-box setting, reported three false positives,
and found four extra vulnerabilities beyond the ones we inserted. ChatGPT makes
nine satisfactory penetration testing and fixing recommendations for the ten
vulnerabilities we want students to fix and can often point to related sources
of information.

<p class="mathjax">The Supreme Court of India has been a pioneer in using ICT in courts through
its e-Courts project in India. Yet another leap, its recent project, Design,
Development, and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution, tools
for transcribing arguments and Court proceedings at Supreme Court of India, has
potential to impact the way AI algorithms are designed in India, and not just
for this particular project. In this paper, we evaluate the endeavours of the
Supreme Court of India in light of the state of AI technology as well as the
attempts to regulate AI. We argue that since the project aims to transcribe and
translate the proceedings of the constitutional benches of the Supreme Court,
it has potential to impact rule of law in the country. Hence, we place this
application in High Risk AI as per the provisions to the proposed EU AI Act. We
provide some guidelines on the approach to transcribe and translate making the
maximum use of AI in the Supreme Court of India without running into the
dangers it may pose.

<p class="mathjax">The canonical approach to video-text retrieval leverages a coarse-grained or
fine-grained alignment between visual and textual information. However,
retrieving the correct video according to the text query is often challenging
as it requires the ability to reason about both high-level (scene) and
low-level (object) visual clues and how they relate to the text query. To this
end, we propose a Unified Coarse-to-fine Alignment model, dubbed UCoFiA.
Specifically, our model captures the cross-modal similarity information at
different granularity levels. To alleviate the effect of irrelevant visual
clues, we also apply an Interactive Similarity Aggregation module (ISA) to
consider the importance of different visual features while aggregating the
cross-modal similarity to obtain a similarity score for each granularity.
Finally, we apply the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to normalize the similarities of
each level before summing them, alleviating over- and under-representation
issues at different levels. By jointly considering the crossmodal similarity of
different granularity, UCoFiA allows the effective unification of multi-grained
alignments. Empirically, UCoFiA outperforms previous state-of-the-art
CLIP-based methods on multiple video-text retrieval benchmarks, achieving 2.4%,
1.4% and 1.3% improvements in text-to-video retrieval R@1 on MSR-VTT,
Activity-Net, and DiDeMo, respectively. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Ziyang412/UCoFiA.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses a new motion planning problem for mobile robots tasked
with accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed using natural
language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define such
missions, we leverage LTL defined over NL-based atomic predicates modeling the
considered NL-based sub-tasks. This is contrast to related planning approaches
that define LTL tasks over atomic predicates capturing desired low-level system
configurations. Our goal is to design robot plans that satisfy LTL tasks
defined over NL-based atomic propositions. A novel technical challenge arising
in this setup lies in reasoning about correctness of a robot plan with respect
to such LTL-encoded tasks. To address this problem, we propose HERACLEs, a
hierarchical conformal natural language planner, that relies on a novel
integration of existing tools that include (i) automata theory to determine the
NL-specified sub-task the robot should accomplish next to make mission
progress; (ii) Large Language Models to design robot plans satisfying these
sub-tasks; and (iii) conformal prediction to reason probabilistically about
correctness of the designed plans and mission satisfaction and to determine if
external assistance is required. We provide extensive comparative experiments
on mobile manipulation tasks. The project website is ltl-llm.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">With most modern visualization tools, authors need to transform their data
into tidy formats to create visualizations they want. Because this requires
experience with programming or separate data processing tools, data
transformation remains a barrier in visualization authoring. To address this
challenge, we present a new visualization paradigm, concept binding, that
separates high-level visualization intents and low-level data transformation
steps, leveraging an AI agent. We realize this paradigm in Data Formulator, an
interactive visualization authoring tool. With Data Formulator, authors first
define data concepts they plan to visualize using natural languages or
examples, and then bind them to visual channels. Data Formulator then
dispatches its AI-agent to automatically transform the input data to surface
these concepts and generate desired visualizations. When presenting the results
(transformed table and output visualizations) from the AI agent, Data
Formulator provides feedback to help authors inspect and understand them. A
user study with 10 participants shows that participants could learn and use
Data Formulator to create visualizations that involve challenging data
transformations, and presents interesting future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Event identification is increasingly recognized as crucial for enhancing the
reliability, security, and stability of the electric power system. With the
growing deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and advancements in data
science, there are promising opportunities to explore data-driven event
identification via machine learning classification techniques. However,
obtaining accurately-labeled eventful PMU data samples remains challenging due
to its labor-intensive nature and uncertainty about the event type (class) in
real-time. Thus, it is natural to use semi-supervised learning techniques,
which make use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. %We propose a novel
semi-supervised framework to assess the effectiveness of incorporating
unlabeled eventful samples to enhance existing event identification
methodologies. We evaluate three categories of classical semi-supervised
approaches: (i) self-training, (ii) transductive support vector machines
(TSVM), and (iii) graph-based label spreading (LS) method. Our approach
characterizes events using physically interpretable features extracted from
modal analysis of synthetic eventful PMU data. In particular, we focus on the
identification of four event classes whose identification is crucial for grid
operations. We have developed and publicly shared a comprehensive Event
Identification package which consists of three aspects: data generation,
feature extraction, and event identification with limited labels using
semi-supervised methodologies. Using this package, we generate and evaluate
eventful PMU data for the South Carolina synthetic network. Our evaluation
consistently demonstrates that graph-based LS outperforms the other two
semi-supervised methods that we consider, and can noticeably improve event
identification performance relative to the setting with only a small number of
labeled samples.

<p class="mathjax">The virtual element method (VEM) allows discretization of the problem domain
with polygons in 2D. The polygons can have an arbitrary number of sides and can
be concave or convex. These features, among others, are attractive for meshing
complex geometries. VEM applied to linear elasticity problems is now well
established. Nonlinear problems involving plasticity and hyperelasticity have
also been explored by researchers using VEM. Clearly, techniques for extending
the method to nonlinear problems are attractive. In this work a novel first
order consistent virtual element method is applied within a static
co-rotational framework. To the author's knowledge this has not appeared before
in the literature with virtual elements. The formulation allows for large
displacements and large rotations in a small strain setting. For some problems
avoiding the complexity of finite strains, and alternative stress measures, is
warranted. Furthermore, small strain plasticity is easily incorporated. The
basic method, VEM specific implementation details for co-rotation, and
representative benchmark problems are illustrated. Consequently, this research
demonstrates that the co-rotational VEM formulation successfully solves certain
classes of nonlinear solid mechanics problems. The work concludes with a
discussion of results for the current formulation and future research
directions.

<p class="mathjax">Robots should exist anywhere humans do: indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped
environments. In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal
Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging
spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these
contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader
spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings.
As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new
challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor
environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent
semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can
reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for
Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a
new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this
more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a
simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Our agent has
no premapping and our formalism outperforms naive LLM-based approaches

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning (via methods such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback) is a crucial step in training language models to robustly
carry out tasks of interest. However, we lack a systematic understanding of the
effects of fine-tuning, particularly on tasks outside the narrow fine-tuning
distribution. In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving
performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the
expense of suppressing model capabilities on other tasks. This degradation is
especially pronounced for tasks "closest" to the fine-tuning distribution. We
hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt
corresponds, and the fine-tuning process predominantly skews this task
inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this
hypothesis, we propose Conjugate Prompting to see if we can recover pretrained
capabilities. Conjugate prompting artificially makes the task look farther from
the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability. We find that
conjugate prompting systematically recovers some of the pretraining
capabilities on our synthetic setup. We then apply conjugate prompting to
real-world LLMs using the observation that fine-tuning distributions are
typically heavily skewed towards English. We find that simply translating the
prompts to different languages can cause the fine-tuned models to respond like
their pretrained counterparts instead. This allows us to recover the in-context
learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, and more concerningly, to
recover harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots
like ChatGPT.

analysts in planning their analyses, enabling more robust decision-making.
Though AI-based assistants that target code execution (e.g., Github Copilot)

both analysis execution and planning. In this work, we characterize helpful
planning suggestions and their impacts on analysts' workflows. We first review
the analysis planning literature and crowd-sourced analysis studies to

<p class="mathjax">Test-time adaptation is a promising research direction that allows the source
model to adapt itself to changes in data distribution without any supervision.
Yet, current methods are usually evaluated on benchmarks that are only a
simplification of real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose to validate test-time
adaptation methods using the recently introduced datasets for autonomous
driving, namely CLAD-C and SHIFT. We observe that current test-time adaptation
methods struggle to effectively handle varying degrees of domain shift, often
resulting in degraded performance that falls below that of the source model. We
noticed that the root of the problem lies in the inability to preserve the
knowledge of the source model and adapt to dynamically changing, temporally
correlated data streams. Therefore, we enhance well-established self-training
framework by incorporating a small memory buffer to increase model stability
and at the same time perform dynamic adaptation based on the intensity of
domain shift. The proposed method, named AR-TTA, outperforms existing
approaches on both synthetic and more real-world benchmarks and shows
robustness across a variety of TTA scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce an improved version of the fifth-order weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) shock-capturing scheme by incorporating deep
learning techniques. The established WENO algorithm is improved by training a
compact neural network to adjust the smoothness indicators within the WENO
scheme. This modification enhances the accuracy of the numerical results,
particularly near abrupt shocks. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods,
no additional post-processing steps are necessary for maintaining consistency.
We demonstrate the superiority of our new approach using several examples from
the literature for the two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. Through
intensive study of these test problems, which involve various shocks and
rarefaction waves, the new technique is shown to outperform traditional
fifth-order WENO schemes, especially in cases where the numerical solutions
exhibit excessive diffusion or overshoot around shocks.

<p class="mathjax">Accumulating substantial volumes of real-world driving data proves pivotal in
the realm of trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving. Given the heavy
reliance of current trajectory forecasting models on data-driven methodologies,
we aim to tackle the challenge of learning general trajectory forecasting
representations under limited data availability. We propose to augment both HD
maps and trajectories and apply pre-training strategies on top of them.
Specifically, we take advantage of graph representations of HD-map and apply
vector transformations to reshape the maps, to easily enrich the limited number
of scenes. Additionally, we employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories
based on augmented scenes; thus enlarging the trajectories beyond the collected
real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this
augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training
strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for
trajectory forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline
prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04\%, 3.84\% and 8.30\% in terms of
$MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by artistic practices such as beadwork and himmeli, we study the
problem of threading a single string through a set of tubes, so that pulling
the string forms a desired graph. More precisely, given a connected graph
(where edges represent tubes and vertices represent junctions where they meet),
we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a minimum-length closed walk
(representing a threading of string) that induces a connected graph of string
at every junction. The algorithm is based on a surprising reduction to
minimum-weight perfect matching. Along the way, we give tight worst-case bounds
on the length of the optimal threading and on the maximum number of times this
threading can visit a single edge. We also give more efficient solutions to two
special cases: cubic graphs and when each edge can be visited only twice.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant improvements in robot capabilities, they are likely to
fail in human-robot collaborative tasks due to high unpredictability in human
environments and varying human expectations. In this work, we explore the role
of explanation of failures by a robot in a human-robot collaborative task. We
present a user study incorporating common failures in collaborative tasks with
human assistance to resolve the failure. In the study, a robot and a human work
together to fill a shelf with objects. Upon encountering a failure, the robot
explains the failure and the resolution to overcome the failure, either through
handovers or humans completing the task. The study is conducted using different
levels of robotic explanation based on the failure action, failure cause, and
action history, and different strategies in providing the explanation over the
course of repeated interaction. Our results show that the success in resolving
the failures is not only a function of the level of explanation but also the
type of failures. Furthermore, while novice users rate the robot higher overall
in terms of their satisfaction with the explanation, their satisfaction is not
only a function of the robot's explanation level at a certain round but also
the prior information they received from the robot.

<p class="mathjax">Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are a cornerstone of decentralized finance
(DeFi), allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for
third-party authorization. Investors are incentivized to deposit assets into
liquidity pools, against which users can trade directly, while paying fees to
liquidity providers (LPs). However, a number of unresolved issues related to
capital efficiency and market risk hinder DeFi's further development. Uniswap
V3, a leading and groundbreaking DEX project, addresses capital efficiency by
enabling LPs to concentrate their liquidity within specific price ranges for
deposited assets. Nevertheless, this approach exacerbates market risk, as LPs
earn trading fees only when asset prices are within these predetermined
brackets. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) solution designed to adaptively adjust these price ranges,
maximizing profits and mitigating market risks. Our approach also neutralizes
price-change risks by hedging the liquidity position through a rebalancing
portfolio in a centralized futures exchange. The DRL policy aims to optimize
trading fees earned by LPs against associated costs, such as gas fees and
hedging expenses, which is referred to as loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR). Using
simulations with a profit-and-loss (PnL) benchmark, our method demonstrates
superior performance in ETH/USDC and ETH/USDT pools compared to existing
baselines. We believe that this strategy not only offers investors a valuable
asset management tool but also introduces a new incentive mechanism for DEX
designers.

<p class="mathjax">Graph transformers have gained popularity in various graph-based tasks by
addressing challenges faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks. However, the
quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in
graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph
based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive
and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel
approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for
leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction
tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends
task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive
power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added
tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the
need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and
scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized
datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or
even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer
task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt
tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and
message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource
utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to
a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction
tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph
representation learning.

<p class="mathjax">Improving the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of machines on the shop
floor is crucial to ensure the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing
systems. To achieve the goal of increased OEE, there is a need to develop
flexible runtime control strategies for the system. Decentralized strategies,
such as multi-agent systems, have proven effective in improving system
flexibility. However, runtime multi-agent control of complex manufacturing
systems can be challenging as the agents require extensive communication and
computational efforts to coordinate agent activities. One way to improve
communication speed and cooperation capabilities between system agents is by
providing a common language between these agents to represent knowledge about
system behavior. The integration of ontology into multi-agent systems in
manufacturing provides agents with the capability to continuously update and
refine their knowledge in a global context. This paper contributes to the
design of an ontology for multi-agent systems in manufacturing, introducing an
extendable knowledge base and a methodology for continuously updating the
production data by agents during runtime. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework, a case study is conducted in a simulated environment,
which shows improvements in OEE during runtime.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a large number of labeled graph samples
to obtain good performance on the graph classification task. The performance of
GNNs degrades significantly as the number of labeled graph samples decreases.
To reduce the annotation cost, it is therefore important to develop graph
augmentation methods that can generate new graph instances to increase the size
and diversity of the limited set of available labeled graph samples. In this
work, we propose a novel mixup-based graph augmentation method, Graph Dual
Mixup (GDM), that leverages both functional and structural information of the
graph instances to generate new labeled graph samples. GDM employs a graph
structural auto-encoder to learn structural embeddings of the graph samples,
and then applies mixup to the structural information of the graphs in the
learned structural embedding space and generates new graph structures from the
mixup structural embeddings. As for the functional information, GDM applies
mixup directly to the input node features of the graph samples to generate
functional node feature information for new mixup graph instances. Jointly, the
generated input node features and graph structures yield new graph samples
which can supplement the set of original labeled graphs. Furthermore, we
propose two novel Balanced Graph Sampling methods to enhance the balanced
difficulty and diversity for the generated graph samples. Experimental results
on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method substantially
outperforms the state-of-the-art graph augmentation methods when the labeled
graphs are scarce.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to modify morphology in response to environmental changes
represents a highly advantageous feature in biological organisms, facilitating
their adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. While some robots have
the capability to modify their morphology by utilizing adaptive body parts, the
practical implementation of morphological transformations in robotic systems is
still relatively restricted. This limitation can be attributed, in part, to the
intricate nature of achieving such transformations, which necessitates the
integration of advanced materials, control systems, and design approaches. In
nature, a range of morphology adaptation strategies is employed to achieve
optimal performance and efficiency, such as those employed by crocodiles and
alligators, who adjust their body posture depending on the speed and the
surface they traverse on. Drawing inspiration from these biological examples,
this paper introduces Adjustbot, a quadruped robot with an undulating body
capable of adjusting its body posture. Its adaptive morphology allows it to
traverse a wide range of terradynamically challenging surfaces and facilitates
avoidance of collisions, navigation through narrow channels, obstacle
traversal, and incline negotiation.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to possess strong representation
abilities over graph data. However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
and even minor perturbations to the graph structure can significantly degrade
their performance. Existing methods either are ineffective against
sophisticated attacks or require the optimization of dense adjacency matrices,
which is time-consuming and prone to local minima. To remedy this problem, we
propose an Efficient Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) defense method,
which aims to learn low-rank and sparse graph structures for defending against
adversarial attacks, ensuring effective defense with greater efficiency.
Specifically, ELR-GNN consists of two modules: a Coarse Low-Rank Estimation
Module and a Fine-Grained Estimation Module. The first module adopts the
truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to initialize the low-rank
adjacency matrix estimation, which serves as a starting point for optimizing
the low-rank matrix. In the second module, the initial estimate is refined by
jointly learning a low-rank sparse graph structure with the GNN model. Sparsity
is incorporated into the learned low-rank adjacency matrix by pruning weak
connections, which can reduce redundant data while maintaining valuable
information. As a result, instead of using the dense adjacency matrix directly,
ELR-GNN can learn a low-rank and sparse estimate of it in a simple, efficient
and easy to optimize manner. The experimental results demonstrate that ELR-GNN
outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN defense methods in the literature, in
addition to being very efficient and easy to train.

<p class="mathjax">The ever-increasing computational and storage requirements of modern
applications and the slowdown of technology scaling pose major challenges to
designing and implementing efficient computer architectures. In this paper, we
leverage the architectural balance principle to alleviate the bandwidth
bottleneck at the L1 data memory boundary of a tightly-coupled cluster of
processing elements (PEs). We thus explore coupling each PE with an L0 memory,
namely a private register file implemented as Standard Cell Memory (SCM).
Architecturally, the SCM is the Vector Register File (VRF) of Spatz, a compact
64-bit floating-point-capable vector processor based on RISC-V's Vector
Extension Zve64d. Unlike typical vector processors, whose VRF are hundreds of
KiB large, we prove that Spatz can achieve peak energy efficiency with a VRF of
only 2 KiB. An implementation of the Spatz-based cluster in GlobalFoundries'
12LPP process with eight double-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs) achieves
an FPU utilization just 3.4% lower than the ideal upper bound on a
double-precision, floating-point matrix multiplication. The cluster reaches 7.7
FMA/cycle, corresponding to 15.7 GFLOPS-DP and 95.7 GFLOPS-DP/W at 1 GHz and
nominal operating conditions (TT, 0.80V, 25^oC) with more than 55% of the power
spent on the FPUs. Furthermore, the optimally-balanced Spatz-based cluster
reaches a 95.0% FPU utilization (7.6 FMA/cycle), 15.2 GFLOPS-DP, and 99.3
GFLOPS-DP/W (61% of the power spent in the FPU) on a 2D workload with a 7x7
kernel, resulting in an outstanding area/energy efficiency of 171
GFLOPS-DP/W/mm^2. At equi-area, our computing cluster built upon compact vector
processors reaches a 30% higher energy efficiency than a cluster with the same
FPU count built upon scalar cores specialized for stream-based floating-point
computation.

we introduce the feature geometry, which unifies statistical dependence and
features in the same functional space with geometric structures. By applying
the feature geometry, we formulate each learning problem as solving the optimal
feature approximation of the dependence component specified by the learning
setting. We propose a nesting technique for designing learning algorithms to
learn the optimal features from data samples, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf network architectures and optimizers. To demonstrate the
application of the nesting technique, we further discuss multivariate learning
problems, including conditioned inference and multimodal learning, where we
present the optimal features and reveal their connections to classical
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient delivery of current from PCB to point-of-load (POL) is a primary
concern in modern high-power high-density integrated systems. Traditionally, a
48 V power signal is converted to the low, POL voltage at the board and/or
package level. As interconnect has become the dominant power loss component,
minimizing voltage drop across the laterally routed portions of the
board-to-die interconnect (referred to as horizontal interconnect) is a
promising approach to enhance the efficiency of the power delivery system.
Delivering lower current vertically, at a higher voltage should therefore be
considered. High-power conversion near POL, however, results in higher
switching and inductor losses, exhibiting an undesired power efficiency
tradeoff. To address this problem, four vertical power delivery architectures
are proposed in this paper, considering state-of-the-art power converter
topologies, integration levels, and voltage conversion schemes. Embedding
Silicon (Si) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices and inductors on top of
and/or within the interposer is investigated. Integrating GaN power devices on
a dedicated power die is also discussed. Various multi-stage 48V-to-1V power
conversion schemes are examined and state-of-the-art power conversion circuits
are reviewed. Power delivery characteristics with these architectures are
determined for a high power (1 kW) high-current density (2 A/mm$^2$) system.

<p class="mathjax">Gait recognition (GR) is a growing biometric modality used for person
identification from a distance through visual cameras. GR provides a secure and
reliable alternative to fingerprint and face recognition, as it is harder to
distinguish between false and authentic signals. Furthermore, its resistance to
spoofing makes GR suitable for all types of environments. With the rise of deep
learning, steadily improving strides have been made in GR technology with
promising results in various contexts. As video surveillance becomes more
prevalent, new obstacles arise, such as ensuring uniform performance evaluation
across different protocols, reliable recognition despite shifting lighting
conditions, fluctuations in gait patterns, and protecting privacy.This survey
aims to give an overview of GR and analyze the environmental elements and
complications that could affect it in comparison to other biometric recognition
systems. The primary goal is to examine the existing deep learning (DL)
techniques employed for human GR that may generate new research opportunities.

similar to humans as possible. The production and customization of android
robots is expensive and time-consuming, so it may be practical to use a digital

in terms of emotions based on the difference in appearance, a robot head was
digitally replicated. In an experiment, the basic emotions evaluated in a
preliminary study were compared in three conditions and then statistically
analyzed. It was found that apart from fear, all emotions were recognized on
the real robot head. The digital head with "ideal" emotions performed better
than the real head apart from the anger representation, which offers
optimization potential for the real head. Contrary to expectations, significant
differences between the real and the replicated head with the same emotions
could only be found in the representation of surprise.

<p class="mathjax">Website Fingerprinting (WF) is considered a major threat to the anonymity of
Tor users (and other anonymity systems). While state-of-the-art WF techniques
have claimed high attack accuracies, e.g., by leveraging Deep Neural Networks
(DNN), several recent works have questioned the practicality of such WF attacks
in the real world due to the assumptions made in the design and evaluation of
these attacks. In this work, we argue that such impracticality issues are
mainly due to the attacker's inability in collecting training data in
comprehensive network conditions, e.g., a WF classifier may be trained only on
samples collected on specific high-bandwidth network links but deployed on
connections with different network conditions. We show that augmenting network
traces can enhance the performance of WF classifiers in unobserved network
conditions. Specifically, we introduce NetAugment, an augmentation technique
tailored to the specifications of Tor traces. We instantiate NetAugment through
semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques. Our extensive
open-world and close-world experiments demonstrate that under practical
evaluation settings, our WF attacks provide superior performances compared to
the state-of-the-art; this is due to their use of augmented network traces for
training, which allows them to learn the features of target traffic in
unobserved settings. For instance, with a 5-shot learning in a closed-world
scenario, our self-supervised WF attack (named NetCLR) reaches up to 80%
accuracy when the traces for evaluation are collected in a setting unobserved
by the WF adversary. This is compared to an accuracy of 64.4% achieved by the
state-of-the-art Triplet Fingerprinting [35]. We believe that the promising
results of our work can encourage the use of network trace augmentation in
other types of network traffic analysis.

<p class="mathjax">In continual learning (CL), an AI agent (e.g., autonomous vehicles or
robotics) learns from non-stationary data streams under dynamic environments.
For the practical deployment of such applications, it is important to guarantee
robustness to unseen environments while maintaining past experiences. In this
paper, a novel CL framework is proposed to achieve robust generalization to
dynamic environments while retaining past knowledge. The considered CL agent
uses a capacity-limited memory to save previously observed environmental
information to mitigate forgetting issues. Then, data points are sampled from
the memory to estimate the distribution of risks over environmental change so
as to obtain predictors that are robust with unseen changes. The generalization
and memorization performance of the proposed framework are theoretically
analyzed. This analysis showcases the tradeoff between memorization and
generalization with the memory size. Experiments show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms memory-based CL baselines across all environments while
significantly improving the generalization performance on unseen target
environments.

training multi-task policies from large offline datasets that can leverage both
human demonstrations and autonomously collected data. Our method uses a
Transformer to provide a scalable representation for Q-functions trained via
offline temporal difference backups. We therefore refer to the method as
Q-Transformer. By discretizing each action dimension and representing the
Q-value of each action dimension as separate tokens, we can apply effective
high-capacity sequence modeling techniques for Q-learning. We present several
design decisions that enable good performance with offline RL training, and
show that Q-Transformer outperforms prior offline RL algorithms and imitation
learning techniques on a large diverse real-world robotic manipulation task
suite. The project's website and videos can be found at

<p class="mathjax">The manufacturing sector has a substantial influence on worldwide energy
consumption. Therefore, improving manufacturing system energy efficiency is
becoming increasingly important as the world strives to move toward a more
resilient and sustainable energy paradigm. Batch processes are a major
contributor to energy consumption in manufacturing systems. In batch
manufacturing, a number of parts are grouped together before starting a batch
process. To improve the scheduling and control of batch manufacturing
processes, we propose a system-level energy-efficient Digital Twin framework
that considers Time-of-Use (TOU) energy pricing for runtime decision-making. As
part of this framework, we develop a model that combines batch manufacturing
process dynamics and TOU-based energy cost. We also provide an
optimization-based decision-making algorithm that makes batch scheduling
decisions during runtime. A simulated case study showcases the benefits of the
proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic surgical subtask automation has the potential to reduce the
per-patient workload of human surgeons. There are a variety of surgical
subtasks that require geometric information of subsurface anatomy, such as the
location of tumors, which necessitates accurate and efficient surgical sensing.
In this work, we propose an automated sensing method that maps 3D subsurface
anatomy to provide such geometric knowledge. We model the anatomy via a
Bayesian Hilbert map-based probabilistic 3D occupancy map. Using the 3D
occupancy map, we plan sensing paths on the surface of the anatomy via a graph
search algorithm, $A^*$ search, with a cost function that enables the
trajectories generated to balance between exploration of unsensed regions and
refining the existing probabilistic understanding. We demonstrate the
performance of our proposed method by comparing it against 3 different methods
in several anatomical environments including a real-life CT scan dataset. The
experimental results show that our method efficiently detects relevant
subsurface anatomy with shorter trajectories than the comparison methods, and
the resulting occupancy map achieves high accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Offline handwriting recognition (HWR) has improved significantly with the
advent of deep learning architectures in recent years. Nevertheless, it remains
a challenging problem and practical applications often rely on post-processing
techniques for restricting the predicted words via lexicons or language models.
Despite their enhanced performance, such systems are less usable in contexts
where out-of-vocabulary words are anticipated, e.g. for detecting misspelled
words in school assessments. To that end, we introduce the task of comparing a
handwriting image to text. To solve the problem, we propose an unrestricted
binary classifier, consisting of a HWR feature extractor and a multimodal
classification head which convolves the feature extractor output with the
vector representation of the input text. Our model's classification head is
trained entirely on synthetic data created using a state-of-the-art generative
adversarial network. We demonstrate that, while maintaining high recall, the
classifier can be calibrated to achieve an average precision increase of 19.5%
compared to addressing the task by directly using state-of-the-art HWR models.
Such massive performance gains can lead to significant productivity increases
in applications utilizing human-in-the-loop automation.

<p class="mathjax">Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a
challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and
communication capabilities. The robots must execute a
Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local
environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A
fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what
information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions
while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has
been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as
flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully
decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily
remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing
frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference,
which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are
used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In
particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer
information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized
inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are
asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information,
communication, action inference, and control execution at different
frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed
framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large
environments.

<p class="mathjax">Our vision of the future world is one wherein everything, anywhere and at any
time, can reliably communicate in real time. 5G, the fifth generation of
cellular networks, is anticipated to use heterogeneity to deliver ultra-high
data rates to a vastly increased number of devices in ultra-dense areas.
Improving the backhaul network capacity is one of the most important open
challenges for deploying a 5G network. A promising solution is Integrated
Access and Backhaul (IAB), which assigns a portion of radio resources to
construct a multi-hop wireless backhaul network. Although 3GPP has acknowledged
the cost-effectiveness of the IAB-enabled framework and its orchestration has
been extensively studied in the literature, its transmission capacity (i.e.,
the number of base stations it can support) has not been sufficiently
investigated. In this paper, we formulate the problem of maximizing
transmission capacity and minimizing transmit powers for IAB-enabled multi-hop
networks, taking into account relay selection, channel assignment, and power
control constraints. Then, the solution space of the problem is analyzed, two
optimality bounds are derived, and a heuristic algorithm is proposed to
investigate the bounds. The claims are finally supported by numerical results.

<p class="mathjax">As automated web accessibility testing tools become enriched with new and
improved tests, it can be impractical to leverage those advances. Each tool
offers unique benefits, but effectively using multiple tools would require
integrating them into a uniform testing and reporting scheme. Such integration
is complex, because tools vary in what they try to detect, what they actually
detect, and how they classify, describe, and report defects. Consequently,
testers typically use only one tool.
<br />Testaro is a novel open-source NPM package that checks compliance with about
650 rules defined by an ensemble of 8 tools: alfa, Axe, Equal Access, HTML
CodeSniffer, Nu Html Checker, QualWeb, Testaro, and WAVE.
<br />Attendees at the demonstration will, within 5 minutes, create jobs for
Testaro, run them, and generate unified reports documenting more accessibility
issues than any single tool can discover.

<p class="mathjax">We evaluate the ability of semantic parsers based on large language models
(LLMs) to handle contextual utterances. In real-world settings, there typically
exists only a limited number of annotated contextual utterances due to
annotation cost, resulting in an imbalance compared to non-contextual
utterances. Therefore, parsers must adapt to contextual utterances with a few
training examples. We examine four major paradigms for doing so in
conversational semantic parsing i.e., Parse-with-Utterance-History,
Parse-with-Reference-Program, Parse-then-Resolve, and Rewrite-then-Parse. To
facilitate such cross-paradigm comparisons, we construct
SMCalFlow-EventQueries, a subset of contextual examples from SMCalFlow with
additional annotations. Experiments with in-context learning and fine-tuning
suggest that Rewrite-then-Parse is the most promising paradigm when
holistically considering parsing accuracy, annotation cost, and error types.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing abundance of video data enables users to search for events of
interest, e.g., emergency incidents. Meanwhile, it raises new concerns, such as
the need for preserving privacy. Existing approaches to video search require
either manual inspection or a deep learning model with massive training. We
develop a method that uses recent advances in vision and language models, as
well as formal methods, to search for events of interest in video clips
automatically and efficiently. The method consists of an algorithm to map
text-based event descriptions into linear temporal logic over finite traces
(LTL$_f$) and an algorithm to construct an automaton encoding the video
information. Then, the method formally verifies the automaton representing the
video against the LTL$_f$ specifications and adds the pertinent video clips to
the search result if the automaton satisfies the specifications. We provide
qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the video-searching
capability of the proposed method. It achieves over 90 percent precision in
searching over privacy-sensitive videos and a state-of-the-art autonomous
driving dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus serves as a standard protocol for
facilitating communication among various electronic control units (ECUs) within
contemporary vehicles. However, it has been demonstrated that the CAN bus is
susceptible to remote attacks, which pose risks to the vehicle's safety and
functionality. To tackle this concern, researchers have introduced intrusion
detection systems (IDSs) to identify and thwart such attacks. In this paper, we
present an innovative approach to intruder detection within the CAN bus,
leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) techniques as introduced by Zhang,
Tong, Xu, and Maciejewski in 2019. By harnessing the capabilities of deep
learning, we aim to enhance attack detection accuracy while minimizing the
requirement for manual feature engineering. Our experimental findings
substantiate that the proposed GCN-based method surpasses existing IDSs in
terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, our approach
demonstrates efficacy in detecting mixed attacks, which are more challenging to
identify than single attacks. Furthermore, it reduces the necessity for
extensive feature engineering and is particularly well-suited for real-time
detection systems. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the pioneering
application of GCN to CAN data for intrusion detection. Our proposed approach
holds significant potential in fortifying the security and safety of modern
vehicles, safeguarding against attacks and preventing them from undermining
vehicle functionality.

<p class="mathjax">Learning from human demonstrations (behavior cloning) is a cornerstone of
robot learning. However, most behavior cloning algorithms require a large
number of demonstrations to learn a task, especially for general tasks that
have a large variety of initial conditions. Humans, however, can learn to
complete tasks, even complex ones, after only seeing one or two demonstrations.
Our work seeks to emulate this ability, using behavior cloning to learn a task
given only a single human demonstration. We achieve this goal by using linear
transforms to augment the single demonstration, generating a set of
trajectories for a wide range of initial conditions. With these demonstrations,
we are able to train a behavior cloning agent to successfully complete three
block manipulation tasks. Additionally, we developed a novel addition to the
temporal ensembling method used by action chunking agents during inference. By
incorporating the standard deviation of the action predictions into the
ensembling method, our approach is more robust to unforeseen changes in the
environment, resulting in significant performance improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory retiming is the task of computing a feasible time parameterization
to traverse a path. It is commonly used in the decoupled approach to trajectory
optimization whereby a path is first found, then a retiming algorithm computes
a speed profile that satisfies kino-dynamic and other constraints. While
trajectory retiming is most often formulated with the minimum-time objective
(i.e. traverse the path as fast as possible), it is not always the most
desirable objective, particularly when we seek to balance multiple objectives
or when bang-bang control is unsuitable. In this paper, we present a novel
algorithm based on factor graph variable elimination that can solve for the
global optimum of the retiming problem with quadratic objectives as well (e.g.
minimize control effort or match a nominal speed by minimizing squared error),
which may extend to arbitrary objectives with iteration. Our work extends prior
works, which find only solutions on the boundary of the feasible region, while
maintaining the same linear time complexity from a single forward-backward
pass. We experimentally demonstrate that (1) we achieve better real-world robot
performance by using quadratic objectives in place of the minimum-time
objective, and (2) our implementation is comparable or faster than
state-of-the-art retiming algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The Metaverse is a new paradigm that aims to create a virtual environment
consisting of numerous worlds, each of which will offer a different set of
services. To deal with such a dynamic and complex scenario, considering the
stringent quality of service requirements aimed at the 6th generation of
communication systems (6G), one potential approach is to adopt self-sustaining
strategies, which can be realized by employing Adaptive Artificial Intelligence
(Adaptive AI) where models are continually re-trained with new data and
conditions. One aspect of self-sustainability is the management of multiple
access to the frequency spectrum. Although several innovative methods have been
proposed to address this challenge, mostly using Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL), the problem of adapting agents to a non-stationary environment has not
yet been precisely addressed. This paper fills in the gap in the current
literature by investigating the problem of multiple access in multi-channel
environments to maximize the throughput of the intelligent agent when the
number of active User Equipments (UEs) may fluctuate over time. To solve the
problem, a Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) technique empowered by Continual
Learning (CL) is proposed to overcome the non-stationary situation, while the
environment is unknown. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to
other well-known methods, the CL-DDQL algorithm achieves significantly higher
throughputs with a considerably shorter convergence time in highly dynamic
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, as the need for capacity continues to grow, entirely novel services
are emerging. A solid cloud-network integrated infrastructure is necessary to
supply these services in a real-time responsive, and scalable way. Due to their
diverse characteristics and limited capacity, communication and computing
resources must be collaboratively managed to unleash their full potential.
Although several innovative methods have been proposed to orchestrate the
resources, most ignored network resources or relaxed the network as a simple
graph, focusing only on cloud resources. This paper fills the gap by studying
the joint problem of communication and computing resource allocation, dubbed
CCRA, including function placement and assignment, traffic prioritization, and
path selection considering capacity constraints and quality requirements, to
minimize total cost. We formulate the problem as a non-linear programming model
and propose two approaches, dubbed B\&amp;B-CCRA and WF-CCRA, based on the Branch
\&amp; Bound and Water-Filling algorithms to solve it when the system is fully
known. Then, for partially known systems, a Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL)
architecture is designed. Numerical simulations show that B\&amp;B-CCRA optimally
solves the problem, whereas WF-CCRA delivers near-optimal solutions in a
substantially shorter time. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that DDQL-CCRA
obtains near-optimal solutions in the absence of request-specific information.

<p class="mathjax">With the recent wave of digitalization, specifically in the context of
safety-critical applications, there has been a growing need for computationally
efficient, accurate, generalizable, and trustworthy models. Physics-based
models have traditionally been used extensively for simulating and
understanding complex phenomena. However, these models though trustworthy and
generalizable to a wide array of problems, are not ideal for real-time. To
address this issue, the physics-based models are simplified. Unfortunately,
these simplifications, like reducing the dimension of the problem (3D to 2D) or
linearizing the highly non-linear characteristics of the problem, can degrade
model accuracy. Data-driven models, on the other hand, can exhibit better
computational efficiency and accuracy. However, they fail to generalize and
operate as blackbox, limiting their acceptability in safety-critical
applications. In the current article, we demonstrate how we can use a
data-driven approach to correct for the two kinds of simplifications in a
physics-based model. To demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness, we apply
the method to model several elasticity problems. The results show that the
hybrid approach, which we call the corrective source term approach, can make
erroneous physics-based models more accurate and certain. The hybrid model also
exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy, model uncertainty, and
generalizability when compared to its end-to-end data-driven modeling
counterpart.

<p class="mathjax">Rigidity of the interaction graph is a fundamental condition for achieving
the desired formation which can be defined in terms of distance or bearing
constraints between agents. In this paper, for reaching a unique formation with
the same scaling and orientation as the target formation, both distance and
bearing constraints are considered for defining the desired formation. Besides,
both distance and bearing measurements are also available. Each agent is able
to gather the measurements with respect to other agents in its own body frame.
So, the agents are coordinated-free concerning a global reference frame. On the
other hand, the framework is embedded in SE(3). The control signal is designed
based on a gradient descent method by introducing a cost function. Firstly, the
formation problem is considered for bearing-only constraints in SE(3)
configuration. Then, the formation control is expressed for the general case of
both bearing and distance constraints. Furthermore, the essential conditions
that guarantee reaching the desired formation are discussed. Finally, the
validity of the proposed formation control is verified by numerical
simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Novel applications such as the Metaverse have highlighted the potential of
beyond 5G networks, which necessitate ultra-low latency communications and
massive broadband connections. Moreover, the burgeoning demand for such
services with ever-fluctuating users has engendered a need for heightened
service continuity consideration in B5G. To enable these services, the
edge-cloud paradigm is a potential solution to harness cloud capacity and
effectively manage users in real time as they move across the network. However,
edge-cloud networks confront a multitude of limitations, including networking
and computing resources that must be collectively managed to unlock their full
potential. This paper addresses the joint problem of service placement and
resource allocation in a network-cloud integrated environment while considering
capacity constraints, dynamic users, and end-to-end delays. We present a
non-linear programming model that formulates the optimization problem with the
aiming objective of minimizing overall cost while enhancing latency. Next, to
address the problem, we introduce a DDQL-based technique using RNNs to predict
user behavior, empowered by a water-filling-based algorithm for service
placement. The proposed framework adeptly accommodates the dynamic nature of
users, the placement of services that mandate ultra-low latency in B5G, and
service continuity when users migrate from one location to another. Simulation
results show that our solution provides timely responses that optimize the
network's potential, offering a scalable and efficient placement.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning is well known for its ability to model sequential
tasks and learn latent data patterns adaptively. Deep learning models have been
widely explored and adopted in regression and classification tasks. However,
deep learning has its limitations such as the assumption of equally spaced and
ordered data, and the lack of ability to incorporate graph structure in terms
of time-series prediction. Graphical neural network (GNN) has the ability to
overcome these challenges and capture the temporal dependencies in time-series
data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for predicting time-series
data using GNN and monitoring with Reinforcement Learning (RL). GNNs are able
to explicitly incorporate the graph structure of the data into the model,
allowing them to capture temporal dependencies in a more natural way. This
approach allows for more accurate predictions in complex temporal structures,
such as those found in healthcare, traffic and weather forecasting. We also
fine-tune our GraphRL model using a Bayesian optimisation technique to further
improve performance. The proposed framework outperforms the baseline models in
time-series forecasting and monitoring. The contributions of this study include
the introduction of a novel GraphRL framework for time-series prediction and
the demonstration of the effectiveness of GNNs in comparison to traditional
deep learning models such as RNNs and LSTMs. Overall, this study demonstrates
the potential of GraphRL in providing accurate and efficient predictions in
dynamic RL environments.

<p class="mathjax">Qualitative methods like interviews produce richer data in comparison with
quantitative surveys, but are difficult to scale. Switching from web-based
questionnaires to interactive chatbots offers a compromise, improving user
engagement and response quality. Uptake remains limited, however, because of
differences in users' expectations versus the capabilities of natural language
processing methods. In this study, we evaluate the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to support an information elicitation chatbot that narrows this
"gulf of expectations" (Luger &amp; Sellen 2016). We conduct a user study in which
participants (N = 399) were randomly assigned to interact with a rule-based
chatbot versus one of two LLM-augmented chatbots. We observe limited evidence
of differences in user engagement or response richness between conditions.
However, the addition of LLM-based dynamic probing skills produces significant
improvements in both quantitative and qualitative measures of user experience,
consistent with a narrowing of the expectations gulf.

<p class="mathjax">The modeling of multistage manufacturing systems (MMSs) has attracted
increased attention from both academia and industry. Recent advancements in
deep learning methods provide an opportunity to accomplish this task with
reduced cost and expertise. This study introduces a stochastic deep Koopman
(SDK) framework to model the complex behavior of MMSs. Specifically, we present
a novel application of Koopman operators to propagate critical quality
information extracted by variational autoencoders. Through this framework, we
can effectively capture the general nonlinear evolution of product quality
using a transferred linear representation, thus enhancing the interpretability
of the data-driven model. To evaluate the performance of the SDK framework, we
carried out a comparative study on an open-source dataset. The main findings of
this paper are as follows. Our results indicate that SDK surpasses other
popular data-driven models in accuracy when predicting stagewise product
quality within the MMS. Furthermore, the unique linear propagation property in
the stochastic latent space of SDK enables traceability for quality evolution
throughout the process, thereby facilitating the design of root cause analysis
schemes. Notably, the proposed framework requires minimal knowledge of the
underlying physics of production lines. It serves as a virtual metrology tool
that can be applied to various MMSs, contributing to the ultimate goal of Zero
Defect Manufacturing.

<p class="mathjax">Learning effective recommendation models from sparse user interactions
represents a fundamental challenge in developing modern sequential
recommendation methods. Recently, pre-training-based methods have been
developed to tackle this challenge. The key idea behind these methods is to
learn transferable knowledge from related tasks (i.e., auxiliary tasks) via
pre-training and adapt the knowledge to the task of interest (i.e., target
task) to mitigate its data sparsity, thereby enabling more accurate
recommendations. Though promising, in this paper, we show that existing methods
suffer from the notorious negative transfer issue, where the model adapted from
the pre-trained model results in worse performance compared to the model
learned from scratch in the target task. To address this issue, we develop a
method, denoted as ANT, for transferable sequential recommendation. Compared to
existing methods, ANT mitigates negative transfer by 1) incorporating
multi-modality item information, including item texts, images and prices, to
effectively learn more transferable knowledge from auxiliary tasks; and 2)
better capturing task-specific knowledge in the target task using a
re-learning-based adaptation strategy. We evaluate ANT against eight
state-of-the-art baseline methods on five target tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that ANT does not suffer from the negative transfer issue
on any of the five tasks. The results also demonstrate that ANT substantially
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in five target tasks with an
improvement of as much as 15.2%. Our analysis highlights the utility of item
texts, images and prices together for sequential recommendation. It also
demonstrates that our re-learning-based strategy is more effective than
fine-tuning on all five target tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear strategy for the motion and force
control of flexible manipulators is proposed. The approach provides robust
motion control until contact is detected when force control is then
available--without any control switch--, and vice versa. This self-tuning in
mixed contact/non-contact scenarios is possible thanks to the unified
formulation of force and motion control, including an integral transpose-based
inverse kinematics and adaptive-update laws for the flexible manipulator link
and contact stiffnesses. Global boundedness of all signals and asymptotic
stability of force and position are guaranteed through Lyapunov analysis. The
control strategy and its implementation has been validated using a low-cost
basic microcontroller and a manipulator with 3 flexible joints and 4 actuators.
Complete experimental results are provided in a realistic mixed contact
scenario, demonstrating very-low computational demand with inexpensive force
sensors.

with a high penetration of solar generation units, operating under a sparse

<p class="mathjax">Neuro-evolutionary methods have proven effective in addressing a wide range
of tasks. However, the study of the robustness and generalisability of evolved
artificial neural networks (ANNs) has remained limited. This has immense
implications in the fields like robotics where such controllers are used in
control tasks. Unexpected morphological or environmental changes during
operation can risk failure if the ANN controllers are unable to handle these
changes. This paper proposes an algorithm that aims to enhance the robustness
and generalisability of the controllers. This is achieved by introducing
morphological variations during the evolutionary process. As a results, it is
possible to discover generalist controllers that can handle a wide range of
morphological variations sufficiently without the need of the information
regarding their morphologies or adaptation of their parameters. We perform an
extensive experimental analysis on simulation that demonstrates the trade-off
between specialist and generalist controllers. The results show that
generalists are able to control a range of morphological variations with a cost
of underperforming on a specific morphology relative to a specialist. This
research contributes to the field by addressing the limited understanding of
robustness and generalisability in neuro-evolutionary methods and proposes a
method by which to improve these properties.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet aligning these models with human values and preferences using RLHF remains
a significant challenge. This challenge is characterized by various
instabilities, such as reward hacking and catastrophic forgetting. In this
technical report, we propose two innovations to stabilize RLHF training: 1)
Advantage Model, which directly models advantage score i.e., extra reward
compared to the expected rewards and regulates score distributions across tasks
to prevent reward hacking. 2) Selective Rehearsal, which mitigates catastrophic
forgetting by strategically selecting data for PPO training and knowledge
rehearsing. Our experimental analysis on public and proprietary datasets
reveals that the proposed methods not only increase stability in RLHF training
but also achieve higher reward scores and win rates.

<p class="mathjax">Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice that aims to
reduce the cost and risk of code integration among teams. Recent empirical
studies have confirmed associations between CI and the software quality (SQ).
However, no existing study investigates causal relationships between CI and SQ.
This paper investigates it by applying the causal Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
technique. We combine two other strategies to support this technique: a
literature review and a Mining Software Repository (MSR) study. In the first
stage, we review the literature to discover existing associations between CI
and SQ, which help us create a "literature-based causal DAG" in the second
stage. This DAG encapsulates the literature assumptions regarding CI and its
influence on SQ. In the third stage, we analyze 12 activity months for 70
opensource projects by mining software repositories -- 35 CI and 35 no-CI
projects. This MSR study is not a typical "correlation is not causation" study
because it is used to verify the relationships uncovered in the causal DAG
produced in the first stages. The fourth stage consists of testing the
statistical implications from the "literature-based causal DAG" on our dataset.
Finally, in the fifth stage, we build a DAG with observations from the
literature and the dataset, the "literature-data DAG". In addition to the
direct causal effect of CI on SQ, we find evidence of indirect effects of CI.
For example, CI affects teams' communication, which positively impacts SQ. We
also highlight the confounding effect of project age.

<p class="mathjax">Open-set logo recognition is commonly solved by first detecting possible logo
regions and then matching the detected parts against an ever-evolving dataset
of cropped logo images. The matching model, a metric learning problem, is
especially challenging for logo recognition due to the mixture of text and
symbols in logos. We propose two novel contributions to improve the matching
model's performance: (a) using image-text paired samples for pre-training, and
(b) an improved metric learning loss function. A standard paradigm of
fine-tuning ImageNet pre-trained models fails to discover the text sensitivity
necessary to solve the matching problem effectively. This work demonstrates the
importance of pre-training on image-text pairs, which significantly improves
the performance of a visual embedder trained for the logo retrieval task,
especially for more text-dominant classes. We construct a composite public logo
dataset combining LogoDet3K, OpenLogo, and FlickrLogos-47 deemed
OpenLogoDet3K47. We show that the same vision backbone pre-trained on
image-text data, when fine-tuned on OpenLogoDet3K47, achieves $98.6\%$
recall@1, significantly improving performance over pre-training on Imagenet1K
($97.6\%$). We generalize the ProxyNCA++ loss function to propose ProxyNCAHN++
which incorporates class-specific hard negative images. The proposed method
sets new state-of-the-art on five public logo datasets considered, with a
$3.5\%$ zero-shot recall@1 improvement on LogoDet3K test, $4\%$ on OpenLogo,
$6.5\%$ on FlickrLogos-47, $6.2\%$ on Logos In The Wild, and $0.6\%$ on

<p class="mathjax">Two prevalent types of distributional shifts in machine learning are the
covariate shift (as observed across different domains) and the semantic shift
(as seen across different classes). Traditional OOD detection techniques
typically address only one of these shifts. However, real-world testing
environments often present a combination of both covariate and semantic shifts.
In this study, we introduce a novel problem, semantic OOD detection across
domains, which simultaneously addresses both distributional shifts. To this
end, we introduce two regularization strategies: domain generalization
regularization, which ensures semantic invariance across domains to counteract
the covariate shift, and OOD detection regularization, designed to enhance OOD
detection capabilities against the semantic shift through energy bounding.
Through rigorous testing on three standard domain generalization benchmarks,
our proposed framework showcases its superiority over conventional domain
generalization approaches in terms of OOD detection performance. Moreover, it
holds its ground by maintaining comparable InD classification accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">We consider how human-centered causal theories and tools from the dynamical
systems literature can be deployed to guide the representation of data when
training neural networks for complex classification tasks. Specifically, we use
simulated data to show that training a neural network with a data
representation that makes explicit the invariant structural causal features of
the data generating process of an epidemic system improves out-of-distribution
(OOD) generalization performance on a classification task as compared to a more
naive approach to data representation. We take these results to demonstrate
that using human-generated causal knowledge to reduce the epistemic uncertainty
of ML developers can lead to more well-specified ML pipelines. This, in turn,
points to the utility of a dynamical systems approach to the broader effort
aimed at improving the robustness and safety of machine learning systems via
improved ML system development practices.

<p class="mathjax">New web technologies have enabled the deployment of powerful GPU-based
computational pipelines that run entirely in the web browser, opening a new
frontier for accessible scientific visualization applications. However, these
new capabilities do not address the memory constraints of lightweight end-user
devices encountered when attempting to visualize the massive data sets produced
by today's simulations and data acquisition systems. In this paper, we propose
a novel implicit isosurface rendering algorithm for interactive visualization
of massive volumes within a small memory footprint. We achieve this by
progressively traversing a wavefront of rays through the volume and
decompressing blocks of the data on-demand to perform implicit ray-isosurface
intersections. The progressively rendered surface is displayed after each pass
to improve interactivity. Furthermore, to accelerate rendering and increase GPU
utilization, we introduce speculative ray-block intersection into our
algorithm, where additional blocks are traversed and intersected speculatively
along rays as other rays terminate to exploit additional parallelism in the
workload. Our entire pipeline is run in parallel on the GPU to leverage the
parallel computing power that is available even on lightweight end-user
devices. We compare our algorithm to the state of the art in low-overhead
isosurface extraction and demonstrate that it achieves 1.7x-5.7x reductions in
memory overhead and up to 8.4x reductions in data decompressed.

<p class="mathjax">Maintaining a maximum bipartite matching online while minimizing
recourse/augmentations is a well studied problem, motivated by content
delivery, job scheduling, and hashing. A breakthrough result of Bernstein,
Holm, and Rotenberg (\emph{SODA 2018}) resolved this problem up to a
logarithmic factors. However, we may need a richer class of combinatorial
constraints (e.g., matroid constraints) to model other problems in scheduling
and resource allocation.
<br />We consider the problem of maintaining a maximum independent set of an
arbitrary matroid $\mathcal{M}$ and a partition matroid $\mathcal{P}$ in the
online setting. Specifically, at each timestep $t$ one part $P_t$ of the
partition matroid (i.e., a subset of elements) is revealed: we must now select
at most one of these newly-revealed elements, but can exchange some of the
previously selected elements for new ones from previous parts, to maintain a
maximum independent set on the elements seen thus far. The goal is to minimize
the number of augmentations/changes done by our algorithm. If $\mathcal{M}$ is
also a partition matroid, we recover the problem of maintaining a maximum
bipartite matching online with recourse as a special case. In our work, we
allow arbitrary matroids $\mathcal{M}$, and so we can model broader classes of
problems.
<br />Our main result is an $O(n \log^2 n)$-competitive algorithm, where $n$ is the
rank of the largest common base; this matches the current best quantitative
bound for the bipartite matching special case. Our result builds substantively
on the breakthrough result of Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg for maintaining
bipartite matchings: a key contribution of our work is to make connections to
market equilibria and prices, and our use of properties of these equilibria in
submodular utility allocation markets to prove our bound on the number of
augmentations.

<p class="mathjax">Data mining reproduces colonialism, and Indigenous voices are being left out
of the development of technology that relies on data, such as artificial
intelligence. This research stresses the need for the inclusion of Indigenous
Data Sovereignty and centers on the importance of Indigenous rights over their
own data. Inclusion is necessary in order to integrate Indigenous knowledge
into the design, development, and implementation of data-reliant technology. To
support this hypothesis and address the problem, the CARE Principles for
Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics) are applied. We cover how the colonial practices of
data mining do not align with Indigenous convictions. The included case studies
highlight connections to Indigenous rights in relation to the protection of
data and environmental ecosystems, thus establishing how data governance can
serve both the people and the Earth. By applying the CARE Principles to the
issues that arise from data mining and neocolonialism, our goal is to provide a
framework that can be used in technological development. The theory is that
this could reflect outwards to promote data sovereignty generally and create
new relationships between people and data that are ethical as opposed to driven
by speed and profit.

<p class="mathjax">Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been widely used
in many robotic applications for sequential decision-making under uncertainty.
POMDP online planning algorithms such as Partially Observable Monte-Carlo
Planning (POMCP) can solve very large POMDPs with the goal of maximizing the
expected return. But the resulting policies cannot provide safety guarantees
that are imperative for real-world safety-critical tasks (e.g., autonomous
driving). In this work, we consider safety requirements represented as
almost-sure reach-avoid specifications (i.e., the probability to reach a set of
goal states is one and the probability to reach a set of unsafe states is
zero). We compute shields that restrict unsafe actions violating almost-sure
reach-avoid specifications. We then integrate these shields into the POMCP
algorithm for safe POMDP online planning. We propose four distinct shielding
methods, differing in how the shields are computed and integrated, including
factored variants designed to improve scalability. Experimental results on a
set of benchmark domains demonstrate that the proposed shielding methods
successfully guarantee safety (unlike the baseline POMCP without shielding) on
large POMDPs, with negligible impact on the runtime for online planning.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation is a vital problem in computer vision. Recently, a
common solution to semantic segmentation is the end-to-end convolution neural
network, which is much more accurate than traditional methods.Recently, the
decoders based on attention achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
various datasets. But these networks always are compared with the mIoU of
previous SOTA networks to prove their superiority and ignore their
characteristics without considering the computation complexity and precision in
various categories, which is essential for engineering applications. Besides,
the methods to analyze the FLOPs and memory are not consistent between
different networks, which makes the comparison hard to be utilized. What's
more, various methods utilize attention in semantic segmentation, but the
conclusion of these methods is lacking. This paper first conducts experiments
to analyze their computation complexity and compare their performance. Then it
summarizes suitable scenes for these networks and concludes key points that
should be concerned when constructing an attention network. Last it points out
some future directions of the attention network.

<p class="mathjax">Blended learning is generally defined as the combination of traditional
face-to-face learning and online learning. This learning mode has been widely
used in advanced education across the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic's
social distance restriction as well as the development of technology. Online
learning plays an important role in blended learning, and as it requires more
student autonomy, the quality of blended learning in advanced education has
been a persistent concern. Existing literature offers several elements and
frameworks regarding evaluating the quality of blended learning. However, most
of them either have different favours for evaluation perspectives or simply
offer general guidance for evaluation, reducing the completeness, objectivity
and practicalness of related works. In order to carry out a more intuitive and
comprehensive evaluation framework, this paper proposes a hierarchy-based
analysis approach. Applying gradient boosting model and feature importance
evaluation method, this approach mainly analyses student engagement and its
three identified dimensions (behavioral engagement, emotional engagement,
cognitive engagement) to eliminate some existing stubborn problems when it
comes to blended learning evaluation. The results show that cognitive
engagement and emotional engagement play a more important role in blended
learning evaluation, implying that these two should be considered to improve
for better learning as well as teaching quality.

<p class="mathjax">Clinically, automated polyp segmentation techniques have the potential to
significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis, thereby
reducing the risk of colorectal cancer in patients. Unfortunately, existing
methods suffer from two significant weaknesses that can impact the accuracy of
segmentation. Firstly, features extracted by encoders are not adequately
filtered and utilized. Secondly, semantic conflicts and information redundancy
caused by feature fusion are not attended to. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach for polyp segmentation, named MLFF-Net, which
leverages multi-level feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Specifically,
MLFF-Net comprises three modules: Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM),
High-level Feature Enhancement Module (HFEM), and Global Attention Module
(GAM). Among these, MAM is used to extract multi-scale information and polyp
details from the shallow output of the encoder. In HFEM, the deep features of
the encoders complement each other by aggregation. Meanwhile, the attention
mechanism redistributes the weight of the aggregated features, weakening the
conflicting redundant parts and highlighting the information useful to the
task. GAM combines features from the encoder and decoder features, as well as
computes global dependencies to prevent receptive field locality. Experimental
results on five public datasets show that the proposed method not only can
segment multiple types of polyps but also has advantages over current
state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are at the forefront of neuromorphic computing
thanks to their potential energy-efficiency, low latencies, and capacity for
continual learning. While these capabilities are well suited for robotics
tasks, SNNs have seen limited adaptation in this field thus far. This work
introduces a SNN for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that is both trainable
within minutes and queryable in milliseconds, making it well suited for
deployment on compute-constrained robotic systems. Our proposed system,
VPRTempo, overcomes slow training and inference times using an abstracted SNN
that trades biological realism for efficiency. VPRTempo employs a temporal code
that determines the timing of a single spike based on a pixel's intensity, as
opposed to prior SNNs relying on rate coding that determined the number of
spikes; improving spike efficiency by over 100%. VPRTempo is trained using
Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity and a supervised delta learning rule
enforcing that each output spiking neuron responds to just a single place. We
evaluate our system on the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmark localization
datasets, which include up to 27k places. We found that VPRTempo's accuracy is
comparable to prior SNNs and the popular NetVLAD place recognition algorithm,
while being several orders of magnitude faster and suitable for real-time
deployment -- with inference speeds over 50 Hz on CPU. VPRTempo could be
integrated as a loop closure component for online SLAM on resource-constrained
systems such as space and underwater robots.

specific challenge to prototype and fabricate such a clothing is to design the
wiring layout, while minimizing the intervention to human motion. We address
this challenge by formulating the topological optimization problem on the
clothing surface as a deformation-weighted Steiner tree problem on a 3D
clothing mesh. Our method proposed an energy function for minimizing strain
energy in the wiring area under different motions, regularized by its total
length. We built the physical prototype to verify the effectiveness of our
method and conducted user study with participants of both design experts and

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR-based semantic scene understanding is an important module in the modern
autonomous driving perception stack. However, identifying Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) points in a LiDAR point cloud is challenging as point clouds lack
semantically rich features when compared with RGB images. We revisit this
problem from the perspective of selective classification, which introduces a
selective function into the standard closed-set classification setup. Our
solution is built upon the basic idea of abstaining from choosing any known
categories but learns a point-wise abstaining penalty with a marginbased loss.
Synthesizing outliers to approximate unlimited OOD samples is also critical to
this idea, so we propose a strong synthesis pipeline that generates outliers
originated from various factors: unrealistic object categories, sampling
patterns and sizes. We demonstrate that learning different abstaining
penalties, apart from point-wise penalty, for different types of (synthesized)
outliers can further improve the performance. We benchmark our method on
SemanticKITTI and nuScenes and achieve state-of-the-art results. Risk-coverage
analysis further reveals intrinsic properties of different methods. Codes and
models will be publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Machine-learning-based parameterizations (i.e. representation of sub-grid
processes) of global climate models or turbulent simulations have recently been
proposed as a powerful alternative to physical, but empirical, representations,
offering a lower computational cost and higher accuracy. Yet, those approaches
still suffer from a lack of generalization and extrapolation beyond the
training data, which is however critical to projecting climate change or
unobserved regimes of turbulence. Here we show that a multi-fidelity approach,
which integrates datasets of different accuracy and abundance, can provide the
best of both worlds: the capacity to extrapolate leveraging the
physically-based parameterization and a higher accuracy using the
machine-learning-based parameterizations. In an application to climate
modeling, the multi-fidelity framework yields more accurate climate projections
without requiring major increase in computational resources. Our multi-fidelity
randomized prior networks (MF-RPNs) combine physical parameterization data as
low-fidelity and storm-resolving historical run's data as high-fidelity. To
extrapolate beyond the training data, the MF-RPNs are tested on high-fidelity
warming scenarios, $+4K$, data. We show the MF-RPN's capacity to return much
more skillful predictions compared to either low- or high-fidelity (historical
data) simulations trained only on one regime while providing trustworthy
uncertainty quantification across a wide range of scenarios. Our approach paves
the way for the use of machine-learning based methods that can optimally
leverage historical observations or high-fidelity simulations and extrapolate
to unseen regimes such as climate change.

<p class="mathjax">Vehicles in platoons need to process many tasks to support various real-time
vehicular applications. When a task arrives at a vehicle, the vehicle may not
process the task due to its limited computation resource. In this case, it
usually requests to offload the task to other vehicles in the platoon for
processing. However, when the computation resources of all the vehicles in the
platoon are insufficient, the task cannot be processed in time through
offloading to the other vehicles in the platoon. Vehicular fog computing
(VFC)-assisted platoon can solve this problem through offloading the task to
the VFC which is formed by the vehicles driving near the platoon. Offloading
delay is an important performance metric, which is impacted by both the
offloading strategy for deciding where the task is offloaded and the number of
the allocated vehicles in VFC to process the task. Thus, it is critical to
propose an offloading strategy to minimize the offloading delay. In the
VFC-assisted platoon system, vehicles usually adopt the IEEE 802.11p
distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism while having various
computation resources. Moreover, when vehicles arrive and depart the VFC
randomly, their tasks also arrive at and depart the system randomly. In this
paper, we propose a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) based offloading
strategy while considering these factors to obtain the maximal long-term reward
reflecting the offloading delay. Our research provides a robust strategy for
task offloading in VFC systems, its effectiveness is demonstrated through
simulation experiments and comparison with benchmark strategies.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a family of curvature-based regularization terms for deep
generative model learning. Explicit coordinate-invariant formulas for both
intrinsic and extrinsic curvature measures are derived for the case of
arbitrary data manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean space.
Because computing the curvature is a highly computation-intensive process
involving the evaluation of second-order derivatives, efficient formulas are
derived for approximately evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures.
Comparative studies are conducted that compare the relative efficacy of
intrinsic versus extrinsic curvature-based regularization measures, as well as
performance comparisons against existing autoencoder training methods.
Experiments involving noisy motion capture data confirm that curvature-based
methods outperform existing autoencoder regularization methods, with intrinsic
curvature measures slightly more effective than extrinsic curvature measures.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy policies serve as the primary conduit through which online service
providers inform users about their data collection and usage procedures.
However, in a bid to be comprehensive and mitigate legal risks, these policy
documents are often quite verbose. In practical use, users tend to click the
Agree button directly rather than reading them carefully. This practice exposes
users to risks of privacy leakage and legal issues. Recently, the advent of
Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 has opened new
possibilities for text analysis, especially for lengthy documents like privacy
policies. In this study, we investigate a privacy policy text analysis
framework PolicyGPT based on the LLM. This framework was tested using two
datasets. The first dataset comprises of privacy policies from 115 websites,
which were meticulously annotated by legal experts, categorizing each segment
into one of 10 classes. The second dataset consists of privacy policies from
304 popular mobile applications, with each sentence manually annotated and
classified into one of another 10 categories. Under zero-shot learning
conditions, PolicyGPT demonstrated robust performance. For the first dataset,
it achieved an accuracy rate of 97%, while for the second dataset, it attained
an 87% accuracy rate, surpassing that of the baseline machine learning and
neural network models.

<p class="mathjax">In-memory caching systems are fundamental building blocks in cloud services.
However, due to the coupled CPU and memory on monolithic servers, existing
caching systems cannot elastically adjust resources in a resource-efficient and
agile manner. To achieve better elasticity, we propose to port in-memory
caching systems to the disaggregated memory (DM) architecture, where compute
and memory resources are decoupled and can be allocated flexibly. However,
constructing an elastic caching system on DM is challenging since accessing
cached objects with CPU-bypass remote memory accesses hinders the execution of
caching algorithms. Moreover, the elastic changes of compute and memory
resources on DM affect the access patterns of cached data, compromising the hit
rates of caching algorithms. We design Ditto, the first caching system on DM,
to address these challenges. Ditto first proposes a client-centric caching
framework to efficiently execute various caching algorithms in the compute pool
of DM, relying only on remote memory accesses. Then, Ditto employs a
distributed adaptive caching scheme that adaptively switches to the best-fit
caching algorithm in real-time based on the performance of multiple caching
algorithms to improve cache hit rates. Our experiments show that Ditto
effectively adapts to the changing resources on DM and outperforms the
state-of-the-art caching systems by up to 3.6x in real-world workloads and 9x
in YCSB

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the adoption of differential privacy (DP) in
practical database systems like PINQ, FLEX, and PrivateSQL. Such systems allow
data analysts to query sensitive data while providing a rigorous and provable
privacy guarantee. However, the existing design of these systems does not
distinguish data analysts of different privilege levels or trust levels. This
design can have an unfair apportion of the privacy budget among the data
analyst if treating them as a single entity, or waste the privacy budget if
considering them as non-colluding parties and answering their queries
independently. In this paper, we propose DProvDB, a fine-grained privacy
provenance framework for the multi-analyst scenario that tracks the privacy
loss to each single data analyst. Under this framework, when given a fixed
privacy budget, we build algorithms that maximize the number of queries that
could be answered accurately and apportion the privacy budget according to the
privilege levels of the data analysts.

<p class="mathjax">It is significant to evaluate the security of existing digital image
tampering localization algorithms in real-world applications. In this paper, we
propose an adversarial attack scheme to reveal the reliability of such
tampering localizers, which would be fooled and fail to predict altered regions
correctly. Specifically, the adversarial examples based on optimization and
gradient are implemented for white/black-box attacks. Correspondingly, the
adversarial example is optimized via reverse gradient propagation, and the
perturbation is added adaptively in the direction of gradient rising. The
black-box attack is achieved by relying on the transferability of such
adversarial examples to different localizers. Extensive evaluations verify that
the proposed attack sharply reduces the localization accuracy while preserving
high visual quality of the attacked images.

<p class="mathjax">Domain Adaptation (DA) is important for deep learning-based medical image
segmentation models to deal with testing images from a new target domain. As
the source-domain data are usually unavailable when a trained model is deployed
at a new center, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing for data and
annotation-efficient adaptation to the target domain. However, existing SFDA
methods have a limited performance due to lack of sufficient supervision with
source-domain images unavailable and target-domain images unlabeled. We propose
a novel Uncertainty-aware Pseudo Label guided (UPL) SFDA method for medical
image segmentation. Specifically, we propose Target Domain Growing (TDG) to
enhance the diversity of predictions in the target domain by duplicating the
pre-trained model's prediction head multiple times with perturbations. The
different predictions in these duplicated heads are used to obtain pseudo
labels for unlabeled target-domain images and their uncertainty to identify
reliable pseudo labels. We also propose a Twice Forward pass Supervision (TFS)
strategy that uses reliable pseudo labels obtained in one forward pass to
supervise predictions in the next forward pass. The adaptation is further
regularized by a mean prediction-based entropy minimization term that
encourages confident and consistent results in different prediction heads.
UPL-SFDA was validated with a multi-site heart MRI segmentation dataset, a
cross-modality fetal brain segmentation dataset, and a 3D fetal tissue
segmentation dataset. It improved the average Dice by 5.54, 5.01 and 6.89
percentage points for the three tasks compared with the baseline, respectively,
and outperformed several state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM) framework that generates rich and
diverse NL datasets using only Vega-Lite specifications as input, thereby
streamlining the development of Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data
visualization. We propose two techniques to synthesize relevant chart semantics
accurately and enhance syntactic diversity in each NL dataset, respectively: 1)
a guided discovery incorporated into prompting so that LLMs can steer
themselves to create varying NL datasets in a self-directed manner; 2) a
score-based paraphrasing to augment NL syntax along with four well-defined
language axes. We also present a new chart collection of 1,981 real-world
Vega-Lite specifications that have increased diversity and complexity compared
to benchmarks, to demonstrate the generalizability of our framework. The
experimental results show that our framework accurately extracts chart

respectively, while generating and paraphrasing utterances and questions with

<p class="mathjax">There is growing interest in generating skeleton-based human motions from
natural language descriptions. While most efforts have focused on developing
better neural architectures for this task, there has been no significant work
on determining the proper evaluation metric. Human evaluation is the ultimate
accuracy measure for this task, and automated metrics should correlate well
with human quality judgments. Since descriptions are compatible with many
motions, determining the right metric is critical for evaluating and designing
effective generative models. This paper systematically studies which metrics
best align with human evaluations and proposes new metrics that align even
better. Our findings indicate that none of the metrics currently used for this
task show even a moderate correlation with human judgments on a sample level.
However, for assessing average model performance, commonly used metrics such as
R-Precision and less-used coordinate errors show strong correlations.
Additionally, several recently developed metrics are not recommended due to
their low correlation compared to alternatives. We also introduce a novel
metric based on a multimodal BERT-like model, MoBERT, which offers strongly
human-correlated sample-level evaluations while maintaining near-perfect
model-level correlation. Our results demonstrate that this new metric exhibits
extensive benefits over all current alternatives.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the problem of calculating the matrix multiplication of
two massive matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ distributedly. We provide a
modulo technique that can be applied to coded distributed matrix multiplication
problems to reduce the recovery threshold. This technique exploits the special
structure of interpolation points and can be applied to many existing coded
matrix designs. Recently studied discrete Fourier transform based code achieves
a smaller recovery threshold than the optimal MatDot code with the expense that
it cannot resist stragglers. We also propose a distributed matrix
multiplication scheme based on the idea of locally repairable code to reduce
the recovery threshold of MatDot code and provide resilience to stragglers. We
also apply our constructions to a type of matrix computing problems, where
generalized linear models act as a special case.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity
and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming.
However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and
can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities.
While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial
"jailbreak" attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These
jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing
challenging. In this paper, we introduce \fuzzer, a novel black-box jailbreak
fuzzing framework inspired by AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual
engineering, \fuzzer automates the generation of jailbreak templates for
red-teaming LLMs. At its core, \fuzzer starts with human-written templates as
seeds, then mutates them using mutate operators to produce new templates. We
detail three key components of \fuzzer: a seed selection strategy for balancing
efficiency and variability, metamorphic relations for creating semantically
equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of
a jailbreak attack. We tested \fuzzer on various commercial and open-source
LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Claude2, under diverse attack scenarios.
Our results indicate that \fuzzer consistently produces jailbreak templates
with a high success rate, even in settings where all human-crafted templates
fail. Notably, even starting with suboptimal seed templates, \fuzzer maintains
over 90\% attack success rate against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models. We believe
\fuzzer will aid researchers and practitioners in assessing LLM robustness and
will spur further research into LLM safety.

<p class="mathjax">Large language model (LLM) platforms, such as ChatGPT, have recently begun
offering a plugin ecosystem to interface with third-party services on the
internet. While these plugins extend the capabilities of LLM platforms, they
are developed by arbitrary third parties and thus cannot be implicitly trusted.
Plugins also interface with LLM platforms and users using natural language,
which can have imprecise interpretations. In this paper, we propose a framework
that lays a foundation for LLM platform designers to analyze and improve the
security, privacy, and safety of current and future plugin-integrated LLM
platforms. Our framework is a formulation of an attack taxonomy that is
developed by iteratively exploring how LLM platform stakeholders could leverage
their capabilities and responsibilities to mount attacks against each other. As
part of our iterative process, we apply our framework in the context of
OpenAI's plugin ecosystem. We uncover plugins that concretely demonstrate the
potential for the types of issues that we outline in our attack taxonomy. We
conclude by discussing novel challenges and by providing recommendations to
improve the security, privacy, and safety of present and future LLM-based
computing platforms.

<p class="mathjax">While showing promising results, recent RGB-D camera-based category-level
object pose estimation methods have restricted applications due to the heavy
reliance on depth sensors. RGB-only methods provide an alternative to this
problem yet suffer from inherent scale ambiguity stemming from monocular
observations. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that decouples the 6D
pose and size estimation to mitigate the influence of imperfect scales on rigid
transformations. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained monocular estimator to
extract local geometric information, mainly facilitating the search for inlier
2D-3D correspondence. Meanwhile, a separate branch is designed to directly
recover the metric scale of the object based on category-level statistics.
Finally, we advocate using the RANSAC-P$n$P algorithm to robustly solve for 6D
object pose. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and
real datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our method over
previous state-of-the-art RGB-based approaches, especially in terms of rotation
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Joint source and channel coding (JSCC) has attracted increasing attention due
to its robustness and high efficiency. However, JSCC is vulnerable to privacy
leakage due to the high relevance between the source image and channel input.
In this paper, we propose a disentangled information bottleneck guided
privacy-protective JSCC (DIB-PPJSCC) for image transmission, which aims at
protecting private information as well as achieving superior communication
performance at the legitimate receiver. In particular, we propose a DIB
objective to disentangle private and public information. The goal is to
compress the private information in the public subcodewords, preserve the
private information in the private subcodewords and improve the reconstruction
quality simultaneously. In order to optimize JSCC neural networks using the DIB
objective, we derive a differentiable estimation of the DIB objective based on
the variational approximation and the density-ratio trick. Additionally, we
design a password-based privacy-protective (PP) algorithm which can be jointly
optimized with JSCC neural networks to encrypt the private subcodewords.
Specifically, we employ a private information encryptor to encrypt the private
subcodewords before transmission, and a corresponding decryptor to recover the
private information at the legitimate receiver. A loss function for jointly
training the encryptor, decryptor and JSCC decoder is derived based on the
maximum entropy principle, which aims at maximizing the eavesdropping
uncertainty as well as improving the reconstruction quality. Experimental
results show that DIB-PPJSCC can reduce the eavesdropping accuracy on private
information up to $15\%$ and reduce $10\%$ inference time compared to existing
privacy-protective JSCC and traditional separate methods.

<p class="mathjax">Unit testing validates the correctness of the unit under test and has become
an essential activity in software development process. A unit test consists of
a test prefix that drives the unit under test into a particular state, and a
test oracle (e.g., assertion), which specifies the behavior in that state. To
reduce manual efforts in conducting unit testing, Yu et al. proposed an
integrated approach (integration for short), combining information retrieval
(IR) with a deep learning-based approach, to generate assertions for a unit
test. Despite promising, there is still a knowledge gap as to why or where
integration works or does not work. In this paper, we describe an in-depth
analysis of the effectiveness of integration. Our analysis shows that: 1) The
overall performance of integration is mainly due to its success in retrieving
assertions. 2) integration struggles to understand the semantic differences
between the retrieved focal-test (focal-test includes a test prefix and a unit
under test) and the input focal-test; 3) integration is limited to specific
types of edit operations and cannot handle token addition or deletion. To
improve the effectiveness of assertion generation, this paper proposes a novel
retrieve-and-edit approach named EditAS. Specifically, EditAS first retrieves a
similar focal-test from a pre-defined corpus and treats its assertion as a
prototype. Then, EditAS reuses the information in the prototype and edits the
prototype automatically. EditAS is more generalizable than integration. We
conduct experiments on two large-scale datasets and experimental results
demonstrate that EditAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, with an
average improvement of 10.00%-87.48% and 3.30%-42.65% in accuracy and BLEU
score, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Non-navigable rivers and retention ponds play important roles in buffering
communities from flooding, yet emergency planners often have no data as to the
volume of water that they can carry before flooding the surrounding. This paper
describes a practical approach for using an uncrewed marine surface vehicle
(USV) to collect and merge bathymetric maps with digital surface maps of the
banks of shallow bodies of water into a unified volumetric model. The
below-waterline mesh is developed by applying the Poisson surface
reconstruction algorithm to the sparse sonar depth readings of the underwater
surface. Dense above-waterline meshes of the banks are created using commercial
structure from motion (SfM) packages. Merging is challenging for many reasons,
the most significant is gaps in sensor coverage, i.e., the USV cannot collect
sonar depth data or visually see sandy beaches leading to a bank thus the two
meshes may not intersect. The approach is demonstrated on a Hydronalix EMILY
USV with a Humminbird single beam echosounder and Teledyne FLIR camera at Lake
ESTI at the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Extension Service Disaster City complex.

<p class="mathjax">There has been significant research in the last five years on ensuring the
providers of items in a recommender system are treated fairly, particularly in
terms of the exposure the system provides to their work through its results.
However, the metrics developed to date have all been designed and tested for
linear ranked lists. It is unknown whether and how existing fair ranking
metrics for linear layouts can be applied to grid-based displays. Moreover,
depending on the device (phone, tab, or laptop) users use to interact with
systems, column size is adjusted using column reduction approaches in a
grid-view. The visibility or exposure of recommended items in grid layouts
varies based on column sizes and column reduction approaches as well. In this
paper, we extend existing fair ranking concepts and metrics to study
provider-side group fairness in grid layouts, present an analysis of the
behavior of these grid adaptations of fair ranking metrics, and study how their
behavior changes across different grid ranking layout designs and geometries.
We examine how fairness scores change with different ranking layouts to yield
insights into (1) the consistency of fair ranking measurements across layouts;
(2) whether rankings optimized for fairness in a linear ranking remain fair
when the results are displayed in a grid; and (3) the impact of column
reduction approaches to support different device geometries on fairness
measurement. This work highlights the need to use layout-specific user
attention models when measuring fairness of rankings, and provide practitioners
with a first set of insights on what to expect when translating existing fair
ranking metrics to the grid layouts in wide use today.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most popular downstream tasks in the field of Natural Language
Processing is text classification. Text classification tasks have become more
daunting when the texts are code-mixed. Though they are not exposed to such
text during pre-training, different BERT models have demonstrated success in
tackling Code-Mixed NLP challenges. Again, in order to enhance their
performance, Code-Mixed NLP models have depended on combining synthetic data
with real-world data. It is crucial to understand how the BERT models'
performance is impacted when they are pretrained using corresponding code-mixed
languages. In this paper, we introduce Tri-Distil-BERT, a multilingual model
pre-trained on Bangla, English, and Hindi, and Mixed-Distil-BERT, a model
fine-tuned on code-mixed data. Both models are evaluated across multiple NLP
tasks and demonstrate competitive performance against larger models like mBERT
and XLM-R. Our two-tiered pre-training approach offers efficient alternatives
for multilingual and code-mixed language understanding, contributing to
advancements in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Controller design for soft robots is challenging due to nonlinear deformation
and high degrees of freedom of flexible material. The data-driven approach is a
promising solution to the controller design problem for soft robots. However,
the existing data-driven controller design methods for soft robots suffer from
two drawbacks: (i) they require excessively long training time, and (ii) they
may result in potentially inefficient controllers. This paper addresses these
issues by developing two memory-based controllers for soft robots that can be
trained in a data-driven fashion: the finite memory controller (FMC) approach
and the long short-term memory (LSTM) based approach. An FMC stores the
tracking errors at different time instances and computes the actuation signal
according to a weighted sum of the stored tracking errors. We develop three
reinforcement learning algorithms for computing the optimal weights of an FMC
using the Q-learning, soft actor-critic, and deterministic policy gradient
(DDPG) methods. An LSTM-based controller is composed of an LSTM network where
the inputs of the network are the robot's desired configuration and current
configuration. The LSTM network computes the required actuation signal for the
soft robot to follow the desired configuration. We study the performance of the
proposed approaches in controlling a soft finger where, as benchmarks, we use
the existing reinforcement learning (RL) based controllers and
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Our numerical results show
that the training time of the proposed memory-based controllers is
significantly shorter than that of the classical RL-based controllers.
Moreover, the proposed controllers achieve a smaller tracking error compared
with the classical RL algorithms and the PID controller.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a
challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for
all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various
domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and
self-driving vehicles. The current approaches for MAPF can be broadly
categorized into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning.
Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality and thus does not
scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized
planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially
observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they
suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments.
In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a crowd-aware decentralized approach to
address this problem by leveraging reinforcement learning guided by a boosted
curriculum-based training strategy. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized
methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to
58% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 5% in success rate in
comparison to previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling and controlling nonlinear
systems with varying parameters. The approach introduces the use of a
parameter-varying Koopman operator (PVKO) in a lifted space, which provides an
efficient way to understand system behavior and design control algorithms that
account for underlying dynamics and changing parameters. The PVKO builds on a
conventional Koopman model by incorporating local time-invariant linear systems
through interpolation within the lifted space. This paper outlines a procedure
for identifying the PVKO and designing a model predictive control using the
identified PVKO model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
approach improves model accuracy and enables predictions based on future
parameter information. The feasibility and stability of the proposed control
approach are analyzed, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through
simulation.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce POP3D, a novel framework that creates a full $360^\circ$-view 3D
model from a single image. POP3D resolves two prominent issues that limit the
single-view reconstruction. Firstly, POP3D offers substantial generalizability
to arbitrary categories, a trait that previous methods struggle to achieve.
Secondly, POP3D further improves reconstruction fidelity and naturalness, a
crucial aspect that concurrent works fall short of. Our approach marries the
strengths of four primary components: (1) a monocular depth and normal
predictor that serves to predict crucial geometric cues, (2) a space carving
method capable of demarcating the potentially unseen portions of the target
object, (3) a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset that
can complete unseen regions of the target, and (4) a neural implicit surface
reconstruction method tailored in reconstructing objects using RGB images along
with monocular geometric cues. The combination of these components enables
POP3D to readily generalize across various in-the-wild images and generate
state-of-the-art reconstructions, outperforming similar works by a significant
margin. Project page: \url{<a href="http://cg.postech.ac.kr/research/POP3D">this http URL</a>}

<p class="mathjax">Privacy-preserving crowd density analysis finds application across a wide
range of scenarios, substantially enhancing smart building operation and
management while upholding privacy expectations in various spaces. We propose a
non-speech audio-based approach for crowd analytics, leveraging a
transformer-based model. Our results demonstrate that non-speech audio alone
can be used to conduct such analysis with remarkable accuracy. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are
proposed for predicting occupancy. As far as we know, there has been no other
similar approach of its kind prior to this. To accomplish this, we deployed our
sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval
over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images
for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based
approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines.
In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech
audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to
provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the
viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation,
while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing
robust privacy protections through differential privacy guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">During early stages of CPU design, benchmarks can only run on simulators to
evaluate CPU performance. However, most big data benchmarks are too huge at
code size scale, which causes them to be unable to finish running on simulators
at an acceptable time cost. Moreover, big data benchmarks usually need complex
software stacks to support their running, which is hard to be ported on
simulators. Proxy benchmarks, without long running times and complex software
stacks, have the same micro-architectural metrics as real benchmarks, which
means they can represent real benchmarks' micro-architectural characteristics.
Therefore, proxy benchmarks can replace real benchmarks to run on simulators to
evaluate the CPU performance. The biggest challenge is how to guarantee that
the proxy benchmarks have exactly the same micro-architectural metrics as real
benchmarks when the number of micro-architectural metrics is very large. To
deal with this challenge, we propose a linear combination-based proxy benchmark
generation methodology that transforms this problem into solving a linear
equation system. We also design the corresponding algorithms to ensure the
linear equation is astringency, which means that although sometimes the linear
equation system doesn't have a unique solution, the algorithm can find the best
solution by the non-negative least square method. We generate fifteen proxy
benchmarks and evaluate their running time and accuracy in comparison to
corresponding real benchmarks for Mysql and RockDB. On the typical Intel Xeon
platform, the average running time is 1.62s, and the average accuracy of every
micro-architectural metric is over 92%, while the longest running time of real
benchmarks is nearly 4 hours. We also conduct two case studies that demonstrate
that our proxy benchmarks are consistent with real benchmarks both before and
after prefetch or Hyper-Threading is turned on.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Unlearning is an emerging field that addresses data privacy issues by
enabling the removal of private or irrelevant data from the Machine Learning
process. Challenges related to privacy and model efficiency arise from the use
of outdated, private, and irrelevant data. These issues compromise both the
accuracy and the computational efficiency of models in both Machine Learning
and Unlearning. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel framework,
Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning
(FRAMU). This framework incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms, privacy
preservation techniques, and optimization strategies, making it a well-rounded
solution for handling various data sources, either single-modality or
multi-modality, while maintaining accuracy and privacy. FRAMU's strength lies
in its adaptability to fluctuating data landscapes, its ability to unlearn
outdated, private, or irrelevant data, and its support for continual model
evolution without compromising privacy. Our experiments, conducted on both
single-modality and multi-modality datasets, revealed that FRAMU significantly
outperformed baseline models. Additional assessments of convergence behavior
and optimization strategies further validate the framework's utility in
federated learning applications. Overall, FRAMU advances Machine Unlearning by
offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution that optimizes model performance
while also addressing key challenges in dynamic data environments.

<p class="mathjax">With the fast growth of parameter size, it becomes increasingly challenging
to deploy large generative models as they typically require large GPU memory
consumption and massive computation. Unstructured model pruning has been a
common approach to reduce both GPU memory footprint and the overall computation
while retaining good model accuracy. However, the existing solutions do not
provide a highly-efficient support for handling unstructured sparsity on modern
GPUs, especially on the highly-structured Tensor Core hardware. Therefore, we
propose Flash-LLM for enabling low-cost and highly-efficient large generative
model inference with the sophisticated support of unstructured sparsity on
high-performance but highly restrictive Tensor Cores. Based on our key
observation that the main bottleneck of generative model inference is the
several skinny matrix multiplications for which Tensor Cores would be
significantly under-utilized due to low computational intensity, we propose a
general Load-as-Sparse and Compute-as-Dense methodology for unstructured sparse
matrix multiplication. The basic insight is to address the significant memory
bandwidth bottleneck while tolerating redundant computations that are not
critical for end-to-end performance on Tensor Cores. Based on this, we design
an effective software framework for Tensor Core based unstructured SpMM,
leveraging on-chip resources for efficient sparse data extraction and
computation/memory-access overlapping. At SpMM kernel level, Flash-LLM
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art library, i.e., Sputnik and
SparTA by an average of 2.9x and 1.5x, respectively. At end-to-end framework
level on OPT-30B/66B/175B models, for tokens per GPU-second, Flash-LLM achieves
up to 3.8x and 3.6x improvement over DeepSpeed and FasterTransformer,
respectively, with significantly lower inference cost.

<p class="mathjax">Efficiently counting or detecting defective items is a crucial task in
various fields ranging from biological testing to quality control to streaming
algorithms. The group testing estimation problem concerns estimating the number
of defective elements $d$ in a collection of $n$ total within a fixed factor.
We primarily consider the classical query model, in which a query reveals
whether the selected group of elements contains a defective one. We show that
any non-adaptive randomized algorithm that estimates the value of $d$ within a
constant factor requires $\Omega(\log n)$ queries. This confirms that a known
$O(\log n)$ upper bound by Bshouty (2019) is tight and resolves a conjecture by
Damaschke and Sheikh Muhammad (2010). Additionally, we prove a similar lower
bound in the threshold query model.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic systems for manipulation in millimeter scale often use a camera with
high magnification for visual feedback of the target region. However, the
limited field-of-view (FoV) of the microscopic camera necessitates camera
motion to capture a broader workspace environment. In this work, we propose an
autonomous robotic control method to constrain a robot-held camera within a
designated FoV. Furthermore, we model the camera extrinsics as part of the
kinematic model and use camera measurements coupled with a U-Net based tool
tracking to adapt the complete robotic model during task execution. As a
proof-of-concept demonstration, the proposed framework was evaluated in a
bi-manual setup, where the microscopic camera was controlled to view a tool
moving in a pre-defined trajectory. The proposed method allowed the camera to
stay 99.5% of the time within the real FoV, compared to 48.1% without the

<p class="mathjax">Mehta and Panigrahi (2012) proposed Online Matching with Stochastic Rewards,
which generalizes the Online Bipartite Matching problem of Karp, Vazirani, and
Vazirani (1990) by associating the edges with success probabilities. This new
feature captures the pay-per-click model in online advertising. Recently, Huang
and Zhang (2020) studied this problem under the online primal dual framework
using the Configuration Linear Program (LP), and got the best known competitive
ratios of the Stochastic Balance algorithm. Their work suggests that the more
expressive Configuration LP is more suitable for this problem than the Matching
LP.
<br />This paper advances the theory of Configuration LP in two directions. Our
technical contribution includes a characterization of the joint matching
outcome of an offline vertex and \emph{all its neighbors}. This
characterization may be of independent interest, and is aligned with the spirit
of Configuration LP. By contrast, previous analyses of Ranking generally focus
on only one neighbor. Second, we designed a Stochastic Configuration LP that
captures a stochastic benchmark proposed by Goyal and Udwani (2020), who used a
Path-based LP. The Stochastic Configuration LP is smaller and simpler than the
Path-based LP. Moreover, using the new LP we improved the competitive ratio of
Stochastic Balance from $0.596$ to $0.611$ when the success probabilities are
infinitesimal, and to $0.613$ when the success probabilities are further equal.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate long-term predictions are the foundations for many machine learning
applications and decision-making processes. However, building accurate
long-term prediction models remains challenging due to the limitations of
existing temporal models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as they capture
only the statistical connections in the training data and may fail to learn the
underlying dynamics of the target system. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a novel machine learning model based on Koopman operator theory, which we call
Koopman Invertible Autoencoders (KIA), that captures the inherent
characteristic of the system by modeling both forward and backward dynamics in
the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This enables us to efficiently learn
low-dimensional representations, resulting in more accurate predictions of
long-term system behavior. Moreover, our method's invertibility design
guarantees reversibility and consistency in both forward and inverse
operations. We illustrate the utility of KIA on pendulum and climate datasets,
demonstrating 300% improvements in long-term prediction capability for pendulum
while maintaining robustness against noise. Additionally, our method excels in
long-term climate prediction, further validating our method's effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">We evaluate using Julia as a single language and ecosystem paradigm powered
by LLVM to develop workflow components for high-performance computing. We run a
Gray-Scott, 2-variable diffusion-reaction application using a memory-bound,
7-point stencil kernel on Frontier, the US Department of Energy's first
exascale supercomputer. We evaluate the feasibility, performance, scaling, and
trade-offs of (i) the computational kernel on AMD's MI250x GPUs, (ii) weak
scaling up to 4,096 MPI processes/GPUs or 512 nodes, (iii) parallel I/O writes
using the ADIOS2 library bindings, and (iv) Jupyter Notebooks for interactive
data analysis. Our results suggest that although Julia generates a reasonable
LLVM-IR kernel, a nearly 50\% performance difference exists vs. native AMD HIP
stencil codes when running on the GPUs. As expected, we observed near-zero
overhead when using MPI and parallel I/O bindings for system-wide installed
implementations. Consequently, Julia emerges as a compelling high-performance
and high-productivity workflow composition strategy, as measured on the fastest
supercomputer in the world.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence techniques can be used to classify a patient's
physical activities and predict vital signs for remote patient monitoring.
Regression analysis based on non-linear models like deep learning models has
limited explainability due to its black-box nature. This can require
decision-makers to make blind leaps of faith based on non-linear model results,
especially in healthcare applications. In non-invasive monitoring, patient data
from tracking sensors and their predisposing clinical attributes act as input
features for predicting future vital signs. Explaining the contributions of
various features to the overall output of the monitoring application is
critical for a clinician's decision-making. In this study, an Explainable AI
for Quantitative analysis (QXAI) framework is proposed with post-hoc model
explainability and intrinsic explainability for regression and classification
tasks in a supervised learning approach. This was achieved by utilizing the
Shapley values concept and incorporating attention mechanisms in deep learning
models. We adopted the artificial neural networks (ANN) and attention-based
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models for the prediction of heart rate and
classification of physical activities based on sensor data. The deep learning
models achieved state-of-the-art results in both prediction and classification
tasks. Global explanation and local explanation were conducted on input data to
understand the feature contribution of various patient data. The proposed QXAI
framework was evaluated using PPG-DaLiA data to predict heart rate and mobile
health (MHEALTH) data to classify physical activities based on sensor data.
Monte Carlo approximation was applied to the framework to overcome the time
complexity and high computation power requirements required for Shapley value
calculations.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explored how to boost speech emotion recognition (SER) with
the state-of-the-art speech pre-trained model (PTM), data2vec, text generation
technique, GPT-4, and speech synthesis technique, Azure TTS. First, we
investigated the representation ability of different speech self-supervised
pre-trained models, and we found that data2vec has a good representation
ability on the SER task. Second, we employed a powerful large language model
(LLM), GPT-4, and emotional text-to-speech (TTS) model, Azure TTS, to generate
emotionally congruent text and speech. We carefully designed the text prompt
and dataset construction, to obtain the synthetic emotional speech data with
high quality. Third, we studied different ways of data augmentation to promote
the SER task with synthetic speech, including random mixing, adversarial
training, transfer learning, and curriculum learning. Experiments and ablation
studies on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
compared with other data augmentation methods, and data augmentation with other
synthetic data.

<p class="mathjax">Diagrammatic Teaching is a paradigm for robots to acquire novel skills,
whereby the user provides 2D sketches over images of the scene to shape the
robot's motion. In this work, we tackle the problem of teaching a robot to
approach a surface and then follow cyclic motion on it, where the cycle of the
motion can be arbitrarily specified by a single user-provided sketch over an
image from the robot's camera. Accordingly, we introduce the \emph{Stable
Diffeomorphic Diagrammatic Teaching} (SDDT) framework. SDDT models the robot's
motion as an \emph{Orbitally Asymptotically Stable} (O.A.S.) dynamical system
that learns to follow the user-specified sketch. This is achieved by applying a
\emph{diffeomorphism}, i.e. a differentiable and invertible function, to morph
a known O.A.S. system. The parameterised diffeomorphism is then optimised with
respect to the Hausdorff distance between the limit cycle of our modelled
system and the sketch, to produce the desired robot motion. We provide
theoretical insight into the behaviour of the optimised system and also
empirically evaluate SDDT, both in simulation and on a quadruped with a mounted
6-DOF manipulator. Results show that we can diagrammatically teach complex
cyclic motion patterns with a high degree of accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-domain learning (MDL) aims to train a model with minimal average risk
across multiple overlapping but non-identical domains. To tackle the challenges
of dataset bias and domain domination, numerous MDL approaches have been
proposed from the perspectives of seeking commonalities by aligning
distributions to reduce domain gap or reserving differences by implementing
domain-specific towers, gates, and even experts. MDL models are becoming more
and more complex with sophisticated network architectures or loss functions,
introducing extra parameters and enlarging computation costs. In this paper, we
propose a frustratingly easy and hyperparameter-free multi-domain learning
method named Decoupled Training(D-Train). D-Train is a tri-phase
general-to-specific training strategy that first pre-trains on all domains to
warm up a root model, then post-trains on each domain by splitting into multi
heads, and finally fine-tunes the heads by fixing the backbone, enabling
decouple training to achieve domain independence. Despite its extraordinary
simplicity and efficiency, D-Train performs remarkably well in extensive
evaluations of various datasets from standard benchmarks to applications of
satellite imagery and recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed Volt-Var Control (VVC) is a widely used control mode of smart
inverters. However, necessary VVC curve parameters are remotely communicated to
the smart inverter, which opens doors for cyberattacks. If the VVC curves of an
inverter are maliciously manipulated, the attacked inverter's reactive power
injection will oscillate, causing undesirable voltage oscillations to manifest
in the distribution system, which, in turn, threatens the system's stability.
In contrast with previous works that proposed methods to mitigate the
oscillations after they are already present in the system, this paper presents
an intrusion detection method to detect malicious VVC curves once they are
communicated to the inverter. The proposed method utilizes a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) that is trained on features extracted from only the local
measurements of the inverter. After a smart inverter is equipped with the
proposed method, any communicated VVC curve will be verified by the MLP once
received. If the curve is found to be malicious, it will be rejected, thus
preventing unwanted oscillations beforehand. Otherwise, legitimate curves will
be permitted. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified using the
9-bus Canadian urban benchmark distribution system simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC
environment. Our results show that the proposed solution can accurately detect
malicious VVC curves.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a
variety of natural language tasks based on just a few examples of natural
language instructions, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering.
However, most powerful LLMs are closed-source or limited in their capability
for languages other than English. In this technical report, we present Baichuan
2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models containing 7 billion
and 13 billion parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion tokens.
Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms other open-source models of similar size on
public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore, Baichuan
2 excels in vertical domains such as medicine and law. We will release all
pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the research community in better
understanding the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot object navigation is a challenging task for home-assistance robots.
This task emphasizes visual grounding, commonsense inference and locomotion
abilities, where the first two are inherent in foundation models. But for the
locomotion part, most works still depend on map-based planning approaches. The
gap between RGB space and map space makes it difficult to directly transfer the
knowledge from foundation models to navigation tasks. In this work, we propose
a Pixel-guided Navigation skill (PixNav), which bridges the gap between the
foundation models and the embodied navigation task. It is straightforward for
recent foundation models to indicate an object by pixels, and with pixels as
the goal specification, our method becomes a versatile navigation policy
towards all different kinds of objects. Besides, our PixNav is a pure RGB-based
policy that can reduce the cost of home-assistance robots. Experiments
demonstrate the robustness of the PixNav which achieves 80+% success rate in
the local path-planning task. To perform long-horizon object navigation, we
design an LLM-based planner to utilize the commonsense knowledge between
objects and rooms to select the best waypoint. Evaluations across both
photorealistic indoor simulators and real-world environments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed navigation strategy. Code and video demos are
available at https://github.com/wzcai99/Pixel-Navigator.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world datasets are represented as tensors, i.e., multi-dimensional
arrays of numerical values. Storing them without compression often requires
substantial space, which grows exponentially with the order. While many tensor
compression algorithms are available, many of them rely on strong data
assumptions regarding its order, sparsity, rank, and smoothness. In this work,
we propose TENSORCODEC, a lossy compression algorithm for general tensors that
do not necessarily adhere to strong input data assumptions. TENSORCODEC
incorporates three key ideas. The first idea is Neural Tensor-Train
Decomposition (NTTD) where we integrate a recurrent neural network into
Tensor-Train Decomposition to enhance its expressive power and alleviate the
limitations imposed by the low-rank assumption. Another idea is to fold the
input tensor into a higher-order tensor to reduce the space required by NTTD.
Finally, the mode indices of the input tensor are reordered to reveal patterns
that can be exploited by NTTD for improved approximation. Our analysis and
experiments on 8 real-world datasets demonstrate that TENSORCODEC is (a)
Concise: it gives up to 7.38x more compact compression than the best competitor
with similar reconstruction error, (b) Accurate: given the same budget for
compressed size, it yields up to 3.33x more accurate reconstruction than the
best competitor, (c) Scalable: its empirical compression time is linear in the
number of tensor entries, and it reconstructs each entry in logarithmic time.
Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kbrother/TensorCodec.

<p class="mathjax">Cooperative online scalar field mapping is an important task for multi-robot
systems. Gaussian process regression is widely used to construct a map that
represents spatial information with confidence intervals. However, it is
difficult to handle cooperative online mapping tasks because of its high
computation and communication costs. This letter proposes a resource-efficient
cooperative online field mapping method via distributed sparse Gaussian process
regression. A novel distributed online Gaussian process evaluation method is
developed such that robots can cooperatively evaluate and find observations of
sufficient global utility to reduce computation. The bounded errors of
distributed aggregation results are guaranteed theoretically, and the
performances of the proposed algorithms are validated by real online light
field mapping experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language is an appealing medium for explaining how large language
models process and store information, but evaluating the faithfulness of such
explanations is challenging. To help address this, we develop two modes of
evaluation for natural language explanations that claim individual neurons
represent a concept in a text input. In the observational mode, we evaluate
claims that a neuron $a$ activates on all and only input strings that refer to
a concept picked out by the proposed explanation $E$. In the intervention mode,
we construe $E$ as a claim that the neuron $a$ is a causal mediator of the
concept denoted by $E$. We apply our framework to the GPT-4-generated
explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons of Bills et al. (2023) and show that even the
most confident explanations have high error rates and little to no causal
efficacy. We close the paper by critically assessing whether natural language
is a good choice for explanations and whether neurons are the best level of
analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Following the success of GPT4, there has been a surge in interest in
multimodal large language model (MLLM) research. This line of research focuses
on developing general-purpose LLMs through fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs and
vision models. However, catastrophic forgetting, a notorious phenomenon where
the fine-tuned model fails to retain similar performance compared to the
pre-trained model, still remains an inherent problem in multimodal LLMs (MLLM).
In this paper, we introduce EMT: Evaluating MulTimodality for evaluating the
catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs, by treating each MLLM as an image classifier.
We first apply EMT to evaluate several open-source fine-tuned MLLMs and we
discover that almost all evaluated MLLMs fail to retain the same performance
levels as their vision encoders on standard image classification tasks.
Moreover, we continue fine-tuning LLaVA, an MLLM and utilize EMT to assess
performance throughout the fine-tuning. Interestingly, our results suggest that
early-stage fine-tuning on an image dataset improves performance across other
image datasets, by enhancing the alignment of text and visual features.
However, as fine-tuning proceeds, the MLLMs begin to hallucinate, resulting in
a significant loss of generalizability, even when the image encoder remains
frozen. Our results suggest that MLLMs have yet to demonstrate performance on
par with their vision models on standard image classification tasks and the
current MLLM fine-tuning procedure still has room for improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate estimation of stereo camera extrinsic parameters is the key to
guarantee the performance of stereo matching algorithms. In prior arts, the
online self-calibration of stereo cameras has commonly been formulated as a
specialized visual odometry problem, without taking into account the principles
of stereo rectification. In this paper, we first delve deeply into the concept
of rectifying homography, which serves as the cornerstone for the development
of our novel stereo camera online self-calibration algorithm, for cases where
only a single pair of images is available. Furthermore, we introduce a simple
yet effective solution for globally optimum extrinsic parameter estimation in
the presence of stereo video sequences. Additionally, we emphasize the
impracticality of using three Euler angles and three components in the
translation vectors for performance quantification. Instead, we introduce four
new evaluation metrics to quantify the robustness and accuracy of extrinsic
parameter estimation, applicable to both single-pair and multi-pair cases.
Extensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor environments using
various experimental setups validate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm. The comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate its superior
performance in comparison to the baseline algorithm. Our source code, demo
video, and supplement are publicly available at mias.group/StereoCalibrator.

<p class="mathjax">We present an overview of the literature on trust in AI and AI
trustworthiness and argue for the need to distinguish these concepts more
clearly and to gather more empirically evidence on what contributes to people s
trusting behaviours. We discuss that trust in AI involves not only reliance on
the system itself, but also trust in the developers of the AI system. AI ethics
principles such as explainability and transparency are often assumed to promote
user trust, but empirical evidence of how such features actually affect how
users perceive the system s trustworthiness is not as abundance or not that
clear. AI systems should be recognised as socio-technical systems, where the
people involved in designing, developing, deploying, and using the system are
as important as the system for determining whether it is trustworthy. Without
recognising these nuances, trust in AI and trustworthy AI risk becoming
nebulous terms for any desirable feature for AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">Eliminating the rain degradation in stereo images poses a formidable
challenge, which necessitates the efficient exploitation of mutual information
present between the dual views. To this end, we devise MQINet, which employs
multi-dimension queries and interactions for stereo image deraining. More
specifically, our approach incorporates a context-aware dimension-wise queried
block (CDQB). This module leverages dimension-wise queries that are independent
of the input features and employs global context-aware attention (GCA) to
capture essential features while avoiding the entanglement of redundant or
irrelevant information. Meanwhile, we introduce an intra-view physics-aware
attention (IPA) based on the inverse physical model of rainy images. IPA
extracts shallow features that are sensitive to the physics of rain
degradation, facilitating the reduction of rain-related artifacts during the
early learning period. Furthermore, we integrate a cross-view multi-dimension
interacting attention mechanism (CMIA) to foster comprehensive feature
interaction between the two views across multiple dimensions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our model over EPRRNet
and StereoIRR, achieving respective improvements of 4.18 dB and 0.45 dB in
PSNR. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/chdwyb/MQINet}.

<p class="mathjax">Honeywords are decoy passwords that can be added to a credential database; if
a login attempt uses a honeyword, this indicates that the site's credential
database has been leaked. In this paper we explore the basic requirements for
honeywords to be effective, in a threat model where the attacker knows
passwords for the same users at other sites. First, we show that for
user-chosen (vs. algorithmically generated, i.e., by a password manager)
passwords, existing honeyword-generation algorithms largely fail to achieve
reasonable tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives in this threat
model. Second, we show that for users leveraging algorithmically generated
passwords, state-of-the-art methods for honeyword generation will produce
honeywords that are not sufficiently deceptive, yielding many false negatives.
Instead, we find that only a honeyword-generation algorithm that uses the same
password generator as the user can provide deceptive honeywords in this case.
However, when the defender's ability to infer the generator from the (one)
account password is less accurate than the attacker's ability to infer the
generator from potentially many, this deception can again wane. Taken together,
our results provide a cautionary note for the state of honeyword research and
pose new challenges to the field.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where
computers analyze data and find patterns in the data. The study focuses on the
detection of metastatic cancer using ML. Metastatic cancer is the point where
the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is the cause of
approximately 90% of cancer related deaths. Normally, pathologists spend hours
each day to manually classify whether tumors are benign or malignant. This
tedious task contributes to mislabeling metastasis being over 60% of time and
emphasizes the importance to be aware of human error, and other inefficiencies.
ML is a good candidate to improve the correct identification of metastatic
cancer saving thousands of lives and can also improve the speed and efficiency
of the process thereby taking less resources and time. So far, deep learning
methodology of AI has been used in the research to detect cancer. This study is
a novel approach to determine the potential of using preprocessing algorithms
combined with classification algorithms in detecting metastatic cancer. The
study used two preprocessing algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA) and
the genetic algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and then
used three classification algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree
classifier, and k-nearest neighbors to detect metastatic cancer in the
pathology scans. The highest accuracy of 71.14% was produced by the ML pipeline
comprising of PCA, the genetic algorithm, and the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm, suggesting that preprocessing and classification algorithms have
great potential for detecting metastatic cancer.

candidate answers, and a QA data filter to filter out high-quality QA data.
Moreover, QASnowball can be self-enhanced by reseeding the seed set to
fine-tune itself in different iterations, leading to continual improvements in
the generation quality. We conduct experiments in the high-resource English
scenario and the medium-resource Chinese scenario, and the experimental results
show that the data generated by QASnowball can facilitate QA models: (1)
training models on the generated data achieves comparable results to using
supervised data, and (2) pre-training on the generated data and fine-tuning on
supervised data can achieve better performance. Our code and generated data
will be released to advance further work.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting semantic representations from mobile user interfaces (UI) and
using the representations for designers' decision-making processes have shown
the potential to be effective computational design support tools. Current
approaches rely on machine learning models trained on small-sized mobile UI
datasets to extract semantic vectors and use screenshot-to-screenshot
comparison to retrieve similar-looking UIs given query screenshots. However,
the usability of these methods is limited because they are often not
open-sourced and have complex training pipelines for practitioners to follow,
and are unable to perform screenshot set-to-set (i.e., app-to-app) retrieval.
To this end, we (1) employ visual models trained with large web-scale images
and test whether they could extract a UI representation in a zero-shot way and
outperform existing specialized models, and (2) use mathematically founded
methods to enable app-to-app retrieval and design consistency analysis. Our
experiments show that our methods not only improve upon previous retrieval
models but also enable multiple new applications.

<p class="mathjax">2D irregular shape packing is a necessary step to arrange UV patches of a 3D
model within a texture atlas for memory-efficient appearance rendering in
computer graphics. Being a joint, combinatorial decision-making problem
involving all patch positions and orientations, this problem has well-known
NP-hard complexity. Prior solutions either assume a heuristic packing order or
modify the upstream mesh cut and UV mapping to simplify the problem, which
either limits the packing ratio or incurs robustness or generality issues.
Instead, we introduce a learning-assisted 2D irregular shape packing method
that achieves a high packing quality with minimal requirements from the input.
Our method iteratively selects and groups subsets of UV patches into
near-rectangular super patches, essentially reducing the problem to
bin-packing, based on which a joint optimization is employed to further improve
the packing ratio. In order to efficiently deal with large problem instances
with hundreds of patches, we train deep neural policies to predict nearly
rectangular patch subsets and determine their relative poses, leading to linear
time scaling with the number of patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method on three datasets for UV packing, where our method achieves a higher
packing ratio over several widely used baselines with competitive computational
speed.

geometry detail recovery and anti-aliased novel view rendering. Drawing
inspiration from voxel-based representations with the level of detail (LoD), we
introduce a multi-scale tri-plane-based scene representation that is capable of
capturing the LoD of the signed distance function (SDF) and the space radiance.
Our representation aggregates space features from a multi-convolved

<p class="mathjax">Privacy is important when dealing with sensitive personal information in
machine learning models, which require large data sets for training. In the
energy field, access to household prosumer energy data is crucial for energy
predictions to support energy grid management and large-scale adoption of
renewables however citizens are often hesitant to grant access to cloud-based
machine learning models. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution to
privacy challenges however report issues in generating the global prediction
model due to data heterogeneity, variations in generation patterns, and the
high number of parameters leading to even lower prediction accuracy. This paper
addresses these challenges by introducing FedWOA a novel federated learning
model that employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm to aggregate global
prediction models from the weights of local LTSM neural network models trained
on prosumer energy data. The proposed solution identifies the optimal vector of
weights in the search spaces of the local models to construct the global shared
model and then is subsequently transmitted to the local nodes to improve the
prediction quality at the prosumer site while for handling non-IID data K-Means
was used for clustering prosumers with similar scale of energy data. The
evaluation results on prosumers energy data have shown that FedWOA can
effectively enhance the accuracy of energy prediction models accuracy by 25%
for MSE and 16% for MAE compared to FedAVG while demonstrating good convergence
and reduced loss.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of performing logistic regression on data
collected from privacy-sensitive sellers. Since the data is private, sellers
must be incentivized through payments to provide their data. Thus, the goal is
to design a mechanism that optimizes a weighted combination of test loss,
seller privacy, and payment, i.e., strikes a balance between multiple
objectives of interest. We solve the problem by combining ideas from game
theory, statistical learning theory, and differential privacy. The buyer's
objective function can be highly non-convex. However, we show that, under
certain conditions on the problem parameters, the problem can be convexified by
using a change of variables. We also provide asymptotic results characterizing
the buyer's test error and payments when the number of sellers becomes large.
Finally, we demonstrate our ideas by applying them to a real healthcare data
set.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of rate
splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multi-antenna transmission
networks through the joint optimization of rate allocation and beamforming.
Unlike conventional methods like weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and
standard fractional programming (FP), which tackle the non-convex WSR problem
iteratively using disciplined convex subproblems and optimization toolboxes,
our work pioneers a novel toolbox-free approach. For the first time, we
identify the optimal beamforming structure and common rate allocation for WSR
maximization in RSMA by leveraging FP and Lagrangian duality. Then we propose
an algorithm based on FP and fixed point iteration to optimize the beamforming
and common rate allocation without the need for optimization toolboxes. Our
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm attains the same
performance as standard FP and classical WMMSE methods while significantly
reducing computational time.

<p class="mathjax">The Internet Engineering Task Force is standardizing new DNS resource
records, namely SVCB and HTTPS. Both records inform clients about endpoint and
service properties such as supported application layer protocols, IP address
hints or Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) information. Therefore, they allow
clients to reduce required DNS queries and potential retries during connection
establishment and thus help to improve the quality of experience and privacy of
the client. The latter is achieved by reducing visible meta-data, which is
further improved with encrypted DNS and ECH.
<br />The standardization is in its final stages and companies announced support,
e.g., Cloudflare and Apple. Therefore, we provide the first large-scale
overview of actual record deployment by analyzing more than 400 M domains. We
find 3.96 k SVCB and 10.5 M HTTPS records. As of March 2023, Cloudflare hosts
and serves most domains, and most records only contain Application-Layer
Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and IP address hints. Besides Cloudflare, we see
adoption by a variety of authoritative name servers and hosting providers
indicating increased adoption in the near future. Lastly, we can verify the
correctness of records for more than 93 % of domains based on three application

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent agents such as robots are increasingly deployed in real-world,
safety-critical settings. It is vital that these agents are able to explain the
reasoning behind their decisions to human counterparts, however, their behavior
is often produced by uninterpretable models such as deep neural networks. We
propose an approach to generate natural language explanations for an agent's
behavior based only on observations of states and actions, agnostic to the
underlying model representation. We show how a compact representation of the
agent's behavior can be learned and used to produce plausible explanations with
minimal hallucination while affording user interaction with a pre-trained large
language model. Through user studies and empirical experiments, we show that
our approach generates explanations as helpful as those generated by a human
domain expert while enabling beneficial interactions such as clarification and
counterfactual queries.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial purification using generative models demonstrates strong
adversarial defense performance. These methods are classifier and
attack-agnostic, making them versatile but often computationally intensive.
Recent strides in diffusion and score networks have improved image generation
and, by extension, adversarial purification. Another highly efficient class of
adversarial defense methods known as adversarial training requires specific
knowledge of attack vectors, forcing them to be trained extensively on
adversarial examples. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new
framework, namely Language Guided Adversarial Purification (LGAP), utilizing
pre-trained diffusion models and caption generators to defend against
adversarial attacks. Given an input image, our method first generates a
caption, which is then used to guide the adversarial purification process
through a diffusion network. Our approach has been evaluated against strong
adversarial attacks, proving its effectiveness in enhancing adversarial
robustness. Our results indicate that LGAP outperforms most existing
adversarial defense techniques without requiring specialized network training.
This underscores the generalizability of models trained on large datasets,
highlighting a promising direction for further research.

<p class="mathjax">Sorting is fundamental and ubiquitous in modern computing systems. Hardware
sorting systems are built based on comparison operations with Von Neumann
architecture, but their performance are limited by the bandwidth between memory
and comparison units and the performance of complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based circuitry. Sort-in-memory (SIM) based on
emerging memristors is desired but not yet available due to comparison
operations that are challenging to be implemented within memristive memory.
Here we report fast and reconfigurable SIM system enabled by digit read (DR) on
1-transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) memristor arrays. We develop DR tree node
skipping (TNS) that support variable data quantity and data types, and extend
TNS with multi-bank, bit-slice and multi-level strategies to enable cross-array
TNS (CA-TNS) for practical adoptions. Experimented on benchmark sorting
datasets, our memristor-enabled SIM system presents up to 3.32x~7.70x speedup,
6.23x~183.5x energy efficiency improvement and 2.23x~7.43x area reduction
compared with state-of-the-art sorting systems. We apply such SIM system for
shortest path search with Dijkstra's algorithm and neural network inference
with in-situ pruning, demonstrating the capability in solving practical sorting
tasks and the compatibility in integrating with other compute-in-memory (CIM)
schemes. The comparison-free TNS/CA-TNS SIM enabled by memristors pushes
sorting into a new paradigm of sort-in-memory for next-generation sorting
systems.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality requirements minimize the risk of propagating defects to later
stages of the software development life cycle. Achieving a sufficient level of
quality is a major goal of requirements engineering. This requires a clear
definition and understanding of requirements quality. Though recent
publications make an effort at disentangling the complex concept of quality,
the requirements quality research community lacks identity and clear structure
which guides advances and puts new findings into an holistic perspective. In
this research commentary we contribute (1) a harmonized requirements quality
theory organizing its core concepts, (2) an evaluation of the current state of
requirements quality research, and (3) a research roadmap to guide advancements
in the field. We show that requirements quality research focuses on normative
rules and mostly fails to connect requirements quality to its impact on
subsequent software development activities, impeding the relevance of the
research. Adherence to the proposed requirements quality theory and following
the outlined roadmap will be a step towards amending this gap.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks have shown
significant promise in the domain of road scene parsing. Nevertheless, the
existing works focus primarily on freespace detection, with little attention
given to hazardous road defects that could compromise both driving safety and
comfort. In this paper, we introduce RoadFormer, a novel Transformer-based
data-fusion network developed for road scene parsing. RoadFormer utilizes a
duplex encoder architecture to extract heterogeneous features from both RGB
images and surface normal information. The encoded features are subsequently
fed into a novel heterogeneous feature synergy block for effective feature
fusion and recalibration. The pixel decoder then learns multi-scale long-range
dependencies from the fused and recalibrated heterogeneous features, which are
subsequently processed by a Transformer decoder to produce the final semantic
prediction. Additionally, we release SYN-UDTIRI, the first large-scale road
scene parsing dataset that contains over 10,407 RGB images, dense depth images,
and the corresponding pixel-level annotations for both freespace and road
defects of different shapes and sizes. Extensive experimental evaluations
conducted on our SYN-UDTIRI dataset, as well as on three public datasets,
including KITTI road, CityScapes, and ORFD, demonstrate that RoadFormer
outperforms all other state-of-the-art networks for road scene parsing.
Specifically, RoadFormer ranks first on the KITTI road benchmark. Our source
code, created dataset, and demo video are publicly available at
mias.group/RoadFormer.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems usually leverage multi-task learning methods to
simultaneously optimize several objectives because of the multi-faceted user
behavior data. The typical way of conducting multi-task learning is to
establish appropriate parameter sharing across multiple tasks at lower layers
while reserving a separate task tower for each task at upper layers. Since the
task towers exert direct impact on the prediction results, we argue that the
architecture of standalone task towers is sub-optimal for promoting positive
knowledge sharing. Accordingly, we propose the framework of Deep Mutual
Learning across task towers, which is compatible with various backbone
multi-task networks. Extensive offline experiments and online AB tests are
conducted to evaluate and verify the proposed approach's effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupported and unfalsifiable claims we encounter in our daily lives can
influence our view of the world. Characterizing, summarizing, and -- more
generally -- making sense of such claims, however, can be challenging. In this
work, we focus on fine-grained debate topics and formulate a new task of
distilling, from such claims, a countable set of narratives. We present a
crowdsourced dataset of 12 controversial topics, comprising more than 120k
arguments, claims, and comments from heterogeneous sources, each annotated with
a narrative label. We further investigate how large language models (LLMs) can
be used to synthesise claims using In-Context Learning. We find that generated
claims with supported evidence can be used to improve the performance of
narrative classification models and, additionally, that the same model can
infer the stance and aspect using a few training examples. Such a model can be
useful in applications which rely on narratives , e.g. fact-checking.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple pedestrian tracking faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in
the presence of occlusion. Existing methods suffer from inaccurate motion
estimation, appearance feature extraction, and association due to occlusion,
leading to inadequate Identification F1-Score (IDF1), excessive ID switches
(IDSw), and insufficient association accuracy and recall (AssA and AssR). We
found that the main reason is abnormal detections caused by partial occlusion.
In this paper, we suggest that the key insight is explicit motion estimation,
reliable appearance features, and fair association in occlusion scenes.
Specifically, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian
tracker, OccluTrack. We first introduce an abnormal motion suppression
mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier
motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we propose a pose-guided re-ID
module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded
pedestrians. Last, we design a new occlusion-aware association method towards
fair IoU and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded
pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our OccluTrack
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOT-Challenge datasets. Particularly,
the improvements on IDF1, IDSw, AssA, and AssR demonstrate the effectiveness of
our OccluTrack on tracking and association performance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper examines the robustness of a multi-modal computer vision model,
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), in the context of unsupervised
learning. The main objective is twofold: first, to evaluate the robustness of
CLIP, and second, to explore strategies for augmenting its robustness. To
achieve this, we introduce a novel approach named LP-CLIP. This technique
involves the distillation of CLIP features through the incorporation of a
linear probing layer positioned atop its encoding structure. This newly added
layer is trained utilizing pseudo-labels produced by CLIP, coupled with a
self-training strategy. The LP-CLIP technique offers a promising approach to
enhance the robustness of CLIP without the need for annotations. By leveraging
a simple linear probing layer, we aim to improve the model's ability to
withstand various uncertainties and challenges commonly encountered in
real-world scenarios. Importantly, our approach does not rely on annotated
data, which makes it particularly valuable in situations where labeled data
might be scarce or costly to obtain. Our proposed approach increases the
robustness of CLIP with SOTA results compared to supervised technique on
various datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) enables edge nodes to collaboratively contribute to
constructing a global model without sharing their data. This is accomplished by
devices computing local, private model updates that are then aggregated by a
server. However, computational resource constraints and network communication
can become a severe bottleneck for larger model sizes typical for deep learning
applications. Edge nodes tend to have limited hardware resources (RAM, CPU),
and the network bandwidth and reliability at the edge is a concern for scaling
federated fleet applications. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a FL
strategy inspired by transfer learning in order to reduce resource utilization
on devices, as well as the load on the server and network in each global
training round. For each local model update, we randomly select layers to
train, freezing the remaining part of the model. In doing so, we can reduce
both server load and communication costs per round by excluding all untrained
layer weights from being transferred to the server. The goal of this study is
to empirically explore the potential trade-off between resource utilization on
devices and global model convergence under the proposed strategy. We implement
the approach using the federated learning framework FEDn. A number of
experiments were carried out over different datasets (CIFAR-10, CASA, and
IMDB), performing different tasks using different deep-learning model
architectures. Our results show that training the model partially can
accelerate the training process, efficiently utilizes resources on-device, and
reduce the data transmission by around 75% and 53% when we train 25%, and 50%
of the model layers, respectively, without harming the resulting global model
accuracy.

which the method can take $2^{\Omega(n)}$ steps to converge, demonstrating that

is easy to solve. As this is in contrast to the empirical performance of the
algorithm, we also analyze the running time in the framework of smoothed
analysis. In particular, given an instance of $n$ points in $d$ dimensions, we
prove that the expected number of iterations needed for Hartigan's method to

enabling truly safe but efficient human-robot interactions. Current
uncertainty-aware methods in 3D human pose estimation are limited to predicting
the uncertainty of the body posture, while effectively neglecting the body
shape and root pose. In this work, we present GloPro, which to the best of our
knowledge the first framework to predict an uncertainty distribution of a 3D
body mesh including its shape, pose, and root pose, by efficiently fusing
visual clues with a learned motion model. We demonstrate that it vastly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of human trajectory accuracy in a
world coordinate system (even in the presence of severe occlusions), yields
consistent uncertainty distributions, and can run in real-time. Our code will

shallow neural networks characterized by one hidden layer, a ramp activation
function, an ${\mathcal L}^2$ Schatten class (or Hilbert-Schmidt) cost
function, input space ${\mathbb R}^M$, output space ${\mathbb R}^Q$ with $Q\leq
M$, and training input sample size $N&gt;QM$. We prove an upper bound on the
minimum of the cost function of order $O(\delta_P$ where $\delta_P$ measures
the signal to noise ratio of training inputs. We obtain an approximate
optimizer using projections adapted to the averages $\overline{x_{0,j}}$ of
training input vectors belonging to the same output vector $y_j$,
$j=1,\dots,Q$. In the special case $M=Q$, we explicitly determine an exact
degenerate local minimum of the cost function; the sharp value differs from the
upper bound obtained for $Q\leq M$ by a relative error $O(\delta_P^2)$. The
proof of the upper bound yields a constructively trained network; we show that
it metrizes the $Q$-dimensional subspace in the input space ${\mathbb R}^M$
spanned by $\overline{x_{0,j}}$, $j=1,\dots,Q$. We comment on the
characterization of the global minimum of the cost function in the given

<p class="mathjax">A moderately detailed consideration of interactive LLMs as cognitive systems
is given, focusing on LLMs circa mid-2023 such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Llama,
etc.. Cognitive strengths of these systems are reviewed, and then careful
attention is paid to the substantial differences between the sort of cognitive
system these LLMs are, and the sort of cognitive systems human beings are. It
is found that many of the practical weaknesses of these AI systems can be tied
specifically to lacks in the basic cognitive architectures according to which
these systems are built. It is argued that incremental improvement of such LLMs
is not a viable approach to working toward human-level AGI, in practical terms
given realizable amounts of compute resources. This does not imply there is
nothing to learn about human-level AGI from studying and experimenting with
LLMs, nor that LLMs cannot form significant parts of human-level AGI
architectures that also incorporate other ideas. Social and ethical matters
regarding LLMs are very briefly touched from this perspective, which implies
that while care should be taken regarding misinformation and other issues, and
economic upheavals will need their own social remedies based on their
unpredictable course as with any powerfully impactful technology, overall the
sort of policy needed as regards modern LLMs is quite different than would be
the case if a more credible approximation to human-level AGI were at hand.

real-world scenarios occasionally involve human mistakes, which can cause
intelligent agents to fail. While most prior research assumes perfect answers
from human interlocutors, we focus on a setting where the agent points out
unintentional mistakes for the interlocutor to review, better reflecting
real-world situations. In this paper, we show that human answer mistakes depend
on question type and QA turn in the visual dialogue by analyzing a previously
unused data collection of human mistakes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
those factors for the model's accuracy in a pointing-human-mistake task through
experiments using a simple MLP model and a Visual Language Model.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular in Graph Representation
Learning (GRL). One fundamental application is few-shot node classification.
Most existing methods follow the meta learning paradigm, showing the ability of
fast generalization to few-shot tasks. However, recent works indicate that
graph contrastive learning combined with fine-tuning can significantly
outperform meta learning methods. Despite the empirical success, there is
limited understanding of the reasons behind it. In our study, we first identify
two crucial advantages of contrastive learning compared to meta learning,
including (1) the comprehensive utilization of graph nodes and (2) the power of
graph augmentations. To integrate the strength of both contrastive learning and
meta learning on the few-shot node classification tasks, we introduce a new
paradigm: Contrastive Few-Shot Node Classification (COLA). Specifically, COLA
employs graph augmentations to identify semantically similar nodes, which
enables the construction of meta-tasks without the need for label information.
Therefore, COLA can utilize all nodes to construct meta-tasks, further reducing
the risk of overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
essentiality of each component in our design and demonstrate that COLA achieves
new state-of-the-art on all tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-channel speech enhancement seeks to utilize spatial information to
distinguish target speech from interfering signals. While deep learning
approaches like the dual-path convolutional recurrent network (DPCRN) have made
strides, challenges persist in effectively modeling inter-channel correlations
and amalgamating multi-level information. In response, we introduce the
Parallel Dual-Path Convolutional Recurrent Network (PDPCRN). This acoustic
modeling architecture has two key innovations. First, a parallel design with
separate branches extracts complementary features. Second, bi-directional
modules enable cross-branch communication. Together, these facilitate diverse
representation fusion and enhanced modeling. Experimental validation on TIMIT
datasets underscores the prowess of PDPCRN. Notably, against baseline models
like the standard DPCRN, PDPCRN not only outperforms in PESQ and STOI metrics
but also boasts a leaner computational footprint with reduced parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Tactile Internet based operations, e.g., telesurgery, rely on end-to-end
closed loop control for accuracy and corrections. The feedback and control are
subject to network latency and loss. We design two edge intelligence algorithms
hosted at P4 programmable end switches. These algorithms locally compute and
command corrective signals, thereby dispense the feedback signals from
traversing the network to the other ends and save on control loop latency and
network load. We implement these algorithms entirely on data plane on Netronome
Agilio SmartNICs using P4. Our first algorithm, $\textit{pose correction}$, is
placed at the edge switch connected to an industrial robot gripping a tool. The
round trip between transmitting force sensor array readings to the edge switch
and receiving correct tip coordinates at the robot is shown to be less than
$100~\mu s$. The second algorithm, $\textit{tremor suppression}$, is placed at
the edge switch connected to the human operator. It suppresses physiological
tremors of amplitudes smaller than $100~\mu m$ which not only improves the
application's performance but also reduces the network load up to $99.9\%$. Our
solution allows edge intelligence modules to seamlessly switch between the
algorithms based on the tasks being executed at the end hosts.

<p class="mathjax">While recent 3D-aware generative models have shown photo-realistic image
synthesis with multi-view consistency, the synthesized image quality degrades
depending on the camera pose (e.g., a face with a blurry and noisy boundary at
a side viewpoint). Such degradation is mainly caused by the difficulty of
learning both pose consistency and photo-realism simultaneously from a dataset
with heavily imbalanced poses. In this paper, we propose SideGAN, a novel 3D
GAN training method to generate photo-realistic images irrespective of the
camera pose, especially for faces of side-view angles. To ease the challenging
problem of learning photo-realistic and pose-consistent image synthesis, we
split the problem into two subproblems, each of which can be solved more
easily. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a combination of two simple
discrimination problems, one of which learns to discriminate whether a
synthesized image looks real or not, and the other learns to discriminate
whether a synthesized image agrees with the camera pose. Based on this, we
propose a dual-branched discriminator with two discrimination branches. We also
propose a pose-matching loss to learn the pose consistency of 3D GANs. In
addition, we present a pose sampling strategy to increase learning
opportunities for steep angles in a pose-imbalanced dataset. With extensive
validation, we demonstrate that our approach enables 3D GANs to generate
high-quality geometries and photo-realistic images irrespective of the camera
pose.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-channel speech enhancement utilizes spatial information from multiple
microphones to extract the target speech. However, most existing methods do not
explicitly model spatial cues, instead relying on implicit learning from
multi-channel spectra. To better leverage spatial information, we propose
explicitly incorporating spatial modeling by applying spherical harmonic
transforms (SHT) to the multi-channel input. In detail, a hierarchical
framework is introduced whereby lower order harmonics capturing broader spatial
patterns are estimated first, then combined with higher orders to recursively
predict finer spatial details. Experiments on TIMIT demonstrate the proposed
method can effectively recover target spatial patterns and achieve improved
performance over baseline models, using fewer parameters and computations.
Explicitly modeling spatial information hierarchically enables more effective
multi-channel speech enhancement.

<p class="mathjax">Embedded, smart, and IoT devices are increasingly popular in numerous
everyday settings. Since lower-end devices have the most strict cost
constraints, they tend to have few, if any, security features. This makes them
attractive targets for exploits and malware. Prior research proposed various
security architectures for enforcing security properties for
resource-constrained devices, e.g., via Remote Attestation (RA). Such
techniques can (statically) verify software integrity of a remote device and
detect compromise. However, run-time (dynamic) security, e.g., via Control-Flow
Integrity (CFI), is hard to achieve. This work constructs an architecture that
ensures integrity of software execution against run-time attacks, such as
Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). It is built atop a recently proposed CASU --
a low-cost active Root-of-Trust (RoT) that guarantees software immutability. We
extend CASU to support a shadow stack and a CFI monitor to mitigate run-time
attacks. This gives some confidence that CFI can indeed be attained even on
low-end devices, with minimal hardware overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Clinical decision support systems are software tools that help clinicians to
make medical decisions. However, their acceptance by clinicians is usually
rather low. A known problem is that they often require clinicians to manually
enter lots of patient data, which is long and tedious. Existing solutions, such
as the automatic data extraction from electronic health record, are not fully
satisfying, because of low data quality and availability. In practice, many
systems still include long questionnaire for data entry.
<br />In this paper, we propose an original solution to simplify patient data
entry, using an adaptive questionnaire, i.e. a questionnaire that evolves
during user interaction, showing or hiding questions dynamically. Considering a
rule-based decision support systems, we designed methods for translating the
system's clinical rules into display rules that determine the items to show in
the questionnaire, and methods for determining the optimal order of priority
among the items in the questionnaire. We applied this approach to a decision
support system implementing STOPP/START v2, a guideline for managing
polypharmacy. We show that it permits reducing by about two thirds the number
of clinical conditions displayed in the questionnaire. Presented to clinicians
during focus group sessions, the adaptive questionnaire was found "pretty easy
to use". In the future, this approach could be applied to other guidelines, and
adapted for data entry by patients.

uses weak causal signals in the scene to model how the presence of a feature in
one part of the image affects the appearance of another feature in a different
part of the image. Our method consists of two components: a convolutional
neural network backbone and a causality-factors extractor module. The latter
computes weights for the feature maps to enhance each feature map according to
its causal influence in the image's scene. We can modify the functioning of the
causality module by using two external signals, thus obtaining different
variants of our method. We evaluate our method on a public dataset of prostate
MRI images for prostate cancer diagnosis, using quantitative experiments,
qualitative assessment, and ablation studies. Our results show that our method
improves classification performance and produces more robust predictions,
focusing on relevant parts of the image. That is especially important in
medical imaging, where accurate and reliable classifications are essential for
effective diagnosis and treatment planning.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training for
efficient adaptation of large language models~(LLMs) to extremely long context
windows. PoSE decouples train length from target context window size by
simulating long inputs using a fixed context window with manipulated position
indices during training. Concretely, we select several short chunks from a long
input sequence, and introduce distinct skipping bias terms to modify the
position indices of each chunk. These bias terms, along with the length of each
chunk, are altered for each training example, allowing the model to adapt to
all positions within the target context window without training on full length
inputs. Experiments show that, compared with fine-tuning on the full length,
PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead with minimal impact on
performance. Leveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMA
model to 128k tokens. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that PoSE is
compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and various position interpolation
strategies. Notably, by decoupling fine-tuning length from target context
window, PoSE can theoretically extend the context window infinitely,
constrained only by memory usage for inference. With ongoing advancements for
efficient inference, we believe PoSE holds great promise for scaling the
context window even further.

<p class="mathjax">The universal approximation property of width-bounded networks has been
studied as a dual of the classical universal approximation theorem for
depth-bounded ones. There were several attempts to characterize the minimum
width $w_{\min}$ enabling the universal approximation property; however, only a
few of them found the exact values. In this work, we show that the minimum
width for the universal approximation of $L^p$ functions from $[0,1]^{d_x}$ to
$\mathbb R^{d_y}$ is exactly $\max\{d_x,d_y,2\}$ if an activation function is
ReLU-Like (e.g., ReLU, GELU, Softplus). Compared to the known result
$w_{\min}=\max\{d_x+1,d_y\}$ when the domain is ${\mathbb R^{d_x}}$, our result
first shows that approximation on a compact domain requires smaller width than
on ${\mathbb R^{d_x}}$. We next prove a lower bound on $w_{\min}$ for uniform
approximation using general activation functions including ReLU: $w_{\min}\ge
d_y+1$ if $d_x&lt;d_y\le2d_x$. Together with our first result, this shows a
dichotomy between $L^p$ and uniform approximations for general activation
functions and input/output dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">Exploring and comprehending the culinary heritage of a nation holds a
captivating allure. It offers insights into the structure and qualities of its
cuisine. The endeavor becomes more accessible with the availability of a
well-organized dataset. In this paper, we present the introduction of INDoRI
(Indian Dataset of Recipes and Ingredients), a compilation drawn from seven
distinct online platforms, representing 18 regions within the Indian
subcontinent. This comprehensive geographical span ensures a portrayal of the
rich variety within culinary practices. Furthermore, we introduce a unique
collection of stop words, referred to as ISW (Ingredient Stop Words), manually
tuned for the culinary domain. We assess the validity of ISW in the context of
global cuisines beyond Indian culinary tradition. Subsequently, an ingredient
network (InN) is constructed, highlighting interconnections among ingredients
sourced from different recipes. We delve into both the defining attributes of
INDoRI and the communal dimensions of InN. Additionally, we outline the
potential applications that can be developed leveraging this dataset.
Addressing one of the applications, we demonstrated a research problem on InN
with a simple weighted community detection algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a
comparative analysis of the results obtained with this algorithm against those
generated by two baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Data clustering, the task of grouping observations according to their
similarity, is a key component of unsupervised learning -- with real world
applications in diverse fields such as biology, medicine, and social science.
Often in these fields the data comes with complex interdependencies between the
dimensions of analysis, for instance the various characteristics and opinions
people can have live on a complex social network. Current clustering methods
are ill-suited to tackle this complexity: deep learning can approximate these
dependencies, but not take their explicit map as the input of the analysis. In
this paper, we aim at fixing this blind spot in the unsupervised learning
literature. We can create network-aware embeddings by estimating the network
distance between numeric node attributes via the generalized Euclidean
distance. Differently from all methods in the literature that we know of, we do
not cluster the nodes of the network, but rather its node attributes. In our
experiments we show that having these network embeddings is always beneficial
for the learning task; that our method scales to large networks; and that we
can actually provide actionable insights in applications in a variety of fields
such as marketing, economics, and political science. Our method is fully open
source and data and code are available to reproduce all results in the paper.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating tactile perception could potentially leverage the learning
capabilities of robotic systems in manipulation tasks. However, the reality gap
of simulators for high-resolution tactile sensors remains large. Models trained
on simulated data often fail in zero-shot inference and require fine-tuning
with real data. In addition, work on high-resolution sensors commonly focus on
ones with flat surfaces while 3D round sensors are essential for dexterous
manipulation. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) termed SightGAN. SightGAN relies on the early CycleGAN while
including two additional loss components aimed to accurately reconstruct
background and contact patterns including small contact traces. The proposed
SightGAN learns real-to-sim and sim-to-real processes over difference images.
It is shown to generate real-like synthetic images while maintaining accurate
contact positioning. The generated images can be used to train zero-shot models
for newly fabricated sensors. Consequently, the resulted sim-to-real generator
could be built on top of the tactile simulator to provide a real-world
framework. Potentially, the framework can be used to train, for instance,
reinforcement learning policies of manipulation tasks. The proposed model is
verified in extensive experiments with test data collected from real sensors
and also shown to maintain embedded force information within the tactile
images.

<p class="mathjax">Grounding dialogue response generation on external knowledge is proposed to
produce informative and engaging responses. However, current knowledge-grounded
dialogue (KGD) systems often fail to align the generated responses with
human-preferred qualities due to several issues like hallucination and the lack
of coherence. Upon analyzing multiple language model generations, we observe
the presence of alternative generated responses within a single decoding
process. These alternative responses are more faithful and exhibit a comparable
or higher level of relevance to prior conversational turns compared to the
optimal responses prioritized by the decoding processes. To address these
challenges and driven by these observations, we propose Polished \&amp; Informed
Candidate Scoring (PICK), a generation re-scoring framework that empowers
models to generate faithful and relevant responses without requiring additional
labeled data or model tuning. Through comprehensive automatic and human
evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PICK in generating responses
that are more faithful while keeping them relevant to the dialogue history.
Furthermore, PICK consistently improves the system's performance with both
oracle and retrieved knowledge in all decoding strategies. We provide the
detailed implementation in https://github.com/bryanwilie/pick .

hypergraph stochastic block model in the sparse regime where the maximum
expected hyperdegree is as small as $\Omega(\log n)$ with $n$ denoting the
number of nodes. We show that the basic spectral clustering without
preprocessing or postprocessing is strongly consistent in an even wider range
of the model parameters, in contrast to previous studies that either trim
high-degree nodes or perform local refinement. At the heart of our analysis is
the entry-wise eigenvector perturbation bound derived by the leave-one-out
technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first entry-wise error
bound for degree-corrected hypergraph models, resulting in the strong
consistency for clustering non-uniform hypergraphs with heterogeneous
hyperdegrees.

networks (GNNs) to predict the dynamics of a rolling element bearing. This
approach offers generalizability and interpretability, having the potential for
scalable use in real-time operational digital twin systems for monitoring the
health state of rotating machines. By representing the bearing's components as
nodes in a graph, the GNN can effectively model the complex relationships and
interactions among them. We utilize a dynamic spring-mass-damper model of a
bearing to generate the training data for the GNN. In this model, discrete
masses represent bearing components such as rolling elements, inner raceways,
and outer raceways, while a Hertzian contact model is employed to calculate the
forces between these components.
<br />We evaluate the learning and generalization capabilities of the proposed GNN
framework by testing different bearing configurations that deviate from the
training configurations. Through this approach, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the GNN-based method in accurately predicting the dynamics of
rolling element bearings, highlighting its potential for real-time health
monitoring of rotating machinery.

compare the learners' interaction and perception of the AI and human TAs, we
conducted a between-subject study with 20 novice programming learners. Learners
solve programming tasks by producing subgoals and subsolutions with the

detector, a weakly supervised image classifier with CAM-based localization, and
a minimally supervised anomaly detector. The classifier excels in binary

precise localization. The anomaly detector requires more data for viable

That lifting a monoidal structure corresponds to giving some lax natural
transformation making $Q$ almost monoidal, might be part of folklore in
category theory.We rely on and generalize the tools supporting this
correspondence so to provide exact conditions for lifting symmetric monoidal
closed and star-autonomous structures.A corollary of these characterizations is
that, if $Q$ factors as a monoidal functor through $SLatt$, the category of
complete lattices and sup-preserving functions, then $\int Q$ is always
symmetric monoidalclosed. In this case, we also provide a method, based on the
double negation nucleus from quantale theory, to turn $\int Q$ into a
star-autonomous category.The theory developed, originally motivated from the
categories $P-Set$ of Schalk and de Paiva, yields a wide generalization of
Hyland and Schalk construction of star-autonomous categories by means of

and no consensus has been reached so far. Often simply seen as an inevitable
result of the use of social networks, polarization nevertheless remains a
complex social phenomenon that must be placed in a wider context. To contribute
to a better understanding of polarization, we approach it as an evolving
process, drawing on a dual expertise in political and data sciences. We compare
the polarization process between one mature debate (COVID-19 vaccine) and one
emerging debate (Ukraine conflict) at the time of data collection. Both debates
are studied on Twitter users, a highly politicized population, and on the
French population to provide key elements beyond the traditional US context.
This unprecedented analysis confirms that polarization varies over time,
through a succession of specific periods, whose existence and duration depend
on the maturity of the debate. Importantly, we highlight that polarization is
paced by context-related events. Bearing this in mind, we pave the way for a
new generation of personalized depolarization strategies, adapted to the
context and maturity of debates.

<p class="mathjax">The Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services of the European
Parliament has prepared a report to the Members of the European Parliament
where they enumerate seven main risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
medicine and healthcare: patient harm due to AI errors, misuse of medical AI
tools, bias in AI and the perpetuation of existing inequities, lack of
transparency, privacy and security issues, gaps in accountability, and
obstacles in implementation.
<br />In this study, we propose fourteen functional requirements that AI systems
may implement to reduce the risks associated with their medical purpose: AI
passport, User management, Regulation check, Academic use only disclaimer, data

<p class="mathjax">Microgrids and, in general, active distribution networks require
ultra-short-term prediction, i.e., for sub-second time scales, for specific
control decisions. Conventional forecasting methodologies are not effective at
such time scales. To address this issue, we propose a non-parametric method for
computing ultra short-term prediction intervals (PIs) of the power prosumption
of generic electrical-distribution networks. The method groups historical
observations into clusters according to the values of influential variables. It
is applied either to the original or to the differentiated power-prosumption
time series. The clusters are considered statistically representative pools of
future realizations of power prosumption (or its derivative). They are used to
determine empirical PDFs and, by extracting the quantiles, to deliver PIs for
respective arbitrary confidence levels. The models are validated a posteriori
by carrying out a performance analysis that uses experimentally observed
power-prosumption for different building types, thus allowing the
identification of the dominant model.

<p class="mathjax">Learning object affordances is an effective tool in the field of robot
learning. While the data-driven models delve into the exploration of
affordances of single or paired objects, there is a notable gap in the
investigation of affordances of compound objects that are composed of an
arbitrary number of objects with complex shapes. In this study, we propose
Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network (MOGAN) that models compound object
affordances and predicts the effect of placing new objects on top of the
existing compound. Given different tasks, such as building towers of specific
heights or properties, we used a search based planning to find the sequence of
stack actions with the objects of suitable affordances. We showed that our
system was able to correctly model the affordances of very complex compound
objects that include stacked spheres and cups, poles, and rings that enclose
the poles. We demonstrated the applicability of our system in both simulated
and real-world environments, comparing our systems with a baseline model to
highlight its advantages.

biased predictions owing to the severe imbalance in the distribution of the
relationship labels in the dataset. Thus, this study proposes a method to
generate scene graphs using optimal transport as a measure for comparing two
probability distributions. We apply learning with the optimal transport loss,
which reflects the similarity between the labels in terms of transportation
cost, for predicate classification in SGG. In the proposed approach, the
transportation cost of the optimal transport is defined using the similarity of
words obtained from the pre-trained model. The experimental evaluation of the
effectiveness demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing

<p class="mathjax">Robust 3D perception under corruption has become an essential task for the
realm of 3D vision. While current data augmentation techniques usually perform
random transformations on all point cloud objects in an offline way and ignore
the structure of the samples, resulting in over-or-under enhancement. In this
work, we propose an alternative to make sample-adaptive transformations based
on the structure of the sample to cope with potential corruption via an
auto-augmentation framework, named as AdaptPoint. Specially, we leverage a
imitator, consisting of a Deformation Controller and a Mask Controller,
respectively in charge of predicting deformation parameters and producing a
per-point mask, based on the intrinsic structural information of the input
point cloud, and then conduct corruption simulations on top. Then a
discriminator is utilized to prevent the generation of excessive corruption
that deviates from the original data distribution. In addition, a
perception-guidance feedback mechanism is incorporated to guide the generation
of samples with appropriate difficulty level. Furthermore, to address the
paucity of real-world corrupted point cloud, we also introduce a new dataset
ScanObjectNN-C, that exhibits greater similarity to actual data in real-world
environments, especially when contrasted with preceding CAD datasets.
Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple
corruption benchmarks, including ModelNet-C, our ScanObjectNN-C, and
ShapeNet-C.

<p class="mathjax">The supersingular Endomorphism Ring problem is the following: given a
supersingular elliptic curve, compute all of its endomorphisms. The presumed
hardness of this problem is foundational for isogeny-based cryptography. The
One Endomorphism problem only asks to find a single non-scalar endomorphism. We
prove that these two problems are equivalent, under probabilistic polynomial
time reductions. We prove a number of consequences. First, assuming the
hardness of the endomorphism ring problem, the Charles--Goren--Lauter hash
function is collision resistant, and the SQIsign identification protocol is
sound. Second, the endomorphism ring problem is equivalent to the problem of
computing arbitrary isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves, a result
previously known only for isogenies of smooth degree. Third, there exists an
unconditional probabilistic algorithm to solve the endomorphism ring problem in
time O~(sqrt(p)), a result that previously required to assume the generalized
Riemann hypothesis. To prove our main result, we introduce a flexible framework
for the study of isogeny graphs with additional information. We prove a general

writers may struggle to empathize with readers, get feedback in time, or gain
access to the target group. We propose a concept that generates on-demand

explore this concept with a prototype (using GPT-3.5) in two user studies (N=5

getting different perspectives. The feedback was seen as helpful and inspired
revisions of text and personas, although it was often verbose and unspecific.
We discuss the impact of on-demand feedback, the limited representativity of
contemporary AI systems, and further ideas for defining AI personas. This work
contributes to the vision of supporting writers with AI by expanding the

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems are essential for online applications, and sequential
recommendation has enjoyed significant prevalence due to its expressive ability
to capture dynamic user interests. However, previous sequential modeling
methods still have limitations in capturing contextual information. The primary
reason for this issue is that language models often lack an understanding of
domain-specific knowledge and item-related textual content. To address this
issue, we adopt a new sequential recommendation paradigm and propose LANCER,
which leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained language
models to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach bridges the gap
between language models and recommender systems, resulting in more human-like
recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing promising results and
providing valuable insights into the influence of our model on sequential
recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our experimental codes are publicly

<p class="mathjax">Keypoint detection and description play a pivotal role in various robotics
and autonomous applications including visual odometry (VO), visual navigation,
and Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While a myriad of keypoint
detectors and descriptors have been extensively studied in conventional camera
images, the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of LiDAR-generated
images, i.e. reflectivity and ranges images, has not been assessed. These
images have gained attention due to their resilience in adverse conditions such
as rain or fog. Additionally, they contain significant textural information
that supplements the geometric information provided by LiDAR point clouds in
the point cloud registration phase, especially when reliant solely on LiDAR
sensors. This addresses the challenge of drift encountered in LiDAR Odometry
(LO) within geometrically identical scenarios or where not all the raw point
cloud is informative and may even be misleading. This paper aims to analyze the
applicability of conventional image key point extractors and descriptors on
LiDAR-generated images via a comprehensive quantitative investigation.
Moreover, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and reliability
of LO. After extracting key points, we proceed to downsample the point cloud,
subsequently integrating it into the point cloud registration phase for the
purpose of odometry estimation. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed
approach has comparable accuracy but reduced computational overhead, higher
odometry publishing rate, and even superior performance in scenarios prone to
drift by using the raw point cloud. This, in turn, lays a foundation for
subsequent investigations into the integration of LiDAR-generated images with
LO. Our code is available on GitHub:

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models are emerging expressive generative models, in which a large
number of time steps (inference steps) are required for a single image
generation. To accelerate such tedious process, reducing steps uniformly is
considered as an undisputed principle of diffusion models. We consider that
such a uniform assumption is not the optimal solution in practice; i.e., we can
find different optimal time steps for different models. Therefore, we propose
to search the optimal time steps sequence and compressed model architecture in
a unified framework to achieve effective image generation for diffusion models
without any further training. Specifically, we first design a unified search
space that consists of all possible time steps and various architectures. Then,
a two stage evolutionary algorithm is introduced to find the optimal solution
in the designed search space. To further accelerate the search process, we
employ FID score between generated and real samples to estimate the performance
of the sampled examples. As a result, the proposed method is (i).training-free,
obtaining the optimal time steps and model architecture without any training
process; (ii). orthogonal to most advanced diffusion samplers and can be
integrated to gain better sample quality. (iii). generalized, where the
searched time steps and architectures can be directly applied on different
diffusion models with the same guidance scale. Experimental results show that
our method achieves excellent performance by using only a few time steps, e.g.
17.86 FID score on ImageNet 64 $\times$ 64 with only four steps, compared to
138.66 with DDIM.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the unsupervised speech enhancement problem based
on recurrent variational autoencoder (RVAE). This approach offers promising
generalization performance over the supervised counterpart. Nevertheless, the
involved iterative variational expectation-maximization (VEM) process at test
time, which relies on a variational inference method, results in high
computational complexity. To tackle this issue, we present efficient sampling
techniques based on Langevin dynamics and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms,
adapted to the EM-based speech enhancement with RVAE. By directly sampling from
the intractable posterior distribution within the EM process, we circumvent the
intricacies of variational inference. We conduct a series of experiments,
comparing the proposed methods with VEM and a state-of-the-art supervised
speech enhancement approach based on diffusion models. The results reveal that
our sampling-based algorithms significantly outperform VEM, not only in terms
of computational efficiency but also in overall performance. Furthermore, when
compared to the supervised baseline, our methods showcase robust generalization
performance in mismatched test conditions.

<p class="mathjax">A better understanding of automation disengagements can impact the safety and
efficiency of automated systems. This study investigates the factors
contributing to driver- and system-initiated disengagements by analyzing
semi-structured interviews with 103 users of Tesla's Autopilot and FSD Beta.
Through an examination of the data, main categories and sub-categories of
disengagements were identified, which led to the development of a triadic model
of automation disengagements. The model treats automation and human operators
as equivalent agents. It suggests that human operators disengage automation
when they anticipate failure, observe unnatural or unwanted automation behavior
(e.g., erratic steering, running red lights), or believe the automation is not
suited for certain environments (e.g., inclement weather, non-standard roads).
Human operators' negative experiences, such as frustration, feelings of
unsafety, and distrust, are also incorporated into the model, as these emotions
can be triggered by (anticipated) automation behaviors. The automation, in
turn, monitors human operators and may disengage itself if it detects
insufficient vigilance or traffic rule violations. Moreover, human operators
can be influenced by the reactions of passengers and other road users, leading
them to disengage automation if they sense discomfort, anger, or embarrassment
due to the system's actions. This research offers insights into the factors
contributing to automation disengagements, highlighting not only the concerns
of human operators but also the social aspects of the phenomenon. Furthermore,
the findings provide information on potential edge cases of automated vehicle
technology, which may help to enhance the safety and efficiency of such
systems.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, imitation-based driving planners have reported considerable
success. However, due to the absence of a standardized benchmark, the
effectiveness of various designs remains unclear. The newly released nuPlan
addresses this issue by offering a large-scale real-world dataset and a
standardized closed-loop benchmark for equitable comparisons. Utilizing this
platform, we conduct a comprehensive study on two fundamental yet underexplored
aspects of imitation-based planners: the essential features for ego planning
and the effective data augmentation techniques to reduce compounding errors.
Furthermore, we highlight an imitation gap that has been overlooked by current
learning systems. Finally, integrating our findings, we propose a strong
baseline model-PlanTF. Our results demonstrate that a well-designed, purely
imitation-based planner can achieve highly competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods involving hand-crafted rules and exhibit superior
generalization capabilities in long-tail cases. Our models and benchmarks are
publicly available. Project website https://jchengai.github.io/planTF.

<p class="mathjax">Learnersourcing involves students generating and sharing learning resources
with their peers. When learnersourcing multiple-choice questions, creating
explanations for the generated questions is a crucial step as it facilitates a
deeper understanding of the related concepts. However, it is often difficult
for students to craft effective explanations due to limited subject
understanding and a tendency to merely restate the question stem, distractors,
and correct answer. To help scaffold this task, in this work we propose a
self-reinforcement large-language-model framework, with the goal of generating
and evaluating explanations automatically. Comprising three modules, the
framework generates student-aligned explanations, evaluates these explanations
to ensure their quality and iteratively enhances the explanations. If an
explanation's evaluation score falls below a defined threshold, the framework
iteratively refines and reassesses the explanation. Importantly, our framework
emulates the manner in which students compose explanations at the relevant
grade level. For evaluation, we had a human subject-matter expert compare the
explanations generated by students with the explanations created by the
open-source large language model Vicuna-13B, a version of Vicuna-13B that had
been fine-tuned using our method, and by GPT-4. We observed that, when compared
to other large language models, GPT-4 exhibited a higher level of creativity in
generating explanations. We also found that explanations generated by GPT-4
were ranked higher by the human expert than both those created by the other
models and the original student-created explanations. Our findings represent a
significant advancement in enriching the learnersourcing experience for
students and enhancing the capabilities of large language models in educational
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Controllable text generation is a fundamental aspect of natural language
generation, with numerous methods proposed for different constraint types.
However, these approaches often require significant architectural or decoding
modifications, making them challenging to apply to additional constraints or
resolve different constraint combinations. To address this, our paper
introduces Regular Expression Instruction (REI), which utilizes an
instruction-based mechanism to fully exploit regular expressions' advantages to
uniformly model diverse constraints. Specifically, our REI supports all popular
fine-grained controllable generation constraints, i.e., lexical, positional,
and length, as well as their complex combinations, via regular expression-style
instructions. Our method only requires fine-tuning on medium-scale language
models or few-shot, in-context learning on large language models, and requires
no further adjustment when applied to various constraint combinations.
Experiments demonstrate that our straightforward approach yields high success
rates and adaptability to various constraints while maintaining competitiveness
in automatic metrics and outperforming most previous baselines.

<p class="mathjax">When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see
productivity gains, but the AI-generated content may not match their
preferences exactly. To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in
which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI,
facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that
the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead
to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when
the AI is trained on AI-generated content. And any AI bias may become societal
bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to improve human-AI
interactions, enabling personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, conditional score-based diffusion models have gained significant
attention in the field of supervised speech enhancement, yielding
state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods may face challenges when
generalising to unseen conditions. To address this issue, we introduce an
alternative approach that operates in an unsupervised manner, leveraging the
generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, in a training phase, a
clean speech prior distribution is learnt in the short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) domain using score-based diffusion models, allowing it to
unconditionally generate clean speech from Gaussian noise. Then, we develop a
posterior sampling methodology for speech enhancement by combining the learnt
clean speech prior with a noise model for speech signal inference. The noise
parameters are simultaneously learnt along with clean speech estimation through
an iterative expectationmaximisation (EM) approach. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work exploring diffusion-based generative models
for unsupervised speech enhancement, demonstrating promising results compared
to a recent variational auto-encoder (VAE)-based unsupervised approach and a
state-of-the-art diffusion-based supervised method. It thus opens a new
direction for future research in unsupervised speech enhancement.

<p class="mathjax">Speaker diarization has gained considerable attention within speech
processing research community. Mainstream speaker diarization rely primarily on
speakers' voice characteristics extracted from acoustic signals and often
overlook the potential of semantic information. Considering the fact that
speech signals can efficiently convey the content of a speech, it is of our
interest to fully exploit these semantic cues utilizing language models. In
this work we propose a novel approach to effectively leverage semantic
information in clustering-based speaker diarization systems. Firstly, we
introduce spoken language understanding modules to extract speaker-related
semantic information and utilize these information to construct pairwise
constraints. Secondly, we present a novel framework to integrate these
constraints into the speaker diarization pipeline, enhancing the performance of
the entire system. Extensive experiments conducted on the public dataset
demonstrate the consistent superiority of our proposed approach over
acoustic-only speaker diarization systems.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion-based generative models have recently gained attention in speech
enhancement (SE), providing an alternative to conventional supervised methods.
These models transform clean speech training samples into Gaussian noise
centered at noisy speech, and subsequently learn a parameterized model to
reverse this process, conditionally on noisy speech. Unlike supervised methods,
generative-based SE approaches usually rely solely on an unsupervised loss,
which may result in less efficient incorporation of conditioned noisy speech.
To address this issue, we propose augmenting the original diffusion training
objective with a mean squared error (MSE) loss, measuring the discrepancy
between estimated enhanced speech and ground-truth clean speech at each reverse
process iteration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methodology.

<p class="mathjax">3D scene graphs offer a more efficient representation of the environment by
hierarchically organizing diverse semantic entities and the topological
relationships among them. Fiducial markers, on the other hand, offer a valuable
mechanism for encoding comprehensive information pertaining to environments and
the objects within them. In the context of Visual SLAM (VSLAM), especially when
the reconstructed maps are enriched with practical semantic information, these
markers have the potential to enhance the map by augmenting valuable semantic
information and fostering meaningful connections among the semantic objects. In
this regard, this paper exploits the potential of fiducial markers to
incorporate a VSLAM framework with hierarchical representations that generates
optimizable multi-layered vision-based situational graphs. The framework
comprises a conventional VSLAM system with low-level feature tracking and
mapping capabilities bolstered by the incorporation of a fiducial marker map.
The fiducial markers aid in identifying walls and doors in the environment,
subsequently establishing meaningful associations with high-level entities,
including corridors and rooms. Experimental results are conducted on a
real-world dataset collected using various legged robots and benchmarked
against a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)-based framework (S-Graphs) as the
ground truth. Consequently, our framework not only excels in crafting a richer,
multi-layered hierarchical map of the environment but also shows enhancement in
robot pose accuracy when contrasted with state-of-the-art methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">Online recommender systems (RS) aim to match user needs with the vast amount
of resources available on various platforms. A key challenge is to model user
preferences accurately under the condition of data sparsity. To address this
challenge, some methods have leveraged external user behavior data from
multiple platforms to enrich user representation. However, all of these methods
require a consistent user ID across platforms and ignore the information from
similar users. In this study, we propose RUEL, a novel retrieval-based
sequential recommender that can effectively incorporate external anonymous user
behavior data from Edge browser logs to enhance recommendation. We first
collect and preprocess a large volume of Edge browser logs over a one-year
period and link them to target entities that correspond to candidate items in
recommendation datasets. We then design a contrastive learning framework with a
momentum encoder and a memory bank to retrieve the most relevant and diverse
browsing sequences from the full browsing log based on the semantic similarity
between user representations. After retrieval, we apply an item-level attentive
selector to filter out noisy items and generate refined sequence embeddings for
the final predictor. RUEL is the first method that connects user browsing data
with typical recommendation datasets and can be generalized to various
recommendation scenarios and datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on four
real datasets for sequential recommendation tasks and demonstrate that RUEL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct ablation
studies and qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of each
component of RUEL and provide additional insights into our method.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new approach to analyze distributed hybrid systems by a
generalization of rely-guarantee reasoning. First, we give a system for
deductive verification of class invariants and method contracts in
object-oriented distributed hybrid systems. In a hybrid setting, the object
invariant must not only be the post-condition of a method, but also has to hold
in the post-region of a method. The post-region describes all reachable states
after method termination before another process is guaranteed to run. The
system naturally generalizes rely-guarantee reasoning of discrete
object-oriented languages to hybrid systems and carries over its modularity to
hybrid systems: Only one dL-proof obligation is generated per method. The
post-region can be approximated using lightweight analyses and we give a
general notion of soundness for such analyses. Post-region based verification
is implemented for the Hybrid Active Object language HABS.

<p class="mathjax">Three-dimensional facial stereophotogrammetry provides a detailed
representation of craniofacial soft tissue without the use of ionizing
radiation. While manual annotation of landmarks serves as the current gold
standard for cephalometric analysis, it is a time-consuming process and is
prone to human error. The aim in this study was to develop and evaluate an
automated cephalometric annotation method using a deep learning-based approach.
Ten landmarks were manually annotated on 2897 3D facial photographs by a single
observer. The automated landmarking workflow involved two successive
DiffusionNet models and additional algorithms for facial segmentation. The
dataset was randomly divided into a training and test dataset. The training
dataset was used to train the deep learning networks, whereas the test dataset
was used to evaluate the performance of the automated workflow. The precision
of the workflow was evaluated by calculating the Euclidean distances between
the automated and manual landmarks and compared to the intra-observer and
inter-observer variability of manual annotation and the semi-automated
landmarking method. The workflow was successful in 98.6% of all test cases. The
deep learning-based landmarking method achieved precise and consistent landmark
annotation. The mean precision of 1.69 (+/-1.15) mm was comparable to the
inter-observer variability (1.31 +/-0.91 mm) of manual annotation. The
Euclidean distance between the automated and manual landmarks was within 2 mm
in 69%. Automated landmark annotation on 3D photographs was achieved with the
DiffusionNet-based approach. The proposed method allows quantitative analysis
of large datasets and may be used in diagnosis, follow-up, and virtual surgical
planning.

<p class="mathjax">We aim for accurate and efficient line landmark detection for valet parking,
which is a long-standing yet unsolved problem in autonomous driving. To this
end, we present a deep line landmark detection system where we carefully design
the modules to be lightweight. Specifically, we first empirically design four
general line landmarks including three physical lines and one novel mental
line. The four line landmarks are effective for valet parking. We then develop
a deep network (LineMarkNet) to detect line landmarks from surround-view
cameras where we, via the pre-calibrated homography, fuse context from four
separate cameras into the unified bird-eye-view (BEV) space, specifically we
fuse the surroundview features and BEV features, then employ the multi-task
decoder to detect multiple line landmarks where we apply the center-based
strategy for object detection task, and design our graph transformer to enhance
the vision transformer with hierarchical level graph reasoning for semantic
segmentation task. At last, we further parameterize the detected line landmarks
(e.g., intercept-slope form) whereby a novel filtering backend incorporates
temporal and multi-view consistency to achieve smooth and stable detection.
Moreover, we annotate a large-scale dataset to validate our method.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves the enhanced performance
compared with several line detection methods and validate the multi-task
network's efficiency about the real-time line landmark detection on the
Qualcomm 820A platform while meantime keeps superior accuracy, with our deep
line landmark detection system.

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge is a critical issue in
continual learning typically handled through various regularization strategies.
However, existing methods struggle especially when several incremental steps
are performed. In this paper, we extend our previous approach (RECALL) and
tackle forgetting by exploiting unsupervised web-crawled data to retrieve
examples of old classes from online databases. Differently from the original
approach that did not perform any evaluation of the web data, here we introduce
two novel approaches based on adversarial learning and adaptive thresholding to
select from web data only samples strongly resembling the statistics of the no
longer available training ones. Furthermore, we improved the pseudo-labeling
scheme to achieve a more accurate labeling of web data that also consider
classes being learned in the current step. Experimental results show that this
enhanced approach achieves remarkable results, especially when multiple
incremental learning steps are performed.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring major benefits to transport
and society. To exploit this potential, their acceptance by society is a
necessary condition. However, AV acceptance is currently at stake: AVs face
resistance by bystanders and local communities. Resistance can prevent the
implementation and use of AVs, threatening road safety and efficiency. The
present study performed a qualitative and quantitative text analysis of
comments submitted by locals in San Francisco (SF) to the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) on the fared deployment of AVs. The results of the
analysis are synthesized, and a conceptual framework explaining and predicting
resistance is proposed. The framework posits that the occurrence of resistance
is a direct result of the perception of threats, which is determined by
individual and system characteristics, direct and indirect consequences of
system use, reactions of others, and external events. AVs as threat to safety
was associated with their unpredictable, and illegal driving behavior, as well
as producing conflict situations. The lack of explicit communication between
AVs and other road users due to the absence of a human driver behind the
steering wheel negatively contributed to perceived safety and trust, especially
for vulnerable populations in crossing situations. Respondents reported a
negative impact on road capacity, congestion, and traffic flow, with AVs
blocking other road users, such as emergency vehicles. Inaccessible vehicle
design contributed to the exclusion of vulnerable groups with disabilities. The
scientific dialogue on acceptance of AVs needs to shift towards resistance as
the 'other' essential element of acceptance to ensure that we live up to our
promise of transitioning towards more sustainable mobility that is inclusive,
equitable, fair, just, affordable, and available to all.

<p class="mathjax">Grid sentence is commonly used for studying the Lombard effect and
Normal-to-Lombard conversion. However, it's unclear if Normal-to-Lombard models
trained on grid sentences are sufficient for improving natural speech
intelligibility in real-world applications. This paper presents the recording
of a parallel Lombard corpus (called Lombard Chinese TIMIT, LCT) extracting
natural sentences from Chinese TIMIT. Then We compare natural and grid
sentences in terms of Lombard effect and Normal-to-Lombard conversion using LCT
and Enhanced MAndarin Lombard Grid corpus (EMALG). Through a parametric
analysis of the Lombard effect, We find that as the noise level increases, both
natural sentences and grid sentences exhibit similar changes in parameters, but
in terms of the increase of the alpha ratio, grid sentences show a greater
increase. Following a subjective intelligibility assessment across genders and
Signal-to-Noise Ratios, the StarGAN model trained on EMALG consistently
outperforms the model trained on LCT in terms of improving intelligibility.
This superior performance may be attributed to EMALG's larger alpha ratio
increase from normal to Lombard speech.

<p class="mathjax">The consumer drone market is rapidly expanding with new drone models
featuring unique variations of hardware and software. The rapid development of
drone technology and variability in drone systems can make it difficult for
digital forensic investigators and tools to keep pace and effectively extract
and analyse digital evidence from drones. Furthermore, the growing popularity
of drones and their increased use in illegal and harmful activities, such as
smuggling, espionage, and even terrorism, has led to an increase in the number
of drone forensic cases for authorities to manage. To assist forensic
investigators, a static digital forensic case study was conducted on two drone
devices recently released by Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI): the Mini 3 Pro drone,
and its remote controller, the DJI RC. The study discovered the presence of
several digital artefacts on both devices, including recorded media, flight
logs, and other information that could help investigators trace the drone's
usage and identify its operator. Additionally, this paper explored several
methods for extracting and visualising the drone's flight history, and
highlights some of the potential methods used to limit, obscure, or remove key
types of digital evidence.

<p class="mathjax">Within the model-theoretic framework for supervised learning introduced by
Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004), we study the parameterized complexity of
learning concepts definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO). We show that
the problem of learning a consistent MSO-formula is fixed-parameter tractable
on structures of bounded tree-width and on graphs of bounded clique-width in
the 1-dimensional case, that is, if the instances are single vertices (and not
tuples of vertices). This generalizes previous results on strings and on trees.
Moreover, in the agnostic PAC-learning setting, we show that the result also
holds in higher dimensions. Finally, via a reduction to the MSO-model-checking
problem, we show that learning a consistent MSO-formula is para-NP-hard on
general structures.

<p class="mathjax">Existing nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trackers follow an
"Enhance-then-Track" architecture - first using a light enhancer to brighten
the nighttime video, then employing a daytime tracker to locate the object.
This separate enhancement and tracking fails to build an end-to-end trainable
vision system. To address this, we propose a novel architecture called Darkness
Clue-Prompted Tracking (DCPT) that achieves robust UAV tracking at night by
efficiently learning to generate darkness clue prompts. Without a separate
enhancer, DCPT directly encodes anti-dark capabilities into prompts using a
darkness clue prompter (DCP). Specifically, DCP iteratively learns emphasizing
and undermining projections for darkness clues. It then injects these learned
visual prompts into a daytime tracker with fixed parameters across transformer
layers. Moreover, a gated feature aggregation mechanism enables adaptive fusion
between prompts and between prompts and the base model. Extensive experiments
show state-of-the-art performance for DCPT on multiple dark scenario
benchmarks. The unified end-to-end learning of enhancement and tracking in DCPT
enables a more trainable system. The darkness clue prompting efficiently
injects anti-dark knowledge without extra modules. Code and models will be
released.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding how machine learning models respond to distributional shifts is
a key research challenge. Mazes serve as an excellent testbed due to varied
generation algorithms offering a nuanced platform to simulate both subtle and
pronounced distributional shifts. To enable systematic investigations of model
behavior on out-of-distribution data, we present $\texttt{maze-dataset}$, a
comprehensive library for generating, processing, and visualizing datasets
consisting of maze-solving tasks. With this library, researchers can easily

<p class="mathjax">The utilization of implicit representation for visual data (such as images,
videos, and 3D models) has recently gained significant attention in computer
vision research. In this letter, we propose a novel model steganography scheme
with implicit neural representation. The message sender leverages Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and its viewpoint synthesis capabilities by introducing
a viewpoint as a key. The NeRF model generates a secret viewpoint image, which
serves as a backdoor. Subsequently, we train a message extractor using
overfitting to establish a one-to-one mapping between the secret message and
the secret viewpoint image. The sender delivers the trained NeRF model and the
message extractor to the receiver over the open channel, and the receiver
utilizes the key shared by both parties to obtain the rendered image in the
secret view from the NeRF model, and then obtains the secret message through
the message extractor. The inherent complexity of the viewpoint information
prevents attackers from stealing the secret message accurately. Experimental
results demonstrate that the message extractor trained in this letter achieves
high-capacity steganography with fast performance, achieving a 100\% accuracy
in message extraction. Furthermore, the extensive viewpoint key space of NeRF
ensures the security of the steganography scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Range-measuring sensors play a critical role in autonomous driving systems.
While LiDAR technology has been dominant, its vulnerability to adverse weather
conditions is well-documented. This paper focuses on secondary adverse
conditions and the implications of ill-reflective surfaces on range measurement
sensors. We assess the influence of this condition on the three primary ranging
modalities used in autonomous mobile robotics: LiDAR, RADAR, and Depth-Camera.
Based on accurate experimental evaluation the papers findings reveal that under
ill-reflectivity, LiDAR ranging performance drops significantly to 33% of its
nominal operating conditions, whereas RADAR and Depth-Cameras maintain up to
100% of their nominal distance ranging capabilities. Additionally, we
demonstrate on a 1:10 scaled autonomous racecar how ill-reflectivity adversely
impacts downstream robotics tasks, highlighting the necessity for robust range
sensing in autonomous driving.

<p class="mathjax">The training of neural encoders via deep learning necessitates a
differentiable channel model due to the backpropagation algorithm. This
requirement can be sidestepped by approximating either the channel distribution
or its gradient through pilot signals in real-world scenarios. The initial
approach draws upon the latest advancements in image generation, utilizing
generative adversarial networks (GANs) or their enhanced variants to generate
channel distributions. In this paper, we address this channel approximation
challenge with diffusion models, which have demonstrated high sample quality in
image generation. We offer an end-to-end channel coding framework underpinned
by diffusion models and propose an efficient training algorithm. Our
simulations with various channel models establish that our diffusion models
learn the channel distribution accurately, thereby achieving near-optimal
end-to-end symbol error rates (SERs). We also note a significant advantage of
diffusion models: A robust generalization capability in high signal-to-noise
ratio regions, in contrast to GAN variants that suffer from error floor.
Furthermore, we examine the trade-off between sample quality and sampling
speed, when an accelerated sampling algorithm is deployed, and investigate the
effect of the noise scheduling on this trade-off. With an apt choice of noise
scheduling, sampling time can be significantly reduced with a minor increase in
SER.

<p class="mathjax">Open-domain table question answering aims to provide answers to a question by
retrieving and extracting information from a large collection of tables.
Existing studies of open-domain table QA either directly adopt text retrieval
methods or consider the table structure only in the encoding layer for table
retrieval, which may cause syntactical and structural information loss during
table scoring. To address this issue, we propose a syntax- and structure-aware
retrieval method for the open-domain table QA task. It provides syntactical
representations for the question and uses the structural header and value
representations for the tables to avoid the loss of fine-grained syntactical
and structural information. Then, a syntactical-to-structural aggregator is
used to obtain the matching score between the question and a candidate table by
mimicking the human retrieval process. Experimental results show that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art on the NQ-tables dataset and overwhelms
strong baselines on a newly curated open-domain Text-to-SQL dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Internet of vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a key technology to realize
real-time vehicular application. For IoV, vehicles adopt cellular
vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) standard to support direct communication among
them. C-V2X mode 4 controls resource allocation without the assistance of
cellular network, hence it is widely used for IoV. However, C-V2X mode 4 has
two drawbacks. First is that vehicles cannot communicate with each other for a
period in some case which will cause an increase in age of information (AoI);
second is that vehicles may select resource already occupied by others which
will deteriorate the reliability. To address the two drawbacks, we propose an
enhanced C-V2X mode 4 to optimize AoI and reliability. In addition, we consider
the fact that for most vehicular applications, each vehicle periodically
requires fresh information of vehicles within a certain distance and propose a
new performance metric to evaluate the system AoI for IoV. Furthermore, we
construct a platform through integrating SUMO and NS3. We demonstrate the
superiority of the enhanced C-V2X mode 4 base on this simulation platform.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks (NNs) have been successfully deployed in various fields. In
NNs, a large number of multiplyaccumulate (MAC) operations need to be
performed. Most existing digital hardware platforms rely on parallel MAC units
to accelerate these MAC operations. However, under a given area constraint, the
number of MAC units in such platforms is limited, so MAC units have to be
reused to perform MAC operations in a neural network. Accordingly, the
throughput in generating classification results is not high, which prevents the
application of traditional hardware platforms in extreme-throughput scenarios.
Besides, the power consumption of such platforms is also high, mainly due to
data movement. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose to flatten
and implement all the operations at neurons, e.g., MAC and ReLU, in a neural
network with their corresponding logic circuits. To improve the throughput and
reduce the power consumption of such logic designs, the weight values are
embedded into the MAC units to simplify the logic, which can reduce the delay
of the MAC units and the power consumption incurred by weight movement. The
retiming technique is further used to improve the throughput of the logic
circuits for neural networks. In addition, we propose a hardware-aware training
method to reduce the area of logic designs of neural networks. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed logic designs can achieve high throughput
and low power consumption for several high-throughput applications.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we develop an unsupervised method for the joint segmentation
and denoising of a single image. To this end, we combine the advantages of a
variational segmentation method with the power of a self-supervised,
single-image based deep learning approach. One major strength of our method
lies in the fact, that in contrast to data-driven methods, where huge amounts
of labeled samples are necessary, our model can segment an image into multiple
meaningful regions without any training database. Further, we introduce a novel
energy functional in which denoising and segmentation are coupled in a way that
both tasks benefit from each other. The limitations of existing single-image
based variational segmentation methods, which are not capable of dealing with
high noise or generic texture, are tackled by this specific combination with
self-supervised image denoising. We propose a unified optimisation strategy and
show that, especially for very noisy images available in microscopy, our
proposed joint approach outperforms its sequential counterpart as well as
alternative methods focused purely on denoising or segmentation. Another
comparison is conducted with a supervised deep learning approach designed for
the same application, highlighting the good performance of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Instance segmentation has witnessed promising advancements through deep
neural network-based algorithms. However, these models often exhibit incorrect
predictions with unwarranted confidence levels. Consequently, evaluating
prediction uncertainty becomes critical for informed decision-making. Existing
methods primarily focus on quantifying uncertainty in classification or
regression tasks, lacking emphasis on instance segmentation. Our research
addresses the challenge of estimating spatial certainty associated with the
location of instances with star-convex shapes. Two distinct clustering
approaches are evaluated which compute spatial and fractional certainty per
instance employing samples by the Monte-Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensemble
technique. Our study demonstrates that combining spatial and fractional
certainty scores yields improved calibrated estimation over individual
certainty scores. Notably, our experimental results show that the Deep Ensemble
technique alongside our novel radial clustering approach proves to be an
effective strategy. Our findings emphasize the significance of evaluating the
calibration of estimated certainties for model reliability and decision-making.

understanding the performance of network connections is crucial for web service
providers. While different measures, like TCP options, alternative transport
layer protocols like QUIC, or the hosting of services in CDNs, are expected to
improve connection performance, no studies are quantifying such impacts on
connections on the Internet.
<br />This paper introduces an active Internet measurement approach to assess the
impacts of mentioned measures on connection performance. We conduct downloads
from public web servers considering different vantage points, extract
performance indicators like throughput, RTT, and retransmission rate, and
survey speed-ups due to TCP option usage. Further, we compare the performance
of QUIC-based downloads to TCP-based downloads considering different option
configurations.
<br />Next to significant throughput improvements due to TCP option usage, in
particular TCP window scaling, and QUIC, our study shows significantly
increased performance for connections to domains hosted by different giant
CDNs.

<p class="mathjax">Split learning (SL) is a new collaborative learning technique that allows
participants, e.g. a client and a server, to train machine learning models
without the client sharing raw data. In this setting, the client initially
applies its part of the machine learning model on the raw data to generate
activation maps and then sends them to the server to continue the training
process. Previous works in the field demonstrated that reconstructing
activation maps could result in privacy leakage of client data. In addition to
that, existing mitigation techniques that overcome the privacy leakage of SL
prove to be significantly worse in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we improve
upon previous works by constructing a protocol based on U-shaped SL that can
operate on homomorphically encrypted data. More precisely, in our approach, the
client applies homomorphic encryption on the activation maps before sending
them to the server, thus protecting user privacy. This is an important
improvement that reduces privacy leakage in comparison to other SL-based works.
Finally, our results show that, with the optimum set of parameters, training
with HE data in the U-shaped SL setting only reduces accuracy by 2.65% compared
to training on plaintext. In addition, raw training data privacy is preserved.

<p class="mathjax">We study a challenging problem of unsupervised discovery of object landmarks.
Many recent methods rely on bottlenecks to generate 2D Gaussian heatmaps
however, these are limited in generating informed heatmaps while training,
presumably due to the lack of effective structural cues. Also, it is assumed
that all predicted landmarks are semantically relevant despite having no ground
truth supervision. In the current work, we introduce a consistency-guided
bottleneck in an image reconstruction-based pipeline that leverages landmark
consistency, a measure of compatibility score with the pseudo-ground truth to
generate adaptive heatmaps. We propose obtaining pseudo-supervision via forming
landmark correspondence across images. The consistency then modulates the
uncertainty of the discovered landmarks in the generation of adaptive heatmaps
which rank consistent landmarks above their noisy counterparts, providing
effective structural information for improved robustness. Evaluations on five
diverse datasets including MAFL, AFLW, LS3D, Cats, and Shoes demonstrate
excellent performance of the proposed approach compared to the existing
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation is an essential technology for self-driving cars to
comprehend their surroundings. Currently, real-time semantic segmentation
networks commonly employ either encoder-decoder architecture or two-pathway
architecture. Generally speaking, encoder-decoder models tend to be
quicker,whereas two-pathway models exhibit higher accuracy. To leverage both
strengths, we present the Spatial-Assistant Encoder-Decoder Network (SANet) to
fuse the two architectures. In the overall architecture, we uphold the
encoder-decoder design while maintaining the feature maps in the middle section
of the encoder and utilizing atrous convolution branches for same-resolution
feature extraction. Toward the end of the encoder, we integrate the asymmetric
pooling pyramid pooling module (APPPM) to optimize the semantic extraction of
the feature maps. This module incorporates asymmetric pooling layers that
extract features at multiple resolutions. In the decoder, we present a hybrid
attention module, SAD, that integrates horizontal and vertical attention to
facilitate the combination of various branches. To ascertain the effectiveness
of our approach, our SANet model achieved competitive results on the real-time
CamVid and cityscape datasets. By employing a single 2080Ti GPU, SANet achieved
a 78.4 % mIOU at 65.1 FPS on the Cityscape test dataset and 78.8 % mIOU at 147
FPS on the CamVid test dataset. The training code and model for SANet are
available at https://github.com/CuZaoo/SANet-main

<p class="mathjax">Visible and near-infrared(NIR) band sensors provide images that capture
complementary spectral radiations from a scene. And the fusion of the visible
and NIR image aims at utilizing their spectrum properties to enhance image
quality. However, currently visible and NIR fusion algorithms cannot well take
advantage of spectrum properties, as well as lack information complementarity,
which results in color distortion and artifacts. Therefore, this paper designs
a complementary fusion model from the level of physical signals. First, in
order to distinguish between noise and useful information, we use two layers of
the weight-guided filter and guided filter to obtain texture and edge layers,
respectively. Second, to generate the initial visible-NIR complementarity
weight map, the difference maps of visible and NIR are filtered by the
extend-DoG filter. After that, the significant region of NIR night-time
compensation guides the initial complementarity weight map by the arctanI
function. Finally, the fusion images can be generated by the complementarity
weight maps of visible and NIR images, respectively. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can not only well take advantage of the
spectrum properties and the information complementarity, but also avoid color
unnatural while maintaining naturalness, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Precise polyp segmentation is vital for the early diagnosis and prevention of
colorectal cancer (CRC) in clinical practice. However, due to scale variation
and blurry polyp boundaries, it is still a challenging task to achieve
satisfactory segmentation performance with different scales and shapes. In this
study, we present a novel Edge-aware Feature Aggregation Network (EFA-Net) for
polyp segmentation, which can fully make use of cross-level and multi-scale
features to enhance the performance of polyp segmentation. Specifically, we
first present an Edge-aware Guidance Module (EGM) to combine the low-level
features with the high-level features to learn an edge-enhanced feature, which
is incorporated into each decoder unit using a layer-by-layer strategy.
Besides, a Scale-aware Convolution Module (SCM) is proposed to learn
scale-aware features by using dilated convolutions with different ratios, in
order to effectively deal with scale variation. Further, a Cross-level Fusion
Module (CFM) is proposed to effectively integrate the cross-level features,
which can exploit the local and global contextual information. Finally, the
outputs of CFMs are adaptively weighted by using the learned edge-aware
feature, which are then used to produce multiple side-out segmentation maps.
Experimental results on five widely adopted colonoscopy datasets show that our
EFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods in terms of
generalization and effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Translation automation mechanisms and tools have been developed for several
years to bring people who speak different languages together. A "new search
only approach to machine translation" was adopted to tackle some of the
slowness and inaccuracy of the other technologies. The idea is to develop a
solution that, by indexing an incremental set of words that combine a certain
semantic meaning, makes it possible to create a process of correspondence
between their native language record and the language of translation. This
research principle assumes that the vocabulary used in a given type of
publication/document is relatively limited in terms of language style and word
diversity, which enhances the greater effect of instantaneously and rigor in
the translation process through the indexing process. A volume of electronic
text documents where processed and loaded into a database, and analyzed and
measured in order confirm the previous premise. Although the observed and
projected metric values did not give encouraging results, it was possible to
develop and make available a translation tool using this approach.

<p class="mathjax">Annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds for perception tasks including 3D object
detection and LiDAR semantic segmentation is notoriously
time-and-energy-consuming. To alleviate the burden from labeling, it is
promising to perform large-scale pre-training and fine-tune the pre-trained
backbone on different downstream datasets as well as tasks. In this paper, we
propose SPOT, namely Scalable Pre-training via Occupancy prediction for
learning Transferable 3D representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on
various public datasets with different downstream tasks under the
label-efficiency setting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Occupancy
prediction is shown to be promising for learning general representations, which
is demonstrated by extensive experiments on plenty of datasets and tasks. (2)
SPOT uses beam re-sampling technique for point cloud augmentation and applies
class-balancing strategies to overcome the domain gap brought by various LiDAR
sensors and annotation strategies in different datasets. (3) Scalable
pre-training is observed, that is, the downstream performance across all the
experiments gets better with more pre-training data. We believe that our
findings can facilitate understanding of LiDAR point clouds and pave the way
for future exploration in LiDAR pre-training. Codes and models will be
released.

<p class="mathjax">The basic principle of the patch-matching based style transfer is to
substitute the patches of the content image feature maps by the closest patches
from the style image feature maps. Since the finite features harvested from one
single aesthetic style image are inadequate to represent the rich textures of
the content natural image, existing techniques treat the full-channel style
feature patches as simple signal tensors and create new style feature patches
via signal-level fusion, which ignore the implicit diversities existed in style
features and thus fail for generating better stylised results. In this paper,
we propose a Retinex theory guided, channel-grouping based patch swap technique
to solve the above challenges. Channel-grouping strategy groups the style
feature maps into surface and texture channels, which prevents the
winner-takes-all problem. Retinex theory based decomposition controls a more
stable channel code rate generation. In addition, we provide complementary
fusion and multi-scale generation strategy to prevent unexpected black area and
over-stylised results respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in providing more
style-consistent textures while keeping the content fidelity.

stems from the realisation that dealing efficiently with this production
requires getting better at interlinking digital informational resources
together. Its focus is on linking data. Linking data isn't enough. We need to
provide infrastructural support for linking all sorts of informational
resources including resources whose understanding and fine interlinking
requires domain-specific human expertise. At times when many problems scale to
planetary dimensions, it is essential to scale coordination of information
processing and information production, without giving up on expertise and depth
of analysis, nor forcing languages and formalisms onto thinkers,

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new neural architecture for solving visual abstract reasoning
tasks inspired by human cognition, specifically by observations that human
abstract reasoning often interleaves perceptual and conceptual processing as
part of a flexible, iterative, and dynamic cognitive process. Inspired by this
principle, our architecture models visual abstract reasoning as an iterative,
self-contrasting learning process that pursues consistency between perceptual
and conceptual processing of visual stimuli. We explain how this new
Contrastive Perceptual-Conceptual Network (CPCNet) works using matrix reasoning
problems in the style of the well-known Raven's Progressive Matrices
intelligence test. Experiments on the machine learning dataset RAVEN show that
CPCNet achieves higher accuracy than all previously published models while also
using the weakest inductive bias. We also point out a substantial and
previously unremarked class imbalance in the original RAVEN dataset, and we
propose a new variant of RAVEN -- AB-RAVEN -- that is more balanced in terms of
abstract concepts.

<p class="mathjax">The curve-based lane representation is a popular approach in many lane
detection methods, as it allows for the representation of lanes as a whole
object and maximizes the use of holistic information about the lanes. However,
the curves produced by these methods may not fit well with irregular lines,
which can lead to gaps in performance compared to indirect representations such
as segmentation-based or point-based methods. We have observed that these lanes
are not intended to be irregular, but they appear zigzagged in the perspective
view due to being drawn on uneven pavement. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to the lane detection task by decomposing it into two parts: curve
modeling and ground height regression. Specifically, we use a parameterized
curve to represent lanes in the BEV space to reflect the original distribution
of lanes. For the second part, since ground heights are determined by natural
factors such as road conditions and are less holistic, we regress the ground
heights of key points separately from the curve modeling. Additionally, we have
unified the 2D and 3D lane detection tasks by designing a new framework and a
series of losses to guide the optimization of models with or without 3D lane
labels. Our experiments on 2D lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple and CULane),
as well as the recently proposed 3D lane detection datasets (ONCE-3Dlane and
OpenLane), have shown significant improvements. We will make our
well-documented source code publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Although generative AI has been successful in many areas, its ability to
model geospatial data is still underexplored. Urban flow, a typical kind of
geospatial data, is critical for a wide range of urban applications. Existing
studies mostly focus on predictive modeling of urban flow that predicts the
future flow based on historical flow data, which may be unavailable in
data-sparse areas or newly planned regions. Some other studies aim to predict
OD flow among regions but they fail to model dynamic changes of urban flow over
time. In this work, we study a new problem of urban flow generation that
generates dynamic urban flow for regions without historical flow data. To
capture the effect of multiple factors on urban flow, such as region features
and urban environment, we employ diffusion model to generate urban flow for
regions under different conditions. We first construct an urban knowledge graph
(UKG) to model the urban environment and relationships between regions, based
on which we design a knowledge-enhanced spatio-temporal diffusion model
(KSTDiff) to generate urban flow for each region. Specifically, to accurately
generate urban flow for regions with different flow volumes, we design a novel
diffusion process guided by a volume estimator, which is learnable and
customized for each region. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-enhanced denoising
network to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of urban flow as well as
the impact of urban environment in the denoising process. Extensive experiments
on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model over
state-of-the-art baselines in urban flow generation. Further in-depth studies
demonstrate the utility of generated urban flow data and the ability of our
model for long-term flow generation and urban flow prediction. Our code is
released at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/KSTDiff-Urban-flow-generation.

<p class="mathjax">Computer Vision and 3D printing have rapidly evolved in the last 10 years but
interactions among them have been very limited so far, despite the fact that
they share several mathematical techniques. We try to fill the gap presenting
an overview of some techniques for Shape-from-Shading problems as well as for
3D printing with an emphasis on the approaches based on nonlinear partial
differential equations and optimization. We also sketch possible couplings to
complete the process of object manufacturing starting from one or more images
of the object and ending with its final 3D print. We will give some practical

decision-making. Such decisions are vital for optimizing production lines,
e.g., reducing resource consumption, improving the quality of discrete
manufacturing operations, and optimizing the actual products, e.g., optimizing
the sampling rate for measuring product dimensions during production. Such

<p class="mathjax">We propose a Neighbourhood-Aware Differential Privacy (NADP) mechanism
considering the neighbourhood of a word in a pretrained static word embedding
space to determine the minimal amount of noise required to guarantee a
specified privacy level. We first construct a nearest neighbour graph over the
words using their embeddings, and factorise it into a set of connected
components (i.e. neighbourhoods). We then separately apply different levels of
Gaussian noise to the words in each neighbourhood, determined by the set of
words in that neighbourhood. Experiments show that our proposed NADP mechanism
consistently outperforms multiple previously proposed DP mechanisms such as
Laplacian, Gaussian, and Mahalanobis in multiple downstream tasks, while
guaranteeing higher levels of privacy.

<p class="mathjax">Text guided image editing on real images given only the image and the target
text prompt as inputs, is a very general and challenging problem, which
requires the editing model to reason by itself which part of the image should
be edited, to preserve the characteristics of original image, and also to
perform complicated non-rigid editing. Previous fine-tuning based solutions are
time-consuming and vulnerable to overfitting, limiting their editing
capabilities. To tackle these issues, we design a novel text guided image
editing method, Forgedit. First, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework which
learns to reconstruct the given image in less than one minute by vision
language joint learning. Then we introduce vector subtraction and vector
projection to explore the proper text embedding for editing. We also find a
general property of UNet structures in Diffusion Models and inspired by such a
finding, we design forgetting strategies to diminish the fatal overfitting
issues and significantly boost the editing abilities of Diffusion Models. Our
method, Forgedit, implemented with Stable Diffusion, achieves new
state-of-the-art results on the challenging text guided image editing benchmark
TEdBench, surpassing the previous SOTA method Imagic with Imagen, in terms of
both CLIP score and LPIPS score. Codes are available at
https://github.com/witcherofresearch/Forgedit.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposed a new methodological approach for the assessment of
automated vehicle acceptance (AVA) from the perspective of road users inside
and outside of AVs pre- and post- AV experience. Users can be drivers and
passengers, but also external road users, such as pedestrians,
(motor-)cyclists, and other car drivers, interacting with AVs. A pyramid was
developed, which provides a hierarchical representation of user needs.
Fundamental user needs are organized at the bottom of the pyramid, while
higher-level user needs are at the top of the pyramid. The pyramid
distinguishes between six levels of needs, which are safety trust, efficiency,
comfort and pleasure, social influence, and well-being. Some user needs
universally exist across users, while some are user-specific needs. These needs
are translated into operationalizable indicators representing items of a
questionnaire for the assessment of AVA of users inside and outside AVs. The
formulation of the questionnaire items was derived from established technology
acceptance models. As the instrument was based on the same model for all road
users, the comparison of AVA between different road users is now possible. We
recommend future research to validate this questionnaire, administering it in
studies to contribute to the development of a short, efficient, and
standardized metric for the assessment of AVA.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems are increasingly used in voice
bio-metrics for user authentication but are susceptible to logical and physical
spoofing attacks, posing security risks. Existing research mainly tackles
logical or physical attacks separately, leading to a gap in unified spoofing
detection. Moreover, when existing systems attempt to handle both types of
attacks, they often exhibit significant disparities in the Equal Error Rate
(EER). To bridge this gap, we present a Parallel Stacked Aggregation Network
that processes raw audio. Our approach employs a split-transform-aggregation
technique, dividing utterances into convolved representations, applying
transformations, and aggregating the results to identify logical (LA) and
physical (PA) spoofing attacks. Evaluation of the ASVspoof-2019 and VSDC
datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed system. It outperforms
state-of-the-art solutions, displaying reduced EER disparities and superior
performance in detecting spoofing attacks. This highlights the proposed
method's generalizability and superiority. In a world increasingly reliant on
voice-based security, our unified spoofing detection system provides a robust
defense against a spectrum of voice spoofing attacks, safeguarding ASVs and
user data effectively.

This paper presents that artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning,
has great potential for detecting hidden advertising and allows unbiased,
reproducible, and fair quantification of tobacco-related media content.
Methods: We propose an integrated text and image processing model based on deep
learning, generative methods, and human reinforcement, which can detect smoking
cases in both textual and visual formats, even with little available training
data. Results: Our model can achieve 74\% accuracy for images and 98\% for
text. Furthermore, our system integrates the possibility of expert intervention
in the form of human reinforcement. Conclusions: Using the pre-trained
multimodal, image, and text processing models available through deep learning
makes it possible to detect smoking in different media even with few training
data.

on documents with no structural annotation. We define this problem as "scarce
annotated legal documents" and explore their lack of structural information and
their long lengths with a deep learning-based classification framework which we
call MESc; "Multi-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering"; for judgment
prediction. Specifically, we divide a document into parts to extract their
embeddings from the last four layers of a custom fine-tuned Large Language
Model, and try to approximate their structure through unsupervised clustering.
Which we use in another set of transformer encoder layers to learn the
inter-chunk representations. We explore the adaptability of LLMs with
multi-billion parameters (GPT-Neo, and GPT-J) to legal texts and their
intra-domain(legal) transfer learning capacity. Alongside this, we compare
their performance with MESc and the impact of combining embeddings from their
last layers. For such hierarchical models, we also propose an explanation

<p class="mathjax">Spoken language identification refers to the task of automatically predicting
the spoken language in a given utterance. Conventionally, it is modeled as a
speech-based language identification task. Prior techniques have been
constrained to a single modality; however in the case of video data there is a
wealth of other metadata that may be beneficial for this task. In this work, we
propose MuSeLI, a Multimodal Spoken Language Identification method, which
delves into the use of various metadata sources to enhance language
identification. Our study reveals that metadata such as video title,
description and geographic location provide substantial information to identify
the spoken language of the multimedia recording. We conduct experiments using
two diverse public datasets of YouTube videos, and obtain state-of-the-art
results on the language identification task. We additionally conduct an
ablation study that describes the distinct contribution of each modality for
language recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Various mobile applications that comprise dependent tasks are gaining
widespread popularity and are increasingly complex. These applications often
have low-latency requirements, resulting in a significant surge in demand for
computing resources. With the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), it
becomes the most significant issue to offload the application tasks onto
small-scale devices deployed at the edge of the mobile network for obtaining a
high-quality user experience. However, since the environment of MEC is dynamic,
most existing works focusing on task graph offloading, which rely heavily on
expert knowledge or accurate analytical models, fail to fully adapt to such
environmental changes, resulting in the reduction of user experience. This
paper investigates the task graph offloading in MEC, considering the
time-varying computation capabilities of edge computing devices. To adapt to
environmental changes, we model the task graph scheduling for computation
offloading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then, we design a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm (SATA-DRL) to learn the task scheduling
strategy from the interaction with the environment, to improve user experience.
Extensive simulations validate that SATA-DRL is superior to existing strategies
in terms of reducing average makespan and deadline violation.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce the novel application of the adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) technique in the global stability analysis of incompressible
flows. The design of an accurate mesh for transitional flows is crucial.
Indeed, an inadequate resolution might introduce numerical noise that triggers
premature transition. With AMR, we enable the design of three different and
independent meshes for the non-linear base flow, the linear direct and adjoint
solutions. Each of those is designed to reduce the truncation and quadrature
errors for its respective solution, which are measured via the spectral error
indicator. We provide details about the workflow and the refining procedure.
The numerical framework is validated for the two-dimensional flow past a
circular cylinder, computing a portion of the spectrum for the linearised
direct and adjoint Navier-Stokes operators.

<p class="mathjax">In beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks,
beam management (BM) is a crucial operation. In the second phase of 5G NR
standardization, known as 5G-Advanced, which is being vigorously promoted, the
key component is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine
learning (ML) techniques. AI/ML for BM is selected as a representative use
case. This article provides an overview of the AI/ML for BM in 5G-Advanced. The
legacy non-AI and prime AI-enabled BM frameworks are first introduced and
compared. Then, the main scope of AI/ML for BM is presented, including
improving accuracy, reducing overhead and latency. Finally, the key challenges
and open issues in the standardization of AI/ML for BM are discussed,
especially the design of new protocols for AI-enabled BM. This article provides
a guideline for the study of AI/ML-based BM standardization.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning has been increasingly applied in monitoring
applications because of its ability to learn from previous experiences and can
make adaptive decisions. However, existing machine learning-based health
monitoring applications are mostly supervised learning algorithms, trained on
labels and they cannot make adaptive decisions in an uncertain complex
environment. This study proposes a novel and generic system, predictive deep
reinforcement learning (PDRL) with multiple RL agents in a time series
forecasting environment. The proposed generic framework accommodates virtual
Deep Q Network (DQN) agents to monitor predicted future states of a complex
environment with a well-defined reward policy so that the agent learns existing
knowledge while maximizing their rewards. In the evaluation process of the
proposed framework, three DRL agents were deployed to monitor a subject's
future heart rate, respiration, and temperature predicted using a BiLSTM model.
With each iteration, the three agents were able to learn the associated
patterns and their cumulative rewards gradually increased. It outperformed the
baseline models for all three monitoring agents. The proposed PDRL framework is
able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the time series forecasting
process. The proposed DRL agents and deep learning model in the PDRL framework
are customized to implement the transfer learning in other forecasting
applications like traffic and weather and monitor their states. The PDRL
framework is able to learn the future states of the traffic and weather
forecasting and the cumulative rewards are gradually increasing over each
episode.

teleoperation of a robotic arm using a digital twin as the interface between
the user and the robotic system. We tested TELESIM by performing a user survey
with 37 participants on two different robots using two different control
modalities: a virtual reality controller and a finger mapping hardware
controller using different grasping systems. Users were asked to teleoperate
the robot to pick and place 3 cubes in a tower and to repeat this task as many
times as possible in 10 minutes, with only 5 minutes of training beforehand.
Our experimental results show that most users were able to succeed by building

<p class="mathjax">Among the recent advances and innovations in satellite communications,
Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellations are gaining popularity
as a viable option for providing widespread broadband internet access and
backhauling services. However, a more complex ground segment with multiple
ground stations is necessary due to these satellites' high speeds and low
altitudes. The complete dimensioning of the ground segment, including gateway
optimal placement and the number of ground access points, remains a relevant
open challenge. In this article, we provide an overview of the key factors that
shall be considered for NGSO gateway station geographical planning.
Subsequently, we propose a ground segment dimensioning approach that combines
several criteria, such as rain attenuation, elevation angle, visibility,
geographical constraints, and user traffic demands. The operational concept is
first discussed, followed by a methodology that combines all these constraints
into a single map-grid to select the best position for each gateway.
Furthermore, a case study is presented, which demonstrates the performance of
the proposed methodology, for one example constellation. Finally, we highlight
relevant open challenges and key research directions in this area.

<p class="mathjax">Machine-learning models can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e.,
carefully-crafted input perturbations that force models to output wrong
predictions. While uncertainty quantification has been recently proposed to
detect adversarial inputs, under the assumption that such attacks exhibit a
higher prediction uncertainty than pristine data, it has been shown that
adaptive attacks specifically aimed at reducing also the uncertainty estimate
can easily bypass this defense mechanism. In this work, we focus on a different
adversarial scenario in which the attacker is still interested in manipulating
the uncertainty estimate, but regardless of the correctness of the prediction;
in particular, the goal is to undermine the use of machine-learning models when
their outputs are consumed by a downstream module or by a human operator.
Following such direction, we: \textit{(i)} design a threat model for attacks
targeting uncertainty quantification; \textit{(ii)} devise different attack
strategies on conceptually different UQ techniques spanning for both
classification and semantic segmentation problems; \textit{(iii)} conduct a
first complete and extensive analysis to compare the differences between some
of the most employed UQ approaches under attack. Our extensive experimental
analysis shows that our attacks are more effective in manipulating uncertainty
quantification measures than attacks aimed to also induce misclassifications.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection is an essential and fundamental task in computer vision and
satellite image processing. Existing deep learning methods have achieved
impressive performance thanks to the availability of large-scale annotated
datasets. Yet, in real-world applications the availability of labels is
limited. In this context, few-shot object detection (FSOD) has emerged as a
promising direction, which aims at enabling the model to detect novel objects
with only few of them annotated. However, many existing FSOD algorithms
overlook a critical issue: when an input image contains multiple novel objects
and only a subset of them are annotated, the unlabeled objects will be
considered as background during training. This can cause confusions and
severely impact the model's ability to recall novel objects. To address this
issue, we propose a self-training-based FSOD (ST-FSOD) approach, which
incorporates the self-training mechanism into the few-shot fine-tuning process.
ST-FSOD aims to enable the discovery of novel objects that are not annotated,
and take them into account during training. On the one hand, we devise a
two-branch region proposal networks (RPN) to separate the proposal extraction
of base and novel objects, On another hand, we incorporate the student-teacher
mechanism into RPN and the region of interest (RoI) head to include those
highly confident yet unlabeled targets as pseudo labels. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in
various FSOD settings by a large margin. The codes will be publicly available
at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/ST-FSOD.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular depth estimation has drawn widespread attention from the vision
community due to its broad applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
physics (geometry)-driven deep learning framework for monocular depth
estimation by assuming that 3D scenes are constituted by piece-wise planes.
Particularly, we introduce a new normal-distance head that outputs pixel-level
surface normal and plane-to-origin distance for deriving depth at each
position. Meanwhile, the normal and distance are regularized by a developed
plane-aware consistency constraint. We further integrate an additional depth
head to improve the robustness of the proposed framework. To fully exploit the
strengths of these two heads, we develop an effective contrastive iterative
refinement module that refines depth in a complementary manner according to the
depth uncertainty. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method
exceeds previous state-of-the-art competitors on the NYU-Depth-v2, KITTI and
SUN RGB-D datasets. Notably, it ranks 1st among all submissions on the KITTI
depth prediction online benchmark at the submission time.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of coordinated data collection is studied for a mobile
crowdsensing (MCS) system. A mobile crowdsensing platform (MCSP) sequentially
publishes sensing tasks to the available mobile units (MUs) that signal their
willingness to participate in a task by sending sensing offers back to the
MCSP. From the received offers, the MCSP decides the task assignment. A stable
task assignment must address two challenges: the MCSP's and MUs' conflicting
goals, and the uncertainty about the MUs' required efforts and preferences. To
overcome these challenges a novel decentralized approach combining matching
theory and online learning, called collision-avoidance multi-armed bandit with
strategic free sensing (CA-MAB-SFS), is proposed. The task assignment problem
is modeled as a matching game considering the MCSP's and MUs' individual goals
while the MUs learn their efforts online. Our innovative "free-sensing"
mechanism significantly improves the MU's learning process while reducing
collisions during task allocation. The stable regret of CA-MAB-SFS, i.e., the
loss of learning, is analytically shown to be bounded by a sublinear function,
ensuring the convergence to a stable optimal solution. Simulation results show
that CA-MAB-SFS increases the MUs' and the MCSP's satisfaction compared to
state-of-the-art methods while reducing the average task completion time by at
least 16%.

<p class="mathjax">Automated vehicle acceptance (AVA) has been measured mostly subjectively by
questionnaires and interviews, with a main focus on drivers inside automated
vehicles (AVs). To ensure that AVs are widely accepted by the public, ensuring
the acceptance by both drivers and passengers is key. The in-vehicle experience
of passengers will determine the extent to which AVs will be accepted by
passengers. A comprehensive understanding of potential assessment methods to
measure the passenger experience in AVs is needed to improve the in-vehicle
experience of passengers and thereby the acceptance. The present work provides
an overview of assessment methods that were used to measure a driver's
behavior, and cognitive and emotional states during (automated) driving. The
results of the review have shown that these assessment methods can be
classified by type of data-collection method (e.g., questionnaires, interviews,
direct input devices, sensors), object of their measurement (i.e., perception,
behavior, state), time of measurement, and degree of objectivity of the data
collected. A conceptual model synthesizes the results of the literature review,
formulating relationships between the factors constituting the in-vehicle
experience and AVA acceptance. It is theorized that the in-vehicle experience
influences the intention to use, with intention to use serving as predictor of
actual use. The model also formulates relationships between actual use and
well-being. A combined approach of using both subjective and objective
assessment methods is needed to provide more accurate estimates for AVA, and
advance the uptake and use of AVs.

<p class="mathjax">Music motif, as a conceptual building block of composition, is crucial for
music structure analysis and automatic composition. While human listeners can
identify motifs easily, existing computational models fall short in
representing motifs and their developments. The reason is that the nature of
motifs is implicit, and the diversity of motif variations extends beyond simple
repetitions and modulations. In this study, we aim to learn the implicit
relationship between motifs and their variations via representation learning,
using the Siamese network architecture and a pretraining and fine-tuning
pipeline. A regularization-based method, VICReg, is adopted for pretraining,
while contrastive learning is used for fine-tuning. Experimental results on a
retrieval-based task show that these two methods complement each other,
yielding an improvement of 12.6% in the area under the precision-recall curve.
Lastly, we visualize the acquired motif representations, offering an intuitive
comprehension of the overall structure of a music piece. As far as we know,
this work marks a noteworthy step forward in computational modeling of music
motifs. We believe that this work lays the foundations for future applications
of motifs in automatic music composition and music information retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-lingual entity alignment is the task of finding the same semantic
entities from different language knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a
simple and novel unsupervised method for cross-language entity alignment. We
utilize the deep learning multi-language encoder combined with a machine
translator to encode knowledge graph text, which reduces the reliance on label
data. Unlike traditional methods that only emphasize global or local alignment,
our method simultaneously considers both alignment strategies. We first view
the alignment task as a bipartite matching problem and then adopt the
re-exchanging idea to accomplish alignment. Compared with the traditional
bipartite matching algorithm that only gives one optimal solution, our
algorithm generates ranked matching results which enabled many potentials
downstream tasks. Additionally, our method can adapt two different types of
optimization (minimal and maximal) in the bipartite matching process, which
provides more flexibility. Our evaluation shows, we each scored 0.966, 0.990,
and 0.996 Hits@1 rates on the DBP15K dataset in Chinese, Japanese, and French
to English alignment tasks. We outperformed the state-of-the-art method in
unsupervised and semi-supervised categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art
supervised method, our method outperforms 2.6% and 0.4% in Ja-En and Fr-En
alignment tasks while marginally lower by 0.2% in the Zh-En alignment task.

<p class="mathjax">Nonlinear metamaterials with tailored mechanical properties have applications
in engineering, medicine, robotics, and beyond. While modeling their
macromechanical behavior is challenging in itself, finding structure parameters
that lead to ideal approximation of high-level performance goals is a
challenging task. In this work, we propose Neural Metamaterial Networks (NMN)
-- smooth neural representations that encode the nonlinear mechanics of entire
metamaterial families. Given structure parameters as input, NMN return
continuously differentiable strain energy density functions, thus guaranteeing
conservative forces by construction. Though trained on simulation data, NMN do
not inherit the discontinuities resulting from topological changes in finite
element meshes. They instead provide a smooth map from parameter to performance
space that is fully differentiable and thus well-suited for gradient-based
optimization. On this basis, we formulate inverse material design as a
nonlinear programming problem that leverages neural networks for both objective
functions and constraints. We use this approach to automatically design
materials with desired strain-stress curves, prescribed directional stiffness
and Poisson ratio profiles. We furthermore conduct ablation studies on network
nonlinearities and show the advantages of our approach compared to native-scale
optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Quotation extraction is a widely useful task both from a sociological and
from a Natural Language Processing perspective. However, very little data is
available to study this task in languages other than English. In this paper, we
present a manually annotated corpus of 1676 newswire texts in French for
quotation extraction and source attribution. We first describe the composition
of our corpus and the choices that were made in selecting the data. We then
detail the annotation guidelines and annotation process, as well as a few

<p class="mathjax">Ocean renewable energy, particularly wave energy, has emerged as a pivotal
component for diversifying the global energy portfolio, reducing dependence on
fossil fuels, and mitigating climate change impacts. This study delves into the
optimization of power take-off (PTO) parameters and the site selection process
for an offshore oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC). However, the
intrinsic dynamics of these interactions, coupled with the multi-modal nature
of the optimization landscape, make this a daunting challenge. Addressing this,
we introduce the novel Hill Climb - Explorative Gray Wolf Optimizer (HC-EGWO).
This new methodology blends a local search method with a global optimizer,
incorporating dynamic control over exploration and exploitation rates. This
balance paves the way for an enhanced exploration of the solution space,
ensuring the identification of superior-quality solutions. Further anchoring
our approach, a feasibility landscape analysis based on linear water wave
theory assumptions and the flap's maximum angular motion is conducted. This
ensures the optimized OSWEC consistently operates within safety and efficiency
parameters. Our findings hold significant promise for the development of more
streamlined OSWEC power take-off systems. They provide insights for selecting
the prime offshore site, optimizing power output, and bolstering the overall
adoption of ocean renewable energy sources. Impressively, by employing the
HC-EGWO method, we achieved an upswing of up to 3.31% in power output compared
to other methods. This substantial increment underscores the efficacy of our
proposed optimization approach. Conclusively, the outcomes offer invaluable
knowledge for deploying OSWECs in the South Caspian Sea, where unique
environmental conditions intersect with considerable energy potential.

<p class="mathjax">While Federated learning (FL) is attractive for pulling privacy-preserving
distributed training data, the credibility of participating clients and
non-inspectable data pose new security threats, of which poisoning attacks are
particularly rampant and hard to defend without compromising privacy,
performance or other desirable properties of FL. To tackle this problem, we
propose a self-purified FL (SPFL) method that enables benign clients to exploit
trusted historical features of locally purified model to supervise the training
of aggregated model in each iteration. The purification is performed by an
attention-guided self-knowledge distillation where the teacher and student
models are optimized locally for task loss, distillation loss and
attention-based loss simultaneously. SPFL imposes no restriction on the
communication protocol and aggregator at the server. It can work in tandem with
any existing secure aggregation algorithms and protocols for augmented security
and privacy guarantee. We experimentally demonstrate that SPFL outperforms
state-of-the-art FL defenses against various poisoning attacks. The attack
success rate of SPFL trained model is at most 3$\%$ above that of a clean
model, even if the poisoning attack is launched in every iteration with all but
one malicious clients in the system. Meantime, it improves the model quality on
normal inputs compared to FedAvg, either under attack or in the absence of an
attack.

<p class="mathjax">Medical Dialogue Generation serves a critical role in telemedicine by
facilitating the dissemination of medical expertise to patients. Existing
studies focus on incorporating textual representations, which have limited
their ability to represent the semantics of text, such as ignoring important
medical entities. To enhance the model's understanding of the textual semantics
and the medical knowledge including entities and relations, we introduce the
use of Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) to construct graphical
representations that delineate the roles of language constituents and medical
entities within the dialogues. In this paper, We propose a novel framework that
models dialogues between patients and healthcare professionals using AMR
graphs, where the neural networks incorporate textual and graphical knowledge
with a dual attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our framework
outperforms strong baseline models in medical dialogue generation,
demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graphs in enhancing the representations
of medical knowledge and logical relationships. Furthermore, to support future
research in this domain, we provide the corresponding source code at
https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/MedDiaAMR.

<p class="mathjax">Performing inference in statistical models with an intractable likelihood is
challenging, therefore, most likelihood-free inference (LFI) methods encounter
accuracy and efficiency limitations. In this paper, we present the
implementation of the LFI method Robust Optimisation Monte Carlo (ROMC) in the
Python package ELFI. ROMC is a novel and efficient (highly-parallelizable) LFI
framework that provides accurate weighted samples from the posterior. Our
implementation can be used in two ways. First, a scientist may use it as an
out-of-the-box LFI algorithm; we provide an easy-to-use API harmonized with the
principles of ELFI, enabling effortless comparisons with the rest of the
methods included in the package. Additionally, we have carefully split ROMC
into isolated components for supporting extensibility. A researcher may
experiment with novel method(s) for solving part(s) of ROMC without
reimplementing everything from scratch. In both scenarios, the ROMC parts can
run in a fully-parallelized manner, exploiting all CPU cores. We also provide
helpful functionalities for (i) inspecting the inference process and (ii)
evaluating the obtained samples. Finally, we test the robustness of our
implementation on some typical LFI examples.

<p class="mathjax">Marine debris poses a significant threat to the survival of marine wildlife,
often leading to entanglement and starvation, ultimately resulting in death.
Therefore, removing debris from the ocean is crucial to restore the natural
balance and allow marine life to thrive. Instance segmentation is an advanced
form of object detection that identifies objects and precisely locates and
separates them, making it an essential tool for autonomous underwater vehicles
(AUVs) to navigate and interact with their underwater environment effectively.
AUVs use image segmentation to analyze images captured by their cameras to
navigate underwater environments. In this paper, we use instance segmentation
to calculate the area of individual objects within an image, we use YOLOV7 in
Roboflow to generate a set of bounding boxes for each object in the image with
a class label and a confidence score for every detection. A segmentation mask
is then created for each object by applying a binary mask to the object's
bounding box. The masks are generated by applying a binary threshold to the
output of a convolutional neural network trained to segment objects from the
background. Finally, refining the segmentation mask for each object is done by
applying post-processing techniques such as morphological operations and
contour detection, to improve the accuracy and quality of the mask. The process
of estimating the area of instance segmentation involves calculating the area
of each segmented instance separately and then summing up the areas of all
instances to obtain the total area. The calculation is carried out using
standard formulas based on the shape of the object, such as rectangles and
circles. In cases where the object is complex, the Monte Carlo method is used
to estimate the area. This method provides a higher degree of accuracy than
traditional methods, especially when using a large number of samples.

<p class="mathjax">High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data is commonly encountered in big
data-related applications like social network services systems, which are
concerning the limited interactions among numerous nodes. Knowledge acquisition
from HDI data is a vital issue in the domain of data science due to their
embedded rich patterns like node behaviors, where the fundamental task is to
perform HDI data representation learning. Nonnegative Latent Factor Analysis
(NLFA) models have proven to possess the superiority to address this issue,
where a linear bias incorporation (LBI) scheme is important in present the
training overshooting and fluctuation, as well as preventing the model from
premature convergence. However, existing LBI schemes are all statistic ones
where the linear biases are fixed, which significantly restricts the
scalability of the resultant NLFA model and results in loss of representation
learning ability to HDI data. Motivated by the above discoveries, this paper
innovatively presents the dynamic linear bias incorporation (DLBI) scheme. It
firstly extends the linear bias vectors into matrices, and then builds a binary
weight matrix to switch the active/inactive states of the linear biases. The
weight matrix's each entry switches between the binary states dynamically
corresponding to the linear bias value variation, thereby establishing the
dynamic linear biases for an NLFA model. Empirical studies on three HDI
datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed DLBI-based NLFA
model obtains higher representation accuracy several than state-of-the-art
models do, as well as highly-competitive computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Domain adaptation (DA) has been widely applied in the diabetic retinopathy
(DR) grading of unannotated ultra-wide-field (UWF) fundus images, which can
transfer annotated knowledge from labeled color fundus images. However,
suffering from huge domain gaps and complex real-world scenarios, the DR
grading performance of most mainstream DA is far from that of clinical
diagnosis. To tackle this, we propose a novel source-free active domain
adaptation (SFADA) in this paper. Specifically, we focus on DR grading problem
itself and propose to generate features of color fundus images with
continuously evolving relationships of DRs, actively select a few valuable UWF
fundus images for labeling with local representation matching, and adapt model
on UWF fundus images with DR lesion prototypes. Notably, the SFADA also takes
data privacy and computational efficiency into consideration. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFADA achieves
state-of-the-art DR grading performance, increasing accuracy by 20.9% and
quadratic weighted kappa by 18.63% compared with baseline and reaching 85.36%
and 92.38% respectively. These investigations show that the potential of our
approach for real clinical practice is promising.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately assessing the potential value of new sensor observations is a
critical aspect of planning for active perception. This task is particularly
challenging when reasoning about high-level scene understanding using
measurements from vision-based neural networks. Due to appearance-based
reasoning, the measurements are susceptible to several environmental effects
such as the presence of occluders, variations in lighting conditions, and
redundancy of information due to similarity in appearance between nearby
viewpoints. To address this, we propose a new active perception framework
incorporating an arbitrary number of perceptual effects in planning and fusion.
Our method models the correlation with the environment by a set of general
functions termed perceptual factors to construct a perceptual map, which
quantifies the aggregated influence of the environment on candidate viewpoints.
This information is seamlessly incorporated into the planning and fusion
processes by adjusting the uncertainty associated with measurements to weigh
their contributions. We evaluate our perceptual maps in a simulated environment
that reproduces environmental conditions common in robotics applications. Our
results show that, by accounting for environmental effects within our
perceptual maps, we improve in the state estimation by correctly selecting the
viewpoints and considering the measurement noise correctly when affected by
environmental factors. We furthermore deploy our approach on a ground robot to
showcase its applicability for real-world active perception missions.

<p class="mathjax">Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a
searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to
capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback
on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a
large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with
third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of
low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve
quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user
studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically
disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging
guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate
approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real
users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that
can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with
that data.
<br />We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for
large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We
have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as
human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs,
and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in
accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real
searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that
models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the
cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.

<p class="mathjax">Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRA) are promising edge accelerators
due to the outstanding balance in flexibility, performance, and energy
efficiency. Classic CGRAs statically map compute operations onto the processing
elements (PE) and route the data dependencies among the operations through the
Network-on-Chip. However, CGRAs are designed for fine-grained static
instruction-level parallelism and struggle to accelerate applications with
dynamic and irregular data-level parallelism, such as graph processing. To
address this limitation, we present Flip, a novel accelerator that enhances
traditional CGRA architectures to boost the performance of graph applications.
Flip retains the classic CGRA execution model while introducing a special
data-centric mode for efficient graph processing. Specifically, it exploits the
natural data parallelism of graph algorithms by mapping graph vertices onto
processing elements (PEs) rather than the operations, and supporting dynamic
routing of temporary data according to the runtime evolution of the graph
frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that Flip achieves up to 36$\times$
speedup with merely 19% more area compared to classic CGRAs. Compared to
state-of-the-art large-scale graph processors, Flip has similar energy
efficiency and 2.2$\times$ better area efficiency at a much-reduced power/area
budget.

<p class="mathjax">Underlayer networks in the context of 6G for manufacturing are crucial. They
address the evolving needs of highly interconnected and autonomous systems in
industry. The digitalization of manufacturing processes, driven by the Internet
of Things and increased data availability, enables more efficient and
demand-driven production. However, wireless connectivity, which offers
flexibility and easy integration of components, comes with challenges such as
signal interference or high latency. A new management system is needed to
coordinate and route traffic of multiple networks in a specific coverage area.
This paper proposes underlayer networks designed for manufacturing, providing
low latency, reliability, and security. These networks enable wireless
connectivity and integration of wireless technologies into the manufacturing
environment, enhancing flexibility and efficiency. The paper also discusses
network slicing, spectrum sharing, and the limitations of current wireless
networks in manufacturing. It introduces a network concept for underlayer
networks and evaluates its application in closed-loop communication for machine
tools. The study concludes with future research prospects in this area.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we explore the influence of entropy change in deep learning
systems by adding noise to the inputs/latent features. The applications in this
paper focus on deep learning tasks within computer vision, but the proposed
theory can be further applied to other fields. Noise is conventionally viewed
as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as
different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning.
However, this paper aims to rethink whether the conventional proposition always
holds. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various
deep architectures under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the
enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined
by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain
in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information
entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two
types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise
can help reduce the complexity of the task. Extensive experiments of CNNs and
ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive
noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of over 95% on
ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that
the presence of positive noise can benefit the learning process, while the
traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The
different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific
tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it
reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via
information entropy change.

<p class="mathjax">The work presented herein has been conducted within the DLR internal research
project HorizonUAM, which encompasses research within numerous areas related to
urban air mobility. One of the project goals was to develop a safe and
certifiable onboard system concept. This paper aims to present the conceptual
propulsion system architecture design for an all-electric battery-powered
multirotor electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle. Therefore, a
conceptual design method was developed that provides a structured approach for
designing the safe multirotor propulsion architecture. Based on the concept of
operation the powertrain system was initially predefined, iteratively refined
based on the safety assessment and validated through component sizing and
simulations. The analysis was conducted within three system groups that were
developed in parallel: the drivetrain, the energy supply and the thermal
management system. The design process indicated that a pure quadcopter
propulsion system can merely be designed reasonably for meeting the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reliability specifications. By adding two
push propellers and implementing numerous safety as well as passivation
measures the reliability specifications defined by EASA could finally be
fulfilled. The subsequent system simulations also verified that the system
architecture is capable of meeting the requirements of the vehicle concept of
operations. However, further work is required to extend the safety analysis to
additional system components as the thermal management system or the battery
management system and to reduce propulsion system weight.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we provide a geometric interpretation of the structure of Deep
Learning (DL) networks, characterized by $L$ hidden layers, a ramp activation
function, an ${\mathcal L}^2$ Schatten class (or Hilbert-Schmidt) cost
function, and input and output spaces ${\mathbb R}^Q$ with equal dimension
$Q\geq1$. The hidden layers are defined on spaces ${\mathbb R}^{Q}$, as well.
We apply our recent results on shallow neural networks to construct an explicit
family of minimizers for the global minimum of the cost function in the case
$L\geq Q$, which we show to be degenerate. In the context presented here, the
hidden layers of the DL network "curate" the training inputs by recursive
application of a truncation map that minimizes the noise to signal ratio of the
training inputs. Moreover, we determine a set of $2^Q-1$ distinct degenerate
local minima of the cost function.

<p class="mathjax">Kinship verification is an emerging task in computer vision with multiple
potential applications. However, there's no large enough kinship dataset to
train a representative and robust model, which is a limitation for achieving
better performance. Moreover, face verification is known to exhibit bias, which
has not been dealt with by previous kinship verification works and sometimes
even results in serious issues. So we first combine existing kinship datasets
and label each identity with the correct race in order to take race information
into consideration and provide a larger and complete dataset, called KinRace
dataset. Secondly, we propose a multi-task learning model structure with
attention module to enhance accuracy, which surpasses state-of-the-art
performance. Lastly, our fairness-aware contrastive loss function with
adversarial learning greatly mitigates racial bias. We introduce a debias term
into traditional contrastive loss and implement gradient reverse in race
classification task, which is an innovative idea to mix two fairness methods to
alleviate bias. Exhaustive experimental evaluation demonstrates the
effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed KFC in both standard
deviation and accuracy at the same time.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has been widely used in source code classification tasks, such
as code classification according to their functionalities, code authorship
attribution, and vulnerability detection. Unfortunately, the black-box nature
of deep learning makes it hard to interpret and understand why a classifier
(i.e., classification model) makes a particular prediction on a given example.
This lack of interpretability (or explainability) might have hindered their
adoption by practitioners because it is not clear when they should or should
not trust a classifier's prediction. The lack of interpretability has motivated
a number of studies in recent years. However, existing methods are neither
robust nor able to cope with out-of-distribution examples. In this paper, we
propose a novel method to produce \underline{Rob}ust \underline{in}terpreters
for a given deep learning-based code classifier; the method is dubbed Robin.
The key idea behind Robin is a novel hybrid structure combining an interpreter
and two approximators, while leveraging the ideas of adversarial training and
data augmentation. Experimental results show that on average the interpreter
produced by Robin achieves a 6.11\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the
classifier), 67.22\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the approximator), and
15.87x higher robustness than that of the three existing interpreters we
evaluated. Moreover, the interpreter is 47.31\% less affected by
out-of-distribution examples than that of LEMNA.

<p class="mathjax">Cellular traffic prediction is a crucial activity for optimizing networks in
fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond, as accurate forecasting is essential
for intelligent network design, resource allocation and anomaly mitigation.
Although machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to effectively predict
network traffic, the centralization of massive data in a single data center
raises issues regarding confidentiality, privacy and data transfer demands. To
address these challenges, federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing ML
training framework which offers high accurate predictions through parallel
distributed computations. However, the environmental impact of these methods is
often overlooked, which calls into question their sustainability. In this
paper, we address the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption in FL
by proposing a novel sustainability indicator that allows assessing the
feasibility of ML models. Then, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art
deep learning (DL) architectures in a federated scenario using real-world
measurements from base station (BS) sites in the area of Barcelona, Spain. Our
findings indicate that larger ML models achieve marginally improved performance
but have a significant environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, which
make them impractical for real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">Current state-of-the-art point cloud-based perception methods usually rely on
large-scale labeled data, which requires expensive manual annotations. A
natural option is to explore the unsupervised methodology for 3D perception
tasks. However, such methods often face substantial performance-drop
difficulties. Fortunately, we found that there exist amounts of image-based
datasets and an alternative can be proposed, i.e., transferring the knowledge
in the 2D images to 3D point clouds. Specifically, we propose a novel approach
for the challenging cross-modal and cross-domain adaptation task by fully
exploring the relationship between images and point clouds and designing
effective feature alignment strategies. Without any 3D labels, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation
on SemanticKITTI by using the knowledge of KITTI360 and GTA5, compared to
existing unsupervised and weakly-supervised baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Whole Slide Images (WSIs) present a challenging computer vision task due to
their gigapixel size and presence of numerous artefacts. Yet they are a
valuable resource for patient diagnosis and stratification, often representing
the gold standard for diagnostic tasks. Real-world clinical datasets tend to
come as sets of heterogeneous WSIs with labels present at the patient-level,
with poor to no annotations. Weakly supervised attention-based multiple
instance learning approaches have been developed in recent years to address
these challenges, but can fail to resolve both long and short-range
dependencies. Here we propose an end-to-end multi-stain self-attention graph
(MUSTANG) multiple instance learning pipeline, which is designed to solve a
weakly-supervised gigapixel multi-image classification task, where the label is
assigned at the patient-level, but no slide-level labels or region annotations
are available. The pipeline uses a self-attention based approach by restricting
the operations to a highly sparse k-Nearest Neighbour Graph of embedded WSI
patches based on the Euclidean distance. We show this approach achieves a
state-of-the-art F1-score/AUC of 0.89/0.92, outperforming the widely used CLAM
model. Our approach is highly modular and can easily be modified to suit
different clinical datasets, as it only requires a patient-level label without
annotations and accepts WSI sets of different sizes, as the graphs can be of
varying sizes and structures. The source code can be found at
https://github.com/AmayaGS/MUSTANG.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a discrete formulation of nonlinear shear- and
torsion-free rods based on \cite{gebhardt_2021_beam} that uses isogeometric
discretization and robust time integration. Omitting the director as an
independent variable field, we reduce the number of degrees of freedom and
obtain discrete solutions in multiple copies of the Euclidean space
$\left(\mathbb{R}^3\right)$, which is larger than the corresponding multiple
copies of the manifold $\left(\mathbb{R}^3 \cross S^2\right)$ obtained with
standard Hermite finite elements. For implicit time integration, we choose a
hybrid form of the mid-point rule and the trapezoidal rule that preserves the
linear angular momentum exactly and approximates the energy accurately. In
addition, we apply a recently introduced approach for outlier removal
\cite{hiemstra_outlier_2021} that reduces high-frequency content in the
response without affecting the accuracy, ensuring robustness of our nonlinear
discrete formulation. We illustrate the efficiency of our nonlinear discrete
formulation for static and transient rods under different loading conditions,
demonstrating good accuracy in space, time and the frequency domain. Our
numerical example coincides with a relevant application case, the simulation of
mooring lines.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in natural
language processing tasks within the financial domain. In this work, we present
a Chinese Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformer framework, named CFGPT,
which includes a dataset~(CFData) for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning,
a financial LLM~(CFLLM) to adeptly manage financial texts, and a deployment
framework~(CFAPP) designed to navigate real-world financial applications. The
CFData comprising both a pre-training dataset and a supervised fine-tuning
dataset, where the pre-training dataset collates Chinese financial data and
analytics, alongside a smaller subset of general-purpose text with 584M
documents and 141B tokens in total, and the supervised fine-tuning dataset is
tailored for six distinct financial tasks, embodying various facets of
financial analysis and decision-making with 1.5M instruction pairs and 1.5B
tokens in total. The CFLLM, which is based on InternLM-7B to balance the model
capability and size, is trained on CFData in two stage, continued pre-training
and supervised fine-tuning. The CFAPP is centered on large language models
(LLMs) and augmented with additional modules to ensure multifaceted
functionality in real-world application. Our codes are released at

<p class="mathjax">Generating a smooth and shorter spiral complete coverage path in a
multi-connected domain is an important research area in robotic cavity
machining. Traditional spiral path planning methods in multi-connected domains
involve a subregion division procedure; a deformed spiral path is incorporated
within each subregion, and these paths within the subregions are interconnected
with bridges. In intricate domains with abundant voids and irregular
boundaries, the added subregion boundaries increase the path avoidance
requirements. This results in excessive bridging and necessitates longer
uneven-density spirals to achieve complete subregion coverage. Considering that
conformal slit mapping can transform multi-connected regions into regular disks
or annuluses without subregion division, this paper presents a novel spiral
complete coverage path planning method by conformal slit mapping. Firstly, a
slit mapping calculation technique is proposed for segmented cubic spline
boundaries with corners. Then, a spiral path spacing control method is
developed based on the maximum inscribed circle radius between adjacent
conformal slit mapping iso-parameters. Lastly, the spiral path is derived by
offsetting iso-parameters. The complexity and applicability of the proposed
method are comprehensively analyzed across various boundary scenarios.
Meanwhile, two cavities milling experiments are conducted to compare the new
method with conventional spiral complete coverage path methods. The comparation
indicate that the new path meets the requirement for complete coverage in
cavity machining while reducing path length and machining time by 12.70% and
12.34%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the growing availability of sensing and data in general, we remain
unable to fully characterise many in-service engineering systems and structures
from a purely data-driven approach. The vast data and resources available to
capture human activity are unmatched in our engineered world, and, even in
cases where data could be referred to as ``big,'' they will rarely hold
information across operational windows or life spans. This paper pursues the
combination of machine learning technology and physics-based reasoning to
enhance our ability to make predictive models with limited data. By explicitly
linking the physics-based view of stochastic processes with a data-based
regression approach, a spectrum of possible Gaussian process models are
introduced that enable the incorporation of different levels of expert
knowledge of a system. Examples illustrate how these approaches can
significantly reduce reliance on data collection whilst also increasing the
interpretability of the model, another important consideration in this context.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring safety in dynamic multi-agent systems is challenging due to limited
information about the other agents. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are
showing promise for safety assurance but current methods make strong
assumptions about other agents and often rely on manual tuning to balance
safety, feasibility, and performance. In this work, we delve into the problem
of adaptive safe learning for multi-agent systems with CBF. We show how
emergent behavior can be profoundly influenced by the CBF configuration,
highlighting the necessity for a responsive and dynamic approach to CBF design.
We present ASRL, a novel adaptive safe RL framework, to fully automate the
optimization of policy and CBF coefficients, to enhance safety and long-term
performance through reinforcement learning. By directly interacting with the
other agents, ASRL learns to cope with diverse agent behaviours and maintains
the cost violations below a desired limit. We evaluate ASRL in a multi-robot
system and a competitive multi-agent racing scenario, against learning-based
and control-theoretic approaches. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy and
flexibility of ASRL, and assess generalization and scalability to
out-of-distribution scenarios. Code and supplementary material are public
online.

<p class="mathjax">Various time variant non-stationary signals need to be pre-processed properly
in hydrological time series forecasting in real world, for example, predictions
of water level. Decomposition method is a good candidate and widely used in
such a pre-processing problem. However, decomposition methods with an
inappropriate sampling technique may introduce future data which is not
available in practical applications, and result in incorrect
decomposition-based forecasting models. In this work, a novel Fully Stepwise
Decomposition-Based (FSDB) sampling technique is well designed for the
decomposition-based forecasting model, strictly avoiding introducing future
information. This sampling technique with decomposition methods, such as
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Singular spectrum analysis (SSA), is
applied to predict water level time series in three different stations of
Guoyang and Chaohu basins in China. Results of VMD-based hybrid model using
FSDB sampling technique show that Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient
is increased by 6.4%, 28.8% and 7.0% in three stations respectively, compared
with those obtained from the currently most advanced sampling technique. In the
meantime, for series of SSA-based experiments, NSE is increased by 3.2%, 3.1%
and 1.1% respectively. We conclude that the newly developed FSDB sampling
technique can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition-based hybrid
model in water level time series forecasting in real world.

<p class="mathjax">The replacement of fossil fuels in combination with an increasing share of
renewable energy sources leads to an increased focus on decentralized
microgrids. One option is the local production of green hydrogen in combination
with fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). In this paper, we develop a control strategy
based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for an energy management system (EMS)
of a hydrogen plant, which is currently under installation in Offenbach,
Germany. The plant includes an electrolyzer, a compressor, a low pressure
storage tank, and six medium pressure storage tanks with complex heuristic
physical coupling during the filling and extraction of hydrogen. Since these
heuristics are too complex to be incorporated into the optimal control problem
(OCP) explicitly, we propose a novel approach to do so implicitly. First, the
MPC is executed without considering them. Then, the so-called allocator uses a
heuristic model (of arbitrary complexity) to verify whether the MPC's plan is
valid. If not, it introduces additional constraints to the MPC's OCP to
implicitly respect the tanks' pressure levels. The MPC is executed again and
the new plan is applied to the plant. Simulation results with real-world
measurement data of the facility's energy management and realistic fueling
scenarios show its advantages over rule-based control.

<p class="mathjax">Democratizing access to natural language processing (NLP) technology is
crucial, especially for underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages.
Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for
these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these
methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified
limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and
cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case
study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online
scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in
constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through
paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of
lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the
\datasetname{} benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely
low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. Our
empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models
conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages. We
release the NusaWrites dataset at https://github.com/IndoNLP/nusa-writes.

<p class="mathjax">We revisit the a priori TSP (with independent activation) and prove stronger
approximation guarantees than were previously known. In the a priori TSP, we
are given a metric space $(V,c)$ and an activation probability $p(v)$ for each
customer $v\in V$. We ask for a TSP tour $T$ for $V$ that minimizes the
expected length after cutting $T$ short by skipping the inactive customers. All
known approximation algorithms select a nonempty subset $S$ of the customers
and construct a master route solution, consisting of a TSP tour for $S$ and two
edges connecting every customer $v\in V\setminus S$ to a nearest customer in
$S$. We address the following questions. If we randomly sample the subset $S$,
what should be the sampling probabilities? How much worse than the optimum can
the best master route solution be? The answers to these questions (we provide
almost matching lower and upper bounds) lead to improved approximation
guarantees: less than 3.1 with randomized sampling, and less than 5.9 with a
deterministic polynomial-time algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">An auditable register extends the classical register with an audit operation
that returns information on the read operations performed on the register. In
this paper, we study Byzantine resilient auditable register implementations in
an asynchronous message-passing system. Existing solutions implement the
auditable register on top of at least 4f+1 servers, where at most $f$ can be
Byzantine. We show that 4f+1 servers are necessary to implement auditability
without communication between servers, or implement does not implement strong
auditability when relaxing the constraint on the servers' communication,
letting them interact with each other. In this setting, it exists a solution
using 3f+1 servers to implement a simple auditable atomic register. In this
work, we implement strong auditable register using 3f+1 servers with server to
server communication, this result reinforced that with communication between
servers, auditability (event strong auditability) does not come with an
additional cost in terms of the number of servers.

<p class="mathjax">We present Fast-dRRT*, a sampling-based multi-robot planner, for real-time
industrial automation scenarios. Fast-dRRT* builds upon the discrete
rapidly-exploring random tree (dRRT*) planner, and extends dRRT* by using
pre-computed swept volumes for efficient collision detection, deadlock
avoidance for partial multi-robot problems, and a simplified rewiring strategy.
We evaluate Fast-dRRT* on five challenging multi-robot scenarios using two to
four industrial robot arms from various manufacturers. The scenarios comprise
situations involving deadlocks, narrow passages, and close proximity tasks. The
results are compared against dRRT*, and show Fast-dRRT* to outperform dRRT* by
up to 94% in terms of finding solutions within given time limits, while only
sacrificing up to 35% on initial solution cost. Furthermore, Fast-dRRT*
demonstrates resilience against noise in target configurations, and is able to
solve challenging welding, and pick and place tasks with reduced computational
time. This makes Fast-dRRT* a promising option for real-time motion planning in
industrial automation.

<p class="mathjax">We focus on the task of soundscape mapping, which involves predicting the
most probable sounds that could be perceived at a particular geographic
location. We utilise recent state-of-the-art models to encode geotagged audio,
a textual description of the audio, and an overhead image of its capture
location using contrastive pre-training. The end result is a shared embedding
space for the three modalities, which enables the construction of soundscape
maps for any geographic region from textual or audio queries. Using the
SoundingEarth dataset, we find that our approach significantly outperforms the
existing SOTA, with an improvement of image-to-audio Recall@100 from 0.256 to
0.450. Our code is available at https://github.com/mvrl/geoclap.

<p class="mathjax">It has long been established that predictive models can be transformed into
lossless compressors and vice versa. Incidentally, in recent years, the machine
learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful
self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit
impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong
compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem
through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of
large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful
general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel
insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example,
Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to
43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating
domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.
Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use
any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing is gaining traction as an attractive model for the
deployment of a multitude of workloads in the cloud. Designing and building
effective resource management solutions for any computing environment requires
extensive long term testing, experimentation and analysis of the achieved
performance metrics. Utilizing real test beds and serverless platforms for such
experimentation work is often times not possible due to resource, time and cost
constraints. Thus, employing simulators to model these environments is key to
overcoming the challenge of examining the viability of such novel ideas for
resource management. Existing simulation software developed for serverless
environments lack generalizibility in terms of their architecture as well as
the various aspects of resource management, where most are purely focused on
modeling function performance under a specific platform architecture. In
contrast, we have developed a serverless simulation model with induced
flexibility in its architecture as well as the key resource management aspects
of function scheduling and scaling. Further, we incorporate techniques for
easily deriving monitoring metrics required for evaluating any implemented
solutions by users. Our work is presented as CloudSimSC, a modular extension to
CloudSim which is a simulator tool extensively used for modeling cloud
environments by the research community. We discuss the implemented features in
our simulation tool using multiple use cases.

<p class="mathjax">Robots often have to operate in discrete partially observable worlds, where
the states of world are only observable at runtime. To react to different world
states, robots need contingencies. However, computing contingencies is costly
and often non-optimal. To address this problem, we develop the improved path
tree optimization (PTO) method. PTO computes motion contingencies by
constructing a tree of motion paths in belief space. This is achieved by
constructing a graph of configurations, then adding observation edges to extend
the graph to belief space. Afterwards, we use a dynamic programming step to
extract the path tree. PTO extends prior work by adding a camera-based state
sampler to improve the search for observation points. We also add support to
non-euclidean state spaces, provide an implementation in the open motion
planning library (OMPL), and evaluate PTO on four realistic scenarios with a
virtual camera in up to 10-dimensional state spaces. We compare PTO with a
default and with the new camera-based state sampler. The results indicate that
the camera-based state sampler improves success rates in 3 out of 4 scenarios
while having a significant lower memory footprint. This makes PTO an important
contribution to advance the state-of-the-art for discrete belief space
planning.

<p class="mathjax">Speaker extraction and diarization are two crucial enabling techniques for
speech applications. Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's
voice from a multi-talk mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech
segments by speaker, identifying `who spoke when'. The previous studies have
typically treated the two tasks independently. However, the two tasks share a
similar objective, that is to disentangle the speakers in the spectral domain
for the former but in the temporal domain for the latter. It is logical to
believe that the speaker turns obtained from speaker diarization can benefit
speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker
turns than the mixture speech. In this paper, we propose a unified framework
called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED). We extend the
existing speaker extraction model to simultaneously extract the waveforms of
all speakers. We also employ a scenario-aware differentiated loss function to
address the problem of sparsely overlapped speech in real-world conversations.
We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the baselines for both
speaker extraction and diarization tasks, in both highly overlapped and
sparsely overlapped scenarios. Audio samples are available at
https://ajyy.github.io/demo/USED/.

<p class="mathjax">Data contamination in model evaluation is getting increasingly prevalent as
the massive training corpora of large language models often unintentionally
include benchmark samples. Therefore, contamination analysis has became an
inevitable part of reliable model evaluation. However, existing method of
contamination analysis requires the access of the entire training data which is
often confidential for recent models. This prevent the community to rigorously
audit these models and conduct accurate assessment of their capability. In this
paper, we propose a novel method to quantify contamination without the access
of the full training set, that measure the extent of contamination with
perplexity. Our analysis provides evidence of significant memorisation of
recent foundation models in popular reading comprehension, summarisation

used for law enforcement. For example, one can think of software that computes
fines like tachograph software, software that prepares evidence like DNA
sequencing software or social profiling software to patrol in high-risk zones,
among others. An important difference between a legal human agent and a
software application lies in possible dialogues. A human agent can be
interrogated to motivate her decisions. Often such dialogues with software are
at the best extremely hard but mostly impossible. We observe that the absence
of a dialogue can sincerely violate civil rights and legal principles like, for
example, Transparency or Contestability. Thus, possible dialogues with legal
algorithms are at the least highly desirable. Futuristic as this may sound, we
observe that in various realms of formal methods, such dialogues are easily
obtainable. However, this triggers the usual tension between the expressibility
of the dialogue language and the feasibility of the corresponding computations.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous flight in unknown environments requires precise planning for both
the spatial and temporal profiles of trajectories, which generally involves
nonconvex optimization, leading to high time costs and susceptibility to local
optima. To address these limitations, we introduce the Learning-Initialized
Trajectory Planner (LIT-Planner), a novel approach that guides optimization
using a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide initial values. We first
leverage the spatial-temporal optimization with batch sampling to generate
training cases, aiming to capture multimodality in trajectories. Based on these
data, the NN-Planner maps visual and inertial observations to trajectory
parameters for handling unknown environments. The network outputs are then
optimized to enhance both reliability and explainability, ensuring robust
performance. Furthermore, we propose a framework that supports robust online
replanning with tolerance to planning latency. Comprehensive simulations
validate the LIT-Planner's time efficiency without compromising trajectory
quality compared to optimization-based methods. Real-world experiments further
demonstrate its practical suitability for autonomous drone navigation.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying stylization
on 3D scenes from a reference style image, in particular onto neural radiance
fields (NeRF). While performing stylization directly on NeRF guarantees
appearance consistency over arbitrary novel views, it is a challenging problem
to guide the transfer of patterns from the style image onto different parts of
the NeRF scene. In this work, we propose a stylization framework for NeRF based
on local style transfer. In particular, we use a hash-grid encoding to learn
the embedding of the appearance and geometry components, and show that the
mapping defined by the hash table allows us to control the stylization to a
certain extent. Stylization is then achieved by optimizing the appearance
branch while keeping the geometry branch fixed. To support local style
transfer, we propose a new loss function that utilizes a segmentation network
and bipartite matching to establish region correspondences between the style
image and the content images obtained from volume rendering. Our experiments
show that our method yields plausible stylization results with novel view
synthesis while having flexible controllability via manipulating and
customizing the region correspondences.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an interval extension of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) called
Interval Signal Temporal Logic (I-STL). Given an STL formula, we consider an
interval inclusion function for each of its predicates. Then, we use minimal
inclusion functions for the $\min$ and $\max$ functions to recursively build an
interval robustness that is a natural inclusion function for the robustness of
the original STL formula. The resulting interval semantics accommodate, for
example, uncertain signals modeled as a signal of intervals and uncertain
predicates modeled with appropriate inclusion functions. In many cases,
verification or synthesis algorithms developed for STL apply to I-STL with
minimal theoretic and algorithmic changes, and existing code can be readily
extended using interval arithmetic packages at negligible computational
expense. To demonstrate I-STL, we present an example of offline monitoring from
an uncertain signal trace obtained from a hardware experiment and an example of
robust online control synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models primarily rely on incontext learning to execute tasks.
We introduce EchoPrompt, a simple yet effective approach to prompt the model to
rephrase its queries before answering them. EchoPrompt is inspired by
self-questioning, a cognitive strategy humans use to vocalize queries before
providing answers, thereby reducing misconceptions. Experimental results
demonstrate that EchoPrompt leads to substantial improvements in both zero-shot
and few-shot in-context learning with standard and chain-of-thought prompting
on four families of causal language models. These improvements are observed
across various numerical reasoning (GSM8K, SVAMP, MultiArith, SingleOp),
reading comprehension (DROP, SQuAD), and logical reasoning (Shuffled Objects,
Date Understanding, Coin Flipping) tasks. On average, EchoPrompt improves the
Zero-shot-CoT performance of code-davinci-002 by 5% in numerical tasks and 13%
in reading comprehension tasks. We investigate the effectiveness of EchoPrompt
through ablation studies, which reveal the significance of both original and
rephrased queries for EchoPrompt's efficacy. Our empirical results show that
EchoPrompt is an effective technique that can easily augment in-context
learning for better performance.

<p class="mathjax">Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose
key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, novel view synthesis from a single image has seen
significant progress thanks to the rapid advancements in 3D scene
representation and image inpainting techniques. While the current approaches
are able to synthesize geometrically consistent novel views, they often do not
handle the view-dependent effects properly. Specifically, the highlights in
their synthesized images usually appear to be glued to the surfaces, making the
novel views unrealistic. To address this major problem, we make a key
observation that the process of synthesizing novel views requires changing the
shading of the pixels based on the novel camera, and moving them to appropriate
locations. Therefore, we propose to split the view synthesis process into two
independent tasks of pixel reshading and relocation. During the reshading
process, we take the single image as the input and adjust its shading based on
the novel camera. This reshaded image is then used as the input to an existing
view synthesis method to relocate the pixels and produce the final novel view
image. We propose to use a neural network to perform reshading and generate a
large set of synthetic input-reshaded pairs to train our network. We
demonstrate that our approach produces plausible novel view images with
realistic moving highlights on a variety of real world scenes.

<p class="mathjax">To solve complex tasks, large language models (LLMs) often require multiple
rounds of interactions with the user, sometimes assisted by external tools.
However, current evaluation paradigms often focus solely on benchmark
performance with single-turn exchanges, neglecting the intricate interactions
among the user, LLMs, and external tools, creating a discrepancy between
benchmark evaluation and real-world use cases. We introduce MINT benchmark to
evaluate LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn interactions by (1) using
tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback. To ensure reproducibility,
we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can access tools by executing
Python code and receive natural language feedback from the user simulated with
GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established datasets and tasks focusing on
reasoning, coding, and decision-making and carefully curate them into a compact
subset of instances for efficient evaluation. Our analysis of 20 open- and
closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (1) LLMs generally benefit from
tool interactions and language feedback, with performance gains (absolute, same
below) of 1--8% per additional turn with tool use and 2--17% with natural
language feedback. (2) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better
multi-turn performance. (3) Surprisingly, on LLMs we evaluated, we found
supervised instruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We hope MINT can help
measure progress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in
multi-turn interactions, especially for open-source communities where
multi-turn human evaluation has been less accessible compared to commercial
LLMs with a larger user base.

<p class="mathjax">The rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted
discussions in academic circles, with students exploring LLM-based tools for
coursework inquiries and instructors exploring them for teaching and research.
Even though a lot of work is underway to create LLM-based tools tailored for
students and instructors, there is a lack of comprehensive user studies that
capture the perspectives of students and instructors regarding LLMs. This paper
addresses this gap by conducting surveys and interviews within undergraduate
engineering universities in India. Using 1306 survey responses among students,
112 student interviews, and 27 instructor interviews around the academic usage
of ChatGPT (a popular LLM), this paper offers insights into the current usage
patterns, perceived benefits, threats, and challenges, as well as
recommendations for enhancing the adoption of LLMs among students and
instructors. These insights are further utilized to discuss the practical
implications of LLMs in undergraduate engineering education and beyond.

<p class="mathjax">The number and arrangement of sensors on an autonomous mobile robot
dramatically influence its perception capabilities. Ensuring that sensors are
mounted in a manner that enables accurate detection, localization, and mapping
is essential for the success of downstream control tasks. However, when
designing a new robotic platform, researchers and practitioners alike usually
mimic standard configurations or maximize simple heuristics like field-of-view
(FOV) coverage to decide where to place exteroceptive sensors. In this work, we
conduct an information-theoretic investigation of this overlooked element of
mobile robotic perception in the context of simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM). We show how to formalize the sensor arrangement problem as a
form of subset selection under the E-optimality performance criterion. While
this formulation is NP-hard in general, we further show that a combination of
greedy sensor selection and fast convex relaxation-based post-hoc verification
enables the efficient recovery of certifiably optimal sensor designs in
practice. Results from synthetic experiments reveal that sensors placed with
OASIS outperform benchmarks in terms of mean squared error of visual SLAM
estimates.

<p class="mathjax">Decision making under uncertainty is at the heart of any autonomous system
acting with imperfect information. The cost of solving the decision making
problem is exponential in the action and observation spaces, thus rendering it
unfeasible for many online systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to
efficient decision-making, by partitioning the high-dimensional observation
space. Using the partitioned observation space, we formulate analytical bounds
on the expected information-theoretic reward, for general belief distributions.
These bounds are then used to plan efficiently while keeping performance
guarantees. We show that the bounds are adaptive, computationally efficient,
and that they converge to the original solution. We extend the partitioning
paradigm and present a hierarchy of partitioned spaces that allows greater
efficiency in planning. We then propose a specific variant of these bounds for
Gaussian beliefs and show a theoretical performance improvement of at least a
factor of 4. Finally, we compare our novel method to other state of the art
algorithms in active SLAM scenarios, in simulation and in real experiments. In
both cases we show a significant speed-up in planning with performance
guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Verifying the performance of safety-critical, stochastic systems with complex
noise distributions is difficult. We introduce a general procedure for the
finite abstraction of nonlinear stochastic systems with non-standard (e.g.,
non-affine, non-symmetric, non-unimodal) noise distributions for verification
purposes. The method uses a finite partitioning of the noise domain to
construct an interval Markov chain (IMC) abstraction of the system via
transition probability intervals. Noise partitioning allows for a general class
of distributions and structures, including multiplicative and mixture models,
and admits both known and data-driven systems. The partitions required for
optimal transition bounds are specified for systems that are monotonic with
respect to the noise, and explicit partitions are provided for affine and
multiplicative structures. By the soundness of the abstraction procedure,
verification on the IMC provides guarantees on the stochastic system against a
temporal logic specification. In addition, we present a novel refinement-free
algorithm that improves the verification results. Case studies on linear and
nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian noise, including a data-driven example,
demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the method without introducing
excessive conservatism.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-grained open-set recognition (FineOSR) aims to recognize images
belonging to classes with subtle appearance differences while rejecting images
of unknown classes. A recent trend in OSR shows the benefit of generative
models to discriminative unknown detection. As a type of generative model,
energy-based models (EBM) are the potential for hybrid modeling of generative
and discriminative tasks. However, most existing EBMs suffer from density
estimation in high-dimensional space, which is critical to recognizing images
from fine-grained classes. In this paper, we explore the low-dimensional latent
space with energy-based prior distribution for OSR in a fine-grained visual
world. Specifically, based on the latent space EBM, we propose an
attribute-aware information bottleneck (AIB), a residual attribute feature
aggregation (RAFA) module, and an uncertainty-based virtual outlier synthesis
(UVOS) module to improve the expressivity, granularity, and density of the
samples in fine-grained classes, respectively. Our method is flexible to take
advantage of recent vision transformers for powerful visual classification and
generation. The method is validated on both fine-grained and general visual
classification datasets while preserving the capability of generating
photo-realistic fake images with high resolution.

<p class="mathjax">There has been a debate about the superiority between vision Transformers and
ConvNets, serving as the backbone of computer vision models. Although they are
usually considered as two completely different architectures, in this paper, we
interpret vision Transformers as ConvNets with dynamic convolutions, which
enables us to characterize existing Transformers and dynamic ConvNets in a
unified framework and compare their design choices side by side. In addition,
our interpretation can also guide the network design as researchers now can
consider vision Transformers from the design space of ConvNets and vice versa.
We demonstrate such potential through two specific studies. First, we inspect
the role of softmax in vision Transformers as the activation function and find
it can be replaced by commonly used ConvNets modules, such as ReLU and Layer
Normalization, which results in a faster convergence rate and better
performance. Second, following the design of depth-wise convolution, we create
a corresponding depth-wise vision Transformer that is more efficient with
comparable performance. The potential of the proposed unified interpretation is
not limited to the given examples and we hope it can inspire the community and
give rise to more advanced network architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Image denoising is a fundamental and challenging task in the field of
computer vision. Most supervised denoising methods learn to reconstruct clean
images from noisy inputs, which have intrinsic spectral bias and tend to
produce over-smoothed and blurry images. Recently, researchers have explored
diffusion models to generate high-frequency details in image restoration tasks,
but these models do not guarantee that the generated texture aligns with real
images, leading to undesirable artifacts. To address the trade-off between
visual appeal and fidelity of high-frequency details in denoising tasks, we
propose a novel approach called the Reconstruct-and-Generate Diffusion Model
(RnG). Our method leverages a reconstructive denoising network to recover the
majority of the underlying clean signal, which serves as the initial estimation
for subsequent steps to maintain fidelity. Additionally, it employs a diffusion
algorithm to generate residual high-frequency details, thereby enhancing visual
quality. We further introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure effective
collaboration between the reconstructive and generative modules of RnG. To
reduce undesirable texture introduced by the diffusion model, we also propose
an adaptive step controller that regulates the number of inverse steps applied
by the diffusion model, allowing control over the level of high-frequency
details added to each patch as well as saving the inference computational cost.
Through our proposed RnG, we achieve a better balance between perception and
distortion. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real
denoising datasets, validating the superiority of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a novel Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) strategy
for autonomous racing at the handling limit that can iteratively explore and
learn unknown dynamics in high-speed operational domains. We start from
existing LMPC formulations and modify the system dynamics learning method. In
particular, our approach uses a nominal, global, nonlinear, physics-based model
with a local, linear, data-driven learning of the error dynamics. We conduct
experiments in simulation, 1/10th scale hardware, and deployed the proposed
LMPC on a full-scale autonomous race car used in the Indy Autonomous Challenge
(IAC) with closed loop experiments at the Putnam Park Road Course in Indiana,
USA. The results show that the proposed control policy exhibits improved
robustness to parameter tuning and data scarcity. Incremental and safety-aware
exploration toward the limit of handling and iterative learning of the vehicle
dynamics in high-speed domains is observed both in simulations and experiments.

<p class="mathjax">An accurate motion model is a fundamental component of most autonomous
navigation systems. While much work has been done on improving model
formulation, no standard protocol exists for gathering empirical data required
to train models. In this work, we address this issue by proposing Data-driven
Robot Input Vector Exploration (DRIVE), a protocol that enables characterizing
uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) input limits and gathering empirical model
training data. We also propose a novel learned slip approach outperforming
similar acceleration learning approaches. Our contributions are validated
through an extensive experimental evaluation, cumulating over 7 km and 1.8 h of
driving data over three distinct UGVs and four terrain types. We show that our
protocol offers increased predictive performance over common human-driven
data-gathering protocols. Furthermore, our protocol converges with 46 s of
training data, almost four times less than the shortest human dataset gathering
protocol. We show that the operational limit for our model is reached in
extreme slip conditions encountered on surfaced ice. DRIVE is an efficient way
of characterizing UGV motion in its operational conditions. Our code and
dataset are both available online at this link:

<p class="mathjax">We develop aspects of music theory related to harmony, such as scales, chord
formation and improvisation from a combinatorial perspective. The goal is to
provide a foundation for this subject by deriving the basic structure from a
few assumptions, rather than writing down long lists of chords/scales to
memorize without an underlying principle. Our approach involves introducing
constraints that limit the possible scales we can consider. For example, we may
impose the constraint that two voices cannot be only a semitone apart as this
is too dissonant. We can then study scales that do not contain notes that are a
semitone apart. A more refined constraint avoids three voices colliding by
studying scales that do not have three notes separated only by semitones.
Additionally, we require that our scales are complete, which roughly means that
they are the maximal sets of tones that satisfy these constraints. As it turns
out, completeness as applied to these simple two/three voice constraints
characterizes the types of scales that are commonly used in music composition.
Surprisingly, there is a correspondence between scales subject to the two-voice
constraint and those subject to the three-voice constraint. We formulate this
correspondence as a duality statement that provides a way to understand scales
subject to one type of constraint in terms of scales subject to the other.
Finally, we combine these constraint ideas to provide a classification of
chords.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce a new graph search algorithm, lazy edged based A*
(LEA*), for robot motion planning. By using an edge queue and exploiting the
idea of lazy search, LEA* is optimally vertex efficient similar to A*, and has
improved edge efficiency compared to A*. LEA* is simple and easy to implement
with minimum modification to A*, resulting in a very small overhead compared to
previous lazy search algorithms. We also explore the effect of inflated
heuristics, which results in the weighted LEA* (wLEA*). We show that the edge
efficiency of wLEA* becomes close to LazySP and, thus is near-optimal. We test
LEA* and wLEA* on 2D planning problems and planning of a 7-DOF manipulator. We
perform a thorough comparison with previous algorithms by considering sparse,
medium, and cluttered random worlds and small, medium, and large graph sizes.
Our results show that LEA* and wLEA* are the fastest algorithms to find the
plan compared to previous algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Humans can easily perceive the direction of sound sources in a visual scene,
termed sound source localization. Recent studies on learning-based sound source
localization have mainly explored the problem from a localization perspective.
However, prior arts and existing benchmarks do not account for a more important
aspect of the problem, cross-modal semantic understanding, which is essential
for genuine sound source localization. Cross-modal semantic understanding is
important in understanding semantically mismatched audio-visual events, e.g.,
silent objects, or off-screen sounds. To account for this, we propose a
cross-modal alignment task as a joint task with sound source localization to
better learn the interaction between audio and visual modalities. Thereby, we
achieve high localization performance with strong cross-modal semantic
understanding. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both
sound source localization and cross-modal retrieval. Our work suggests that
jointly tackling both tasks is necessary to conquer genuine sound source
localization.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically classify medical
images that learns and leverages weak causal signals in the image. Our
framework consists of a convolutional neural network backbone and a
causality-extractor module that extracts cause-effect relationships between
feature maps that can inform the model on the appearance of a feature in one
place of the image, given the presence of another feature within some other
place of the image. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data
scenarios, we train our causality-driven architecture in a One-shot learning
scheme, where we propose a new meta-learning procedure entailing meta-training
and meta-testing tasks that are designed using related classes but at different
levels of granularity. We conduct binary and multi-class classification
experiments on a publicly available dataset of prostate MRI images. To validate
the effectiveness of the proposed causality-driven module, we perform an
ablation study and conduct qualitative assessments using class activation maps
to highlight regions strongly influencing the network's decision-making
process. Our findings show that causal relationships among features play a
crucial role in enhancing the model's ability to discern relevant information
and yielding more reliable and interpretable predictions. This would make it a
promising approach for medical image classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Current state-of-the-art methods for panoptic segmentation require an immense
amount of annotated training data that is both arduous and expensive to obtain
posing a significant challenge for their widespread adoption. Concurrently,
recent breakthroughs in visual representation learning have sparked a paradigm
shift leading to the advent of large foundation models that can be trained with
completely unlabeled images. In this work, we propose to leverage such
task-agnostic image features to enable few-shot panoptic segmentation by
presenting Segmenting Panoptic Information with Nearly 0 labels (SPINO). In
detail, our method combines a DINOv2 backbone with lightweight network heads
for semantic segmentation and boundary estimation. We show that our approach,
albeit being trained with only ten annotated images, predicts high-quality
pseudo-labels that can be used with any existing panoptic segmentation method.
Notably, we demonstrate that SPINO achieves competitive results compared to
fully supervised baselines while using less than 0.3% of the ground truth
labels, paving the way for learning complex visual recognition tasks leveraging
foundation models. To illustrate its general applicability, we further deploy
SPINO on real-world robotic vision systems for both outdoor and indoor
environments. To foster future research, we make the code and trained models

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing has proven to be capable of accelerating many algorithms by
performing tasks that classical computers cannot. Currently, Noisy Intermediate
Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines struggle from scalability and noise issues to
render a commercial quantum computer. However, the physical and software
improvements of a quantum computer can efficiently control quantum gate noise.
As the complexity of quantum algorithms and implementation increases, software
control of quantum circuits may lead to a more intricate design. Consequently,
the verification of quantum circuits becomes crucial in ensuring the
correctness of the compilation, along with other processes, including quantum
error correction and assertions, that can increase the fidelity of quantum
circuits. In this paper, we propose a Decision Diagram-based quantum
equivalence checking approach, QuBEC, that requires less latency compared to
existing techniques, while accounting for circuits with quantum error
correction redundancy. Our proposed methodology reduces verification time on
certain benchmark circuits by up to $271.49 \times$, while the number of
Decision Diagram nodes required is reduced by up to $798.31 \times$, compared
to state-of-the-art strategies. The proposed QuBEC framework can contribute to
the advancement of quantum computing by enabling faster and more efficient
verification of quantum circuits, paving the way for the development of larger

<p class="mathjax">The remarkable capabilities and intricate nature of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) have dramatically escalated the imperative for specialized AI
accelerators. Nonetheless, designing these accelerators for various AI
workloads remains both labor- and time-intensive. While existing design
exploration and automation tools can partially alleviate the need for extensive
human involvement, they still demand substantial hardware expertise, posing a
barrier to non-experts and stifling AI accelerator development. Motivated by
the astonishing potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating
high-quality content in response to human language instructions, we embark on
this work to examine the possibility of harnessing LLMs to automate AI
accelerator design. Through this endeavor, we develop GPT4AIGChip, a framework
intended to democratize AI accelerator design by leveraging human natural
languages instead of domain-specific languages. Specifically, we first perform
an in-depth investigation into LLMs' limitations and capabilities for AI
accelerator design, thus aiding our understanding of our current position and
garnering insights into LLM-powered automated AI accelerator design.
Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the above insights, we develop a
framework called GPT4AIGChip, which features an automated demo-augmented
prompt-generation pipeline utilizing in-context learning to guide LLMs towards
creating high-quality AI accelerator design. To our knowledge, this work is the
first to demonstrate an effective pipeline for LLM-powered automated AI
accelerator generation. Accordingly, we anticipate that our insights and
framework can serve as a catalyst for innovations in next-generation
LLM-powered design automation tools.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of learning a model from multiple heterogeneous
sources with the goal of performing well on a new target distribution. The goal
of learner is to mix these data sources in a target-distribution aware way and
simultaneously minimize the empirical risk on the mixed source. The literature
has made some tangible advancements in establishing theory of learning on
mixture domain. However, there are still two unsolved problems. Firstly, how to
estimate the optimal mixture of sources, given a target domain; Secondly, when
there are numerous target domains, how to solve empirical risk minimization
(ERM) for each target using possibly unique mixture of data sources in a
computationally efficient manner. In this paper we address both problems
efficiently and with guarantees. We cast the first problem, mixture weight
estimation, as a convex-nonconcave compositional minimax problem, and propose
an efficient stochastic algorithm with provable stationarity guarantees. Next,
for the second problem, we identify that for certain regimes, solving ERM for
each target domain individually can be avoided, and instead parameters for a
target optimal model can be viewed as a non-linear function on a space of the
mixture coefficients. Building upon this, we show that in the offline setting,
a GD-trained overparameterized neural network can provably learn such function
to predict the model of target domain instead of solving a designated ERM
problem. Finally, we also consider an online setting and propose a label
efficient online algorithm, which predicts parameters for new targets given an
arbitrary sequence of mixing coefficients, while enjoying regret guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel backup strategy for Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) designed for highly stochastic and partially observable Markov decision
processes. We adopt a probabilistic approach, modeling both value and
action-value nodes as Gaussian distributions. We introduce a novel backup
operator that computes value nodes as the Wasserstein barycenter of their
action-value children nodes; thus, propagating the uncertainty of the estimate
across the tree to the root node. We study our novel backup operator when using
a novel combination of $L^1$-Wasserstein barycenter with $\alpha$-divergence,
by drawing a notable connection to the generalized mean backup operator. We
complement our probabilistic backup operator with two sampling strategies,
based on optimistic selection and Thompson sampling, obtaining our Wasserstein
MCTS algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic convergence to
the optimal policy, and an empirical evaluation on several stochastic and
partially observable environments, where our approach outperforms well-known
related baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained language models have achieved impressive results in various music
understanding and generation tasks. However, existing pre-training methods for
symbolic melody generation struggle to capture multi-scale, multi-dimensional
structural information in note sequences, due to the domain knowledge
discrepancy between text and music. Moreover, the lack of available large-scale
symbolic melody datasets limits the pre-training improvement. In this paper, we
propose MelodyGLM, a multi-task pre-training framework for generating melodies
with long-term structure. We design the melodic n-gram and long span sampling
strategies to create local and global blank infilling tasks for modeling the
local and global structures in melodies. Specifically, we incorporate pitch
n-grams, rhythm n-grams, and their combined n-grams into the melodic n-gram
blank infilling tasks for modeling the multi-dimensional structures in
melodies. To this end, we have constructed a large-scale symbolic melody
dataset, MelodyNet, containing more than 0.4 million melody pieces. MelodyNet
is utilized for large-scale pre-training and domain-specific n-gram lexicon
construction. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that
MelodyGLM surpasses the standard and previous pre-training methods. In
particular, subjective evaluations show that, on the melody continuation task,
MelodyGLM achieves average improvements of 0.82, 0.87, 0.78, and 0.94 in
consistency, rhythmicity, structure, and overall quality, respectively.
Notably, MelodyGLM nearly matches the quality of human-composed melodies on the
melody inpainting task.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models power a vast majority of text-to-audio (TTA) generation
methods. Unfortunately, these models suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative queries to the underlying denoising network, thus unsuitable for
scenarios with inference time or computational constraints. This work modifies
the recently proposed consistency distillation framework to train TTA models
that require only a single neural network query. In addition to incorporating
classifier-free guidance into the distillation process, we leverage the
availability of generated audio during distillation training to fine-tune the
consistency TTA model with novel loss functions in the audio space, such as the
CLAP score. Our objective and subjective evaluation results on the AudioCaps
dataset show that consistency models retain diffusion models' high generation
quality and diversity while reducing the number of queries by a factor of 400.

<p class="mathjax">Metaphors and sarcasm are precious fruits of our highly-evolved social
communication skills. However, children with Asperger syndrome are known to
have difficulties in comprehending sarcasm, even if they possess a certain
level of verbal IQ sufficient for understanding metaphors. Given that, a
screening test that scores the ability to understand metaphor and sarcasm has
been used to differentiate Asperger syndrome from other symptoms exhibiting
akin external behaviors (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This
study uses the standardized test to examine the capability of recent large
language models (LLMs) in understanding human nuanced communication. The
results divulged that, whereas their ability to comprehend metaphors has been
improved with the increase of the number of model parameters, the improvement
in sarcasm understanding was not observed. This implies that an alternative
approach is imperative to imbue LLMs with the capacity to grasp sarcasm, which
has been associated with the amygdala, a pivotal cerebral region for emotional
learning, in the case of humans.

<p class="mathjax">Recent hand-object interaction datasets show limited real object variability
and rely on fitting the MANO parametric model to obtain groundtruth hand
shapes. To go beyond these limitations and spur further research, we introduce
the SHOWMe dataset which consists of 96 videos, annotated with real and
detailed hand-object 3D textured meshes. Following recent work, we consider a
rigid hand-object scenario, in which the pose of the hand with respect to the
object remains constant during the whole video sequence. This assumption allows
us to register sub-millimetre-precise groundtruth 3D scans to the image
sequences in SHOWMe. Although simpler, this hypothesis makes sense in terms of
applications where the required accuracy and level of detail is important eg.,
object hand-over in human-robot collaboration, object scanning, or manipulation
and contact point analysis. Importantly, the rigidity of the hand-object
systems allows to tackle video-based 3D reconstruction of unknown hand-held
objects using a 2-stage pipeline consisting of a rigid registration step
followed by a multi-view reconstruction (MVR) part. We carefully evaluate a set
of non-trivial baselines for these two stages and show that it is possible to
achieve promising object-agnostic 3D hand-object reconstructions employing an
SfM toolbox or a hand pose estimator to recover the rigid transforms and
off-the-shelf MVR algorithms. However, these methods remain sensitive to the
initial camera pose estimates which might be imprecise due to lack of textures
on the objects or heavy occlusions of the hands, leaving room for improvements
in the reconstruction. Code and dataset are available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the structural controllability of switched continuous and
discrete time linear systems. It identifies a gap in the proof for a pivotal
criterion for structural controllability of switched continuous time systems in
the literature. To address this void, we develop novel graph-theoretic
concepts, such as multi-layer dynamic graphs, generalized stems/buds, and
generalized cactus configurations, and based on them, provide a comprehensive
proof for this criterion. Our approach also induces a new, generalized cactus
based graph-theoretic criterion for structural controllability. This not only
extends Lin's cactus-based graph-theoretic condition to switched systems for
the first time, but also provides a lower bound for the generic dimension of
controllable subspaces (which is conjectured to be exact). Finally, we present
extensions to reversible switched discrete-time systems, which lead to not only
a simplified necessary and sufficient condition for structural controllability,
but also the determination of the generic dimension of controllable subspaces.

<p class="mathjax">Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) exploits the inherent superposition
property of wireless channels to integrate the communication and model
aggregation. Though a naturally promising framework for wireless federated
learning, it requires care to mitigate physical layer impairments. In this
work, we consider a heterogeneous edge-intelligent network with different edge
device resources and non-i.i.d. user dataset distributions, under a general
non-convex learning objective. We leverage the Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS) technology to augment OTA-FL system over simultaneous time
varying uplink and downlink noisy communication channels under imperfect CSI
scenario. We propose a cross-layer algorithm that jointly optimizes RIS
configuration, communication and computation resources in this general
realistic setting. Specifically, we design dynamic local update steps in
conjunction with RIS phase shifts and transmission power to boost learning
performance. We present a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, and
show that it outperforms the existing unified approach under heterogeneous
system and imperfect CSI in numerical results.

<p class="mathjax">Analog computing has reemerged as a promising avenue for accelerating deep
neural networks (DNNs) due to its potential to overcome the energy efficiency
and scalability challenges posed by traditional digital architectures. However,
achieving high precision and DNN accuracy using such technologies is
challenging, as high-precision data converters are costly and impractical. In
this paper, we address this challenge by using the residue number system (RNS).
RNS allows composing high-precision operations from multiple low-precision
operations, thereby eliminating the information loss caused by the limited
precision of the data converters. Our study demonstrates that analog
accelerators utilizing the RNS-based approach can achieve ${\geq}99\%$ of FP32
accuracy for state-of-the-art DNN inference using data converters with only
$6$-bit precision whereas a conventional analog core requires more than $8$-bit
precision to achieve the same accuracy in the same DNNs. The reduced precision
requirements imply that using RNS can reduce the energy consumption of analog
accelerators by several orders of magnitude while maintaining the same
throughput and precision. Our study extends this approach to DNN training,
where we can efficiently train DNNs using $7$-bit integer arithmetic while
achieving accuracy comparable to FP32 precision. Lastly, we present a
fault-tolerant dataflow using redundant RNS error-correcting codes to protect
the computation against noise and errors inherent within an analog accelerator.

<p class="mathjax">Bodily behavioral language is an important social cue, and its automated
analysis helps in enhancing the understanding of artificial intelligence
systems. Furthermore, behavioral language cues are essential for active
engagement in social agent-based user interactions. Despite the progress made
in computer vision for tasks like head and body pose estimation, there is still
a need to explore the detection of finer behaviors such as gesturing, grooming,
or fumbling. This paper proposes a multiview attention fusion method named
MAGIC-TBR that combines features extracted from videos and their corresponding
Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients via a transformer-based approach. The
experiments are conducted on the BBSI dataset and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion with multiview attention. The code

<p class="mathjax">We study the combinatorial contracting problem of D\"utting et al. [FOCS
'21], in which a principal seeks to incentivize an agent to take a set of
costly actions. In their model, there is a binary outcome (the agent can
succeed or fail), and the success probability and the costs depend on the set
of actions taken. The optimal contract is linear, paying the agent an $\alpha$
fraction of the reward. For gross substitutes (GS) rewards and additive costs,
they give a poly-time algorithm for finding the optimal contract. They use the
properties of GS functions to argue that there are poly-many "critical values"
of $\alpha$, and that one can iterate through all of them efficiently in order
to find the optimal contract.
<br />In this work we study to which extent GS rewards and additive costs
constitute a tractability frontier for combinatorial contracts. We present an
algorithm that for any rewards and costs, enumerates all critical values, with
poly-many demand queries (in the number of critical values). This implies the
tractability of the optimal contract for any setting with poly-many critical
values and efficient demand oracle. A direct corollary is a poly-time algorithm
for the optimal contract in settings with supermodular rewards and submodular
costs. We also study a natural class of matching-based instances with XOS
rewards and additive costs. While the demand problem for this setting is
tractable, we show that it admits an exponential number of critical values. On
the positive side, we present (pseudo-) polynomial-time algorithms for two
natural special cases of this setting. Our work unveils a profound connection
to sensitivity analysis, and designates matching-based instances as a crucial
focal point for gaining a deeper understanding of combinatorial contract
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language processing (NLP) applications such as named entity
recognition (NER) for low-resource corpora do not benefit from recent advances
in the development of large language models (LLMs) where there is still a need
for larger annotated datasets. This research article introduces a methodology
for generating translated versions of annotated datasets through crosslingual
annotation projection. Leveraging a language agnostic BERT-based approach, it
is an efficient solution to increase low-resource corpora with few human
efforts and by only using already available open data resources. Quantitative
and qualitative evaluations are often lacking when it comes to evaluating the
quality and effectiveness of semi-automatic data generation strategies. The
evaluation of our crosslingual annotation projection approach showed both
effectiveness and high accuracy in the resulting dataset. As a practical
application of this methodology, we present the creation of French Annotated
Resource with Semantic Information for Medical Entities Detection (FRASIMED),
an annotated corpus comprising 2'051 synthetic clinical cases in French. The
corpus is now available for researchers and practitioners to develop and refine
French natural language processing (NLP) applications in the clinical field
(https://zenodo.org/record/8355629), making it the largest open annotated
corpus with linked medical concepts in French.

<p class="mathjax">Thematic analysis is a cornerstone of qualitative research, yet it is often
marked by labor-intensive procedures. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI), especially with large-scale language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, present potential avenues to enhance qualitative data analysis. This
research delves into the effectiveness of ChatGPT in refining the thematic
analysis process. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participants,
inclusive of a 4-participant pilot study, to identify the challenges and
reservations concerning the incorporation of ChatGPT in qualitative analysis.
In partnership with 13 qualitative analysts, we crafted cueing frameworks to
bolster ChatGPT's contribution to thematic analysis. The results indicate that
these frameworks not only amplify the quality of thematic analysis but also
bridge a significant connection between AI and qualitative research. These
insights carry pivotal implications for academics and professionals keen on
harnessing AI for qualitative data exploration.

<p class="mathjax">Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both
research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at
scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying
topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more
robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in
which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not
scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool,
based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of
scientific literature. Given a small initial "core" corpus of papers, we build
a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we
generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality
reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are "similar" to the core or
are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight
into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk. We
demonstrate our new tool for literature review by applying it to two different
fields in machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">As a specific case of graph transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation
on graphs aims for knowledge transfer from label-rich source graphs to
unlabeled target graphs. However, graphs with topology and attributes usually
have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world
scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This
imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain
shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method
named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain
shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are
trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of
node embedding, thus the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be
transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we
propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on
the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their
relative position to the class centroids. Finally, extensive experiments on a
range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our
proposed SGDA in different experimental settings.

<p class="mathjax">A Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft is capable of short/vertical
takeoffs and landings, thus eliminating the requirement of long runways. This
feature makes them suitable for a broader variety of missions, generally not
achievable by a traditional aircraft. The dynamics of the VTOL aircraft in the
vertical plane has been used as a benchmark problem to demonstrate the
effectiveness of different nonlinear control techniques, mainly due to being
highly coupled and non-minimum phase. This paper presents the design of an
inverse optimal control for a simplified VTOL aircraft model. The proposed
control law is based on a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) which exploits the
normal form typically used for control design through feedback linearization.
The suggested control law is compared with dynamic feedback linearization based
control law and a comparison is drawn based on their efficacy and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world datasets live on high-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian
manifolds, $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $Gr(k, \mathbb{R}^N)$ respectively, and
benefit from projection onto lower-dimensional Stiefel (respectively,
Grassmannian) manifolds. In this work, we propose an algorithm called Principal
Stiefel Coordinates (PSC) to reduce data dimensionality from $
V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in an $O(k)$-equivariant manner ($k
\leq n \ll N$). We begin by observing that each element $\alpha \in
V_n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ defines an isometric embedding of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into
$V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Next, we optimize for such an embedding map that minimizes
data fit error by warm-starting with the output of principal component analysis
(PCA) and applying gradient descent. Then, we define a continuous and
$O(k)$-equivariant map $\pi_\alpha$ that acts as a ``closest point operator''
to project the data onto the image of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in
$V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ under the embedding determined by $\alpha$, while
minimizing distortion. Because this dimensionality reduction is
$O(k)$-equivariant, these results extend to Grassmannian manifolds as well.
Lastly, we show that the PCA output globally minimizes projection error in a
noiseless setting, but that our algorithm achieves a meaningfully different and
improved outcome when the data does not lie exactly on the image of a linearly
embedded lower-dimensional Stiefel manifold as above. Multiple numerical
experiments using synthetic and real-world data are performed.

nuances of different approaches to affective computing and their relevance to
the processing of special data under the GDPR. Moreover, it points to potential
tensions with data protection principles, such as fairness and accuracy. Our
article also highlights some of the consequences, including harm, that
processing of emotion data may have for individuals concerned. Additionally, we
discuss how the AI Act proposal intends to regulate affective computing.
Finally, the article outlines the new obligations and transparency requirements
introduced by the DSA for online platforms utilizing emotion data. Our article
aims at raising awareness among the affective computing community about the
applicable legal requirements when developing AC systems intended for the EU
market, or when working with study participants located in the EU. We also
stress the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of individuals even
when the law struggles to keep up with technological developments that capture

<p class="mathjax">Missing diversity, equity, and inclusion elements in affective computing
datasets directly affect the accuracy and fairness of emotion recognition
algorithms across different groups. A literature review reveals how affective
computing systems may work differently for different groups due to, for
instance, mental health conditions impacting facial expressions and speech or
age-related changes in facial appearance and health. Our work analyzes existing
affective computing datasets and highlights a disconcerting lack of diversity
in current affective computing datasets regarding race, sex/gender, age, and
(mental) health representation. By emphasizing the need for more inclusive
sampling strategies and standardized documentation of demographic factors in
datasets, this paper provides recommendations and calls for greater attention
to inclusivity and consideration of societal consequences in affective
computing research to promote ethical and accurate outcomes in this emerging
field.

<p class="mathjax">Despite an exciting new wave of multimodal machine learning models, current
approaches still struggle to interpret the complex contextual relationships
between the different modalities present in videos. Going beyond existing
methods that emphasize simple activities or objects, we propose a new
model-agnostic approach for generating detailed textual descriptions that
captures multimodal video information. Our method leverages the extensive
knowledge learnt by large language models, such as GPT-3.5 or Llama2, to reason
about textual descriptions of the visual and aural modalities, obtained from
BLIP-2, Whisper and ImageBind. Without needing additional finetuning of
video-text models or datasets, we demonstrate that available LLMs have the
ability to use these multimodal textual descriptions as proxies for ``sight''
or ``hearing'' and perform zero-shot multimodal classification of videos
in-context. Our evaluations on popular action recognition benchmarks, such as
UCF-101 or Kinetics, show these context-rich descriptions can be successfully
used in video understanding tasks. This method points towards a promising new
research direction in multimodal classification, demonstrating how an interplay
between textual, visual and auditory machine learning models can enable more
holistic video understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in digital automation for smart grids have led to the
installation of measurement devices like phasor measurement units (PMUs),
micro-PMUs ($\mu$-PMUs), and smart meters. However, a large amount of data
collected by these devices brings several challenges as control room operators
need to use this data with models to make confident decisions for reliable and
resilient operation of the cyber-power systems. Machine-learning (ML) based
tools can provide a reliable interpretation of the deluge of data obtained from
the field. For the decision-makers to ensure reliable network operation under
all operating conditions, these tools need to identify solutions that are
feasible and satisfy the system constraints, while being efficient,
trustworthy, and interpretable. This resulted in the increasing popularity of
physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approaches, as these methods overcome
challenges that model-based or data-driven ML methods face in silos. This work
aims at the following: a) review existing strategies and techniques for
incorporating underlying physical principles of the power grid into different
types of ML approaches (supervised/semi-supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and reinforcement learning (RL)); b) explore the existing works on
PIML methods for anomaly detection, classification, localization, and
mitigation in power transmission and distribution systems, c) discuss
improvements in existing methods through consideration of potential challenges
while also addressing the limitations to make them suitable for real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Developing an agent capable of adapting to unseen environments remains a
difficult challenge in imitation learning. In this work, we present Adaptive
Return-conditioned Policy (ARP), an efficient framework designed to enhance the
agent's generalization ability using natural language task descriptions and
pre-trained multimodal encoders. Our key idea is to calculate a similarity
between visual observations and natural language instructions in the
pre-trained multimodal embedding space (such as CLIP) and use it as a reward
signal. We then train a return-conditioned policy using expert demonstrations
labeled with multimodal rewards. Because the multimodal rewards provide
adaptive signals at each timestep, our ARP effectively mitigates the goal
misgeneralization. This results in superior generalization performances even
when faced with unseen text instructions, compared to existing text-conditioned
policies. To improve the quality of rewards, we also introduce a fine-tuning
method for pre-trained multimodal encoders, further enhancing the performance.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile manipulators have been used for inspection, maintenance and repair
tasks over the years, but there are some key limitations. Stability concerns
typically require mobile platforms to be large in order to handle far-reaching
manipulators, or for the manipulators to have drastically reduced workspaces to
fit onto smaller mobile platforms. Therefore we propose a combination of two
widely-used robots, the Clearpath Jackal unmanned ground vehicle and the Kinova
Gen3 six degree-of-freedom manipulator. The Jackal has a small footprint and
works well in low-clearance indoor environments. Extensive testing of
localization, navigation and mapping using LiDAR sensors makes the Jackal a
well developed mobile platform suitable for mobile manipulation. The Gen3 has a
long reach with reasonable power consumption for manipulation tasks. A wrist
camera for RGB-D sensing and a customizable end effector interface makes the
Gen3 suitable for a myriad of manipulation tasks. Typically these features
would result in an unstable platform, however with a few minor hardware and
software modifications, we have produced a stable, high-performance mobile
manipulation platform with significant mobility, reach, sensing, and
maneuverability for indoor inspection tasks, without degradation of the
component robots' individual capabilities. These assertions were investigated
with hardware via semi-autonomous navigation to waypoints in a busy indoor
environment, and high-precision self-alignment alongside planar structures for
intervention tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers a generalization of the Path Finding (PF) with refueling
constraints referred to as the Refuelling Path Finding (RF-PF) problem. Just
like PF, the RF-PF problem is defined over a graph, where vertices are gas
stations with known fuel prices, and edge costs depend on the gas consumption
between the corresponding vertices. RF-PF seeks a minimum-cost path from the
start to the goal vertex for a robot with a limited gas tank and a limited
number of refuelling stops. While RF-PF is polynomial-time solvable, it remains
a challenge to quickly compute an optimal solution in practice since the robot
needs to simultaneously determine the path, where to make the stops, and the
amount to refuel at each stop. This paper develops a heuristic search algorithm
called Refuel A* (RF-A* ) that iteratively constructs partial solution paths
from the start to the goal guided by a heuristic function while leveraging
dominance rules for state pruning during planning. RF-A* is guaranteed to find
an optimal solution and runs more than an order of magnitude faster than the
existing state of the art (a polynomial time algorithm) when tested in large
city maps with hundreds of gas stations.

<p class="mathjax">We present a hierarchical tree-based motion planning strategy, HAS-RRT,
guided by the workspace skeleton to solve motion planning problems in robotics
and computational biology. Relying on the information about the connectivity of
the workspace and the ranking of available paths in the workspace, the strategy
prioritizes paths indicated by the workspace guidance to find a valid motion
plan for the moving object efficiently. In instances of suboptimal guidance,
the strategy adapts its reliance on the guidance by hierarchically reverting to
local exploration of the planning space. We offer an extensive comparative
analysis against other tree-based planning strategies and demonstrate that
HAS-RRT reliably and efficiently finds low-cost paths. In contrast to methods
prone to inconsistent performance across different environments or reliance on
specific parameters, HAS-RRT is robust to workspace variability.

<p class="mathjax">Subterranean burrowing is inherently difficult for robots because of the high
forces experienced as well as the high amount of uncertainty in this domain.
Because of the difficulty in modeling forces in granular media, we propose the
use of a novel machine-learning control strategy to obtain optimal techniques
for vertical self-burrowing. In this paper, we realize a snake-like
bio-inspired robot that is equipped with an IMU and two triple-axis
magnetometers. Utilizing magnetic field strength as an analog for depth, a
novel deep learning architecture was proposed based on sinusoidal and random
data in order to obtain a more efficient strategy for vertical self-burrowing.
This strategy was able to outperform many other standard burrowing techniques
and was able to automatically reach targeted burrowing depths. We hope these
results will serve as a proof of concept for how optimization can be used to
unlock the secrets of navigating in the subterranean world more efficiently.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning and deep learning methods have been widely explored in
understanding the chaotic behavior of the atmosphere and furthering weather
forecasting. There has been increasing interest from technology companies,
government institutions, and meteorological agencies in building digital twins
of the Earth. Recent approaches using transformers, physics-informed machine
learning, and graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on relatively narrow spatiotemporal scales and specific tasks. With
the recent success of generative artificial intelligence (AI) using pre-trained
transformers for language modeling and vision with prompt engineering and
fine-tuning, we are now moving towards generalizable AI. In particular, we are
witnessing the rise of AI foundation models that can perform competitively on
multiple domain-specific downstream tasks. Despite this progress, we are still
in the nascent stages of a generalizable AI model for global Earth system
models, regional climate models, and mesoscale weather models. Here, we review
current state-of-the-art AI approaches, primarily from transformer and operator
learning literature in the context of meteorology. We provide our perspective
on criteria for success towards a family of foundation models for nowcasting
and forecasting weather and climate predictions. We also discuss how such
models can perform competitively on downstream tasks such as downscaling
(super-resolution), identifying conditions conducive to the occurrence of
wildfires, and predicting consequential meteorological phenomena across various
spatiotemporal scales such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers. In particular,
we examine current AI methodologies and contend they have matured enough to
design and implement a weather foundation model.

<p class="mathjax">We study semantic compression for text where meanings contained in the text
are conveyed to a source decoder, e.g., for classification. The main motivator
to move to such an approach of recovering the meaning without requiring exact
reconstruction is the potential resource savings, both in storage and in
conveying the information to another node. Towards this end, we propose
semantic quantization and compression approaches for text where we utilize
sentence embeddings and the semantic distortion metric to preserve the meaning.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed semantic approaches result in
substantial (orders of magnitude) savings in the required number of bits for
message representation at the expense of very modest accuracy loss compared to
the semantic agnostic baseline. We compare the results of proposed approaches
and observe that resource savings enabled by semantic quantization can be
further amplified by semantic clustering. Importantly, we observe the
generalizability of the proposed methodology which produces excellent results
on many benchmark text classification datasets with a diverse array of
contexts.

<p class="mathjax">Exploiting pre-trained diffusion models for restoration has recently become a
favored alternative to the traditional task-specific training approach.
Previous works have achieved noteworthy success by limiting the solution space
using explicit degradation models. However, these methods often fall short when
faced with complex degradations as they generally cannot be precisely modeled.
In this paper, we propose PGDiff by introducing partial guidance, a fresh
perspective that is more adaptable to real-world degradations compared to
existing works. Rather than specifically defining the degradation process, our
approach models the desired properties, such as image structure and color
statistics of high-quality images, and applies this guidance during the reverse
diffusion process. These properties are readily available and make no
assumptions about the degradation process. When combined with a diffusion
prior, this partial guidance can deliver appealing results across a range of
restoration tasks. Additionally, PGDiff can be extended to handle composite
tasks by consolidating multiple high-quality image properties, achieved by
integrating the guidance from respective tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing diffusion-prior-based
approaches but also competes favorably with task-specific models.

importance and has become one of the key ways of doing cutting edge research.
In this paper we attempt to model the citation flow across three different
fields -- Physics (PHY), Mathematics (MA) and Computer Science (CS). For
instance, is there a specific pattern in which these fields cite one another?
We carry out experiments on a dataset comprising more than 1.2 million articles
taken from these three fields. We quantify the citation interactions among
these three fields through temporal bucket signatures. We present numerical
models based on variants of the recently proposed relay-linking framework to
explain the citation dynamics across the three disciplines. These models make a
modest attempt to unfold the underlying principles of how citation links could
have been formed across the three fields over time.

<p class="mathjax">How can we perform computations over natural language representations to
solve tasks that require symbolic and numeric reasoning? We propose natural
language embedded programs (NLEP) as a unifying framework for addressing
math/symbolic reasoning, natural language understanding, and instruction
following tasks. Our approach prompts a language model to generate full Python
programs that define functions over data structures which contain natural
language representations of structured knowledge. A Python interpreter then
executes the generated code and prints the output. Despite using a task-general
prompt, we find that this approach can improve upon strong baselines across a
range of different tasks including math and symbolic reasoning, text
classification, question answering, and instruction following. We further find
the generated programs are often interpretable and enable post-hoc verification
of the intermediate reasoning steps.

<p class="mathjax">Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial
annotations. However, manual labeling in 2D images is highly labor-intensive.
While existing datasets provide rich annotations for pre-recorded sequences,
they fall short in labeling rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially
hampering the generalization ability for perception models. In this paper, we
present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel approach that combines coarse 3D annotations
with noisy 2D semantic cues to generate consistent panoptic labels and
high-quality images from any viewpoint. Our key insight lies in exploiting the
complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually enhance geometry and semantics.
Specifically, we propose to leverage noisy semantic and instance labels in both
3D and 2D spaces to guide geometry optimization. Simultaneously, the improved
geometry assists in filtering noise present in the 3D and 2D annotations by
merging them in 3D space via a learned semantic field. To further enhance
appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid scene features,
striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and predominantly
contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's
state-of-the-art performance over existing label transfer methods on the
challenging urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360
enables omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and
spatiotemporally consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels. We make
our code and data available at https://github.com/fuxiao0719/PanopticNeRF

holography relies on coherent illumination which can create undesirable speckle
noise in the final image. Although smooth phase holograms can be speckle-free,
their non-uniform eyebox makes them impractical, and speckle mitigation with
partially coherent sources also reduces resolution. Averaging sequential frames
for speckle reduction requires high speed modulators and consumes temporal
bandwidth that may be needed elsewhere in the system.
<br />In this work, we propose multisource holography, a novel architecture that
uses an array of sources to suppress speckle in a single frame without
sacrificing resolution. By using two spatial light modulators, arranged
sequentially, each source in the array can be controlled almost independently
to create a version of the target content with different speckle. Speckle is
then suppressed when the contributions from the multiple sources are averaged
at the image plane. We introduce an algorithm to calculate multisource
holograms, analyze the design space, and demonstrate up to a 10 dB increase in
peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to an equivalent single source system.
Finally, we validate the concept with a benchtop experimental prototype by
producing both 2D images and focal stacks with natural defocus cues.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to understand the impacts of various data combinations (e.g.,
web text, wikipedia, github, books) on the training of large language models
using SlimPajama. SlimPajama is a rigorously deduplicated, multi-source
dataset, which has been refined and further deduplicated to 627B tokens from
the extensive 1.2T tokens RedPajama dataset contributed by Together. We've
termed our research as SlimPajama-DC, an empirical analysis designed to uncover
fundamental characteristics and best practices associated with employing
SlimPajama in the training of large language models. During our research with
SlimPajama, two pivotal observations emerged: (1) Global deduplication vs.
local deduplication. We analyze and discuss how global (across different
sources of datasets) and local (within the single source of dataset)
deduplications affect the performance of trained models. (2) Proportions of
high-quality/highly-deduplicated multi-source datasets in the combination. To
study this, we construct six configurations of SlimPajama dataset and train
individual ones using 1.3B Cerebras-GPT model with Alibi and SwiGLU. Our best
configuration outperforms the 1.3B model trained on RedPajama using the same
number of training tokens by a significant margin. All our 1.3B models are
trained on Cerebras 16$\times$ CS-2 cluster with a total of 80 PFLOP/s in bf16
mixed precision. We further extend our discoveries (such as increasing data
diversity is crucial after global deduplication) on a 7B model with large
batch-size training. Our models and the separate SlimPajama-DC datasets are
available at: https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI-LLM and

<p class="mathjax">We present an exploration of machine learning architectures for predicting
brain responses to realistic images on occasion of the Algonauts Challenge
2023. Our research involved extensive experimentation with various pretrained
models. Initially, we employed simpler models to predict brain activity but
gradually introduced more complex architectures utilizing available data and
embeddings generated by large-scale pre-trained models. We encountered typical
difficulties related to machine learning problems, e.g. regularization and
overfitting, as well as issues specific to the challenge, such as difficulty in
combining multiple input encodings, as well as the high dimensionality, unclear
structure, and noisy nature of the output. To overcome these issues we tested
single edge 3D position-based, multi-region of interest (ROI) and hemisphere
predictor models, but we found that employing multiple simple models, each
dedicated to a ROI in each hemisphere of the brain of each subject, yielded the
best results - a single fully connected linear layer with image embeddings
generated by CLIP as input. While we surpassed the challenge baseline, our
results fell short of establishing a robust association with the data.

<p class="mathjax">An essential premise for neuroscience brain network analysis is the
successful segmentation of the cerebral cortex into functionally homogeneous
regions. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI),
capturing the spontaneous activities of the brain, provides the potential for
cortical parcellation. Previous parcellation methods can be roughly categorized
into three groups, mainly employing either local gradient, global similarity,
or a combination of both. The traditional clustering algorithms, such as
"K-means" and "Spectral clustering" may affect the reproducibility or the
biological interpretation of parcellations; The region growing-based methods
influence the expression of functional homogeneity in the brain at a large
scale; The parcellation method based on probabilistic graph models inevitably
introduce model assumption biases. In this work, we develop an assumption-free
model called as BDEC, which leverages the robust data fitting capability of
deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses
deep learning algorithm for rs-fMRI-based parcellation. By comparing with nine
commonly used brain parcellation methods, the BDEC model demonstrates
significantly superior performance in various functional homogeneity
indicators. Furthermore, it exhibits favorable results in terms of validity,
network analysis, task homogeneity, and generalization capability. These
results suggest that the BDEC parcellation captures the functional
characteristics of the brain and holds promise for future voxel-wise brain
network analysis in the dimensionality reduction of fMRI data.

<p class="mathjax">Molecular conformation generation, a critical aspect of computational
chemistry, involves producing the three-dimensional conformer geometry for a
given molecule. Generating molecular conformation via diffusion requires
learning to reverse a noising process. Diffusion on inter-atomic distances
instead of conformation preserves SE(3)-equivalence and shows superior
performance compared to alternative techniques, whereas related generative
modelings are predominantly based upon heuristical assumptions. In response to
this, we propose a novel molecular conformation generation approach driven by
the observation that the disintegration of a molecule can be viewed as casting
increasing force fields to its composing atoms, such that the distribution of
the change of inter-atomic distance shifts from Gaussian to Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. The corresponding generative modeling ensures a feasible
inter-atomic distance geometry and exhibits time reversibility. Experimental
results on molecular datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
shifting distribution compared to the state-of-the-art.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been shown to have large
quality disparities between the language varieties they are intended or
expected to recognize. One way to mitigate this is to train or fine-tune models
with more representative datasets. But this approach can be hindered by limited
in-domain data for training and evaluation. We propose a new way to improve the
robustness of a US English short-form speech recognizer using a small amount of
out-of-domain (long-form) African American English (AAE) data. We use CORAAL,
YouTube and Mozilla Common Voice to train an audio classifier to approximately
output whether an utterance is AAE or some other variety including Mainstream
American English (MAE). By combining the classifier output with coarse
geographic information, we can select a subset of utterances from a large
corpus of untranscribed short-form queries for semi-supervised learning at
scale. Fine-tuning on this data results in a 38.5% relative word error rate
disparity reduction between AAE and MAE without reducing MAE quality.

<p class="mathjax">Gene essentiality refers to the degree to which a gene is necessary for the
survival and reproductive efficacy of a living organism. Although the
essentiality of non-coding genes has been documented, there are still aspects
of non-coding genes' essentiality that are unknown to us. For example, We do
not know the contribution of sequence features and network spatial features to
essentiality. As a consequence, in this work, we propose DeepHEN that could
answer the above question. By buidling a new lncRNA-proteion-protein network
and utilizing both representation learning and graph neural network, we
successfully build our DeepHEN models that could predict the essentiality of
lncRNA genes. Compared to other methods for predicting the essentiality of
lncRNA genes, our DeepHEN model not only tells whether sequence features or
network spatial features have a greater influence on essentiality but also
addresses the overfitting issue of those methods caused by the low number of
essential lncRNA genes, as evidenced by the results of enrichment analysis.

machine intelligence and consciousness is an arduous pursuit. Researchers have
developed diverse theories for interpreting the consciousness phenomenon in
human brains from different perspectives and levels. This paper surveys several
main branches of consciousness theories originating from different subjects

<p class="mathjax">A major interest in longitudinal neuroimaging studies involves investigating
voxel-level neuroplasticity due to treatment and other factors across visits.
However, traditional voxel-wise methods are beset with several pitfalls, which
can compromise the accuracy of these approaches. We propose a novel Bayesian
tensor response regression approach for longitudinal imaging data, which pools
information across spatially-distributed voxels to infer significant changes
while adjusting for covariates. The proposed method, which is implemented using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, utilizes low-rank decomposition to
reduce dimensionality and preserve spatial configurations of voxels when
estimating coefficients. It also enables feature selection via joint credible
regions which respect the shape of the posterior distributions for more
accurate inference. In addition to group level inferences, the method is able
to infer individual-level neuroplasticity, allowing for examination of
personalized disease or recovery trajectories. The advantages of the proposed
approach in terms of prediction and feature selection over voxel-wise
regression are highlighted via extensive simulation studies. Subsequently, we
apply the approach to a longitudinal Aphasia dataset consisting of task
functional MRI images from a group of subjects who were administered either a
control intervention or intention treatment at baseline and were followed up
over subsequent visits. Our analysis revealed that while the control therapy
showed long-term increases in brain activity, the intention treatment produced
predominantly short-term changes, both of which were concentrated in distinct
localized regions. In contrast, the voxel-wise regression failed to detect any
significant neuroplasticity after multiplicity adjustments, which is
biologically implausible and implies lack of power.

<p class="mathjax">The Gaussian process (GP) is a popular statistical technique for stochastic
function approximation and uncertainty quantification from data. GPs have been
adopted into the realm of machine learning in the last two decades because of
their superior prediction abilities, especially in data-sparse scenarios, and
their inherent ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates. Even so, their
performance highly depends on intricate customizations of the core methodology,
which often leads to dissatisfaction among practitioners when standard setups
and off-the-shelf software tools are being deployed. Arguably the most
important building block of a GP is the kernel function which assumes the role
of a covariance operator. Stationary kernels of the Mat\'ern class are used in
the vast majority of applied studies; poor prediction performance and
unrealistic uncertainty quantification are often the consequences.
Non-stationary kernels show improved performance but are rarely used due to
their more complicated functional form and the associated effort and expertise
needed to define and tune them optimally. In this perspective, we want to help
ML practitioners make sense of some of the most common forms of
non-stationarity for Gaussian processes. We show a variety of kernels in action
using representative datasets, carefully study their properties, and compare
their performances. Based on our findings, we propose a new kernel that
combines some of the identified advantages of existing kernels.

<p class="mathjax">PD is linked to faster brain aging. Sex is recognized as an important factor
in PD, such that males are twice as likely as females to have the disease and
have more severe symptoms and a faster progression rate. Despite previous
research, there remains a significant gap in understanding the function of sex
in the process of brain aging in PD patients. The T1-weighted MRI-driven
brain-predicted age difference was computed in a group of 373 PD patients from
the PPMI database using a robust brain-age estimation framework that was
trained on 949 healthy subjects. Linear regression models were used to
investigate the association between brain-PAD and clinical variables in PD,
stratified by sex. All female PD patients were used in the correlational
analysis while the same number of males were selected based on propensity score
matching method considering age, education level, age of symptom onset, and
clinical symptom severity. Despite both patient groups being matched for
demographics, motor and non-motor symptoms, it was observed that males with
Parkinson's disease exhibited a significantly higher mean brain age-delta than
their female counterparts . In the propensity score-matched PD male group,
brain-PAD was found to be associated with a decline in general cognition, a
worse degree of sleep behavior disorder, reduced visuospatial acuity, and
caudate atrophy. Conversely, no significant links were observed between these
factors and brain-PAD in the PD female group.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been a growing interest in statistical methods
that exhibit robust performance under distribution changes between training and
test data. While most of the related research focuses on point predictions with
the squared error loss, this article turns the focus towards probabilistic
predictions, which aim to comprehensively quantify the uncertainty of an
outcome variable given covariates. Within a causality-inspired framework, we
investigate the invariance and robustness of probabilistic predictions with
respect to proper scoring rules. We show that arbitrary distribution shifts do
not, in general, admit invariant and robust probabilistic predictions, in
contrast to the setting of point prediction. We illustrate how to choose
evaluation metrics and restrict the class of distribution shifts to allow for
identifiability and invariance in the prototypical Gaussian heteroscedastic
linear model. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to yield
invariant probabilistic predictions, called IPP, and study the consistency of
the underlying parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of
our proposed procedure on simulated as well as on single-cell data.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality human transcription is essential for training and improving
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. Recent study~\cite{libricrowd} has
found that every 1% worse transcription Word Error Rate (WER) increases
approximately 2% ASR WER by using the transcriptions to train ASR models.
Transcription errors are inevitable for even highly-trained annotators.
However, few studies have explored human transcription correction. Error
correction methods for other problems, such as ASR error correction and
grammatical error correction, do not perform sufficiently for this problem.
Therefore, we propose HTEC for Human Transcription Error Correction. HTEC
consists of two stages: Trans-Checker, an error detection model that predicts
and masks erroneous words, and Trans-Filler, a sequence-to-sequence generative
model that fills masked positions. We propose a holistic list of correction
operations, including four novel operations handling deletion errors. We
further propose a variant of embeddings that incorporates phoneme information
into the input of the transformer. HTEC outperforms other methods by a large
margin and surpasses human annotators by 2.2% to 4.5% in WER. Finally, we
deployed HTEC to assist human annotators and showed HTEC is particularly
effective as a co-pilot, which improves transcription quality by 15.1% without
sacrificing transcription velocity.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse index tracking is one of the prominent passive portfolio management
strategies that construct a sparse portfolio to track a financial index. A
sparse portfolio is desirable over a full portfolio in terms of transaction
cost reduction and avoiding illiquid assets. To enforce the sparsity of the
portfolio, conventional studies have proposed formulations based on
$\ell_p$-norm regularizations as a continuous surrogate of the $\ell_0$-norm
regularization. Although such formulations can be used to construct sparse
portfolios, they are not easy to use in actual investments because parameter
tuning to specify the exact upper bound on the number of assets in the
portfolio is delicate and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new
problem formulation of sparse index tracking using an $\ell_0$-norm constraint
that enables easy control of the upper bound on the number of assets in the
portfolio. In addition, our formulation allows the choice between portfolio
sparsity and turnover sparsity constraints, which also reduces transaction
costs by limiting the number of assets that are updated at each rebalancing.
Furthermore, an efficient algorithm for solving this problem was developed
based on a primal-dual splitting method. Finally, we illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on the S\&amp;P500 and
NASDAQ100 index datasets

<p class="mathjax">Medical image registration is a critical task that estimates the spatial
correspondence between pairs of images. However, current traditional and
deep-learning-based methods rely on similarity measures to generate a deforming
field, which often results in disproportionate volume changes in dissimilar
regions, especially in tumor regions. These changes can significantly alter the
tumor size and underlying anatomy, which limits the practical use of image
registration in clinical diagnosis. To address this issue, we have formulated
image registration with tumors as a constraint problem that preserves tumor
volumes while maximizing image similarity in other normal regions. Our proposed
strategy involves a two-stage process. In the first stage, we use
similarity-based registration to identify potential tumor regions by their
volume change, generating a soft tumor mask accordingly. In the second stage,
we propose a volume-preserving registration with a novel adaptive
volume-preserving loss that penalizes the change in size adaptively based on
the masks calculated from the previous stage. Our approach balances image
similarity and volume preservation in different regions, i.e., normal and tumor
regions, by using soft tumor masks to adjust the imposition of
volume-preserving loss on each one. This ensures that the tumor volume is
preserved during the registration process. We have evaluated our strategy on
various datasets and network architectures, demonstrating that our method
successfully preserves the tumor volume while achieving comparable registration
results with state-of-the-art methods. Our codes is available at:

<p class="mathjax">The CMS detector is a general-purpose apparatus that detects high-energy
collisions produced at the LHC. Online Data Quality Monitoring of the CMS
electromagnetic calorimeter is a vital operational tool that allows detector
experts to quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector
issues that could affect the quality of physics data. A real-time
autoencoder-based anomaly detection system using semi-supervised machine
learning is presented enabling the detection of anomalies in the CMS
electromagnetic calorimeter data. A novel method is introduced which maximizes
the anomaly detection performance by exploiting the time-dependent evolution of
anomalies as well as spatial variations in the detector response. The
autoencoder-based system is able to efficiently detect anomalies, while
maintaining a very low false discovery rate. The performance of the system is
validated with anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, the first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in
the CMS online Data Quality Monitoring workflow during the beginning of Run 3
of the LHC are presented, showing its ability to detect issues missed by the
existing system.

a large dataset of radiation oncology patient records and clinical notes from

generating radiotherapy treatment regimens, determining optimal radiation
modalities, and providing diagnostic descriptions/ICD codes based on patient
diagnostic details. Evaluations conducted by having radiation oncologists
compare RadOnc-GPT impressions to general large language model impressions
showed that RadOnc-GPT generated outputs with significantly improved clarity,

learning and statistical methods to tabular data. In this paper, we propose the
use of the kernel density integral transformation as a feature preprocessing
step. Our approach subsumes the two leading feature preprocessing methods as
limiting cases: linear min-max scaling and quantile transformation. We
demonstrate that, without hyperparameter tuning, the kernel density integral
transformation can be used as a simple drop-in replacement for either method,
offering robustness to the weaknesses of each. Alternatively, with tuning of a
single continuous hyperparameter, we frequently outperform both of these
methods. Finally, we show that the kernel density transformation can be
profitably applied to statistical data analysis, particularly in correlation
analysis and univariate clustering.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum multiplication is a fundamental operation in quantum computing. Most
existing quantum multipliers require $O(n)$ qubits to multiply two $n$-bit
integer numbers, limiting their applicability to multiply large integer numbers
using near-term quantum computers. This paper proposes a new approach, the
Quantum Multiplier Based on Exponent Adder (QMbead), which addresses this issue
by requiring only $log_2(n)$ qubits to multiply two $n$-bit integer numbers.
QMbead uses a so-called exponent encoding to represent the two multiplicands as
two superposition states, respectively, and then employs a quantum adder to
obtain the sum of these two superposition states, and subsequently measures the
outputs of the quantum adder to calculate the product of the multiplicands. The
paper presents two types of quantum adders based on the quantum Fourier
transform (QFT) for use in QMbead. The circuit depth of QMbead is determined by
the chosen quantum adder, being $O(log_2^2 n)$ when using the two QFT-based
adders. The multiplicand can be either an integer or a decimal number. QMbead
has been implemented on quantum simulators to compute products with a bit
length of up to 273 bits using only 17 qubits. This establishes QMbead as an
efficient solution for multiplying large integer or decimal numbers with many
bits.

<p class="mathjax">Developing reliable computational frameworks for early parasite detection,
particularly at the ova (or egg) stage is crucial for advancing healthcare and
effectively managing potential public health crises. While deep learning has
significantly assisted human workers in various tasks, its application and
diagnostics has been constrained by the need for extensive datasets. The
ability to learn from an extremely scarce training dataset, i.e., when fewer
than 5 examples per class are present, is essential for scaling deep learning
models in biomedical applications where large-scale data collection and
annotation can be expensive or not possible (in case of novel or unknown
infectious agents). In this study, we introduce ProtoKD, one of the first
approaches to tackle the problem of multi-class parasitic ova recognition using
extremely scarce data. Combining the principles of prototypical networks and
self-distillation, we can learn robust representations from only one sample per
class. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to drive research in this
critical direction and validate that the proposed ProtoKD framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we evaluate the framework's
generalizability to other downstream tasks by assessing its performance on a
large-scale taxonomic profiling task based on metagenomes sequenced from
real-world clinical data.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) is an effective imaging tool for
diagnosis tasks that require motion tracking of a certain anatomy. To speed up
DMRI acquisition, k-space measurements are commonly undersampled along spatial
or spatial-temporal domains. The difficulty of recovering useful information
increases with increasing undersampling ratios. Compress sensing was invented
for this purpose and has become the most popular method until deep learning
(DL) based DMRI reconstruction methods emerged in the past decade.
Nevertheless, existing DL networks are still limited in long-range sequential
dependency understanding and computational efficiency and are not fully
automated. Considering the success of Transformers positional embedding and
"swin window" self-attention mechanism in the vision community, especially
natural video understanding, we hereby propose a novel architecture named
Reconstruction Swin Transformer (RST) for 4D MRI. RST inherits the backbone
design of the Video Swin Transformer with a novel reconstruction head
introduced to restore pixel-wise intensity. A convolution network called
SADXNet is used for rapid initialization of 2D MR frames before RST learning to
effectively reduce the model complexity, GPU hardware demand, and training
time. Experimental results in the cardiac 4D MR dataset further substantiate
the superiority of RST, achieving the lowest RMSE of 0.0286 +/- 0.0199 and 1 -
SSIM of 0.0872 +/- 0.0783 on 9 times accelerated validation sequences.

<p class="mathjax">This study reveals a possible correlation between splashing morphology and
the normalized impact force exerted by an impacting drop on a solid surface.
This finding is obtained from a newly proposed feature extraction method and a
subsequent interpretation of the classification of splashing and non-splashing
drops performed by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) video
classifier. Notably, the values of the weight matrix elements of the XAI that
correspond to the extracted features are found to change with the temporal
evolution of the drop morphology. We compute the rate of change of the
contributions of each frame with respect to the classification value of a video
as an important index to quantify the contributions of the extracted splashing
and non-splashing features at different impact times to the classification of
the XAI model. Remarkably, the rate computed for the extracted splashing
features is found to closely match the profile of the normalized impact force,
where the splashing features are most pronounced immediately after the
normalized impact force reaches its peak value. This study has provided an
example that clarifies the relationship between the complex morphological
evolution of a splashing drop and physical parameters by interpreting the
classification of an XAI video classifier.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we seek to simulate rare transitions between metastable states
using score-based generative models. An efficient method for generating
high-quality transition paths is valuable for the study of molecular systems
since data is often difficult to obtain. We develop two novel methods for path
generation in this paper: a chain-based approach and a midpoint-based approach.
The first biases the original dynamics to facilitate transitions, while the
second mirrors splitting techniques and breaks down the original transition
into smaller transitions. Numerical results of generated transition paths for
the M\"uller potential and for Alanine dipeptide demonstrate the effectiveness
of these approaches in both the data-rich and data-scarce regimes.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of Whisper in low-resource languages is still far from
perfect. In addition to a lack of training data on low-resource languages, we
identify some limitations in the beam search algorithm used in Whisper. To
address these issues, we fine-tune Whisper on additional data and propose an
improved decoding algorithm. On the Vietnamese language, fine-tuning
Whisper-Tiny with LoRA leads to an improvement of 38.49 in WER over the
zero-shot Whisper-Tiny setting which is a further reduction of 1.45 compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning. Additionally, by using Filter-Ends and Min
Lookahead decoding algorithms, the WER reduces by 2.26 on average over a range
of languages compared to standard beam search. These results generalise to
larger Whisper model sizes. We also prove a theorem that Min Lookahead
outperforms the standard beam search algorithm used in Whisper.

<p class="mathjax">Domain adaptation (DA) is a statistical learning problem that arises when the
distribution of the source data used to train a model differs from that of the
target data used to evaluate the model. While many DA algorithms have
demonstrated considerable empirical success, blindly applying these algorithms
can often lead to worse performance on new datasets. To address this, it is
crucial to clarify the assumptions under which a DA algorithm has good target
performance. In this work, we focus on the assumption of the presence of
conditionally invariant components (CICs), which are relevant for prediction
and remain conditionally invariant across the source and target data. We
demonstrate that CICs, which can be estimated through conditional invariant
penalty (CIP), play three prominent roles in providing target risk guarantees
in DA. First, we propose a new algorithm based on CICs, importance-weighted
conditional invariant penalty (IW-CIP), which has target risk guarantees beyond
simple settings such as covariate shift and label shift. Second, we show that
CICs help identify large discrepancies between source and target risks of other
DA algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating CICs into the domain
invariant projection (DIP) algorithm can address its failure scenario caused by
label-flipping features. We support our new algorithms and theoretical findings
via numerical experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, and Camelyon17
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise,
instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for
all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding
algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise
present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding
where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement
results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit
Pauli errors for every qubit.
<br />In this setting, we show that Maximum Probability Error (MPE) decoding and
Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard,
respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for MPE decoding, and from #SAT for
ML decoding, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a
qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the
satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of
approximation results for MPE and ML decoding. These are worst-case hardness
results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface
code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes
and for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely
analogous with the known hardness results for MPE and ML decoding of arbitrary
stabilizer codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the dynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with the
goal of deriving an upper bound on their reaction rates. This task is
challenging due to the nonlinear nature and discrete structure inherent in
CRNs. To address this, we employ an information geometric approach, using the
natural gradient, to develop a nonlinear system that yields an upper bound for
CRN dynamics. We validate our approach through numerical simulations,
demonstrating faster convergence in a specific class of CRNs. This class is
characterized by the number of chemicals, the maximum value of stoichiometric
coefficients of the chemical reactions, and the number of reactions. We also
compare our method to a conventional approach, showing that the latter cannot
provide an upper bound on reaction rates of CRNs. While our study focuses on
CRNs, the ubiquity of hypergraphs in fields from natural sciences to
engineering suggests that our method may find broader applications, including
in information science.

transfer of information from low-energy measurements to high-energy BSM models.
We propose to use normalising flows to construct likelihood functions that
achieve this transfer. Likelihood functions constructed in this way provide the
means to generate additional samples and admit a ``trivial'' goodness-of-fit
test in form of a $\chi^2$ test statistic. Here, we study a particular form of

<p class="mathjax">Differentiable quantum architecture search (DQAS) is a gradient-based
framework to design quantum circuits automatically in the NISQ era. It was
motivated by such as low fidelity of quantum hardware, low flexibility of
circuit architecture, high circuit design cost, barren plateau (BP) problem,
and periodicity of weights. People used it to address error mitigation, unitary
decomposition, and quantum approximation optimization problems based on fixed
datasets. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is a part of quantum machine
learning and often has various data. QRL usually uses a manually designed
circuit. However, the pre-defined circuit needs more flexibility for different
tasks, and the circuit design based on various datasets could become
intractable in the case of a large circuit. The problem of whether DQAS can be
applied to quantum deep Q-learning with various datasets is still open. The
main target of this work is to discover the capability of DQAS to solve quantum
deep Q-learning problems. We apply a gradient-based framework DQAS on
reinforcement learning tasks and evaluate it in two different environments -
cart pole and frozen lake. It contains input- and output weights, progressive
search, and other new features. The experiments conclude that DQAS can design
quantum circuits automatically and efficiently. The evaluation results show
significant outperformance compared to the manually designed circuit.
Furthermore, the performance of the automatically created circuit depends on
whether the super-circuit learned well during the training process. This work
is the first to show that gradient-based quantum architecture search is
applicable to QRL tasks.

theory to the domain of quantum systems is presented. It provides a novel
categorical foundation to the theory of quantum information that embraces both
classical and quantum information theory in a natural way, while also allowing
to formalise the notion of quantum environment. A first application of these
ideas is provided by extending the notion of statistical manifold to
incorporate categories, and investigating a possible, uniparametric Cramer-Rao

<p class="mathjax">Quantum neural networks (QNNs) and quantum kernels stand as prominent figures
in the realm of quantum machine learning, poised to leverage the nascent
capabilities of near-term quantum computers to surmount classical machine
learning challenges. Nonetheless, the training efficiency challenge poses a
limitation on both QNNs and quantum kernels, curbing their efficacy when
applied to extensive datasets. To confront this concern, we present a unified
approach: coreset selection, aimed at expediting the training of QNNs and
quantum kernels by distilling a judicious subset from the original training
dataset. Furthermore, we analyze the generalization error bounds of QNNs and
quantum kernels when trained on such coresets, unveiling the comparable
performance with those training on the complete original dataset. Through
systematic numerical simulations, we illuminate the potential of coreset
selection in expediting tasks encompassing synthetic data classification,
identification of quantum correlations, and quantum compiling. Our work offers
a useful way to improve diverse quantum machine learning models with a
theoretical guarantee while reducing the training cost.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual speech enhancement (AV-SE) aims to enhance degraded speech along
with extra visual information such as lip videos, and has been shown to be more
effective than audio-only speech enhancement. This paper proposes the
incorporation of ultrasound tongue images to improve the performance of
lip-based AV-SE systems further. To address the challenge of acquiring
ultrasound tongue images during inference, we first propose to employ knowledge
distillation during training to investigate the feasibility of leveraging
tongue-related information without directly inputting ultrasound tongue images.
Specifically, we guide an audio-lip speech enhancement student model to learn
from a pre-trained audio-lip-tongue speech enhancement teacher model, thus
transferring tongue-related knowledge. To better model the alignment between
the lip and tongue modalities, we further propose the introduction of a
lip-tongue key-value memory network into the AV-SE model. This network enables
the retrieval of tongue features based on readily available lip features,
thereby assisting the subsequent speech enhancement task. Experimental results
demonstrate that both methods significantly improve the quality and
intelligibility of the enhanced speech compared to traditional lip-based AV-SE
baselines. Moreover, both proposed methods exhibit strong generalization
performance on unseen speakers and in the presence of unseen noises.
Furthermore, phone error rate (PER) analysis of automatic speech recognition
(ASR) reveals that while all phonemes benefit from introducing ultrasound
tongue images, palatal and velar consonants benefit most.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation studies play a key role in the validation of causal inference
methods. The simulation results are reliable only if the study is designed
according to the promised operational conditions of the method-in-test. Still,
many causal inference literature tend to design over-restricted or misspecified
studies. In this paper, we elaborate on the problem of improper simulation
design for causal methods and compile a list of desiderata for an effective
simulation framework. We then introduce partially-randomized causal simulation
(PARCS), a simulation framework that meets those desiderata. PARCS synthesizes
data based on graphical causal models and a wide range of adjustable
parameters. There is a legible mapping from usual causal assumptions to the
parameters, thus, users can identify and specify the subset of related
parameters and randomize the remaining ones to generate a range of complying
data-generating processes for their causal method. The result is a more
comprehensive and inclusive empirical investigation for causal claims. Using
PARCS, we reproduce and extend the simulation studies of two well-known causal
discovery and missing data analysis papers to emphasize the necessity of a
proper simulation design. Our results show that those papers would have
improved and extended the findings, had they used PARCS for simulation. The
framework is implemented as a Python package, too. By discussing the
comprehensiveness and transparency of PARCS, we encourage causal inference
researchers to utilize it as a standard tool for future works.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel integration of an instruction-tuned large language model
(LLM) and end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern LLMs can
perform a wide range of linguistic tasks within zero-shot learning when
provided with a precise instruction or a prompt to guide the text generation
process towards the desired task. We explore using this zero-shot capability of
LLMs to extract linguistic information that can contribute to improving ASR
performance. Specifically, we direct an LLM to correct grammatical errors in an
ASR hypothesis and harness the embedded linguistic knowledge to conduct
end-to-end ASR. The proposed model is built on the hybrid connectionist
temporal classification (CTC) and attention architecture, where an
instruction-tuned LLM (i.e., Llama2) is employed as a front-end of the decoder.
An ASR hypothesis, subject to correction, is obtained from the encoder via CTC
decoding, which is then fed into the LLM along with an instruction. The decoder
subsequently takes as input the LLM embeddings to perform sequence generation,
incorporating acoustic information from the encoder output. Experimental
results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed integration yields promising
performance improvements, and our approach largely benefits from LLM-based
rescoring.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in audio generation have been spurred by the evolution of
large-scale deep learning models and expansive datasets. However, the task of
video-to-audio (V2A) generation continues to be a challenge, principally
because of the intricate relationship between the high-dimensional visual and
auditory data, and the challenges associated with temporal synchronization. In
this study, we introduce FoleyGen, an open-domain V2A generation system built
on a language modeling paradigm. FoleyGen leverages an off-the-shelf neural
audio codec for bidirectional conversion between waveforms and discrete tokens.
The generation of audio tokens is facilitated by a single Transformer model,
which is conditioned on visual features extracted from a visual encoder. A
prevalent problem in V2A generation is the misalignment of generated audio with
the visible actions in the video. To address this, we explore three novel
visual attention mechanisms. We further undertake an exhaustive evaluation of
multiple visual encoders, each pretrained on either single-modal or multi-modal
tasks. The experimental results on VGGSound dataset show that our proposed
FoleyGen outperforms previous systems across all objective metrics and human
evaluations.

studied for two cases: i) continuous and ii) discrete random variables. First,
a recursive formula of the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) is
derived in both cases. Then, recurrence relations of the joint probability
density function (PDF) and the joint probability mass function (PMF) are given
in the former and the latter case, respectively. Interestingly, there is a
fundamental difference between the joint PDF and PMF. The proofs are simple and

<p class="mathjax">We investigate nonlinear prediction/regression in an online setting and
introduce a hybrid model that effectively mitigates, via a joint mechanism
through a state space formulation, the need for domain-specific feature
engineering issues of conventional nonlinear prediction models and achieves an
efficient mix of nonlinear and linear components. In particular, we use
recursive structures to extract features from raw sequential sequences and a
traditional linear time series model to deal with the intricacies of the
sequential data, e.g., seasonality, trends. The state-of-the-art ensemble or
hybrid models typically train the base models in a disjoint manner, which is
not only time consuming but also sub-optimal due to the separation of modeling
or independent training. In contrast, as the first time in the literature, we
jointly optimize an enhanced recurrent neural network (LSTM) for automatic
feature extraction from raw data and an ARMA-family time series model (SARIMAX)
for effectively addressing peculiarities associated with time series data. We
achieve this by introducing novel state space representations for the base
models, which are then combined to provide a full state space representation of
the hybrid or the ensemble. Hence, we are able to jointly optimize both models
in a single pass via particle filtering, for which we also provide the update
equations. The introduced architecture is generic so that one can use other
recurrent architectures, e.g., GRUs, traditional time series-specific models,
e.g., ETS or other optimization methods, e.g., EKF, UKF. Due to such novel
combination and joint optimization, we demonstrate significant improvements in
widely publicized real life competition datasets. We also openly share our code
for further research and replicability of our results.

a given planet using Machine Learning. We consider four different kinds of
motion in mean motion resonance with the planet, nominally Tadpole, Horseshoe
and Quasi-satellite, building 3 datasets defined as Real (taking the
ephemerides of real asteroids from the JPL Horizons system), Ideal and
Perturbed (both simulated, obtained by propagating initial conditions
considering two different dynamical systems) for training and testing the
Machine Learning algorithms in different conditions.
<br />The time series of the variable theta (angle related to the resonance) are
studied with a data analysis pipeline defined ad hoc for the problem and
composed by: data creation and annotation, time series features extraction
thanks to the tsfresh package (potentially followed by selection and
standardization) and the application of Machine Learning algorithms for
Dimensionality Reduction and Classification. Such approach, based on features
extracted from the time series, allows to work with a smaller number of data
with respect to Deep Learning algorithms, also allowing to define a ranking of
the importance of the features. Physical Interpretability of the features is
another key point of this approach. In addition, we introduce the SHapley
Additive exPlanations for Explainability technique.
<br />Different training and test sets are used, in order to understand the power
and the limits of our approach. The results show how the algorithms are able to
identify and classify correctly the time series, with a high degree of
performance.

<p class="mathjax">We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity
properties of their best-response graphs. In particular, we show that almost
every 'large' generic game that has a pure Nash equilibrium is connected,
meaning that every non-equilibrium action profile can reach every pure Nash
equilibrium via best-response paths. This has implications for dynamics in
games: many adaptive dynamics, such as the best-response dynamic with inertia,
lead to equilibrium in connected games. It follows that there are simple,
uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost
surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in almost every 'large' generic game that has
one. We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our
characterisation of game connectivity.

<p class="mathjax">The exploration of pathways and alternative pathways that have a specific
function is of interest in numerous chemical contexts. A framework for
specifying and searching for pathways has previously been developed, but a
focus on which of the many pathway solutions are realisable, or can be made
realisable, is missing. Realisable here means that there actually exists some
sequencing of the reactions of the pathway that will execute the pathway. We
present a method for analysing the realisability of pathways based on the
reachability question in Petri nets. For realisable pathways, our method also
provides a certificate encoding an order of the reactions which realises the
pathway. We present two extended notions of realisability of pathways, one of
which is related to the concept of network catalysts. We exemplify our findings
on the pentose phosphate pathway. Lastly, we discuss the relevance of our
concepts for elucidating the choices often implicitly made when depicting
pathways.

<p class="mathjax">Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) is an essential technique to
investigate volumetric tissue ultra-structure. Due to technical limitations and
high imaging costs, samples are often imaged anisotropically, where resolution
in the axial direction ($z$) is lower than in the lateral directions $(x,y)$.
This anisotropy 3DEM can hamper subsequent analysis and visualization tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based
self-supervised super-resolution approach that computationally reconstructs
isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition. The proposed DL-based
framework is built upon the U-shape architecture incorporating
vision-transformer (ViT) blocks, enabling high-capability learning of local and
global multi-scale image dependencies. To train the tailored network, we employ
a self-supervised approach. Specifically, we generate pairs of anisotropic and
isotropic training datasets from the given anisotropic 3DEM data. By feeding
the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset in the trained network through our proposed
framework, the isotropic 3DEM is obtained. Importantly, this isotropic
reconstruction approach relies solely on the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset and
does not require pairs of co-registered anisotropic and isotropic 3DEM training
datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted
experiments using three 3DEM datasets acquired from brain. The experimental
results demonstrated that our proposed framework could successfully reconstruct
isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of steering the distribution of the state of
a discrete-time linear system to a given target distribution while minimizing
an entropy-regularized cost functional. This problem is called a maximum
entropy (MaxEnt) density control problem. Specifically, the running cost is
given by quadratic forms of the state and the control input, and the initial
and final distributions are Gaussian. We first reveal that our problem boils
down to solving two Riccati difference equations coupled through their boundary
values. Based on them, we give the closed-form expression of the unique optimal
policy. Next, we show that the optimal policy for the density control of the
time-reversed system can be obtained simultaneously with the forward-time
optimal policy. Finally, by considering the limit where the entropy
regularization vanishes, we derive the optimal policy for the unregularized
density control problem.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of learning an $\epsilon$-approximate solution for
the discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem via a Stochastic
Variance-Reduced Policy Gradient (SVRPG) approach. Whilst policy gradient
methods have proven to converge linearly to the optimal solution of the
model-free LQR problem, the substantial requirement for two-point cost queries
in gradient estimations may be intractable, particularly in applications where
obtaining cost function evaluations at two distinct control input
configurations is exceptionally costly. To this end, we propose an
oracle-efficient approach. Our method combines both one-point and two-point
estimations in a dual-loop variance-reduced algorithm. It achieves an
approximate optimal solution with only
$O\left(\log\left(1/\epsilon\right)^{\beta}\right)$ two-point cost information
for $\beta \in (0,1)$.

<p class="mathjax">While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are widely used in many
real-world applications, they often do not generalize well to new domains and
need to be finetuned on data from these domains. However, target-domain data
usually are not readily available in many scenarios. In this paper, we propose
a new strategy for adapting ASR models to new target domains without any text
or speech from those domains. To accomplish this, we propose a novel data
synthesis pipeline that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a target
domain text corpus, and a state-of-the-art controllable speech synthesis model
to generate the corresponding speech. We propose a simple yet effective
in-context instruction finetuning strategy to increase the effectiveness of LLM
in generating text corpora for new domains. Experiments on the SLURP dataset
show that the proposed method achieves an average relative word error rate
improvement of $28\%$ on unseen target domains without any performance drop in
source domains.

<p class="mathjax">NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission collects large data volumes
of the Sun's daily activity. Data compression is crucial for space missions to
reduce data storage and video bandwidth requirements by eliminating
redundancies in the data. In this paper, we present a novel neural
Transformer-based video compression approach specifically designed for the SDO
images. Our primary objective is to efficiently exploit the temporal and
spatial redundancies inherent in solar images to obtain a high compression
ratio. Our proposed architecture benefits from a novel Transformer block called
Fused Local-aware Window (FLaWin), which incorporates window-based
self-attention modules and an efficient fused local-aware feed-forward (FLaFF)
network. This architectural design allows us to simultaneously capture
short-range and long-range information while facilitating the extraction of
rich and diverse contextual representations. Moreover, this design choice
results in reduced computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate
the significant contribution of the FLaWin Transformer block to the compression
performance, outperforming conventional hand-engineered video codecs such as
H.264 and H.265 in terms of rate-distortion trade-off.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual representation learning aims to develop systems with human-like
perception by utilizing correlation between auditory and visual information.
However, current models often focus on a limited set of tasks, and
generalization abilities of learned representations are unclear. To this end,
we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of
unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering
5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent
self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all
tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model
performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with
intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet
serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation
code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in
audio-visual learning.

<p class="mathjax">Missions studying the dynamic behaviour of the Sun are defined to capture
multi-spectral images of the sun and transmit them to the ground station in a
daily basis. To make transmission efficient and feasible, image compression
systems need to be exploited. Recently successful end-to-end optimized neural
network-based image compression systems have shown great potential to be used
in an ad-hoc manner. In this work we have proposed a transformer-based
multi-spectral neural image compressor to efficiently capture redundancies both
intra/inter-wavelength. To unleash the locality of window-based self attention
mechanism, we propose an inter-window aggregated token multi head self
attention. Additionally to make the neural compressor autoencoder shift
invariant, a randomly shifted window attention mechanism is used which makes
the transformer blocks insensitive to translations in their input domain. We
demonstrate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the conventional
compression algorithms but also it is able to better decorrelates images along
the multiple wavelengths compared to single spectral compression.

<p class="mathjax">Transform and entropy models are the two core components in deep image
compression neural networks. Most existing learning-based image compression
methods utilize convolutional-based transform, which lacks the ability to model
long-range dependencies, primarily due to the limited receptive field of the
convolution operation. To address this limitation, we propose a
Transformer-based nonlinear transform. This transform has the remarkable
ability to efficiently capture both local and global information from the input
image, leading to a more decorrelated latent representation. In addition, we
introduce a novel entropy model that incorporates two different hyperpriors to
model cross-channel and spatial dependencies of the latent representation. To
further improve the entropy model, we add a global context that leverages
distant relationships to predict the current latent more accurately. This
global context employs a causal attention mechanism to extract long-range
information in a content-dependent manner. Our experiments show that our
proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms
of rate-distortion performance.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have emerged as a popular family of deep generative models
(DGMs). In the literature, it has been claimed that one class of diffusion
models -- denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) -- demonstrate
superior image synthesis performance as compared to generative adversarial
networks (GANs). To date, these claims have been evaluated using either
ensemble-based methods designed for natural images, or conventional measures of
image quality such as structural similarity. However, there remains an
important need to understand the extent to which DDPMs can reliably learn
medical imaging domain-relevant information, which is referred to as `spatial
context' in this work. To address this, a systematic assessment of the ability
of DDPMs to learn spatial context relevant to medical imaging applications is
reported for the first time. A key aspect of the studies is the use of
stochastic context models (SCMs) to produce training data. In this way, the
ability of the DDPMs to reliably reproduce spatial context can be
quantitatively assessed by use of post-hoc image analyses. Error-rates in
DDPM-generated ensembles are reported, and compared to those corresponding to a
modern GAN. The studies reveal new and important insights regarding the
capacity of DDPMs to learn spatial context. Notably, the results demonstrate
that DDPMs hold significant capacity for generating contextually correct images
that are `interpolated' between training samples, which may benefit
data-augmentation tasks in ways that GANs cannot.
