<p class="mathjax">Due to intelligent, adaptive nature towards various operations and their
ability to provide maximum comfort to the occupants residing in them, smart
buildings are becoming a pioneering area of research. Since these architectures
leverage the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for monitoring different
operations (Occupancy, Humidity, Temperature, CO2, etc.) to provide sustainable
comfort to the occupants. This paper proposes a novel approach for intelligent
building operations monitoring using rule-based complex event processing and
query-based approaches for dynamically monitoring the different operations.
Siddhi is a complex event processing engine designed for handling multiple
sources of event data in real time and processing it according to predefined
rules using a decision tree. Since streaming data is dynamic in nature, to keep
track of different operations, we have converted the IoT data into an RDF
dataset. The RDF dataset is ingested to Apache Kafka for streaming purposes and
for stored data we have used the GraphDB tool that extracts information with
the help of SPARQL query. Consequently, the proposed approach is also evaluated
by deploying the large number of events through the Siddhi CEP engine and how
efficiently they are processed in terms of time. Apart from that, a risk
estimation scenario is also designed to generate alerts for end users in case
any of the smart building operations need immediate attention. The output is
visualized and monitored for the end user through a tableau dashboard.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we provide framework to cope with two problems: (i) the
fragility of reinforcement learning due to modeling uncertainties because of
the mismatch between controlled laboratory/simulation and real-world conditions
and (ii) the prohibitive computational cost of stochastic optimal control. We
approach both problems by using reinforcement learning to solve the stochastic
dynamic programming equation. The resulting reinforcement learning controller
is safe with respect to several types of constraints constraints and it can
actively learn about the modeling uncertainties. Unlike exploration and
exploitation, probing and safety are employed automatically by the controller
itself, resulting real-time learning. A simulation example demonstrates the
efficacy of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-channel speech enhancement extracts speech using multiple microphones
that capture spatial cues. Effectively utilizing directional information is key
for multi-channel enhancement. Deep learning shows great potential on
multi-channel speech enhancement and often takes short-time Fourier Transform
(STFT) as inputs directly. To fully leverage the spatial information, we
introduce a method using spherical harmonics transform (SHT) coefficients as
auxiliary model inputs. These coefficients concisely represent spatial
distributions. Specifically, our model has two encoders, one for the STFT and
another for the SHT. By fusing both encoders in the decoder to estimate the
enhanced STFT, we effectively incorporate spatial context. Evaluations on TIMIT
under varying noise and reverberation show our model outperforms established
benchmarks. Remarkably, this is achieved with fewer computations and
parameters. By leveraging spherical harmonics to incorporate directional cues,
our model efficiently improves the performance of the multi-channel speech
enhancement.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a new method for enhancing communication efficiency in
stochastic Federated Learning that trains over-parameterized random networks.
In this setting, a binary mask is optimized instead of the model weights, which
are kept fixed. The mask characterizes a sparse sub-network that is able to
generalize as good as a smaller target network. Importantly, sparse binary
masks are exchanged rather than the floating point weights in traditional
federated learning, reducing communication cost to at most 1 bit per parameter.
We show that previous state of the art stochastic methods fail to find the
sparse networks that can reduce the communication and storage overhead using
consistent loss objectives. To address this, we propose adding a regularization
term to local objectives that encourages sparser solutions by eliminating
redundant features across sub-networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in communication and memory efficiency of up to five
magnitudes compared to the literature, with minimal performance degradation in
validation accuracy in some instances.

<p class="mathjax">Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic
tool for cardiac diseases. However, a limitation of CMR is its slow imaging
speed, which causes patient discomfort and introduces artifacts in the images.
There has been growing interest in deep learning-based CMR imaging algorithms
that can reconstruct high-quality images from highly under-sampled k-space
data. However, the development of deep learning methods requires large training
datasets, which have not been publicly available for CMR. To address this gap,
we released a dataset that includes multi-contrast, multi-view, multi-slice and
multi-coil CMR imaging data from 300 subjects. Imaging studies include cardiac
cine and mapping sequences. Manual segmentations of the myocardium and chambers
of all the subjects are also provided within the dataset. Scripts of
state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms were also provided as a point of
reference. Our aim is to facilitate the advancement of state-of-the-art CMR
image reconstruction by introducing standardized evaluation criteria and making
the dataset freely accessible to the research community. Researchers can access
the dataset at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51471091/wiki/.

<p class="mathjax">AI Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has the potential to improve human
decision-making beyond AI predictions alone by providing additional useful
probabilistic information to users. The majority of past research on AI and
human decision-making has concentrated on model explainability and
interpretability. We implemented instance-based UQ for three real datasets. To
achieve this, we trained different AI models for classification for each
dataset, and used random samples generated around the neighborhood of the given
instance to create confidence intervals for UQ. The computed UQ was calibrated
using a strictly proper scoring rule as a form of quality assurance for UQ. We
then conducted two preregistered online behavioral experiments that compared
objective human decision-making performance under different AI information
conditions, including UQ. In Experiment 1, we compared decision-making for no
AI (control), AI prediction alone, and AI prediction with a visualization of
UQ. We found UQ significantly improved decision-making beyond the other two
conditions. In Experiment 2, we focused on comparing different representations
of UQ information: Point vs. distribution of uncertainty and visualization type
(needle vs. dotplot). We did not find meaningful differences in decision-making
performance among these different representations of UQ. Overall, our results
indicate that human decision-making can be improved by providing UQ information
along with AI predictions, and that this benefit generalizes across a variety
of representations of UQ.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing hand gesture recognition (HGR) systems are limited to a
predefined set of gestures. However, users and developers often want to
recognize new, unseen gestures. This is challenging due to the vast diversity
of all plausible hand shapes, e.g. it is impossible for developers to include
all hand gestures in a predefined list. In this paper, we present a
user-friendly framework that lets users easily customize and deploy their own
gesture recognition pipeline. Our framework provides a pre-trained single-hand
embedding model that can be fine-tuned for custom gesture recognition. Users
can perform gestures in front of a webcam to collect a small amount of images
per gesture. We also offer a low-code solution to train and deploy the custom
gesture recognition model. This makes it easy for users with limited ML
expertise to use our framework. We further provide a no-code web front-end for
users without any ML expertise. This makes it even easier to build and test the
end-to-end pipeline. The resulting custom HGR is then ready to be run on-device
for real-time scenarios. This can be done by calling a simple function in our
open-sourced model inference API, MediaPipe Tasks. This entire process only
takes a few minutes.

<p class="mathjax">SOS TUTORIA UC is a student connection application aimed at facilitating
academic assistance between students through external tutoring outside of the
application. To achieve this, a responsive web application was designed and
implemented, integrated with the WeNet platform, which provides various
services for user management and user recommendation algorithms. This study
presents the development and validation of the experience in the application by
evaluating the importance of incorporating the dimension of personality traits,
according to the Big Five model, in the process of recommending students for
academic tutoring. The goal is to provide support for students to find others
with greater knowledge and with a personality that is \'different\',
\'similar\' or \'indifferent\' to their own preferences for receiving academic
assistance on a specific topic. The integration with the WeNet platform was
successful in terms of components, and the results of the recommendation system
testing were positive but have room for improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Procedural city generation that focuses on believability and adaptability to
random terrain is a difficult challenge in the field of Procedural Content
Generation (PCG). Dozens of researchers compete for a realistic approach in
challenges such as the Generative Settlement Design in Minecraft (GDMC), in
which our method has won the 2022 competition. This was achieved through a
decentralised, iterative planning process that is transferable to similar
generation processes that aims to produce "organic" content procedurally.

<p class="mathjax">We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for control policies executed
on stochastic robotic systems. Given an open- or closed-loop policy and a
finite set of trajectory rollouts under the policy, we bound the expected
value, value-at-risk, and conditional-value-at-risk of the trajectory cost, and
the probability of failure in a sparse rewards setting. The bounds hold, with
user-specified probability, for any policy synthesis technique and can be seen
as a post-design safety certification. Generating the bounds only requires
sampling simulation rollouts, without assumptions on the distribution or
complexity of the underlying stochastic system. We adapt these bounds to also
give a constraint satisfaction test to verify safety of the robot system.
Furthermore, we extend our method to apply when selecting the best policy from
a set of candidates, requiring a multi-hypothesis correction. We show the
statistical validity of our bounds in the Ant, Half-cheetah, and Swimmer MuJoCo
environments and demonstrate our constraint satisfaction test with the Ant.
Finally, using the 20 degree-of-freedom MuJoCo Shadow Hand, we show the
necessity of the multi-hypothesis correction.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of edge devices has unlocked unprecedented opportunities
for deep learning model deployment in computer vision applications. However,
these complex models require considerable power, memory and compute resources
that are typically not available on edge platforms. Ultra low-bit quantization
presents an attractive solution to this problem by scaling down the model
weights and activations from 32-bit to less than 8-bit. We implement highly
optimized ultra low-bit convolution operators for ARM-based targets that
outperform existing methods by up to 4.34x. Our operator is implemented within
Deeplite Runtime (DeepliteRT), an end-to-end solution for the compilation,
tuning, and inference of ultra low-bit models on ARM devices. Compiler passes
in DeepliteRT automatically convert a fake-quantized model in full precision to
a compact ultra low-bit representation, easing the process of quantized model
deployment on commodity hardware. We analyze the performance of DeepliteRT on
classification and detection models against optimized 32-bit floating-point,
8-bit integer, and 2-bit baselines, achieving significant speedups of up to
2.20x, 2.33x and 2.17x, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Our research explores the use of natural language processing (NLP) methods to
automatically classify entities for the purpose of knowledge graph population
and integration with food system ontologies. We have created NLP models that
can automatically classify organizations with respect to categories associated
with environmental issues as well as Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
codes, which are used by the U.S. government to characterize business
activities. As input, the NLP models are provided with text snippets retrieved
by the Google search engine for each organization, which serves as a textual
description of the organization that is used for learning. Our experimental
results show that NLP models can achieve reasonably good performance for these
two classification tasks, and they rely on a general framework that could be
applied to many other classification problems as well. We believe that NLP
models represent a promising approach for automatically harvesting information
to populate knowledge graphs and aligning the information with existing
ontologies through shared categories and concepts.

<p class="mathjax">Nanorobotics offers an emerging frontier in biomedicine, holding the
potential to revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic applications through its
unique capabilities in manipulating biological systems at the nanoscale.
Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted
using IEEE Xplore and PubMed databases, resulting in the identification and
analysis of a total of 414 papers. The studies were filtered to include only
those that addressed both nanorobotics and direct medical applications. Our
analysis traces the technology's evolution, highlighting its growing prominence
in medicine as evidenced by the increasing number of publications over time.
Applications ranged from targeted drug delivery and single-cell manipulation to
minimally invasive surgery and biosensing. Despite the promise, limitations
such as biocompatibility, precise control, and ethical concerns were also
identified. This review aims to offer a thorough overview of the state of
nanorobotics in medicine, drawing attention to current challenges and
opportunities, and providing directions for future research in this rapidly

<p class="mathjax">Camera-based tactile sensing is a low-cost, popular approach to obtain highly
detailed contact geometry information. However, most existing camera-based
tactile sensors are fingertip sensors, and longer fingers often require
extraneous elements to obtain an extended sensing area similar to the full
length of a human finger. Moreover, existing methods to estimate proprioceptive
information such as total forces and torques applied on the finger from
camera-based tactile sensors are not effective when the contact geometry is
complex. We introduce GelSight Svelte, a curved, human finger-sized,
single-camera tactile sensor that is capable of both tactile and proprioceptive
sensing over a large area. GelSight Svelte uses curved mirrors to achieve the
desired shape and sensing coverage. Proprioceptive information, such as the
total bending and twisting torques applied on the finger, is reflected as
deformations on the flexible backbone of GelSight Svelte, which are also
captured by the camera. We train a convolutional neural network to estimate the
bending and twisting torques from the captured images. We conduct gel
deformation experiments at various locations of the finger to evaluate the
tactile sensing capability and proprioceptive sensing accuracy. To demonstrate
the capability and potential uses of GelSight Svelte, we conduct an object
holding task with three different grasping modes that utilize different areas
of the finger. More information is available on our website:

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a Time-Frequency Space Transformation (TFST) to derive
non-orthogonal bases for modulation techniques over the delay-doppler plane. A
family of Overloaded Delay-Doppler Modulation (ODDM) techniques is proposed
based on the TFST, which enhances flexibility and efficiency by expressing
modulated signals as a linear combination of basis signals. A Non-Orthogonal
Time-Frequency Space (NOTFS) digital modulation is derived for the proposed
ODDM techniques, and simulations show that they offer high-mobility
communication systems with improved spectral efficiency and low latency,
particularly in challenging scenarios such as high overloading factors and
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. A modified sphere decoding
algorithm is also presented to efficiently decode the received signal. The
proposed modulation and decoding techniques contribute to the advancement of
non-orthogonal approaches in the next-generation of mobile communication
systems, delivering superior spectral efficiency and low latency, and offering
a promising solution towards the development of efficient high-mobility
communication systems.

<p class="mathjax">Graphs are a widely used data structure for collecting and analyzing
relational data. However, when the graph structure is distributed across
several parties, its analysis is particularly challenging. In particular, due
to the sensitivity of the data each party might want to keep their partial
knowledge of the graph private, while still willing to collaborate with the
other parties for tasks of mutual benefit, such as data curation or the removal
of poisoned data. To address this challenge, we propose Crypto'Graph, an
efficient protocol for privacy-preserving link prediction on distributed
graphs. More precisely, it allows parties partially sharing a graph with
distributed links to infer the likelihood of formation of new links in the
future. Through the use of cryptographic primitives, Crypto'Graph is able to
compute the likelihood of these new links on the joint network without
revealing the structure of the private individual graph of each party, even
though they know the number of nodes they have, since they share the same graph
but not the same links. Crypto'Graph improves on previous works by enabling the
computation of a certain number of similarity metrics without any additional
cost. The use of Crypto'Graph is illustrated for defense against graph
poisoning attacks, in which it is possible to identify potential adversarial
links without compromising the privacy of the graphs of individual parties. The
effectiveness of Crypto'Graph in mitigating graph poisoning attacks and
achieving high prediction accuracy on a graph neural network node
classification task is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on a
real-world dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is a central task in multilingual NLP,
allowing models trained in languages with more sufficient training resources to
generalize to other low-resource languages. Earlier efforts on this task use
parallel corpora, bilingual dictionaries, or other annotated alignment data to
improve cross-lingual transferability, which are typically expensive to obtain.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method, SALT, to improve the
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer of the multilingual pretrained language models
without the help of such external data. By incorporating code-switching and
embedding mixup with self-augmentation, SALT effectively distills cross-lingual
knowledge from the multilingual PLM and enhances its transferability on
downstream tasks. Experimental results on XNLI and PAWS-X show that our method
is able to improve zero-shot cross-lingual transferability without external
data. Our code is available at https://github.com/luka-group/SALT.

<p class="mathjax">Hybrid dynamical systems with non-linear dynamics are one of the most general
modeling tools for representing robotic systems, especially contact-rich
systems. However, providing guarantees regarding the safety or performance of
such hybrid systems can still prove to be a challenging problem because it
requires simultaneous reasoning about continuous state evolution and discrete
mode switching. In this work, we address this problem by extending classical
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, a formal verification method for
continuous non-linear dynamics in the presence of bounded inputs and
disturbances, to hybrid dynamical systems. Our framework can compute reachable
sets for hybrid systems consisting of multiple discrete modes, each with its
own set of non-linear continuous dynamics, discrete transitions that can be
directly commanded or forced by a discrete control input, while still
accounting for control bounds and adversarial disturbances in the state
evolution. Along with the reachable set, the proposed framework also provides
an optimal continuous and discrete controller to ensure system safety. We
demonstrate our framework in simulation on an aircraft collision avoidance
problem, as well as on a real-world testbed to solve the optimal mode planning
problem for a quadruped with multiple gaits.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new
opportunities for healthcare, from information synthesis to clinical decision
support. These new LLMs are not just capable of modeling language, but can also
act as intelligent "agents" that interact with stakeholders in open-ended
conversations and even influence clinical decision-making. Rather than relying
on benchmarks that measure a model's ability to process clinical data or answer
standardized test questions, LLM agents should be assessed for their
performance on real-world clinical tasks. These new evaluation frameworks,
which we call "Artificial-intelligence Structured Clinical Examinations"
("AI-SCI"), can draw from comparable technologies where machines operate with
varying degrees of self-governance, such as self-driving cars. High-fidelity
simulations may also be used to evaluate interactions between users and LLMs
within a clinical workflow, or to model the dynamic interactions of multiple
LLMs. Developing these robust, real-world clinical evaluations will be crucial
towards deploying LLM agents into healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">This document presents PLVS: a real-time system that leverages sparse SLAM,
volumetric mapping, and 3D unsupervised incremental segmentation. PLVS stands
for Points, Lines, Volumetric mapping, and Segmentation. It supports RGB-D and
Stereo cameras, which may be optionally equipped with IMUs. The SLAM module is
keyframe-based, and extracts and tracks sparse points and line segments as
features. Volumetric mapping runs in parallel with respect to the SLAM
front-end and generates a 3D reconstruction of the explored environment by
fusing point clouds backprojected from keyframes. Different volumetric mapping
methods are supported and integrated in PLVS. We use a novel reprojection error
to bundle-adjust line segments. This error exploits available depth information
to stabilize the position estimates of line segment endpoints. An incremental
and geometric-based segmentation method is implemented and integrated for RGB-D
cameras in the PLVS framework. We present qualitative and quantitative
evaluations of the PLVS framework on some publicly available datasets. The
appendix details the adopted stereo line triangulation method and provides a
derivation of the Jacobians we used for line error terms. The software is
available as open-source.

<p class="mathjax">The text editing tasks, including sentence fusion, sentence splitting and
rephrasing, text simplification, and Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), share
a common trait of dealing with highly similar input and output sequences. This
area of research lies at the intersection of two well-established fields: (i)
fully autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approaches commonly used in tasks
like Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and (ii) sequence tagging techniques
commonly used to address tasks such as Part-of-speech tagging, Named-entity
recognition (NER), and similar. In the pursuit of a balanced architecture,
researchers have come up with numerous imaginative and unconventional
solutions, which we're discussing in the Related Works section. Our approach to
addressing text editing tasks is called RedPenNet and is aimed at reducing
architectural and parametric redundancies presented in specific
Sequence-To-Edits models, preserving their semi-autoregressive advantages. Our
models achieve $F_{0.5}$ scores of 77.60 on the BEA-2019 (test), which can be
considered as state-of-the-art the only exception for system combination and
67.71 on the UAGEC+Fluency (test) benchmarks.
<br />This research is being conducted in the context of the UNLP 2023 workshop,
where it was presented as a paper as a paper for the Shared Task in Grammatical
Error Correction (GEC) for Ukrainian. This study aims to apply the RedPenNet
approach to address the GEC problem in the Ukrainian language.

<p class="mathjax">Many XR devices use bare-hand gestures to reduce the need for handheld
controllers. Such gestures, however, lead to false positive and false negative
recognition errors, which detract from the user experience. While mediation
techniques enable users to overcome recognition errors by clarifying their
intentions via UI elements, little research has explored how mediation
techniques should be designed in XR and how a user's task and context may
impact their design preferences. This research presents empirical studies about
the impact of user perceived error costs on users' preferences for three
mediation technique designs, under different simulated scenarios that were
inspired by real-life tasks. Based on a large-scale crowd-sourced survey and an
immersive VR-based user study, our results suggest that the varying contexts
within each task type can impact users' perceived error costs, leading to
different preferred mediation techniques. We further discuss the study
implications of these results on future XR interaction design.

<p class="mathjax">This letter describes an incremental multimodal surface mapping methodology,
which represents the environment as a continuous probabilistic model. This
model enables high-resolution reconstruction while simultaneously compressing
spatial and intensity point cloud data. The strategy employed in this work
utilizes Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to represent the environment. While
prior GMM-based mapping works have developed methodologies to determine the
number of mixture components using information-theoretic techniques, these
approaches either operate on individual sensor observations, making them
unsuitable for incremental mapping, or are not real-time viable, especially for
applications where high-fidelity modeling is required. To bridge this gap, this
letter introduces a spatial hash map for rapid GMM submap extraction combined
with an approach to determine relevant and redundant data in a point cloud.
These contributions increase computational speed by an order of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art incremental GMM-based mapping. In addition, the
proposed approach yields a superior tradeoff in map accuracy and size when
compared to state-of-the-art mapping methodologies (both GMM- and not
GMM-based). Evaluations are conducted using both simulated and real-world data.
The software is released open-source to benefit the robotics community.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel algorithm for motion planning in complex, multi-agent
scenarios in which occlusions prevent all agents from seeing one another. In
this setting, the fundamental information that each agent has, i.e., the
information structure of the interaction, is determined by the precise
configurations in which agents come into view of one another. Occlusions
prevent the use of existing pure feedback solutions, which assume availability
of the state information of all agents at every time step. On the other hand,
existing open-loop solutions only assume availability of the initial agent
states. Thus, they do not fully utilize the information available to agents
during periods of unhampered visibility. Here, we first introduce an algorithm
for solving an occluded, linear-quadratic (LQ) dynamic game, which computes
Nash equilibrium by using hybrid information and switching between feedback and
open-loop information structures. We then design an efficient iterative
algorithm for decision-making which exploits this hybrid information structure.
Our method is demonstrated in overtaking and intersection traffic scenarios.
Results confirm that our method outputs trajectories with favorable running
times, converging much faster than recent methods employing reachability
analysis.

<p class="mathjax">As consumer adoption of immersive technologies grows, virtual avatars will
play a prominent role in the future of social computing. However, as people
begin to interact more frequently through virtual avatars, it is important to
ensure that the research community has validated tools to evaluate the effects
and consequences of such technologies. We present the first iteration of a new,
freely available 3D avatar library called the Virtual Avatar Library for
Inclusion and Diversity (VALID), which includes 210 fully rigged avatars with a
focus on advancing racial diversity and inclusion. We present a detailed
process for creating, iterating, and validating avatars of diversity. Through a
large online study (n=132) with participants from 33 countries, we provide
statistically validated labels for each avatar's perceived race and gender.
Through our validation study, we also advance knowledge pertaining to the
perception of an avatar's race. In particular, we found that avatars of some
races were more accurately identified by participants of the same race.

<p class="mathjax">We consider selfish sources that send updates to a monitor over a shared
wireless access. The sources would like to minimize the age of their
information at the monitor. Our goal is to devise strategies that incentivize
such sources to use the shared spectrum cooperatively. Earlier work has modeled
such a setting using a non-cooperative one-shot game, played over a single
access slot, and has shown that under certain access settings the dominant
strategy of each source is to transmit in any slot, resulting in packet
collisions between the sources' transmissions and causing all of them to be
decoded in error at the monitor.
<br />We capture the interaction of the sources over an infinitely many medium
access slots using infinitely repeated games. We investigate strategies that
enable cooperation resulting in an efficient use of the wireless access, while
disincentivizing any source from unilaterally deviating from the strategy.
Formally, we are interested in strategies that are a subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium (SPNE). We begin by investigating the properties of the one-stage
(slot) optimal and access-fair correlated strategies. We then consider their
many-slot variants, the age-fair and access-fair strategies, in the infinitely
repeated game model. We prove that the access-fair and age-fair strategies are
SPNEs for when collision slots are longer than successful transmission slots.
Otherwise, neither is a SPNE. We end with simulations that shed light on a
possible SPNE for the latter case.

<p class="mathjax">Pathology diagnosis based on EEG signals and decoding brain activity holds
immense importance in understanding neurological disorders. With the
advancement of artificial intelligence methods and machine learning techniques,
the potential for accurate data-driven diagnoses and effective treatments has
grown significantly. However, applying machine learning algorithms to
real-world datasets presents diverse challenges at multiple levels. The
scarcity of labelled data, especially in low regime scenarios with limited
availability of real patient cohorts due to high costs of recruitment,
underscores the vital deployment of scaling and transfer learning techniques.
In this study, we explore a real-world pathology classification task to
highlight the effectiveness of data and model scaling and cross-dataset
knowledge transfer. As such, we observe varying performance improvements
through data scaling, indicating the need for careful evaluation and labelling.
Additionally, we identify the challenges of possible negative transfer and
emphasize the significance of some key components to overcome distribution
shifts and potential spurious correlations and achieve positive transfer. We
see improvement in the performance of the target model on the target (NMT)
datasets by using the knowledge from the source dataset (TUAB) when a low
amount of labelled data was available. Our findings indicate a small and
generic model (e.g. ShallowNet) performs well on a single dataset, however, a
larger model (e.g. TCN) performs better on transfer and learning from a larger
and diverse dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Affordance detection and pose estimation are of great importance in many
robotic applications. Their combination helps the robot gain an enhanced
manipulation capability, in which the generated pose can facilitate the
corresponding affordance task. Previous methods for affodance-pose joint
learning are limited to a predefined set of affordances, thus limiting the
adaptability of robots in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a
new method for language-conditioned affordance-pose joint learning in 3D point
clouds. Given a 3D point cloud object, our method detects the affordance region
and generates appropriate 6-DoF poses for any unconstrained affordance label.
Our method consists of an open-vocabulary affordance detection branch and a
language-guided diffusion model that generates 6-DoF poses based on the
affordance text. We also introduce a new high-quality dataset for the task of
language-driven affordance-pose joint learning. Intensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method works effectively on a wide range of
open-vocabulary affordances and outperforms other baselines by a large margin.
In addition, we illustrate the usefulness of our method in real-world robotic
applications. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial examples, deliberately crafted using small perturbations to fool
deep neural networks, were first studied in image processing and more recently
in NLP. While approaches to detecting adversarial examples in NLP have largely
relied on search over input perturbations, image processing has seen a range of
techniques that aim to characterise adversarial subspaces over the learned
representations.
<br />In this paper, we adapt two such approaches to NLP, one based on nearest
neighbors and influence functions and one on Mahalanobis distances. The former
in particular produces a state-of-the-art detector when compared against
several strong baselines; moreover, the novel use of influence functions
provides insight into how the nature of adversarial example subspaces in NLP
relate to those in image processing, and also how they differ depending on the
kind of NLP task.

<p class="mathjax">Electroaerodynamic (EAD) propulsion, where thrust is produced by collisions
between electrostatically-accelerated ions and neutral air, is a potentially
transformative method for indoor flight owing to its silent and solid-state
nature. Like rotors, EAD thrusters exhibit changes in performance based on
proximity to surfaces. Unlike rotors, they have no fragile and quickly spinning
parts that have to avoid those surfaces; taking advantage of the efficiency
benefits from proximity effects may be a route towards longer-duration indoor
operation of ion-propelled fliers. This work presents the first empirical study
of ground proximity effects for EAD propulsors, both individually and as
quad-thruster arrays. It focuses on multi-stage ducted centimeter-scale
actuators suitable for use on small robots envisioned for deployment in
human-proximal and indoor environments. Three specific effects (ground,
suckdown, and fountain lift), each occurring with a different magnitude at a
different spacing from the ground plane, are investigated and shown to have
strong dependencies on geometric parameters including thruster-to-thruster
spacing, thruster protrusion from the fuselage, and inclusion of flanges or
strakes. Peak thrust enhancement ranging from 300 to 600% is found for certain
configurations operated in close proximity (0.2 mm) to the ground plane and as
much as a 20% increase is measured even when operated centimeters away.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we propose a staging area for ingesting new superconductors'
experimental data in SuperCon that is machine-collected from scientific
articles. Our objective is to enhance the efficiency of updating SuperCon while
maintaining or enhancing the data quality. We present a semi-automatic staging
area driven by a workflow combining automatic and manual processes on the
extracted database. An anomaly detection automatic process aims to pre-screen
the collected data. Users can then manually correct any errors through a user
interface tailored to simplify the data verification on the original PDF
documents. Additionally, when a record is corrected, its raw data is collected
and utilised to improve machine learning models as training data. Evaluation
experiments demonstrate that our staging area significantly improves curation
quality. We compare the interface with the traditional manual approach of
reading PDF documents and recording information in an Excel document. Using the
interface boosts the precision and recall by 6% and 50%, respectively to an
average increase of 40% in F1-score.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a fully unsupervised deep change detection approach for
mobile robots with 3D LiDAR. In unstructured environments, it is infeasible to
define a closed set of semantic classes. Instead, semantic segmentation is
reformulated as binary change detection. We develop a neural network,
RangeNetCD, that uses an existing point-cloud map and a live LiDAR scan to
detect scene changes with respect to the map. Using a novel loss function,
existing point-cloud semantic segmentation networks can be trained to perform
change detection without any labels or assumptions about local semantics. We
demonstrate the performance of this approach on data from challenging terrains;
mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores range between 67.4% and 82.2%
depending on the amount of environmental structure. This outperforms the
geometric baseline used in all experiments. The neural network runs faster than
10Hz and is integrated into a robot's autonomy stack to allow safe navigation
around obstacles that intersect the planned path. In addition, a novel method
for the rapid automated acquisition of per-point ground-truth labels is
described. Covering changed parts of the scene with retroreflective materials
and applying a threshold filter to the intensity channel of the LiDAR allows
for quantitative evaluation of the change detector.

<p class="mathjax">Non-autoregressive (NAR) modeling has gained significant interest in speech
processing since these models achieve dramatically lower inference time than
autoregressive (AR) models while also achieving good transcription accuracy.
Since NAR automatic speech recognition (ASR) models must wait for the
completion of the entire utterance before processing, some works explore
streaming NAR models based on blockwise attention for low-latency applications.
However, streaming NAR models significantly lag in accuracy compared to
streaming AR and non-streaming NAR models. To address this, we propose a
streaming "semi-autoregressive" ASR model that incorporates the labels emitted
in previous blocks as additional context using a Language Model (LM)
subnetwork. We also introduce a novel greedy decoding algorithm that addresses
insertion and deletion errors near block boundaries while not significantly
increasing the inference time. Experiments show that our method outperforms the
existing streaming NAR model by 19% relative on Tedlium2, 16%/8% on
Librispeech-100 clean/other test sets, and 19%/8% on the Switchboard(SWB) /
Callhome(CH) test sets. It also reduced the accuracy gap with streaming AR and
non-streaming NAR models while achieving 2.5x lower latency. We also
demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize external text data to
pre-train the LM subnetwork to further improve streaming ASR accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce the concept of complex text style transfer tasks,
and constructed complex text datasets based on two widely applicable scenarios.
Our dataset is the first large-scale data set of its kind, with 700 rephrased
sentences and 1,000 sentences from the game Genshin Impact. While large
language models (LLM) have shown promise in complex text style transfer, they
have drawbacks such as data privacy concerns, network instability, and high
deployment costs. To address these issues, we explore the effectiveness of
small models (less than T5-3B) with implicit style pre-training through
contrastive learning. We also propose a method for automated evaluation of text
generation quality based on alignment with human evaluations using ChatGPT.
Finally, we compare our approach with existing methods and show that our model
achieves state-of-art performances of few-shot text style transfer models.

solution to handling distribution shifts in speech applications. In particular,
we introduce distribution-shifts to the test datasets of standard
speech-classification tasks -- for example, speaker-identification and
emotion-detection -- and explore how Test-Time Training (TTT) can help adjust
to the distribution-shift. In our experiments that include distribution shifts
due to background noise and natural variations in speech such as gender and
age, we identify some key-challenges with TTT including sensitivity to
optimization hyperparameters (e.g., number of optimization steps and subset of
parameters chosen for TTT) and scalability (e.g., as each example gets its own
set of parameters, TTT is not scalable). Finally, we propose using BitFit -- a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithm proposed for text applications that
only considers the bias parameters for fine-tuning -- as a solution to the
aforementioned challenges and demonstrate that it is consistently more stable
than fine-tuning all the parameters of the model.

of the NLP research methodologies and applications. However, the development of
such models specifically for the Russian language has received little
attention. This paper presents a collection of 13 Russian Transformer LMs based
on the encoder (ruBERT, ruRoBERTa, ruELECTRA), decoder (ruGPT-3), and
encoder-decoder (ruT5, FRED-T5) models in multiple sizes. Access to these

<p class="mathjax">Affordance detection presents intricate challenges and has a wide range of
robotic applications. Previous works have faced limitations such as the
complexities of 3D object shapes, the wide range of potential affordances on
real-world objects, and the lack of open-vocabulary support for affordance
understanding. In this paper, we introduce a new open-vocabulary affordance
detection method in 3D point clouds, leveraging knowledge distillation and
text-point correlation. Our approach employs pre-trained 3D models through
knowledge distillation to enhance feature extraction and semantic understanding
in 3D point clouds. We further introduce a new text-point correlation method to
learn the semantic links between point cloud features and open-vocabulary
labels. The intensive experiments show that our approach outperforms previous
works and adapts to new affordance labels and unseen objects. Notably, our
method achieves the improvement of 7.96% mIOU score compared to the baselines.
Furthermore, it offers real-time inference which is well-suitable for robotic
manipulation applications.

<p class="mathjax">We study solute-laden flow through permeable geological formations with a
focus on advection-dominated transport and volume reactions. As the fluid flows
through the permeable medium, it reacts with the medium, thereby changing the
morphology and properties of the medium; this in turn, affects the flow
conditions and chemistry. These phenomena occur at various lengths and time
scales, and makes the problem extremely complex. Multiscale modeling addresses
this complexity by dividing the problem into those at individual scales, and
systematically passing information from one scale to another. However, accurate
implementation of these multiscale methods are still prohibitively expensive.
We present a methodology to overcome this challenge that is computationally
efficient and quantitatively accurate. We introduce a surrogate for the
solution operator of the lower scale problem in the form of a recurrent neural
operator, train it using one-time off-line data generated by repeated solutions
of the lower scale problem, and then use this surrogate in application-scale
calculations. The result is the accuracy of concurrent multiscale methods, at a
cost comparable to those of classical models. We study various examples, and
show the efficacy of this method in understanding the evolution of the
morphology, properties and flow conditions over time in geological formations.

<p class="mathjax">Image segmentation is a complex mathematical problem, especially for images
that contain intensity inhomogeneity and tightly packed objects with missing
boundaries in between. For instance, Magnetic Resonance (MR) muscle images
often contain both of these issues, making muscle segmentation especially
difficult. In this paper we propose a novel intensity correction and a
semi-automatic active contour based segmentation approach. The approach uses a
geometric flow that incorporates a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) edge
detector and a geodesic distance penalty term from a set of markers and
anti-markers. We test the proposed scheme on MR muscle segmentation and compare
with some state of the art methods. To help deal with the intensity
inhomogeneity in this particular kind of image, a new approach to estimate the
bias field using a fat fraction image, called Prior Bias-Corrected Fuzzy
C-means (PBCFCM), is introduced. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
scheme leads to significantly better results than compared ones. The average
dice values of the proposed method are 92.5%, 85.3%, 85.3% for quadriceps,
hamstrings and other muscle groups while other approaches are at least 10%
worse.

to navigate as close as possible to the physical bus-stop sign, starting from
30 to 50 meters away. The outcome measures were success rate and gap distance
between the app-indicated location and the actual physical location of the bus
stop. Results: The study was conducted with 24 legally blind participants (mean
age [SD]: 51[14] years; 11 (46%) Female). The success rate of the All_Aboard
app (91%) was significantly higher than the Google Maps (52%, p&lt;0.001). The gap
distance when using the All_Aboard app was significantly lower (mean [95%CI]:
1.8 [1.2-2.3] meters) compared to the Google Maps (7 [6.5-7.5] meters;
p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The All_Aboard app localizes bus stops more accurately
and reliably than GPS-based smartphone navigation options in real-world
environments.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of optimizing the interconnection graphs of complex
networks to promote synchronization. When traditional optimization methods are
inapplicable, due to uncertain or unknown node dynamics, we propose a
data-driven approach leveraging datasets of relevant examples. We analyze two
case studies, with linear and nonlinear node dynamics. First, we show how
including node dynamics in the objective function makes the optimal graphs
heterogeneous. Then, we compare various design strategies, finding that the
best either utilize data samples close to a specific Pareto front or a
combination of a neural network and a genetic algorithm, with statistically
better performance than the best examples in the datasets.

<p class="mathjax">In this article we survey recent progress in the algorithmic theory of matrix
semigroups. The main objective in this area of study is to construct algorithms
that decide various properties of finitely generated subsemigroups of an
infinite group $G$, often represented as a matrix group. Such problems might
not be decidable in general. In fact, they gave rise to some of the earliest
undecidability results in algorithmic theory. However, the situation changes
when the group $G$ satisfies additional constraints. In this survey, we give an
overview of the decidability and the complexity of several algorithmic problems
in the cases where $G$ is a low-dimensional matrix group, or a group with
additional structures such as commutativity, nilpotency and solvability.

<p class="mathjax">Pir\'a is a reading comprehension dataset focused on the ocean, the Brazilian
coast, and climate change, built from a collection of scientific abstracts and
reports on these topics. This dataset represents a versatile language resource,
particularly useful for testing the ability of current machine learning models
to acquire expert scientific knowledge. Despite its potential, a detailed set
of baselines has not yet been developed for Pir\'a. By creating these
baselines, researchers can more easily utilize Pir\'a as a resource for testing
machine learning models across a wide range of question answering tasks. In
this paper, we define six benchmarks over the Pir\'a dataset, covering closed
generative question answering, machine reading comprehension, information
retrieval, open question answering, answer triggering, and multiple choice
question answering. As part of this effort, we have also produced a curated
version of the original dataset, where we fixed a number of grammar issues,
repetitions, and other shortcomings. Furthermore, the dataset has been extended
in several new directions, so as to face the aforementioned benchmarks:
translation of supporting texts from English into Portuguese, classification
labels for answerability, automatic paraphrases of questions and answers, and
multiple choice candidates. The results described in this paper provide several
points of reference for researchers interested in exploring the challenges
provided by the Pir\'a dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Data analysis is challenging as it requires synthesizing domain knowledge,
statistical expertise, and programming skills. Assistants powered by large
language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, can assist analysts by translating
natural language instructions into code. However, AI-assistant responses and
analysis code can be misaligned with the analyst's intent or be seemingly
correct but lead to incorrect conclusions Therefore, validating AI assistance
is crucial and challenging. Here, we explore how analysts across a range of
backgrounds and expertise understand and verify the correctness of AI-generated
analyses. We develop a design probe that allows analysts to pursue diverse
verification workflows using natural language explanations, code,
visualizations, inspecting data tables, and performing common data operations.
Through a qualitative user study (n=22) using this probe, we uncover common
patterns of verification workflows influenced by analysts' programming,
analysis, and AI backgrounds. Additionally, we highlight open challenges and
opportunities for improving future AI analysis assistant experiences.

<p class="mathjax">Anticipating the motion of other road users is crucial for automated driving
systems (ADS), as it enables safe and informed downstream decision-making and
motion planning. Unfortunately, contemporary learning-based approaches for
motion prediction exhibit significant performance degradation as the prediction
horizon increases or the observation window decreases. This paper proposes a
novel technique for trajectory prediction that combines a data-driven
learning-based method with a velocity vector field (VVF) generated from a
nature-inspired concept, i.e., fluid flow dynamics. In this work, the vector
field is incorporated as an additional input to a convolutional-recurrent deep
neural network to help predict the most likely future trajectories given a
sequence of bird's eye view scene representations. The performance of the
proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art methods on the HighD dataset
demonstrating that the VVF inclusion improves the prediction accuracy for both
short and long-term (5~sec) time horizons. It is also shown that the accuracy
remains consistent with decreasing observation windows which alleviates the
requirement of a long history of past observations for accurate trajectory
prediction. Source codes are available at:

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP), improving state-of-the-art on many existing tasks and exhibiting
emergent capabilities. However, LLMs have not yet been successfully applied on
semi-structured document information extraction, which is at the core of many
document processing workflows and consists of extracting key entities from a
visually rich document (VRD) given a predefined target schema. The main
obstacles to LLM adoption in that task have been the absence of layout encoding
within LLMs, critical for a high quality extraction, and the lack of a
grounding mechanism ensuring the answer is not hallucinated. In this paper, we
introduce Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization
(LMDX), a methodology to adapt arbitrary LLMs for document information
extraction. LMDX can do extraction of singular, repeated, and hierarchical
entities, both with and without training data, while providing grounding
guarantees and localizing the entities within the document. In particular, we
apply LMDX to the PaLM 2-S LLM and evaluate it on VRDU and CORD benchmarks,
setting a new state-of-the-art and showing how LMDX enables the creation of
high quality, data-efficient parsers.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) using large language models for tasks with many
labels is challenging due to the limited context window, which makes it
difficult to fit a sufficient number of examples in the prompt. In this paper,
we use a pre-trained dense retrieval model to bypass this limitation, giving
the model only a partial view of the full label space for each inference call.
Testing with recent open-source LLMs (OPT, LLaMA), we set new state of the art
performance in few-shot settings for three common intent classification
datasets, with no finetuning. We also surpass fine-tuned performance on
fine-grained sentiment classification in certain cases. We analyze the
performance across number of in-context examples and different model scales,
showing that larger models are necessary to effectively and consistently make
use of larger context lengths for ICL. By running several ablations, we analyze
the model's use of: a) the similarity of the in-context examples to the current
input, b) the semantic content of the class names, and c) the correct
correspondence between examples and labels. We demonstrate that all three are
needed to varying degrees depending on the domain, contrary to certain recent
works.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research in decoding methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG)
tasks has shown that the traditional beam search and greedy decoding algorithms
are not optimal, because model probabilities do not always align with human
preferences. Stronger decoding methods, including Quality Estimation (QE)
reranking and Minimum Bayes' Risk (MBR) decoding, have since been proposed to
mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality mismatch. While these decoding methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are prohibitively expensive to
compute. In this work, we propose MBR finetuning and QE finetuning which
distill the quality gains from these decoding methods at training time, while
using an efficient decoding algorithm at inference time. Using the canonical
NLG task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we show that even with
self-training, these finetuning methods significantly outperform the base
model. Moreover, when using an external LLM as a teacher model, these
finetuning methods outperform finetuning on human-generated references. These
findings suggest new ways to leverage monolingual data to achieve improvements
in model quality that are on par with, or even exceed, improvements from
human-curated data, while maintaining maximum efficiency during decoding.

<p class="mathjax">The theory of two-sided matching has been extensively developed and applied
to many real-life application domains. As the theory has been applied to
increasingly diverse types of environments, researchers and practitioners have
encountered various forms of distributional constraints. Arguably, the most
general class of distributional constraints would be hereditary constraints; if
a matching is feasible, then any matching that assigns weakly fewer students at
each college is also feasible. However, under general hereditary constraints,
it is shown that no strategyproof mechanism exists that simultaneously
satisfies fairness and weak nonwastefulness, which is an efficiency (students'
welfare) requirement weaker than nonwastefulness. We propose a new
strategyproof mechanism that works for hereditary constraints called the
Multi-Stage Generalized Deferred Acceptance mechanism (MS-GDA). It uses the
Generalized Deferred Acceptance mechanism (GDA) as a subroutine, which works
when distributional constraints belong to a well-behaved class called
hereditary M$^\natural$-convex set. We show that GDA satisfies several
desirable properties, most of which are also preserved in MS-GDA. We
experimentally show that MS-GDA strikes a good balance between fairness and
efficiency (students' welfare) compared to existing strategyproof mechanisms
when distributional constraints are close to an M$^\natural$-convex set.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately determining salient regions of an image is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. DINO-based self-supervised approaches have recently
leveraged meaningful image semantics captured by patch-wise features for
locating foreground objects. Recent methods have also incorporated intuitive
priors and demonstrated value in unsupervised methods for object partitioning.
In this paper, we propose SEMPART, which jointly infers coarse and fine
bi-partitions over an image's DINO-based semantic graph. Furthermore, SEMPART
preserves fine boundary details using graph-driven regularization and
successfully distills the coarse mask semantics into the fine mask. Our salient
object detection and single object localization findings suggest that SEMPART
produces high-quality masks rapidly without additional post-processing and
benefits from co-optimizing the coarse and fine branches.

<p class="mathjax">Fitness landscapes have historically been a powerful tool for analyzing the
search space explored by evolutionary algorithms. In particular, they
facilitate understanding how easily reachable an optimal solution is from a
given starting point. However, simple fitness landscapes are inappropriate for
analyzing the search space seen by selection schemes like lexicase selection in
which the outcome of selection depends heavily on the current contents of the
population (i.e. selection schemes with complex ecological dynamics). Here, we
propose borrowing a tool from ecology to solve this problem: community assembly
graphs. We demonstrate a simple proof-of-concept for this approach on an NK
Landscape where we have perfect information. We then demonstrate that this
approach can be successfully applied to a complex genetic programming problem.
While further research is necessary to understand how to best use this tool, we
believe it will be a valuable addition to our toolkit and facilitate analyses
that were previously impossible.

<p class="mathjax">Quantization is a widely used compression method that effectively reduces
redundancies in over-parameterized neural networks. However, existing
quantization techniques for deep neural networks often lack a comprehensive
error analysis due to the presence of non-convex loss functions and nonlinear
activations. In this paper, we propose a fast stochastic algorithm for
quantizing the weights of fully trained neural networks. Our approach leverages
a greedy path-following mechanism in combination with a stochastic quantizer.
Its computational complexity scales only linearly with the number of weights in
the network, thereby enabling the efficient quantization of large networks.
Importantly, we establish, for the first time, full-network error bounds, under
an infinite alphabet condition and minimal assumptions on the weights and input
data. As an application of this result, we prove that when quantizing a
multi-layer network having Gaussian weights, the relative square quantization
error exhibits a linear decay as the degree of over-parametrization increases.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve error bounds
equivalent to those obtained in the infinite alphabet case, using on the order
of a mere $\log\log N$ bits per weight, where $N$ represents the largest number
of neurons in a layer.

<p class="mathjax">Safe deployment of graph neural networks (GNNs) under distribution shift
requires models to provide accurate confidence indicators (CI). However, while
it is well-known in computer vision that CI quality diminishes under
distribution shift, this behavior remains understudied for GNNs. Hence, we
begin with a case study on CI calibration under controlled structural and
feature distribution shifts and demonstrate that increased expressivity or
model size do not always lead to improved CI performance. Consequently, we
instead advocate for the use of epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods to modulate CIs. To this end, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a new single
model UQ method that extends the recently proposed stochastic centering
framework to support structured data and partial stochasticity. Evaluated
across covariate, concept, and graph size shifts, G-$\Delta$UQ not only
outperforms several popular UQ methods in obtaining calibrated CIs, but also
outperforms alternatives when CIs are used for generalization gap prediction or
OOD detection. Overall, our work not only introduces a new, flexible GNN UQ
method, but also provides novel insights into GNN CIs on safety-critical tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Safe deployment of AI models requires proactive detection of potential
prediction failures to prevent costly errors. While failure detection in
classification problems has received significant attention, characterizing
failure modes in regression tasks is more complicated and less explored.
Existing approaches rely on epistemic uncertainties or feature inconsistency
with the training distribution to characterize model risk. However, we show
that uncertainties are necessary but insufficient to accurately characterize
failure, owing to the various sources of error. In this paper, we propose PAGER
(Principled Analysis of Generalization Errors in Regressors), a framework to
systematically detect and characterize failures in deep regression models.
Built upon the recently proposed idea of anchoring in deep models, PAGER
unifies both epistemic uncertainties and novel, complementary non-conformity
scores to organize samples into different risk regimes, thereby providing a
comprehensive analysis of model errors. Additionally, we introduce novel
metrics for evaluating failure detectors in regression tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of PAGER on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our results
highlight the capability of PAGER to identify regions of accurate
generalization and detect failure cases in out-of-distribution and
out-of-support scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Data-centric AI, with its primary focus on the collection, management, and
utilization of data to drive AI models and applications, has attracted
increasing attention in recent years. In this article, we conduct an in-depth
and comprehensive review, offering a forward-looking outlook on the current
efforts in data-centric AI pertaining to graph data-the fundamental data
structure for representing and capturing intricate dependencies among massive
and diverse real-life entities. We introduce a systematic framework,
Data-centric Graph Machine Learning (DC-GML), that encompasses all stages of
the graph data lifecycle, including graph data collection, exploration,
improvement, exploitation, and maintenance. A thorough taxonomy of each stage
is presented to answer three critical graph-centric questions: (1) how to
enhance graph data availability and quality; (2) how to learn from graph data
with limited-availability and low-quality; (3) how to build graph MLOps systems
from the graph data-centric view. Lastly, we pinpoint the future prospects of
the DC-GML domain, providing insights to navigate its advancements and
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Effective patient monitoring is vital for timely interventions and improved
healthcare outcomes. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to handle
complex, dynamic environments with fluctuating vital signs, leading to delays
in identifying critical conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel AI-driven patient monitoring framework using multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach deploys multiple learning agents,
each dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological feature, such as heart
rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic
healthcare monitoring environment, learn the patients' behavior patterns, and
make informed decisions to alert the corresponding Medical Emergency Teams
(METs) based on the level of emergency estimated. In this study, we evaluate
the performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework using real-world
physiological and motion data from two datasets: PPG-DaLiA and WESAD. We
compare the results with several baseline models, including Q-Learning, PPO,
Actor-Critic, Double DQN, and DDPG, as well as monitoring frameworks like
WISEML and CA-MAQL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach
outperforms all other baseline models, achieving more accurate monitoring of
patient's vital signs. Furthermore, we conduct hyperparameter optimization to
fine-tune the learning process of each agent. By optimizing hyperparameters, we
enhance the learning rate and discount factor, thereby improving the agents'
overall performance in monitoring patient health status. Our AI-driven patient
monitoring system offers several advantages over traditional methods, including
the ability to handle complex and uncertain environments, adapt to varying
patient conditions, and make real-time decisions without external supervision.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, have demonstrated
significant capabilities in various planning and reasoning tasks
\cite{cheng2023gpt4,bubeck2023sparks}. Motivated by these advancements, there
has been a surge of interest among researchers to harness the capabilities of
GPT-4 for the automated design of quantitative factors that do not overlap with
existing factor libraries, with an aspiration to achieve alpha returns
\cite{webpagequant}. In contrast to these work, this study aims to examine the
fidelity of GPT-4's comprehension of classic trading theories and its
proficiency in applying its code interpreter abilities to real-world trading
data analysis. Such an exploration is instrumental in discerning whether the
underlying logic GPT-4 employs for trading is intrinsically reliable.
Furthermore, given the acknowledged interpretative latitude inherent in most
trading theories, we seek to distill more precise methodologies of deploying
these theories from GPT-4's analytical process, potentially offering invaluable
insights to human traders.
<br />To achieve this objective, we selected daily candlestick (K-line) data from
specific periods for certain assets, such as the Shanghai Stock Index. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, we guided GPT-4 to analyze the technical
structures embedded within this data, based on specific theories like the
Elliott Wave Theory. We then subjected its analytical output to manual
evaluation, assessing its interpretative depth and accuracy vis-\`a-vis these
trading theories from multiple dimensions. The results and findings from this
study could pave the way for a synergistic amalgamation of human expertise and
AI-driven insights in the realm of trading.

<p class="mathjax">Based on principal-agent theory and optimal contract theory, companies use
the method of increasing executives' shareholding to stimulate collaborative
innovation. However, from the aspect of agency costs between management and
shareholders (i.e. the first type) and between major shareholders and minority
shareholders (i.e. the second type), the interests of management, shareholders
and creditors will be unbalanced with the change of the marginal utility of
executive equity incentives.In order to establish the correlation between the
proportion of shares held by executives and investments in corporate
innovation, we have chosen a range of publicly listed companies within China's
A-share market as the focus of our study. Employing a multi-variable linear
regression model, we aim to analyze this relationship thoroughly.The following
models were developed: (1) the impact model of executive shareholding on
corporate innovation investment; (2) the impact model of executive shareholding
on two types of agency costs; (3)The model is employed to examine the mediating
influence of the two categories of agency costs. Following both correlation and
regression analyses, the findings confirm a meaningful and positive correlation
between executives' shareholding and the augmentation of corporate innovation
investments. Additionally, the results indicate that executive shareholding
contributes to the reduction of the first type of agency cost, thereby
fostering corporate innovation investment. However, simultaneously, it leads to
an escalation in the second type of agency cost, thus impeding corporate
innovation investment.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have been thriving on numerous tasks to
leverage their promising energy efficiency and exploit their potentialities as
biologically plausible intelligence. Meanwhile, the Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) render high-quality 3D scenes with massive energy consumption, and few
works delve into the energy-saving solution with a bio-inspired approach. In
this paper, we propose spiking NeRF (SpikingNeRF), which aligns the radiance
ray with the temporal dimension of SNN, to naturally accommodate the SNN to the
reconstruction of Radiance Fields. Thus, the computation turns into a
spike-based, multiplication-free manner, reducing the energy consumption. In
SpikingNeRF, each sampled point on the ray is matched onto a particular time
step, and represented in a hybrid manner where the voxel grids are maintained
as well. Based on the voxel grids, sampled points are determined whether to be
masked for better training and inference. However, this operation also incurs
irregular temporal length. We propose the temporal condensing-and-padding (TCP)
strategy to tackle the masked samples to maintain regular temporal length,
i.e., regular tensors, for hardware-friendly computation. Extensive experiments
on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the $76.74\%$
energy consumption on average and obtains comparable synthesis quality with the
ANN baseline.

<p class="mathjax">We present a set of metrics that utilize vision priors to effectively assess
the performance of saliency methods on image classification tasks. To
understand behavior in deep learning models, many methods provide visual
saliency maps emphasizing image regions that most contribute to a model
prediction. However, there is limited work on analyzing the reliability of
saliency methods in explaining model decisions. We propose the metric
COnsistency-SEnsitivity (COSE) that quantifies the equivariant and invariant
properties of visual model explanations using simple data augmentations.
Through our metrics, we show that although saliency methods are thought to be
architecture-independent, most methods could better explain transformer-based
models over convolutional-based models. In addition, GradCAM was found to
outperform other methods in terms of COSE but was shown to have limitations
such as lack of variability for fine-grained datasets. The duality between
consistency and sensitivity allow the analysis of saliency methods from
different angles. Ultimately, we find that it is important to balance these two
metrics for a saliency map to faithfully show model behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Modern smart glasses leverage advanced audio sensing and machine learning
technologies to offer real-time transcribing and captioning services,
considerably enriching human experiences in daily communications. However, such
systems frequently encounter challenges related to environmental noises,
resulting in degradation to speech recognition and speaker change detection. To
improve voice quality, this work investigates directional source separation
using the multi-microphone array. We first explore multiple beamformers to
assist source separation modeling by strengthening the directional properties
of speech signals. In addition to relying on predetermined beamformers, we
investigate neural beamforming in multi-channel source separation,
demonstrating that automatic learning directional characteristics effectively
improves separation quality. We further compare the ASR performance leveraging
separated outputs to noisy inputs. Our results show that directional source
separation benefits ASR for the wearer but not for the conversation partner.
Lastly, we perform the joint training of the directional source separation and
ASR model, achieving the best overall ASR performance.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the potential of constructing an AI spoken dialogue
system that "thinks how to respond" and "thinks how to speak" simultaneously,
which more closely aligns with the human speech production process compared to
the current cascade pipeline of independent chatbot and Text-to-Speech (TTS)
modules. We hypothesize that Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of
parameters possess significant speech understanding capabilities and can
jointly model dialogue responses and linguistic features. We conduct two sets
of experiments: 1) Prosodic structure prediction, a typical front-end task in
TTS, demonstrating the speech understanding ability of LLMs, and 2) Further
integrating dialogue response and a wide array of linguistic features using a
unified encoding format. Our results indicate that the LLM-based approach is a
promising direction for building unified spoken dialogue systems.

<p class="mathjax">Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the processing of encrypted data
without decrypting it. FHE has garnered significant attention over the past
decade as it supports secure outsourcing of data processing to remote cloud
services. Despite its promise of strong data privacy and security guarantees,
FHE introduces a slowdown of up to five orders of magnitude as compared to the
same computation using plaintext data. This overhead is presently a major
barrier to the commercial adoption of FHE.
<br />In this work, we leverage GPUs to accelerate FHE, capitalizing on a
well-established GPU ecosystem available in the cloud. We propose GME, which
combines three key microarchitectural extensions along with a compile-time
optimization to the current AMD CDNA GPU architecture. First, GME integrates a
lightweight on-chip compute unit (CU)-side hierarchical interconnect to retain
ciphertext in cache across FHE kernels, thus eliminating redundant memory
transactions. Second, to tackle compute bottlenecks, GME introduces special
MOD-units that provide native custom hardware support for modular reduction
operations, one of the most commonly executed sets of operations in FHE. Third,
by integrating the MOD-unit with our novel pipelined $64$-bit integer
arithmetic cores (WMAC-units), GME further accelerates FHE workloads by $19\%$.
Finally, we propose a Locality-Aware Block Scheduler (LABS) that exploits the
temporal locality available in FHE primitive blocks. Incorporating these
microarchitectural features and compiler optimizations, we create a synergistic
approach achieving average speedups of $796\times$, $14.2\times$, and
$2.3\times$ over Intel Xeon CPU, NVIDIA V100 GPU, and Xilinx FPGA
implementations, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Pedestrian detection under valet parking scenarios is fundamental for
autonomous driving. However, the presence of pedestrians can be manifested in a
variety of ways and postures under imperfect ambient conditions, which can
adversely affect detection performance. Furthermore, models trained on
publicdatasets that include pedestrians generally provide suboptimal outcomes
for these valet parking scenarios. In this paper, wepresent the Parking
Pedestrian Dataset (PPD), a large-scale fisheye dataset to support research
dealing with real-world pedestrians, especially with occlusions and diverse
postures. PPD consists of several distinctive types of pedestrians captured
with fisheye cameras. Additionally, we present a pedestrian detection baseline
on PPD dataset, and introduce two data augmentation techniques to improve the
baseline by enhancing the diversity ofthe original dataset. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our novel data augmentation
approaches over baselinesand the dataset's exceptional generalizability.

<p class="mathjax">Software often fails in the field, however reproducing and debugging field
failures is very challenging: the failure-inducing input may be missing, and
the program setup can be complicated and hard to reproduce by the developers.
In this paper, we propose to generate fault signatures from the failure
locations and the original source code to reproduce the faults in small
executable programs. We say that a fault signature reproduces the fault in the
original program if the two failed in the same location, triggered the same
error conditions after executing the same selective sequences of
failure-inducing statements. A fault signature aims to contain only sufficient
statements that can reproduce the faults. That way, it provides some context to
inform how a fault is developed and also avoids unnecessary complexity and
setups that may block fault diagnosis. To compute fault signatures from the
failures, we applied a path-sensitive static analysis tool to generate a path
that leads to the fault, and then applied an existing syntactic patching tool
to convert the path into an executable program. Our evaluation on real-world
bugs from Corebench, BugBench, and Manybugs shows that fault signatures can
reproduce the fault for the original programs. Because fault signatures are
less complex, automatic test input generation tools generated failure-inducing
inputs that could not be generated by using the entire programs. Some
failure-inducing inputs can be directly transferred to the original programs.

<p class="mathjax">Certified robustness circumvents the fragility of defences against
adversarial attacks, by endowing model predictions with guarantees of class
invariance for attacks up to a calculated size. While there is value in these
certifications, the techniques through which we assess their performance do not
present a proper accounting of their strengths and weaknesses, as their
analysis has eschewed consideration of performance over individual samples in
favour of aggregated measures. By considering the potential output space of
certified models, this work presents two distinct approaches to improve the
analysis of certification mechanisms, that allow for both dataset-independent
and dataset-dependent measures of certification performance. Embracing such a
perspective uncovers new certification approaches, which have the potential to
more than double the achievable radius of certification, relative to current
state-of-the-art. Empirical evaluation verifies that our new approach can
certify $9\%$ more samples at noise scale $\sigma = 1$, with greater relative
improvements observed as the difficulty of the predictive task increases.

<p class="mathjax">Complex sensors such as LiDAR, RADAR, and event cameras have proliferated in
autonomous robotics to enhance perception and understanding of the environment.
Meanwhile, these sensors are also vulnerable to diverse failure mechanisms that
can intricately interact with their operation environment. In parallel, the
limited availability of training data on complex sensors also affects the
reliability of their deep learning-based prediction flow, where their
prediction models can fail to generalize to environments not adequately
captured in the training set. To address these reliability concerns, this paper
introduces STARNet, a Sensor Trustworthiness and Anomaly Recognition Network
designed to detect untrustworthy sensor streams that may arise from sensor
malfunctions and/or challenging environments. We specifically benchmark STARNet
on LiDAR and camera data. STARNet employs the concept of approximated
likelihood regret, a gradient-free framework tailored for low-complexity
hardware, especially those with only fixed-point precision capabilities.
Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of STARNet in
detecting untrustworthy sensor streams in unimodal and multimodal settings. In
particular, the network shows superior performance in addressing internal
sensor failures, such as cross-sensor interference and crosstalk. In diverse
test scenarios involving adverse weather and sensor malfunctions, we show that
STARNet enhances prediction accuracy by approximately 10% by filtering out
untrustworthy sensor streams. STARNet is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have made it possible to
reconstruct and reanimate dynamic portrait scenes with control over head-pose,
facial expressions and viewing direction. However, training such models assumes
photometric consistency over the deformed region e.g. the face must be evenly
lit as it deforms with changing head-pose and facial expression. Such
photometric consistency across frames of a video is hard to maintain, even in
studio environments, thus making the created reanimatable neural portraits
prone to artifacts during reanimation. In this work, we propose CoDyNeRF, a
system that enables the creation of fully controllable 3D portraits in
real-world capture conditions. CoDyNeRF learns to approximate illumination
dependent effects via a dynamic appearance model in the canonical space that is
conditioned on predicted surface normals and the facial expressions and
head-pose deformations. The surface normals prediction is guided using 3DMM
normals that act as a coarse prior for the normals of the human head, where
direct prediction of normals is hard due to rigid and non-rigid deformations
induced by head-pose and facial expression changes. Using only a
smartphone-captured short video of a subject for training, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of a portrait scene with
explicit head pose and expression controls, and realistic lighting effects. The

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in manufacturing have a growing demand for fast,
automatic prototyping (i.e. assembly and disassembly) capabilities to meet
users' needs. This paper studies automatic rapid LEGO prototyping, which is
devoted to constructing target LEGO objects that satisfy individual
customization needs and allow users to freely construct their novel designs. A
construction plan is needed in order to automatically construct the
user-specified LEGO design. However, a freely designed LEGO object might not
have an existing construction plan, and generating such a LEGO construction
plan requires a non-trivial effort since it requires accounting for numerous
constraints (e.g. object shape, colors, stability, etc.). In addition,
programming the prototyping skill for the robot requires the users to have
expert programming skills, which makes the task beyond the reach of the general
public. To address the challenges, this paper presents a simulation-aided
learning from demonstration (SaLfD) framework for easily deploying LEGO
prototyping capability to robots. In particular, the user demonstrates
constructing the customized novel LEGO object. The robot extracts the task
information by observing the human operation and generates the construction
plan. A simulation is developed to verify the correctness of the learned
construction plan and the resulting LEGO prototype. The proposed system is
deployed to a FANUC LR-mate 200id/7L robot. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed SaLfD framework can effectively correct and learn the prototyping
(i.e. assembly and disassembly) tasks from human demonstrations. And the
learned prototyping tasks are realized by the FANUC robot.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Odometry (VO) plays a pivotal role in autonomous systems, with a
principal challenge being the lack of depth information in camera images. This
paper introduces OCC-VO, a novel framework that capitalizes on recent advances
in deep learning to transform 2D camera images into 3D semantic occupancy,
thereby circumventing the traditional need for concurrent estimation of ego
poses and landmark locations. Within this framework, we utilize the TPV-Former
to convert surround view cameras' images into 3D semantic occupancy. Addressing
the challenges presented by this transformation, we have specifically tailored
a pose estimation and mapping algorithm that incorporates Semantic Label
Filter, Dynamic Object Filter, and finally, utilizes Voxel PFilter for
maintaining a consistent global semantic map. Evaluations on the Occ3D-nuScenes
not only showcase a 20.6% improvement in Success Ratio and a 29.6% enhancement
in trajectory accuracy against ORB-SLAM3, but also emphasize our ability to
construct a comprehensive map. Our implementation is open-sourced and available

<p class="mathjax">The last decade has witnessed the success of deep learning and the surge of
publicly released trained models, which necessitates the quantification of the
model functional distance for various purposes. However, quantifying the model
functional distance is always challenging due to the opacity in inner workings
and the heterogeneity in architectures or tasks. Inspired by the concept of
"field" in physics, in this work we introduce Model Gradient Field (abbr.
ModelGiF) to extract homogeneous representations from the heterogeneous
pre-trained models. Our main assumption underlying ModelGiF is that each
pre-trained deep model uniquely determines a ModelGiF over the input space. The
distance between models can thus be measured by the similarity between their
ModelGiFs. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed ModelGiF with a suite
of testbeds, including task relatedness estimation, intellectual property
protection, and model unlearning verification. Experimental results demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed ModelGiF on these tasks, with significantly
superiority performance to state-of-the-art competitors. Codes are available at

<p class="mathjax">This work solves 3SAT, a classical NP-complete problem, on a CMOS-based Ising
hardware chip with all-to-all connectivity. The paper addresses practical
issues in going from algorithms to hardware. It considers several degrees of
freedom in mapping the 3SAT problem to the chip - using multiple Ising
formulations for 3SAT; exploring multiple strategies for decomposing large
problems into subproblems that can be accommodated on the Ising chip; and
executing a sequence of these subproblems on CMOS hardware to obtain the
solution to the larger problem. These are evaluated within a software
framework, and the results are used to identify the most promising formulations
and decomposition techniques. These best approaches are then mapped to the
all-to-all hardware, and the performance of 3SAT is evaluated on the chip.
Experimental data shows that the deployed decomposition and mapping strategies
impact SAT solution quality: without our methods, the CMOS hardware cannot
achieve 3SAT solutions on SATLIB benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a lightweight uncertainty estimator capable of
predicting multimodal (disjoint) uncertainty bounds by integrating conformal
prediction with a deep-learning regressor. We specifically discuss its
application for visual odometry (VO), where environmental features such as
flying domain symmetries and sensor measurements under ambiguities and
occlusion can result in multimodal uncertainties. Our simulation results show
that uncertainty estimates in our framework adapt sample-wise against
challenging operating conditions such as pronounced noise, limited training
data, and limited parametric size of the prediction model. We also develop a
reasoning framework that leverages these robust uncertainty estimates and
incorporates optical flow-based reasoning to improve prediction prediction
accuracy. Thus, by appropriately accounting for predictive uncertainties of
data-driven learning and closing their estimation loop via rule-based
reasoning, our methodology consistently surpasses conventional deep learning
approaches on all these challenging scenarios--pronounced noise, limited
training data, and limited model size-reducing the prediction error by 2-3x.

<p class="mathjax">We explicitly construct the first nontrivial extractors for degree $d \ge 2$
polynomial sources over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Our extractor requires min-entropy
$k\geq n - \frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{(d\log \log n)^{d/2}}$. Previously, no
constructions were known, even for min-entropy $k\geq n-1$. A key ingredient in
our construction is an input reduction lemma, which allows us to assume that
any polynomial source with min-entropy $k$ can be generated by $O(k)$ uniformly
random bits.
<br />We also provide strong formal evidence that polynomial sources are unusually
challenging to extract from, by showing that even our most powerful general
purpose extractors cannot handle polynomial sources with min-entropy below
$k\geq n-o(n)$. In more detail, we show that sumset extractors cannot even
disperse from degree $2$ polynomial sources with min-entropy $k\geq
n-O(n/\log\log n)$. In fact, this impossibility result even holds for a more
specialized family of sources that we introduce, called polynomial
non-oblivious bit-fixing (NOBF) sources. Polynomial NOBF sources are a natural
new family of algebraic sources that lie at the intersection of polynomial and
variety sources, and thus our impossibility result applies to both of these
classical settings. This is especially surprising, since we do have variety
extractors that slightly beat this barrier - implying that sumset extractors
are not a panacea in the world of seedless extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Miniature locomotion robots with the ability to navigate confined
environments show great promise for a wide range of tasks, including search and
rescue operations. Soft miniature locomotion robots, as a burgeoning field,
have attracted significant research interest due to their exceptional terrain
adaptability and safety features. In this paper, we introduce a fully-soft
miniature crawling robot directly powered by fluid kinetic energy generated by
an electrohydraulic actuator. Through optimization of the operating voltage and
design parameters, the crawling velocity of the robot is dramatically enhanced,
reaching 16 mm/s. The optimized robot weighs 6.3 g and measures 5 cm in length,
5 cm in width, and 6 mm in height. By combining two robots in parallel, the
robot can achieve a turning rate of approximately 3 degrees/s. Additionally, by
reconfiguring the distribution of electrodes in the electrohydraulic actuator,
the robot can achieve 2 degrees-of-freedom translational motion, improving its
maneuverability in narrow spaces. Finally, we demonstrate the use of a soft
water-proof skin for underwater locomotion and actuation. In comparison with
other soft miniature crawling robots, our robot with full softness can achieve
relatively high crawling velocity as well as increased robustness and recovery.

<p class="mathjax">PyPI provides a convenient and accessible package management platform to
developers, enabling them to quickly implement specific functions and improve
work efficiency. However, the rapid development of the PyPI ecosystem has led
to a severe problem of malicious package propagation. Malicious developers
disguise malicious packages as normal, posing a significant security risk to
end-users.
<br />To this end, we conducted an empirical study to understand the
characteristics and current state of the malicious code lifecycle in the PyPI
ecosystem. We first built an automated data collection framework and collated a
multi-source malicious code dataset containing 4,669 malicious package files.
We preliminarily classified these malicious code into five categories based on
malicious behaviour characteristics. Our research found that over 50% of
malicious code exhibits multiple malicious behaviours, with information
stealing and command execution being particularly prevalent. In addition, we
observed several novel attack vectors and anti-detection techniques. Our
analysis revealed that 74.81% of all malicious packages successfully entered
end-user projects through source code installation, thereby increasing security
risks. A real-world investigation showed that many reported malicious packages
persist in PyPI mirror servers globally, with over 72% remaining for an
extended period after being discovered. Finally, we sketched a portrait of the
malicious code lifecycle in the PyPI ecosystem, effectively reflecting the
characteristics of malicious code at different stages. We also present some
suggested mitigations to improve the security of the Python open-source
ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we consider the setting where machine learning models are
retrained on updated datasets in order to incorporate the most up-to-date
information or reflect distribution shifts. We investigate whether one can
infer information about these updates in the training data (e.g., changes to
attribute values of records). Here, the adversary has access to snapshots of
the machine learning model before and after the change in the dataset occurs.
Contrary to the existing literature, we assume that an attribute of a single or
multiple training data points are changed rather than entire data records are
removed or added. We propose attacks based on the difference in the prediction
confidence of the original model and the updated model. We evaluate our attack
methods on two public datasets along with multi-layer perceptron and logistic
regression models. We validate that two snapshots of the model can result in
higher information leakage in comparison to having access to only the updated
model. Moreover, we observe that data records with rare values are more
vulnerable to attacks, which points to the disparate vulnerability of privacy
attacks in the update setting. When multiple records with the same original
attribute value are updated to the same new value (i.e., repeated changes), the
attacker is more likely to correctly guess the updated values since repeated
changes leave a larger footprint on the trained model. These observations point
to vulnerability of machine learning models to attribute inference attacks in
the update setting.

<p class="mathjax">A method of numerically solving the Maxwell equations is considered for
modeling harmonic electromagnetic fields. The vector finite element method
makes it possible to obtain a physically consistent discretization of the
differential equations. However, solving large systems of linear algebraic
equations with indefinite ill-conditioned matrices is a challenge. The high
order of the matrices limits the capabilities of the Gaussian method to solve
such systems, since this requires large RAM and much calculation. To reduce
these requirements, an iterative preconditioned algorithm based on integral
Laguerre transform in time is used. This approach allows using multigrid
algorithms and, as a result, needs less RAM compared to the direct methods of
solving systems of linear algebraic equations.

<p class="mathjax">The study further explores randomized QMC (RQMC), which maintains the QMC
convergence rate and facilitates computational efficiency analysis. Emphasis is
laid on integrating randomly shifted lattice rules, a distinct RQMC quadrature,
with IS,a classic variance reduction technique. The study underscores the
intricacies of establishing a theoretical convergence rate for IS in QMC
compared to MC, given the influence of problem dimensions and smoothness on
QMC. The research also touches on the significance of IS density selection and
its potential implications. The study culminates in examining the error bound
of IS with a randomly shifted lattice rule, drawing inspiration from the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the realm of finance and
statistics, many problems boil down to computing expectations, predominantly
integrals concerning a Gaussian measure. This study considers optimal drift
importance sampling (ODIS) and Laplace importance sampling (LapIS) as common
importance densities. Conclusively, the paper establishes that under certain
conditions, the IS-randomly shifted lattice rule can achieve a near $O(N^{-1})$
error bound.

<p class="mathjax">Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract and classify entity mentions
in the text into pre-defined types (e.g., organization or person name).
Recently, many works have been proposed to shape the NER as a machine reading
comprehension problem (also termed MRC-based NER), in which entity recognition
is achieved by answering the formulated questions related to pre-defined entity
types through MRC, based on the contexts. However, these works ignore the label
dependencies among entity types, which are critical for precisely recognizing
named entities. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the label dependencies
among entity types into a multi-task learning framework for better MRC-based
NER. We decompose MRC-based NER into multiple tasks and use a self-attention
module to capture label dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on both nested
NER and flat NER datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed Multi-NER. Experimental results show that Multi-NER can achieve better
performance on all datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Users rely on search engines for information in critical contexts, such as
public health emergencies. Understanding how users evaluate the trustworthiness
of search results is therefore essential. Research has identified rank and the
presence of misinformation as factors impacting perceptions and click behavior
in search. Here, we elaborate on these findings by measuring the effects of
rank and misinformation, as well as warning banners, on the perceived
trustworthiness of individual results in search. We conducted three online
experiments (N=3196) using Covid-19-related queries to address this question.
We show that although higher-ranked results are clicked more often, they are
not more trusted. We also show that misinformation did not change trust in
accurate results below it. However, a warning about unreliable sources
backfired, decreasing trust in accurate information but not misinformation.
This work addresses concerns about how people evaluate information in search,
and illustrates the dangers of generic prevention approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Robots have become increasingly prevalent in dynamic and crowded environments
such as airports and shopping malls. In these scenarios, the critical
challenges for robot navigation are reliability and timely arrival at
predetermined destinations. While existing risk-based motion planning
algorithms effectively reduce collision risks with static and dynamic
obstacles, there is still a need for significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the dynamic environments demand more rapid responses and robust
planning. To address this gap, we introduce a novel risk-based
multi-directional sampling algorithm, Multi-directional Risk-based
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Multi-Risk-RRT). Unlike traditional algorithms
that solely rely on a rooted tree or double trees for state space exploration,
our approach incorporates multiple sub-trees. Each sub-tree independently
explores its surrounding environment. At the same time, the primary rooted tree
collects the heuristic information from these sub-trees, facilitating rapid
progress toward the goal state. Our evaluations, including simulation and
real-world environmental studies, demonstrate that Multi-Risk-RRT outperforms
existing unidirectional and bi-directional risk-based algorithms in planning
efficiency and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Derivative-free optimization algorithms play an important role in scientific
and engineering design optimization problems, especially when derivative
information is not accessible. In this paper, we study the framework of
classification-based derivative-free optimization algorithms. By introducing a
concept called hypothesis-target shattering rate, we revisit the computational
complexity upper bound of this type of algorithms. Inspired by the revisited
upper bound, we propose an algorithm named "RACE-CARS", which adds a random
region-shrinking step compared with "SRACOS" (Hu et al., 2017).. We further
establish a theorem showing the acceleration of region-shrinking. Experiments
on the synthetic functions as well as black-box tuning for
language-model-as-a-service demonstrate empirically the efficiency of
"RACE-CARS". An ablation experiment on the introduced hyperparameters is also
conducted, revealing the mechanism of "RACE-CARS" and putting forward an
empirical hyperparameter-tuning guidance.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present CaveSeg - the first visual learning pipeline for
semantic segmentation and scene parsing for AUV navigation inside underwater
caves. We address the problem of scarce annotated training data by preparing a
comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation of underwater cave scenes. It
contains pixel annotations for important navigation markers (e.g. caveline,
arrows), obstacles (e.g. ground plain and overhead layers), scuba divers, and
open areas for servoing. Through comprehensive benchmark analyses on cave
systems in USA, Mexico, and Spain locations, we demonstrate that robust deep
visual models can be developed based on CaveSeg for fast semantic scene parsing
of underwater cave environments. In particular, we formulate a novel
transformer-based model that is computationally light and offers near real-time
execution in addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we
explore the design choices and implications of semantic segmentation for visual
servoing by AUVs inside underwater caves. The proposed model and benchmark
dataset open up promising opportunities for future research in autonomous
underwater cave exploration and mapping.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have been fueled by the rapid
development of communication technologies, sensor technologies, and the
Internet of Things (IoT). Nonetheless, due to the dynamic characteristics of
the vehicle networks, it is rather challenging to make timely and accurate
decisions of vehicle behaviors. Moreover, in the presence of mobile wireless
communications, the privacy and security of vehicle information are at constant
risk. In this context, a new paradigm is urgently needed for various
applications in dynamic vehicle environments. As a distributed machine learning
technology, federated learning (FL) has received extensive attention due to its
outstanding privacy protection properties and easy scalability. We conduct a
comprehensive survey of the latest developments in FL for ITS. Specifically, we
initially research the prevalent challenges in ITS and elucidate the
motivations for applying FL from various perspectives. Subsequently, we review
existing deployments of FL in ITS across various scenarios, and discuss
specific potential issues in object recognition, traffic management, and
service providing scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct a further analysis of the
new challenges introduced by FL deployment and the inherent limitations that FL
alone cannot fully address, including uneven data distribution, limited storage
and computing power, and potential privacy and security concerns. We then
examine the existing collaborative technologies that can help mitigate these
challenges. Lastly, we discuss the open challenges that remain to be addressed
in applying FL in ITS and propose several future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) method based on
Model Predictive Path Integral control (MPPI), named Stein Variational Guided
MPPI (SVG-MPPI), designed to handle rapidly shifting multimodal optimal action
distributions. While MPPI can find a Gaussian-approximated optimal action
distribution in closed form, i.e., without iterative solution updates, it
struggles with multimodality of the optimal distributions, such as those
involving non-convex constraints for obstacle avoidance. This is due to the
less representative nature of the Gaussian. To overcome this limitation, our
method aims to identify a target mode of the optimal distribution and guide the
solution to converge to fit it. In the proposed method, the target mode is
roughly estimated using a modified Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
method and embedded into the MPPI algorithm to find a closed-form
"mode-seeking" solution that covers only the target mode, thus preserving the
fast convergence property of MPPI. Our simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that SVG-MPPI outperforms both the original MPPI and other
state-of-the-art sampling-based SOC algorithms in terms of path-tracking and
obstacle-avoidance capabilities. Source code:

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved amazing zero-shot
learning performance over a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks,
especially for text generative tasks. Yet, the large size of LLMs often leads
to the high computational cost of model training and online deployment. In our
work, we present ALTER, a system that effectively builds the multi-tAsk
Learners with mixTure-of-task-adaptERs upon small language models (with &lt;1B
parameters) to address multiple NLP tasks simultaneously, capturing the
commonalities and differences between tasks, in order to support
domain-specific applications. Specifically, in ALTER, we propose the
Mixture-of-Task-Adapters (MTA) module as an extension to the transformer
architecture for the underlying model to capture the intra-task and inter-task
knowledge. A two-stage training method is further proposed to optimize the
collaboration between adapters at a small computational cost. Experimental
results over a mixture of NLP tasks show that our proposed MTA architecture and
the two-stage training method achieve good performance. Based on ALTER, we have
also produced MTA-equipped language models for various domains.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new score-based model with one-step sampling. Previously,
score-based models were burdened with heavy computations due to iterative
sampling. For substituting the iterative process, we train a standalone
generator to compress all the time steps with the gradient backpropagated from
the score network. In order to produce meaningful gradients for the generator,
the score network is trained to simultaneously match the real data distribution
and mismatch the fake data distribution. This model has the following
advantages: 1) For sampling, it generates a fake image with only one step
forward. 2) For training, it only needs 10 diffusion steps.3) Compared with
consistency model, it is free of the ill-posed problem caused by consistency
loss. On the popular CIFAR-10 dataset, our model outperforms Consistency Model
and Denoising Score Matching, which demonstrates the potential of the
framework. We further provide more examples on the MINIST and LSUN datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is currently one of the most popular technologies in
the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to its collaborative learning and
ability to preserve client privacy. However, it faces challenges such as
non-identically and non-independently distributed (non-IID) and data with
imbalanced labels among local clients. To address these limitations, the
research community has explored various approaches such as using local model
parameters, federated generative adversarial learning, and federated
representation learning. In our study, we propose a novel Clustered FedStack
framework based on the previously published Stacked Federated Learning
(FedStack) framework. The local clients send their model predictions and output
layer weights to a server, which then builds a robust global model. This global
model clusters the local clients based on their output layer weights using a
clustering mechanism. We adopt three clustering mechanisms, namely K-Means,
Agglomerative, and Gaussian Mixture Models, into the framework and evaluate
their performance. We use Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the maximum
likelihood function to determine the number of clusters. The Clustered FedStack
models outperform baseline models with clustering mechanisms. To estimate the
convergence of our proposed framework, we use Cyclical learning rates.

<p class="mathjax">Across various domains, data from different sources such as Baidu Baike and
Wikipedia often manifest in distinct forms. Current entity matching
methodologies predominantly focus on homogeneous data, characterized by
attributes that share the same structure and concise attribute values. However,
this orientation poses challenges in handling data with diverse formats.
Moreover, prevailing approaches aggregate the similarity of attribute values
between corresponding attributes to ascertain entity similarity. Yet, they
often overlook the intricate interrelationships between attributes, where one
attribute may have multiple associations. The simplistic approach of pairwise
attribute comparison fails to harness the wealth of information encapsulated
within entities.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel entity
matching model, dubbed Entity Matching Model for Capturing Complex Attribute
Relationships(EMM-CCAR),built upon pre-trained models. Specifically, this model
transforms the matching task into a sequence matching problem to mitigate the
impact of varying data formats. Moreover, by introducing attention mechanisms,
it identifies complex relationships between attributes, emphasizing the degree
of matching among multiple attributes rather than one-to-one correspondences.
Through the integration of the EMM-CCAR model, we adeptly surmount the
challenges posed by data heterogeneity and intricate attribute
interdependencies. In comparison with the prevalent DER-SSM and Ditto
approaches, our model achieves improvements of approximately 4% and 1% in F1
scores, respectively. This furnishes a robust solution for addressing the
intricacies of attribute complexity in entity matching.

<p class="mathjax">Edge computing is a promising solution for handling high-dimensional,
multispectral analog data from sensors and IoT devices for applications such as
autonomous drones. However, edge devices' limited storage and computing
resources make it challenging to perform complex predictive modeling at the
edge. Compute-in-memory (CiM) has emerged as a principal paradigm to minimize
energy for deep learning-based inference at the edge. Nevertheless, integrating
storage and processing complicates memory cells and/or memory peripherals,
essentially trading off area efficiency for energy efficiency. This paper
proposes a novel solution to improve area efficiency in deep learning inference
tasks. The proposed method employs two key strategies. Firstly, a Frequency
domain learning approach uses binarized Walsh-Hadamard Transforms, reducing the
necessary parameters for DNN (by 87% in MobileNetV2) and enabling
compute-in-SRAM, which better utilizes parallelism during inference. Secondly,
a memory-immersed collaborative digitization method is described among CiM
arrays to reduce the area overheads of conventional ADCs. This facilitates more
CiM arrays in limited footprint designs, leading to better parallelism and
reduced external memory accesses. Different networking configurations are
explored, where Flash, SA, and their hybrid digitization steps can be
implemented using the memory-immersed scheme. The results are demonstrated
using a 65 nm CMOS test chip, exhibiting significant area and energy savings
compared to a 40 nm-node 5-bit SAR ADC and 5-bit Flash ADC. By processing
analog data more efficiently, it is possible to selectively retain valuable
data from sensors and alleviate the challenges posed by the analog data deluge.

<p class="mathjax">Question answering on tabular data (TableQA), which aims at generating
answers to questions grounded on a given table, has attracted increasing
attention in recent years. Existing work tends to generate factual short-form
answers by extracting information from one or a few table cells without
reasoning over selected table cells. However, the free-form TableQA, requiring
a more complex relevant table cell selection strategy and the complex
integration and inference of separate pieces of information, has been
under-explored. To this end, this paper proposes a generalized three-stage
approach: Table-to-Graph conversion and cell localizing, external knowledge
retrieval and table-text fusion (called TAG-QA), addressing the challenge of
inferring long free-form answer for generative TableQA. In particular, TAG-QA
(1) locates relevant table cells using a graph neural network to gather
intersecting cells between relevant rows and columns; (2) leverages external
knowledge from Wikipedia and (3) generates answers by integrating both tabular
data and natural linguistic information. Experiments with a human evaluation
demonstrate that TAG-QA is capable of generating more faithful and coherent
sentence when compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Especially,
TAG-QA outperforms the strong pipeline-based baseline TAPAS by 17% and 14%, in
terms of BLEU-4 and PARENT F-score, respectively. Moreover, TAG-QA outperforms
end-to-end model T5 by 16% and 12% on BLEU-4 and PARENT F-score.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern in recent
times due to its potential to spread misinformation and manipulate public
opinion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the detection of
fake news in Brazilian Portuguese, focusing on journalistic-type news. We
propose a machine learning-based approach that leverages natural language

textual data. We evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms,
such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, AdaBoost,
and LightGBM, on a dataset containing both true and fake news articles. The
proposed approach achieves a high level of accuracy and F1-Score, demonstrating
its effectiveness in identifying fake news. Additionally, we develop a

<p class="mathjax">The significant rise of security concerns in conventional centralized
learning has promoted federated learning (FL) adoption in building intelligent
applications without privacy breaches. In cybersecurity, the sensitive data
along with the contextual information and high-quality labeling in each
enterprise organization play an essential role in constructing high-performance
machine learning (ML) models for detecting cyber threats. Nonetheless, the
risks coming from poisoning internal adversaries against FL systems have raised
discussions about designing robust anti-poisoning frameworks. Whereas defensive
mechanisms in the past were based on outlier detection, recent approaches tend
to be more concerned with latent space representation. In this paper, we
investigate a novel robust aggregation method for FL, namely Fed-LSAE, which
takes advantage of latent space representation via the penultimate layer and
Autoencoder to exclude malicious clients from the training process. The
experimental results on the CIC-ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets confirm the
feasibility of our defensive mechanism against cutting-edge poisoning attacks
for developing a robust FL-based threat detector in the context of IoT. More
specifically, the FL evaluation witnesses an upward trend of approximately 98%
across all metrics when integrating with our Fed-LSAE defense.

<p class="mathjax">Chain-of-Thought (CoT) plays a crucial role in reasoning for math problem
solving. We conduct a comprehensive examination of methods for designing CoT,
comparing conventional natural language CoT with various program CoTs,
including the self-describing program, the comment-describing program, and the
non-describing program. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of programming
language on program CoTs, comparing Python and Wolfram Language. Through
extensive experiments on GSM8K, MATHQA, and SVAMP, we find that program CoTs
often have superior effectiveness in math problem solving. Notably, the best
performing combination with 30B parameters beats GPT-3.5-turbo by a significant
margin. The results show that self-describing program offers greater diversity
and thus can generally achieve higher performance. We also find that Python is
a better choice of language than Wolfram for program CoTs. The experimental
results provide a valuable guideline for future CoT designs that take into
account both programming language and coding style for further advancements.
Our datasets and code are publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Sensing and communication technologies have enhanced learning-based decision
making methodologies for multi-agent systems such as connected autonomous
vehicles (CAV). However, most existing safe reinforcement learning based
methods assume accurate state information. It remains challenging to achieve
safety requirement under state uncertainties for CAVs, considering the noisy
sensor measurements and the vulnerability of communication channels. In this
work, we propose a Robust Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with robust
Safety Shield (SR-MAPPO) for CAVs in various driving scenarios. Both robust
MARL algorithm and control barrier function (CBF)-based safety shield are used
in our approach to cope with the perturbed or uncertain state inputs. The
robust policy is trained with a worst-case Q function regularization module
that pursues higher lower-bounded reward in the former, whereas the latter,
i.e., the robust CBF safety shield accounts for CAVs' collision-free
constraints in complicated driving scenarios with even perturbed vehicle state
information. We validate the advantages of SR-MAPPO in robustness and safety
and compare it with baselines under different driving and state perturbation
scenarios in CARLA simulator. The SR-MAPPO policy is verified to maintain
higher safety rates and efficiency (reward) when threatened by both state
perturbations and unconnected vehicles' dangerous behaviors.

complex dynamics of internal migration and daily mobility in Santiago de Chile
during the global COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on socioeconomic
differentials. Major findings include an increase in daily mobility among
lower-income brackets compared to higher ones in 2020. In contrast, long-term
relocation patterns rose primarily among higher-income groups. These shifts
indicate a nuanced response to the pandemic across socioeconomic strata. Unlike
in 2017, economic factors in 2020 influenced a change not only in the decision
to emigrate but also in the selection of destinations, suggesting a profound
transformation in mobility behaviors. Contrary to expectations, there was no
evidence supporting a preference for rural over urban destinations despite the
surge in emigration from Santiago during the pandemic. The study enhances our
understanding of how varying socioeconomic conditions intersect with mobility
decisions during crises and provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming
to enact fair, informed measures in rapidly changing circumstances.

<p class="mathjax">Text editing is a crucial task that involves modifying text to better align
with user intents. However, existing text editing benchmark datasets have
limitations in providing only coarse-grained instructions. Consequently,
although the edited output may seem reasonable, it often deviates from the
intended changes outlined in the gold reference, resulting in low evaluation
scores. To comprehensively investigate the text editing capabilities of large
language models, this paper introduces XATU, the first benchmark specifically
designed for fine-grained instruction-based explainable text editing. XATU
covers a wide range of topics and text types, incorporating lexical, syntactic,
semantic, and knowledge-intensive edits. To enhance interpretability, we
leverage high-quality data sources and human annotation, resulting in a
benchmark that includes fine-grained instructions and gold-standard edit
explanations. By evaluating existing open and closed large language models
against our benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of instruction tuning
and the impact of underlying architecture across various editing tasks.
Furthermore, extensive experimentation reveals the significant role of
explanations in fine-tuning language models for text editing tasks. The
benchmark will be open-sourced to support reproduction and facilitate future
research.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has shown that multi-task pre-training greatly improves the
model's robustness and transfer ability, which is crucial for building a
high-quality dialog system. However, most previous works on multi-task
pre-training rely heavily on human-defined input format or prompt, which is not
optimal in quality and quantity. In this work, we propose to use Task-based
Automatic Prompt generation (TAP) to automatically generate high-quality
prompts. Using the high-quality prompts generated, we scale the corpus of the
pre-trained conversation model to 122 datasets from 15 dialog-related tasks,
resulting in Universal Pre-trained Conversation Model (UniPCM), a powerful
foundation model for various conversational tasks and different dialog systems.
Extensive experiments have shown that UniPCM is robust to input prompts and
capable of various dialog-related tasks. Moreover, UniPCM has strong transfer
ability and excels at low resource scenarios, achieving SOTA results on 9
different datasets ranging from task-oriented dialog to open-domain
conversation. Furthermore, we are amazed to find that TAP can generate prompts
on par with those collected with crowdsourcing. The code is released with the
paper.

This dual approach effectively resolves fragmented objects, improves detection

<p class="mathjax">Classic Graph Neural Network (GNN) inference approaches, designed for static
graphs, are ill-suited for streaming graphs that evolve with time. The dynamism
intrinsic to streaming graphs necessitates constant updates, posing unique
challenges to acceleration on GPU. We address these challenges based on two key
insights: (1) Inside the $k$-hop neighborhood, a significant fraction of the
nodes is not impacted by the modified edges when the model uses min or max as
aggregation function; (2) When the model weights remain static while the graph
structure changes, node embeddings can incrementally evolve over time by
computing only the impacted part of the neighborhood. With these insights, we
propose a novel method, InkStream, designed for real-time inference with
minimal memory access and computation, while ensuring an identical output to
conventional methods. InkStream operates on the principle of propagating and
fetching data only when necessary. It uses an event-based system to control
inter-layer effect propagation and intra-layer incremental updates of node
embedding. InkStream is highly extensible and easily configurable by allowing
users to create and process customized events. We showcase that less than 10
lines of additional user code are needed to support popular GNN models such as
GCN, GraphSAGE, and GIN. Our experiments with three GNN models on four large
graphs demonstrate that InkStream accelerates by 2.5-427$\times$ on a CPU
cluster and 2.4-343$\times$ on two different GPU clusters while producing
identical outputs as GNN model inference on the latest graph snapshot.

from noisy data. The presence of noise is known to be a significant problem for
symbolic regression algorithms. We combine Gaussian process regression, a
nonparametric learning method, with SINDy, a parametric learning approach, to
identify nonlinear dynamical systems from data. The key advantages of our
proposed approach are its simplicity coupled with the fact that it demonstrates
improved robustness properties with noisy data over SINDy. We demonstrate our
proposed approach on a Lotka-Volterra model and a unicycle dynamic model in
simulation and on an NVIDIA JetRacer system using hardware data. We demonstrate
improved performance over SINDy for discovering the system dynamics and

<p class="mathjax">As video games evolve into expansive, detailed worlds, visual quality becomes
essential, yet increasingly challenging. Traditional testing methods, limited
by resources, face difficulties in addressing the plethora of potential bugs.
Machine learning offers scalable solutions; however, heavy reliance on large
labeled datasets remains a constraint. Addressing this challenge, we propose a
novel method, utilizing unlabeled gameplay and domain-specific augmentations to
generate datasets &amp; self-supervised objectives used during pre-training or
multi-task settings for downstream visual bug detection. Our methodology uses
weak-supervision to scale datasets for the crafted objectives and facilitates
both autonomous and interactive weak-supervision, incorporating unsupervised
clustering and/or an interactive approach based on text and geometric prompts.
We demonstrate on first-person player clipping/collision bugs (FPPC) within the
expansive Giantmap game world, that our approach is very effective, improving
over a strong supervised baseline in a practical, very low-prevalence, low data
regime (0.336 $\rightarrow$ 0.550 F1 score). With just 5 labeled "good"
exemplars (i.e., 0 bugs), our self-supervised objective alone captures enough
signal to outperform the low-labeled supervised settings. Building on
large-pretrained vision models, our approach is adaptable across various visual
bugs. Our results suggest applicability in curating datasets for broader image
and video tasks within video games beyond visual bugs.

<p class="mathjax">Medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) is a machine learning task that
aims to create a system that can answer natural language questions based on
given medical images. Although there has been rapid progress on the general VQA
task, less progress has been made on Med-VQA due to the lack of large-scale
annotated datasets. In this paper, we present domain-specific pre-training
strategies, including a novel contrastive learning pretraining method, to
mitigate the problem of small datasets for the Med-VQA task. We find that the
model benefits from components that use fewer parameters. We also evaluate and
discuss the model's visual reasoning using evidence verification techniques.
Our proposed model obtained an accuracy of 60% on the VQA-Med 2019 test set,
giving comparable results to other state-of-the-art Med-VQA models.

<p class="mathjax">Sound can convey significant information for spatial reasoning in our daily
lives. To endow deep networks with such ability, we address the challenge of
dense indoor prediction with sound in both 2D and 3D via cross-modal knowledge
distillation. In this work, we propose a Spatial Alignment via Matching (SAM)
distillation framework that elicits local correspondence between the two
modalities in vision-to-audio knowledge transfer. SAM integrates audio features
with visually coherent learnable spatial embeddings to resolve inconsistencies
in multiple layers of a student model. Our approach does not rely on a specific
input representation, allowing for flexibility in the input shapes or
dimensions without performance degradation. With a newly curated benchmark
named Dense Auditory Prediction of Surroundings (DAPS), we are the first to
tackle dense indoor prediction of omnidirectional surroundings in both 2D and
3D with audio observations. Specifically, for audio-based depth estimation,
semantic segmentation, and challenging 3D scene reconstruction, the proposed
distillation framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various metrics and backbone architectures.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

<p class="mathjax">Computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, Google Colab) are widely used for
interactive data science and machine learning. In those frameworks, users can
start a session, then execute cells (i.e., a set of statements) to create
variables, train models, visualize results, etc. Unfortunately, existing
notebook systems do not offer live migration: when a notebook launches on a new
machine, it loses its state, preventing users from continuing their tasks from
where they had left off. This is because, unlike DBMS, the sessions directly
rely on underlying kernels (e.g., Python/R interpreters) without an additional
data management layer. Existing techniques for preserving states, such as
copying all variables or OS-level checkpointing, are unreliable (often fail),
inefficient, and platform-dependent. Also, re-running code from scratch can be
highly time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a new notebook system,
ElasticNotebook, that offers live migration via checkpointing/restoration using
a novel mechanism that is reliable, efficient, and platform-independent.
Specifically, by observing all cell executions via transparent, lightweight
monitoring, \system can find a reliable and efficient way (i.e., replication
plan) for reconstructing the original session state, considering variable-cell
dependencies, observed runtime, variable sizes, etc. To this end, our new
graph-based optimization problem finds how to reconstruct all variables
(efficiently) from a subset of variables that can be transferred across
machines. We show that ElasticNotebook reduces end-to-end migration and
restoration times by 85%-98% and 94%-99%, respectively, on a variety (i.e.,
Kaggle, JWST, and Tutorial) of notebooks with negligible runtime and memory
overheads of &lt;2.5% and &lt;10%.

<p class="mathjax">In the past decade, there has been significant advancement in designing
wearable neural interfaces for controlling neurorobotic systems, particularly
bionic limbs. These interfaces function by decoding signals captured
non-invasively from the skin's surface. Portable high-density surface
electromyography (HD-sEMG) modules combined with deep learning decoding have
attracted interest by achieving excellent gesture prediction and myoelectric
control of prosthetic systems and neurorobots. However, factors like
pixel-shape electrode size and unstable skin contact make HD-sEMG susceptible
to pixel electrode drops. The sparse electrode-skin disconnections rooted in
issues such as low adhesion, sweating, hair blockage, and skin stretch
challenge the reliability and scalability of these modules as the perception
unit for neurorobotic systems. This paper proposes a novel deep-learning model
providing resiliency for HD-sEMG modules, which can be used in the wearable
interfaces of neurorobots. The proposed 3D Dilated Efficient CapsNet model
trains on an augmented input space to computationally `force' the network to
learn channel dropout variations and thus learn robustness to channel dropout.
The proposed framework maintained high performance under a sensor dropout
reliability study conducted. Results show conventional models' performance
significantly degrades with dropout and is recovered using the proposed
architecture and the training paradigm.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the prediction stability, prediction accuracy and
control capability of the current probabilistic model-based reinforcement
learning (MBRL) built on neural networks. A novel approach dropout-based
probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (DPETS) is proposed where the
system uncertainty is stably predicted by combining the Monte-Carlo dropout and
trajectory sampling in one framework. Its loss function is designed to correct
the fitting error of neural networks for more accurate prediction of
probabilistic models. The state propagation in its policy is extended to filter
the aleatoric uncertainty for superior control capability. Evaluated by several
Mujoco benchmark control tasks under additional disturbances and one practical
robot arm manipulation task, DPETS outperforms related MBRL approaches in both
average return and convergence velocity while achieving superior performance
than well-known model-free baselines with significant sample efficiency. The
open source code of DPETS is available at https://github.com/mrjun123/DPETS.

<p class="mathjax">With the explosive growth of web videos in recent years, large-scale
Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) becomes increasingly essential in video
filtering, recommendation, and copyright protection. Segment-level CBVR
(S-CBVR) locates the start and end time of similar segments in finer
granularity, which is beneficial for user browsing efficiency and infringement
detection especially in long video scenarios. The challenge of S-CBVR task is
how to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation and
low storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity and
Alignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trained
end-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in video
retrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module to
reduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection
(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frame
extraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but also
introduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms of
temporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy and
efficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly train
SSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the two
key modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other video
retrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.
Experimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higher
alignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational cost
compared to existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">With the advancement in face manipulation technologies, the importance of
face forgery detection in protecting authentication integrity becomes
increasingly evident. Previous Vision Transformer (ViT)-based detectors have
demonstrated subpar performance in cross-database evaluations, primarily
because fully fine-tuning with limited Deepfake data often leads to forgetting
pre-trained knowledge and over-fitting to data-specific ones. To circumvent
these issues, we propose a novel Forgery-aware Adaptive Vision Transformer
(FA-ViT). In FA-ViT, the vanilla ViT's parameters are frozen to preserve its
pre-trained knowledge, while two specially designed components, the Local-aware
Forgery Injector (LFI) and the Global-aware Forgery Adaptor (GFA), are employed
to adapt forgery-related knowledge. our proposed FA-ViT effectively combines
these two different types of knowledge to form the general forgery features for
detecting Deepfakes. Specifically, LFI captures local discriminative
information and incorporates these information into ViT via
Neighborhood-Preserving Cross Attention (NPCA). Simultaneously, GFA learns
adaptive knowledge in the self-attention layer, bridging the gap between the
two different domain. Furthermore, we design a novel Single Domain Pairwise
Learning (SDPL) to facilitate fine-grained information learning in FA-ViT. The
extensive experiments demonstrate that our FA-ViT achieves state-of-the-art
performance in cross-dataset evaluation and cross-manipulation scenarios, and
improves the robustness against unseen perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Lyric translation, a field studied for over a century, is now attracting
computational linguistics researchers. We identified two limitations in
previous studies. Firstly, lyric translation studies have predominantly focused
on Western genres and languages, with no previous study centering on K-pop
despite its popularity. Second, the field of lyric translation suffers from a
lack of publicly available datasets; to the best of our knowledge, no such
dataset exists. To broaden the scope of genres and languages in lyric
translation studies, we introduce a novel singable lyric translation dataset,
approximately 89\% of which consists of K-pop song lyrics. This dataset aligns
Korean and English lyrics line-by-line and section-by-section. We leveraged
this dataset to unveil unique characteristics of K-pop lyric translation,
distinguishing it from other extensively studied genres, and to construct a
neural lyric translation model, thereby underscoring the importance of a
dedicated dataset for singable lyric translations.

<p class="mathjax">Delays are inherent to most dynamical systems. Besides shifting the process
in time, they can significantly affect their performance. For this reason, it
is usually valuable to study the delay and account for it. Because they are
dynamical systems, it is of no surprise that sequential decision-making
problems such as Markov decision processes (MDP) can also be affected by
delays. These processes are the foundational framework of reinforcement
learning (RL), a paradigm whose goal is to create artificial agents capable of
learning to maximise their utility by interacting with their environment.
<br />RL has achieved strong, sometimes astonishing, empirical results, but delays
are seldom explicitly accounted for. The understanding of the impact of delay
on the MDP is limited. In this dissertation, we propose to study the delay in
the agent's observation of the state of the environment or in the execution of
the agent's actions. We will repeatedly change our point of view on the problem
to reveal some of its structure and peculiarities. A wide spectrum of delays
will be considered, and potential solutions will be presented. This
dissertation also aims to draw links between celebrated frameworks of the RL
literature and the one of delays.

<p class="mathjax">Stress is various mental health disorders including depression and anxiety
among college students. Early stress diagnosis and intervention may lower the
risk of developing mental illnesses. We examined a machine learning-based
method for identification of stress using data collected in a naturalistic
study utilizing self-reported stress as ground truth as well as physiological
data such as heart rate and hand acceleration. The study involved 54 college
students from a large campus who used wearable wrist-worn sensors and a mobile
health (mHealth) application continuously for 40 days. The app gathered
physiological data including heart rate and hand acceleration at one hertz
frequency. The application also enabled users to self-report stress by tapping
on the watch face, resulting in a time-stamped record of the self-reported
stress. We created, evaluated, and analyzed machine learning algorithms for
identifying stress episodes among college students using heart rate and
accelerometer data. The XGBoost method was the most reliable model with an AUC
of 0.64 and an accuracy of 84.5%. The standard deviation of hand acceleration,
standard deviation of heart rate, and the minimum heart rate were the most
important features for stress detection. This evidence may support the efficacy
of identifying patterns in physiological reaction to stress using smartwatch
sensors and may inform the design of future tools for real-time detection of
stress.

<p class="mathjax">In healthcare applications, understanding how machine/deep learning models
make decisions is crucial. In this study, we introduce a neural network
framework, $\textit{Truth Table rules}$ (TT-rules), that combines the global
and exact interpretability properties of rule-based models with the high
performance of deep neural networks. TT-rules is built upon $\textit{Truth
Table nets}$ (TTnet), a family of deep neural networks initially developed for
formal verification. By extracting the necessary and sufficient rules
$\mathcal{R}$ from the trained TTnet model (global interpretability) to yield
the same output as the TTnet (exact interpretability), TT-rules effectively
transforms the neural network into a rule-based model. This rule-based model
supports binary classification, multi-label classification, and regression
tasks for small to large tabular datasets. After outlining the framework, we
evaluate TT-rules' performance on healthcare applications and compare it to
state-of-the-art rule-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TT-rules
achieves equal or higher performance compared to other interpretable methods.
Notably, TT-rules presents the first accurate rule-based model capable of
fitting large tabular datasets, including two real-life DNA datasets with over
20K features.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized federated learning (PFL) reduces the impact of non-independent
and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients by allowing each
client to train a personalized model when collaborating with others. A key
question in PFL is to decide which parameters of a client should be localized
or shared with others. In current mainstream approaches, all layers that are
sensitive to non-IID data (such as classifier layers) are generally
personalized. The reasoning behind this approach is understandable, as
localizing parameters that are easily influenced by non-IID data can prevent
the potential negative effect of collaboration. However, we believe that this
approach is too conservative for collaboration. For example, for a certain
client, even if its parameters are easily influenced by non-IID data, it can
still benefit by sharing these parameters with clients having similar data
distribution. This observation emphasizes the importance of considering not
only the sensitivity to non-IID data but also the similarity of data
distribution when determining which parameters should be localized in PFL. This
paper introduces a novel guideline for client collaboration in PFL. Unlike
existing approaches that prohibit all collaboration of sensitive parameters,
our guideline allows clients to share more parameters with others, leading to
improved model performance. Additionally, we propose a new PFL method named
FedCAC, which employs a quantitative metric to evaluate each parameter's
sensitivity to non-IID data and carefully selects collaborators based on this
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that FedCAC enables clients to
share more parameters with others, resulting in superior performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where clients have
diverse distributions.

<p class="mathjax">The Mixup method has proven to be a powerful data augmentation technique in
Computer Vision, with many successors that perform image mixing in a guided
manner. One of the interesting research directions is transferring the
underlying Mixup idea to other domains, e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Even though there already exist several methods that apply Mixup to textual
data, there is still room for new, improved approaches. In this work, we
introduce AttentionMix, a novel mixing method that relies on attention-based
information. While the paper focuses on the BERT attention mechanism, the
proposed approach can be applied to generally any attention-based model.
AttentionMix is evaluated on 3 standard sentiment classification datasets and
in all three cases outperforms two benchmark approaches that utilize Mixup
mechanism, as well as the vanilla BERT method. The results confirm that the
attention-based information can be effectively used for data augmentation in
the NLP domain.

<p class="mathjax">By applying the linearly implicit conservative difference scheme proposed in
[D.-L. Wang, A.-G. Xiao, W. Yang. J. Comput. Phys. 2014;272:670-681], the
system of repulsive space fractional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations
leads to a sequence of linear systems with complex symmetric and
Toeplitz-plus-diagonal structure. In this paper, we propose the diagonal and
normal with Toeplitz-block splitting iteration method to solve the above linear
systems. The new iteration method is proved to converge unconditionally, and
the optimal iteration parameter is deducted. Naturally, this new iteration
method leads to a diagonal and normal with circulant-block preconditioner which
can be executed efficiently by fast algorithms. In theory, we provide sharp
bounds for the eigenvalues of the discrete fractional Laplacian and its
circulant approximation, and further analysis indicates that the spectral
distribution of the preconditioned system matrix is tight. Numerical
experiments show that the new preconditioner can significantly improve the
computational efficiency of the Krylov subspace iteration methods. Moreover,
the corresponding preconditioned GMRES method shows space mesh size independent
and almost fractional order parameter insensitive convergence behaviors.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a simultaneous exploration and object search
framework for the application of autonomous trolley collection. For environment
representation, a task-oriented environment partitioning algorithm is presented
to extract diverse information for each sub-task. First, LiDAR data is
classified as potential objects, walls, and obstacles after outlier removal.
Segmented point clouds are then transformed into a hybrid map with the
following functional components: object proposals to avoid missing trolleys
during exploration; room layouts for semantic space segmentation; and polygonal
obstacles containing geometry information for efficient motion planning. For
exploration and simultaneous trolley collection, we propose an efficient
exploration-based object search method. First, a traveling salesman problem
with precedence constraints (TSP-PC) is formulated by grouping frontiers and
object proposals. The next target is selected by prioritizing object search
while avoiding excessive robot backtracking. Then, feasible trajectories with
adequate obstacle clearance are generated by topological graph search. We
validate the proposed framework through simulations and demonstrate the system
with real-world autonomous trolley collection tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Domain shift caused by, e.g., different geographical regions or acquisition
conditions is a common issue in machine learning for global scale satellite
image processing. A promising method to address this problem is domain
adaptation, where the training and the testing datasets are split into two or
multiple domains according to their distributions, and an adaptation method is
applied to improve the generalizability of the model on the testing dataset.
However, defining the domain to which each satellite image belongs is not
trivial, especially under large-scale multi-temporal and multi-sensory
scenarios, where a single image mosaic could be generated from multiple data
sources. In this paper, we propose an self-supervised domain-agnostic domain
adaptation (SS(DA)2) method to perform domain adaptation without such a domain
definition. To achieve this, we first design a contrastive generative
adversarial loss to train a generative network to perform image-to-image
translation between any two satellite image patches. Then, we improve the
generalizability of the downstream models by augmenting the training data with
different testing spectral characteristics. The experimental results on public
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of SS(DA)2.

<p class="mathjax">Intrinsic susceptibility of deep learning to adversarial examples has led to
a plethora of attack techniques with a broad common objective of fooling deep
models. However, we find slight compositional differences between the
algorithms achieving this objective. These differences leave traces that
provide important clues for attacker profiling in real-life scenarios. Inspired
by this, we introduce a novel problem of PRofiling Adversarial aTtacks (PRAT).
Given an adversarial example, the objective of PRAT is to identify the attack
used to generate it. Under this perspective, we can systematically group
existing attacks into different families, leading to the sub-problem of attack
family identification, which we also study. To enable PRAT analysis, we
introduce a large Adversarial Identification Dataset (AID), comprising over
180k adversarial samples generated with 13 popular attacks for image
specific/agnostic white/black box setups. We use AID to devise a novel
framework for the PRAT objective. Our framework utilizes a Transformer based
Global-LOcal Feature (GLOF) module to extract an approximate signature of the
adversarial attack, which in turn is used for the identification of the attack.
Using AID and our framework, we provide multiple interesting benchmark results
for the PRAT problem.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid and massive diffusion of electric vehicles poses new challenges to
the electric system, which must be able to supply these new loads, but at the
same time opens up new opportunities thanks to the possible provision of
ancillary services. Indeed, in the so-called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) set-up, the
charging power can be modulated throughout the day so that a fleet of vehicles
can absorb an excess of power from the grid or provide extra power during a
shortage.To this end, many works in the literature focus on the optimization of
each vehicle daily charging profiles to offer the requested ancillary services
while guaranteeing a charged battery for each vehicle at the end of the day.
However, the size of the economic benefits related to the provision of
ancillary services varies significantly with the modeling approaches, different
assumptions, and considered scenarios. In this paper we propose a profitability
analysis with reference to a recently proposed framework for V2G optimal
operation in presence of uncertainty. We provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for profitability in a simplified case and we show via simulation
that they also hold for the general case.

<p class="mathjax">A recent sensor fusion in a Bird's Eye View (BEV) space has shown its utility
in various tasks such as 3D detection, map segmentation, etc. However, the
approach struggles with inaccurate camera BEV estimation, and a perception of
distant areas due to the sparsity of LiDAR points. In this paper, we propose a
broad BEV fusion (\textit{BroadBEV}) that addresses the problems with a spatial
synchronization approach of cross-modality. Our strategy aims to enhance camera
BEV estimation for a broad-sighted perception while simultaneously improving
the completion of LiDAR's sparsity in the entire BEV space. Toward that end, we
devise Point-scattering that scatters LiDAR BEV distribution to camera depth
distribution. The method boosts the learning of depth estimation of the camera
branch and induces accurate location of dense camera features in BEV space. For
an effective BEV fusion between the spatially synchronized features, we suggest
ColFusion that applies self-attention weights of LiDAR and camera BEV features
to each other. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BroadBEV provides a
broad-sighted BEV perception with remarkable performance gains.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) serves as a non-destructive spatial spectroscopy
technique with a multitude of potential applications. However, a recurring
challenge lies in the limited size of the target datasets, impeding exhaustive
architecture search. Consequently, when venturing into novel applications,
reliance on established methodologies becomes commonplace, in the hope that
they exhibit favorable generalization characteristics. Regrettably, this
optimism is often unfounded due to the fine-tuned nature of models tailored to
specific HSI contexts.
<br />To address this predicament, this study introduces an innovative benchmark
dataset encompassing three markedly distinct HSI applications: food inspection,
remote sensing, and recycling. This comprehensive dataset affords a finer
assessment of hyperspectral model capabilities. Moreover, this benchmark
facilitates an incisive examination of prevailing state-of-the-art techniques,
consequently fostering the evolution of superior methodologies.
<br />Furthermore, the enhanced diversity inherent in the benchmark dataset
underpins the establishment of a pretraining pipeline for HSI. This pretraining
regimen serves to enhance the stability of training processes for larger
models. Additionally, a procedural framework is delineated, offering insights
into the handling of applications afflicted by limited target dataset sizes.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, advanced model-based and data-driven control methods are
unlocking the potential of complex robotics systems, and we can expect this
trend to continue at an exponential rate in the near future. However, ensuring
safety with these advanced control methods remains a challenge. A well-known
tool to make controllers (either Model Predictive Controllers or Reinforcement
Learning policies) safe, is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe
set). Unfortunately, for nonlinear systems, such a set cannot be exactly
computed in general. Numerical algorithms exist for computing approximate
control-invariant sets, but classic theoretic control methods break down if the
set is not exact. This paper presents our recent efforts to address this issue.
We present a novel Model Predictive Control scheme that can guarantee recursive
feasibility and/or safety under weaker assumptions than classic methods. In
particular, recursive feasibility is guaranteed by making the safe-set
constraint move backward over the horizon, and assuming that such set satisfies
a condition that is weaker than control invariance. Safety is instead
guaranteed under an even weaker assumption on the safe set, triggering a safe
task-abortion strategy whenever a risk of constraint violation is detected. We
evaluated our approach on a simulated robot manipulator, empirically
demonstrating that it leads to less constraint violations than state-of-the-art
approaches, while retaining reasonable performance in terms of tracking cost
and number of completed tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Dominant Person Search methods aim to localize and recognize query persons in
a unified network, which jointly optimizes two sub-tasks, \ie, detection and
Re-IDentification (ReID). Despite significant progress, two major challenges
remain: 1) Detection-prior modules in previous methods are suboptimal for the
ReID task. 2) The collaboration between two sub-tasks is ignored. To alleviate
these issues, we present a novel Person Search framework based on the Diffusion
model, PSDiff. PSDiff formulates the person search as a dual denoising process
from noisy boxes and ReID embeddings to ground truths. Unlike existing methods
that follow the Detection-to-ReID paradigm, our denoising paradigm eliminates
detection-prior modules to avoid the local-optimum of the ReID task. Following
the new paradigm, we further design a new Collaborative Denoising Layer (CDL)
to optimize detection and ReID sub-tasks in an iterative and collaborative way,
which makes two sub-tasks mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments on the
standard benchmarks show that PSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance with
fewer parameters and elastic computing overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake has taken the world by storm, triggering a trust crisis. Current
deepfake detection methods are typically inadequate in generalizability, with a
tendency to overfit to image contents such as the background, which are
frequently occurring but relatively unimportant in the training dataset.
Furthermore, current methods heavily rely on a few dominant forgery regions and
may ignore other equally important regions, leading to inadequate uncovering of
forgery cues. In this paper, we strive to address these shortcomings from three
aspects: (1) We propose an innovative two-stream network that effectively
enlarges the potential regions from which the model extracts forgery evidence.
(2) We devise three functional modules to handle the multi-stream and
multi-scale features in a collaborative learning scheme. (3) Confronted with
the challenge of obtaining forgery annotations, we propose a Semi-supervised
Patch Similarity Learning strategy to estimate patch-level forged location
annotations. Empirically, our method demonstrates significantly improved
robustness and generalizability, outperforming previous methods on six
benchmarks, and improving the frame-level AUC on Deepfake Detection Challenge
preview dataset from 0.797 to 0.835 and video-level AUC on CelebDF$\_$v1
dataset from 0.811 to 0.847. Our implementation is available at

<p class="mathjax">The challenge in sourcing attribution for forgery faces has gained widespread
attention due to the rapid development of generative techniques. While many
recent works have taken essential steps on GAN-generated faces, more
threatening attacks related to identity swapping or expression transferring are
still overlooked. And the forgery traces hidden in unknown attacks from the
open-world unlabeled faces still remain under-explored. To push the related
frontier research, we introduce a new benchmark called Open-World DeepFake
Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to evaluate attribution performance against
various types of fake faces under open-world scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel framework named Contrastive Pseudo Learning (CPL) for the OW-DFA task
through 1) introducing a Global-Local Voting module to guide the feature
alignment of forged faces with different manipulated regions, 2) designing a
Confidence-based Soft Pseudo-label strategy to mitigate the pseudo-noise caused
by similar methods in unlabeled set. In addition, we extend the CPL framework
with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative
learning to further enhance traceability performance. Extensive experiments
verify the superiority of our proposed method on the OW-DFA and also
demonstrate the interpretability of deepfake attribution task and its impact on
improving the security of deepfake detection area.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a shape anchor guided learning strategy (AncLearn) for
robust holistic indoor scene understanding. We observe that the search space
constructed by current methods for proposal feature grouping and instance point
sampling often introduces massive noise to instance detection and mesh
reconstruction. Accordingly, we develop AncLearn to generate anchors that
dynamically fit instance surfaces to (i) unmix noise and target-related
features for offering reliable proposals at the detection stage, and (ii)
reduce outliers in object point sampling for directly providing well-structured
geometry priors without segmentation during reconstruction. We embed AncLearn
into a reconstruction-from-detection learning system (AncRec) to generate
high-quality semantic scene models in a purely instance-oriented manner.
Experiments conducted on the challenging ScanNetv2 dataset demonstrate that our
shape anchor-based method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of 3D object detection, layout estimation, and shape reconstruction. The
code will be available at https://github.com/Geo-Tell/AncRec.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and robust vehicle localization in highly urbanized areas is
challenging. Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale
environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory
estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements
for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor
measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation
using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary
timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state
and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a
generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study
different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight
coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets
from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental
studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations,
smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed
approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the
classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test
sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in
a mean 2D positioning error of 0.19m for loosely coupled GNSS fusion and 0.48m
while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in tight coupling.

<p class="mathjax">Beam selection for joint transmission in cell-free massive multi-input
multi-output systems faces the problem of extremely high training overhead and
computational complexity. The traffic-aware quality of service additionally
complicates the beam selection problem. To address this issue, we propose a
traffic-aware hierarchical beam selection scheme performed in a dual timescale.
In the long-timescale, the central processing unit collects wide beam responses
from base stations (BSs) to predict the power profile in the narrow beam space
with a convolutional neural network, based on which the cascaded multiple-BS
beam space is carefully pruned. In the short-timescale, we introduce a
centralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to maximize the satisfaction
rate of delay w.r.t. beam selection within multiple consecutive time slots.
Moreover, we put forward three scalable distributed algorithms including
hierarchical distributed Lyapunov optimization, fully distributed RL, and
centralized training with decentralized execution of RL to achieve better
scalability and better tradeoff between the performance and the execution
signal overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes
significantly reduce both model training cost and beam training overhead and
are easier to meet the user-specific delay requirement, compared to existing
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised sentence representation learning aims to transform input
sentences into fixed-length vectors enriched with intricate semantic
information while obviating the reliance on labeled data. Recent progress
within this field, propelled by contrastive learning and prompt engineering,
has significantly bridged the gap between unsupervised and supervised
strategies. Nonetheless, the potential utilization of Chain-of-Thought, remains
largely untapped within this trajectory. To unlock latent capabilities within
pre-trained models, such as BERT, we propose a two-stage approach for sentence
representation: comprehension and summarization. Subsequently, the output of
the latter phase is harnessed as the vectorized representation of the input
sentence. For further performance enhancement, we meticulously refine both the
contrastive learning loss function and the template denoising technique for
prompt engineering. Rigorous experimentation substantiates our method,
CoT-BERT, transcending a suite of robust baselines without necessitating other
text representation models or external databases.

<p class="mathjax">Cardiac structure segmentation from echocardiogram videos plays a crucial
role in diagnosing heart disease. The combination of multi-view echocardiogram
data is essential to enhance the accuracy and robustness of automated methods.
However, due to the visual disparity of the data, deriving cross-view context
information remains a challenging task, and unsophisticated fusion strategies
can even lower performance. In this study, we propose a novel Gobal-Local
fusion (GL-Fusion) network to jointly utilize multi-view information globally
and locally that improve the accuracy of echocardiogram analysis. Specifically,
a Multi-view Global-based Fusion Module (MGFM) is proposed to extract global
context information and to explore the cyclic relationship of different
heartbeat cycles in an echocardiogram video. Additionally, a Multi-view
Local-based Fusion Module (MLFM) is designed to extract correlations of cardiac
structures from different views. Furthermore, we collect a multi-view
echocardiogram video dataset (MvEVD) to evaluate our method. Our method
achieves an 82.29% average dice score, which demonstrates a 7.83% improvement
over the baseline method, and outperforms other existing state-of-the-art
methods. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of a multi-view method
for echocardiogram video segmentation. Code available at:

<p class="mathjax">Echocardiogram video segmentation plays an important role in cardiac disease
diagnosis. This paper studies the unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) for
echocardiogram video segmentation, where the goal is to generalize the model
trained on the source domain to other unlabelled target domains. Existing UDA
segmentation methods are not suitable for this task because they do not model
local information and the cyclical consistency of heartbeat. In this paper, we
introduce a newly collected CardiacUDA dataset and a novel GraphEcho method for
cardiac structure segmentation. Our GraphEcho comprises two innovative modules,
the Spatial-wise Cross-domain Graph Matching (SCGM) and the Temporal Cycle
Consistency (TCC) module, which utilize prior knowledge of echocardiogram
videos, i.e., consistent cardiac structure across patients and centers and the
heartbeat cyclical consistency, respectively. These two modules can better
align global and local features from source and target domains, improving UDA
segmentation results. Experimental results showed that our GraphEcho

<p class="mathjax">Wheeled mobile robots need the ability to estimate their motion and the
effect of their control actions for navigation planning. In this paper, we
present ST-VIO, a novel approach which tightly fuses a single-track dynamics
model for wheeled ground vehicles with visual inertial odometry. Our method
calibrates and adapts the dynamics model online and facilitates accurate
forward prediction conditioned on future control inputs. The single-track
dynamics model approximates wheeled vehicle motion under specific control
inputs on flat ground using ordinary differential equations. We use a
singularity-free and differentiable variant of the single-track model to enable
seamless integration as dynamics factor into VIO and to optimize the model
parameters online together with the VIO state variables. We validate our method
with real-world data in both indoor and outdoor environments with different
terrain types and wheels. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our ST-VIO
can not only adapt to the change of the environments and achieve accurate
prediction under new control inputs, but even improves the tracking accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In-process compartmentalization and access control have been actively
explored to provide in-place and efficient isolation of in-process security
domains. Many works have proposed compartmentalization schemes that leverage
hardware features, most notably using the new page-based memory isolation
feature called Protection Keys for Userspace (PKU) on x86. Unfortunately, the
modern ARM architecture does not have an equivalent feature. Instead, newer ARM
architectures introduced Pointer Authentication (PA) and Memory Tagging
Extension (MTE), adapting the reference validation model for memory safety and
runtime exploit mitigation. We argue that those features have been
underexplored in the context of compartmentalization and that they can be
retrofitted to implement a capability-based in-process access control scheme.
This paper presents Capacity, a novel hardware-assisted intra-process access
control design that embraces capability-based security principles. Capacity
coherently incorporates the new hardware security features on ARM that already
exhibit inherent characteristics of capability. It supports the life-cycle
protection of the domain's sensitive objects -- starting from their import from
the file system to their place in memory. With intra-process domains
authenticated with unique PA keys, Capacity transforms file descriptors and
memory pointers into cryptographically-authenticated references and completely
mediates reference usage with its program instrumentation framework and an
efficient system call monitor. We evaluate our Capacity-enabled NGINX web
server prototype and other common applications in which sensitive resources are
isolated into different domains. Our evaluation shows that Capacity incurs a
low-performance overhead of approximately 17% for the single-threaded and
13.54% for the multi-threaded webserver.

<p class="mathjax">In high-stakes settings, Machine Learning models that can provide predictions
that are interpretable for humans are crucial. This is even more true with the
advent of complex deep learning based models with a huge number of tunable
parameters. Recently, prototype-based methods have emerged as a promising
approach to make deep learning interpretable. We particularly focus on the
analysis of deepfake videos in a forensics context. Although prototype-based
methods have been introduced for the detection of deepfake videos, their use in
real-world scenarios still presents major challenges, in that prototypes tend
to be overly similar and interpretability varies between prototypes. This paper
proposes a Visual Analytics process model for prototype learning, and, based on
this, presents ProtoExplorer, a Visual Analytics system for the exploration and
refinement of prototype-based deepfake detection models. ProtoExplorer offers
tools for visualizing and temporally filtering prototype-based predictions when
working with video data. It disentangles the complexity of working with
spatio-temporal prototypes, facilitating their visualization. It further
enables the refinement of models by interactively deleting and replacing
prototypes with the aim to achieve more interpretable and less biased
predictions while preserving detection accuracy. The system was designed with
forensic experts and evaluated in a number of rounds based on both open-ended
think aloud evaluation and interviews. These sessions have confirmed the
strength of our prototype based exploration of deepfake videos while they
provided the feedback needed to continuously improve the system.

<p class="mathjax">This article addresses the challenge of vision-based proximity navigation in
asteroid exploration missions and on-orbit servicing. Traditional feature
extraction methods struggle with the significant appearance variations of
asteroids due to limited scattered light. To overcome this, we propose a
lightweight feature extractor specifically tailored for asteroid proximity
navigation, designed to be robust to illumination changes and affine
transformations. We compare and evaluate state-of-the-art feature extraction
networks and three lightweight network architectures in the asteroid context.
Our proposed feature extractors and their evaluation leverages both synthetic
images and real-world data from missions such as NEAR Shoemaker, Hayabusa,
Rosetta, and OSIRIS-REx. Our contributions include a trained feature extractor,
incremental improvements over existing methods, and a pipeline for training
domain-specific feature extractors. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving accurate navigation and
localization. This work aims to advance the field of asteroid navigation and
provides insights for future research in this domain.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking of plant cells in images obtained by microscope is a challenging
problem due to biological phenomena such as large number of cells, non-uniform
growth of different layers of the tightly packed plant cells and cell division.
Moreover, images in deeper layers of the tissue being noisy and unavoidable
systemic errors inherent in the imaging process further complicates the
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method that exploits
the tightly packed three-dimensional cell structure of plant cells to create a
three-dimensional graph in order to perform accurate cell tracking. We further
propose novel algorithms for cell division detection and effective
three-dimensional registration, which improve upon the state-of-the-art
algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in terms of tracking
accuracy and inference-time on a benchmark dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation (FSVOS) aims to segment objects in a query
video with the same category defined by a few annotated support images.
However, this task was seldom explored. In this work, based on IPMT, a
state-of-the-art few-shot image segmentation method that combines external
support guidance information with adaptive query guidance cues, we propose to
leverage multi-grained temporal guidance information for handling the temporal
correlation nature of video data. We decompose the query video information into
a clip prototype and a memory prototype for capturing local and long-term
internal temporal guidance, respectively. Frame prototypes are further used for
each frame independently to handle fine-grained adaptive guidance and enable
bidirectional clip-frame prototype communication. To reduce the influence of
noisy memory, we propose to leverage the structural similarity relation among
different predicted regions and the support for selecting reliable memory
frames. Furthermore, a new segmentation loss is also proposed to enhance the
category discriminability of the learned prototypes. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed video IPMT model significantly outperforms
previous models on two benchmark datasets. Code is available at
https://github.com/nankepan/VIPMT.

<p class="mathjax">Benefiting from tens of GHz of bandwidth, terahertz (THz) communications has
become a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, the conventional
hybrid beamforming architecture based on frequency-independent phase-shifters
is not able to cope with the beam split effect (BSE) in THz massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Despite some work introducing
the frequency-dependent phase shifts via the time delay network to mitigate the
beam splitting in THz wideband communications, the corresponding issue in
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communications has not been well
investigated. In this paper, the BSE in THz massive MIMO is quantified by
analyzing the array gain loss. A new beamforming architecture has been proposed
to mitigate this effect under RIS-aided communications scenarios. Simulations
are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture
in combating the array gain loss.

recover constituent and dependency structures by casting parsing as sequence
labeling. To do so, we select a few LLMs and study them on 13 diverse UD
treebanks for dependency parsing and 10 treebanks for constituent parsing. Our
results show that: (i) the framework is consistent across encodings, (ii)
pre-trained word vectors do not favor constituency representations of syntax
over dependencies, (iii) sub-word tokenization is needed to represent syntax,

<p class="mathjax">The swift advancement in the scale and capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) positions them as promising tools for a variety of downstream tasks. In
addition to the pursuit of better performance and the avoidance of violent
feedback on a certain prompt, to ensure the responsibility of the LLM, much
attention is drawn to the robustness of LLMs. However, existing evaluation
methods mostly rely on traditional question answering datasets with predefined
supervised labels, which do not align with the superior generation capabilities
of contemporary LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel rational
evaluation approach that leverages pre-trained reward models as diagnostic
tools to evaluate the robustness of LLMs, which we refer to as the Reward Model
for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation (TREvaL). Our extensive empirical
experiments have demonstrated that TREval provides an accurate method for
evaluating the robustness of an LLM, especially when faced with more
challenging open questions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that LLMs
frequently exhibit vulnerability to word-level perturbations, which are
commonplace in daily language usage. Notably, we were surprised to discover
that robustness tends to decrease as fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF) is conducted.
The code of TREval is available in https://github.com/Harry-mic/TREval.

<p class="mathjax">In the current deep learning paradigm, the amount and quality of training
data are as critical as the network architecture and its training details.
However, collecting, processing, and annotating real data at scale is
difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, particularly for tasks such as 3D
object registration. While synthetic datasets can be created, they require
expertise to design and include a limited number of categories. In this paper,
we introduce a new approach called AutoSynth, which automatically generates 3D
training data for point cloud registration. Specifically, AutoSynth
automatically curates an optimal dataset by exploring a search space
encompassing millions of potential datasets with diverse 3D shapes at a low
cost.To achieve this, we generate synthetic 3D datasets by assembling shape
primitives, and develop a meta-learning strategy to search for the best
training data for 3D registration on real point clouds. For this search to
remain tractable, we replace the point cloud registration network with a much
smaller surrogate network, leading to a $4056.43$ times speedup. We demonstrate
the generality of our approach by implementing it with two different point
cloud registration networks, BPNet and IDAM. Our results on TUD-L, LINEMOD and
Occluded-LINEMOD evidence that a neural network trained on our searched dataset
yields consistently better performance than the same one trained on the widely
used ModelNet40 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) is a more promising solution for
medical image segmentation tasks where high-quality annotations are naturally
scarce. However, current mainstream methods primarily focus on extracting
holistic representations from support images with large intra-class variations
in appearance and background, and encounter difficulties in adapting to query
images. In this work, we present an approach to extract multiple representative
sub-regions from a given support medical image, enabling fine-grained selection
over the generated image regions. Specifically, the foreground of the support
image is decomposed into distinct regions, which are subsequently used to
derive region-level representations via a designed Regional Prototypical
Learning (RPL) module. We then introduce a novel Prototypical Representation
Debiasing (PRD) module based on a two-way elimination mechanism which
suppresses the disturbance of regional representations by a self-support,
Multi-direction Self-debiasing (MS) block, and a support-query, Interactive
Debiasing (ID) block. Finally, an Assembled Prediction (AP) module is devised
to balance and integrate predictions of multiple prototypical representations
learned using stacked PRD modules. Results obtained through extensive
experiments on three publicly accessible medical imaging datasets demonstrate
consistent improvements over the leading FSMIS methods. The source code is

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the problem of determining the identity of a byzantine user
(internal adversary) in a communication system. We consider a two-user discrete
memoryless multiple access channel where either user may deviate from the
prescribed behaviour. Owing to the noisy nature of the channel, it may be
overly restrictive to attempt to detect all deviations. In our formulation, we
only require detecting deviations which impede the decoding of the
non-deviating user's message. When neither user deviates, correct decoding is
required. When one user deviates, the decoder must either output a pair of
messages of which the message of the non-deviating user is correct or identify
the deviating user. The users and the receiver do not share any randomness. The
results include a characterization of the set of channels where communication
is feasible, and an inner and outer bound on the capacity region. We also show
that whenever the rate region has non-empty interior, the capacity region is
same as the capacity region under randomized encoding, where each user shares
independent randomness with the receiver. We also give an outer bound for this
randomized coding capacity region.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has demonstrated promising results for
recommender systems, as they can effectively leverage high-order relationship.
However, these methods usually encounter data sparsity issue in real-world
scenarios. To address this issue, GCN-based recommendation methods employ
contrastive learning to introduce self-supervised signals. Despite their
effectiveness, these methods lack consideration of the significant degree
disparity between head and tail nodes. This can lead to non-uniform
representation distribution, which is a crucial factor for the performance of
contrastive learning methods. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel
Long-tail Augmented Graph Contrastive Learning (LAGCL) method for
recommendation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable long-tail augmentation
approach to enhance tail nodes by supplementing predicted neighbor information,
and generate contrastive views based on the resulting augmented graph. To make
the data augmentation schema learnable, we design an auto drop module to
generate pseudo-tail nodes from head nodes and a knowledge transfer module to
reconstruct the head nodes from pseudo-tail nodes. Additionally, we employ
generative adversarial networks to ensure that the distribution of the
generated tail/head nodes matches that of the original tail/head nodes.
Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the
significant improvement in performance of our model over the state-of-the-arts.
Further analyses demonstrate the uniformity of learned representations and the
superiority of LAGCL on long-tail performance. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/im0qianqian/LAGCL

computation (procedural) impact programmer ergonomics, code reusability and
database efficiency. To eliminate the necessity for two models or paradigms, we
propose a small but high-leverage innovation: the introduction of complete
relations into the relational database. Complete relations and the discipline
of constraint programming, which concerns them, are founded on the same algebra
as relational databases. We claim that by synthesising the relational database
of Codd and Date, with the results of the constraint programming community, the
relational model holistically offers programmers a single declarative paradigm
for both data transformation and computation, reusable code with computations
that are indifferent to what is input and what is output, and efficient
applications with the query engine optimising and parallelising all levels of
data transformation and computation.

<p class="mathjax">Arbitrary Pattern Formation (APF) is a fundamental coordination problem in
swarm robotics. It requires a set of autonomous robots (mobile computing units)
to form any arbitrary pattern (given as input) starting from any initial
pattern. The APF problem is well-studied in both continuous and discrete
settings. This work concerns the discrete version of the problem. A set of
robots is placed on the nodes of an infinite rectangular grid graph embedded in
a euclidean plane. The movements of the robots are restricted to one of the
four neighboring grid nodes from its current position. The robots are
autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate
Look-Compute-Move cycles. Here we have considered the classical
$\mathcal{OBLOT}$ robot model, i.e., the robots have no persistent memory and
no explicit means of communication. The robots have full unobstructed
visibility. This work proposes an algorithm that solves the APF problem in a
fully asynchronous scheduler under this setting assuming the initial
configuration is asymmetric. The considered performance measures of the
algorithm are space and number of moves required for the robots. The algorithm
is asymptotically move-optimal. A definition of the space-complexity is
presented here. We observe an obvious lower bound $\mathcal{D}$ of the space
complexity and show that the proposed algorithm has the space complexity
$\mathcal{D}+4$. On comparing with previous related works, we show that this is
the first proposed algorithm considering $\mathcal{OBLOT}$ robot model that is
asymptotically move-optimal and has the least space complexity which is almost
optimal.

<p class="mathjax">Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) is a widely-used explainability method for
isolating the average effect of a feature on the output, because it handles
cases with correlated features well. However, it has two limitations. First, it
does not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from the
average (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating the
average effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sized
bins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. To
address these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE
(RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standard
deviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimal
variable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve an
unbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within each
bin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on these
conditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal
partitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance. Through evaluations
on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RHALE
compared to other methods, including the advantages of automatic bin splitting,
especially in cases with correlated features.

<p class="mathjax">The Languini Kitchen serves as both a research collective and codebase
designed to empower researchers with limited computational resources to
contribute meaningfully to the field of language modelling. We introduce an
experimental protocol that enables model comparisons based on equivalent
compute, measured in accelerator hours. The number of tokens on which a model
is trained is defined by the model's throughput and the chosen compute class.
Notably, this approach avoids constraints on critical hyperparameters which
affect total parameters or floating-point operations. For evaluation, we
pre-process an existing large, diverse, and high-quality dataset of books that
surpasses existing academic benchmarks in quality, diversity, and document
length. On it, we compare methods based on their empirical scaling trends which
are estimated through experiments at various levels of compute. This work also
provides two baseline models: a feed-forward model derived from the GPT-2
architecture and a recurrent model in the form of a novel LSTM with ten-fold
throughput. While the GPT baseline achieves better perplexity throughout all
our levels of compute, our LSTM baseline exhibits a predictable and more
favourable scaling law. This is due to the improved throughput and the need for
fewer training tokens to achieve the same decrease in test perplexity.
Extrapolating the scaling laws leads of both models results in an intersection
at roughly 50,000 accelerator hours. We hope this work can serve as the
foundation for meaningful and reproducible language modelling research.

<p class="mathjax">Knitting patterns are a crucial component in the creation and design of
knitted materials. Traditionally, these patterns were taught informally, but
thanks to advancements in technology, anyone interested in knitting can use the
patterns as a guide to start knitting. Perhaps because knitting is mostly a
hobby, with the exception of industrial manufacturing utilising specialised
knitting machines, the use of Al in knitting is less widespread than its
application in other fields. However, it is important to determine whether
knitted pattern classification using an automated system is viable. In order to
recognise and classify knitting patterns. Using data augmentation and a
transfer learning technique, this study proposes a deep learning model. The
Inception ResNet-V2 is the main feature extraction and classification algorithm
used in the model. Metrics like accuracy, logarithmic loss, F1-score,
precision, and recall score were used to evaluate the model. The model
evaluation's findings demonstrate high model accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1 score. In addition, the AUC score for majority of the classes was in the
range (0.7-0.9). A comparative analysis was done using other pretrained models
and a ResNet-50 model with transfer learning and the proposed model evaluation
results surpassed all others. The major limitation for this project is time, as
with more time, there might have been better accuracy over a larger number of
epochs.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancement of Blockchain technology consolidates its status as a
viable alternative for various domains. However, evaluating the performance of
blockchain applications can be challenging due to the underlying
infrastructure's complexity and distributed nature. Therefore, a reliable
modelling approach is needed to boost Blockchain-based applications'
development and evaluation. While simulation-based solutions have been
researched, machine learning (ML) model-based techniques are rarely discussed
in conjunction with evaluating blockchain application performance. Our novel
research makes use of two ML model-based methods. Firstly, we train a $k$
nearest neighbour ($k$NN) and support vector machine (SVM) to predict
blockchain performance using predetermined configuration parameters. Secondly,
we employ the salp swarm optimization (SO) ML model which enables the
investigation of optimal blockchain configurations for achieving the required
performance level. We use rough set theory to enhance SO, hereafter called ISO,
which we demonstrate to prove achieving an accurate recommendation of optimal
parameter configurations; despite uncertainty. Finally, statistical comparisons
indicate that our models have a competitive edge. The $k$NN model outperforms
SVM by 5\% and the ISO also demonstrates a reduction of 4\% inaccuracy
deviation compared to regular SO.

<p class="mathjax">Despite their competitive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, large
language models (LLMs) still have limitations in memorizing all world knowledge
especially long tail knowledge. In this paper, we study the KG-augmented
language model approach for solving the knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA) task that requires rich world knowledge. Existing work has shown that
retrieving KG knowledge to enhance LLMs prompting can significantly improve
LLMs performance in KGQA. However, their approaches lack a well-formed
verbalization of KG knowledge, i.e., they ignore the gap between KG
representations and textual representations. To this end, we propose an
answer-sensitive KG-to-Text approach that can transform KG knowledge into
well-textualized statements most informative for KGQA. Based on this approach,
we propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task.
Experiments on several KGQA benchmarks show that the proposed KG-to-Text
augmented LLMs approach outperforms previous KG-augmented LLMs approaches
regarding answer accuracy and usefulness of knowledge statements.

<p class="mathjax">Automatically identifying bat species from their echolocation calls is a
difficult but important task for monitoring bats and the ecosystem they live
in. Major challenges in automatic bat call identification are high call
variability, similarities between species, interfering calls and lack of
annotated data. Many currently available models suffer from relatively poor
performance on real-life data due to being trained on single call datasets and,
moreover, are often too slow for real-time classification. Here, we propose a
Transformer architecture for multi-label classification with potential
applications in real-time classification scenarios. We train our model on
synthetically generated multi-species recordings by merging multiple bats calls
into a single recording with multiple simultaneous calls. Our approach achieves
a single species accuracy of 88.92% (F1-score of 84.23%) and a multi species
macro F1-score of 74.40% on our test set. In comparison to three other tools on
the independent and publicly available dataset ChiroVox, our model achieves at
least 25.82% better accuracy for single species classification and at least
6.9% better macro F1-score for multi species classification.

<p class="mathjax">Existing fully-supervised point cloud segmentation methods suffer in the
dynamic testing environment with emerging new classes. Few-shot point cloud
segmentation algorithms address this problem by learning to adapt to new
classes at the sacrifice of segmentation accuracy for the base classes, which
severely impedes its practicality. This largely motivates us to present the
first attempt at a more practical paradigm of generalized few-shot point cloud
segmentation, which requires the model to generalize to new categories with
only a few support point clouds and simultaneously retain the capability to
segment base classes. We propose the geometric words to represent geometric
components shared between the base and novel classes, and incorporate them into
a novel geometric-aware semantic representation to facilitate better
generalization to the new classes without forgetting the old ones. Moreover, we
introduce geometric prototypes to guide the segmentation with geometric prior
knowledge. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet consistently illustrate
the superior performance of our method over baseline methods. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">The problem of predicting the training time of machine learning (ML) models
has become extremely relevant in the scientific community. Being able to
predict a priori the training time of an ML model would enable the automatic
selection of the best model both in terms of energy efficiency and in terms of
performance in the context of, for instance, MLOps architectures. In this
paper, we present the work we are conducting towards this direction. In
particular, we present an extensive empirical study of the Full Parameter Time
Complexity (FPTC) approach by Zheng et al., which is, to the best of our
knowledge, the only approach formalizing the training time of ML models as a
function of both dataset's and model's parameters. We study the formulations
proposed for the Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, and we
highlight the main strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Finally, we
observe how, from the conducted study, the prediction of training time is
strictly related to the context (i.e., the involved dataset) and how the FPTC
approach is not generalizable.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation aims to train a model to quickly
adapt to new unseen classes with only a handful of support set samples.
However, the noise-free assumption in the support set can be easily violated in
many practical real-world settings. In this paper, we focus on improving the
robustness of few-shot point cloud segmentation under the detrimental influence
of noisy support sets during testing time. To this end, we first propose a
Component-level Clean Noise Separation (CCNS) representation learning to learn
discriminative feature representations that separates the clean samples of the
target classes from the noisy samples. Leveraging the well separated clean and
noisy support samples from our CCNS, we further propose a Multi-scale
Degree-based Noise Suppression (MDNS) scheme to remove the noisy shots from the
support set. We conduct extensive experiments on various noise settings on two
benchmark datasets. Our results show that the combination of CCNS and MDNS
significantly improves the performance. Our code is available at

is an important problem in cryptography, coding theory, and computational
complexity. We prove lower bounds on the second-order, third-order, and
higher-order nonlinearities of some trace monomial Boolean functions.
<br />We prove lower bounds on the second-order nonlinearities of functions
$\mathrm{tr}_n(x^7)$ and $\mathrm{tr}_n(x^{2^r+3})$ where $n=2r$. Among all
trace monomials, our bounds match the best second-order nonlinearity lower
bounds by \cite{Car08} and \cite{YT20} for odd and even $n$ respectively. We
prove a lower bound on the third-order nonlinearity for functions
$\mathrm{tr}_n(x^{15})$, which is the best third-order nonlinearity lower
bound. For any $r$, we prove that the $r$-th order nonlinearity of
$\mathrm{tr}_n(x^{2^{r+1}-1})$ is at least
$2^{n-1}-2^{(1-2^{-r})n+\frac{r}{2^{r-1}}-1}- O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$. For $r \ll

<p class="mathjax">This study evaluates the potential of ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence
language model developed by OpenAI, as an editing tool for Spanish literary and
academic books. The need for efficient and accessible reviewing and editing
processes in the publishing industry has driven the search for automated
solutions. ChatGPT-4, being one of the most advanced language models, offers
notable capabilities in text comprehension and generation. In this study, the
features and capabilities of ChatGPT-4 are analyzed in terms of grammatical
correction, stylistic coherence, and linguistic enrichment of texts in Spanish.
Tests were conducted with 100 literary and academic texts, where the edits made
by ChatGPT-4 were compared to those made by expert human reviewers and editors.
The results show that while ChatGPT-4 is capable of making grammatical and
orthographic corrections with high accuracy and in a very short time, it still
faces challenges in areas such as context sensitivity, bibliometric analysis,
deep contextual understanding, and interaction with visual content like graphs
and tables. However, it is observed that collaboration between ChatGPT-4 and
human reviewers and editors can be a promising strategy for improving
efficiency without compromising quality. Furthermore, the authors consider that
ChatGPT-4 represents a valuable tool in the editing process, but its use should
be complementary to the work of human editors to ensure high-caliber editing in
Spanish literary and academic books.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, open-source large language models like LLaMA have emerged. Recent
developments have incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to align these models with human goals. However,
SFT methods treat all training data with mixed quality equally, while RLFT
methods require high-quality pairwise or ranking-based preference data. In this
study, we present a novel framework, named OpenChat, to advance open-source
language models with mixed-quality data. Specifically, we consider the general
SFT training data, consisting of a small amount of expert data mixed with a
large proportion of sub-optimal data, without any preference labels. We propose
the C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained
reward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary
data quality information. Interestingly, the optimal policy in C-RLFT can be
easily solved through single-stage, RL-free supervised learning, which is
lightweight and avoids costly human preference labeling. Through extensive
experiments on three standard benchmarks, our openchat-13b fine-tuned with
C-RLFT achieves the highest average performance among all 13b open-source
language models. Moreover, we use AGIEval to validate the model generalization
performance, in which only openchat-13b surpasses the base model. Finally, we
conduct a series of analyses to shed light on the effectiveness and robustness
of OpenChat. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in a probabilistic model
to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes. To
apply lifted inference, a lifted representation has to be obtained, and to do
so, the so-called colour passing algorithm is the state of the art. The colour
passing algorithm, however, is bound to a specific inference algorithm and we
found that it ignores commutativity of factors while constructing a lifted
representation. We contribute a modified version of the colour passing
algorithm that uses logical variables to construct a lifted representation
independent of a specific inference algorithm while at the same time exploiting
commutativity of factors during an offline-step. Our proposed algorithm
efficiently detects more symmetries than the state of the art and thereby
drastically increases compression, yielding significantly faster online query
times for probabilistic inference when the resulting model is applied.

non-parametric representations based on the image of a Hankel matrix of
previously collected, persistently exciting, input-output data. Persistence of
excitation necessitates that the data is sufficiently long and, hence, the
computational complexity of the corresponding finite-horizon optimal control
problem increases. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-driven

and SE data needed to analyse gender bias in Italian academic promotions.
Subsequently, we apply a formal bias metric to these data to assess the amount
of bias and look at its variation over time. From the conducted analysis, we
observe how the SE community presents a higher bias in promotions to Associate
Professors and a smaller bias in promotions to Full Professors compared to the
overall INF community.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel layered framework that integrates visual
foundation models to improve robot manipulation tasks and motion planning. The
framework consists of five layers: Perception, Cognition, Planning, Execution,
and Learning. Using visual foundation models, we enhance the robot's perception
of its environment, enabling more efficient task understanding and accurate
motion planning. This approach allows for real-time adjustments and continual
learning, leading to significant improvements in task execution. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in various
robot manipulation tasks and motion planning scenarios, highlighting its
potential for practical deployment in dynamic environments.

<p class="mathjax">Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is increasingly being used
to design efficient deep learning architectures. An efficient and flexible
search space is crucial to the success of HW-NAS. Current approaches focus on
designing a macro-architecture and searching for the architecture's
hyperparameters based on a set of possible values. This approach is biased by
the expertise of deep learning (DL) engineers and standard modeling approaches.
In this paper, we present a Grassroots Operator Search (GOS) methodology. Our
HW-NAS adapts a given model for edge devices by searching for efficient
operator replacement. We express each operator as a set of mathematical
instructions that capture its behavior. The mathematical instructions are then
used as the basis for searching and selecting efficient replacement operators
that maintain the accuracy of the original model while reducing computational
complexity. Our approach is grassroots since it relies on the mathematical
foundations to construct new and efficient operators for DL architectures. We
demonstrate on various DL models, that our method consistently outperforms the
original models on two edge devices, namely Redmi Note 7S and Raspberry Pi3,
with a minimum of 2.2x speedup while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally,
we showcase a use case of our GOS approach in pulse rate estimation on
wristband devices, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while
maintaining reduced computational complexity, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our approach in practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">The application of artificial intelligence to simulate air-to-air combat
scenarios is attracting increasing attention. To date the high-dimensional
state and action spaces, the high complexity of situation information (such as
imperfect and filtered information, stochasticity, incomplete knowledge about
mission targets) and the nonlinear flight dynamics pose significant challenges
for accurate air combat decision-making. These challenges are exacerbated when
multiple heterogeneous agents are involved. We propose a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for air-to-air combat with
multiple heterogeneous agents. In our framework, the decision-making process is
divided into two stages of abstraction, where heterogeneous low-level policies
control the action of individual units, and a high-level commander policy
issues macro commands given the overall mission targets. Low-level policies are
trained for accurate unit combat control. Their training is organized in a
learning curriculum with increasingly complex training scenarios and
league-based self-play. The commander policy is trained on mission targets
given pre-trained low-level policies. The empirical validation advocates the
advantages of our design choices.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Transformer-based text detection techniques have sought to predict
polygons by encoding the coordinates of individual boundary vertices using
distinct query features. However, this approach incurs a significant memory
overhead and struggles to effectively capture the intricate relationships
between vertices belonging to the same instance. Consequently, irregular text
layouts often lead to the prediction of outlined vertices, diminishing the
quality of results. To address these challenges, we present an innovative
approach rooted in Sparse R-CNN: a cascade decoding pipeline for polygon
prediction. Our method ensures precision by iteratively refining polygon
predictions, considering both the scale and location of preceding results.
Leveraging this stabilized regression pipeline, even employing just a single
feature vector to guide polygon instance regression yields promising detection
results. Simultaneously, the leverage of instance-level feature proposal
substantially enhances memory efficiency (&gt;50% less vs. the state-of-the-art
method DPText-DETR) and reduces inference speed (&gt;40% less vs. DPText-DETR)
with minor performance drop on benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Many protocols in distributed computing rely on a source of randomness,
usually called a random beacon, both for their applicability and security. This
is especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the next
miner or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihood
to be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.
<br />Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroboros
and Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely on
pseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform,
which is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate their
randomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants are
required to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of a
final random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that the
numbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentive
for the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beacons
have both limitations.
<br />In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation of
randomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar to
some of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by different
participants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial difference
is that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone's
best interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is the
first to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, the
approach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers. It is also
tamper-proof and no party can change the output or affect its distribution.
Finally, it is designed with modularity in mind and can be easily plugged into
existing distributed protocols such as proof-of-stake blockchains.

semantic differences which also elicit different visual scenarios. In this
paper, we ask whether Vision and Language (V\&amp;L) models capture such

We compare the results from V\&amp;L models to human judgements and find that
models' predictions differ from those of human participants, in particular
displaying a grammatical bias. We further investigate whether the human-model
misalignment is related to model architecture. Our methodology, developed on

web site visitor and aggregate the interaction to reveal the interests and
problems of the visitors. However, previous research identified such techniques
as privacy intrusive. This position paper updates the information on data
collection by Hotjar. It revisits the previous findings to detect and describe
the changes. The default policy to gather inputs changed; the recording script
gathers only information from explicitly allowed input elements. Nevertheless,
Hotjar does record content reflecting users' behaviour outside input HTML
elements. Even though we propose changes that would prevent the leakage of the
reflected content, we argue that such changes will most likely not appear in
practice. The paper discusses improvements in handling TLS. Not only do web
page operators interact with Hotjar through encrypted connections, but Hotjar
scripts do not work on sites not protected by TLS. Hotjar respects the Do Not
Track signal; however, users need to connect to Hotjar even in the presence of
the Do Not Track setting. Worse, malicious web operators can trick Hotjar into
recording sessions of users with the active Do Not Track setting. Finally, we
propose and motivate the extension of GDPR Art. 25 obligations to processors.

<p class="mathjax">Coarse architectural models are often generated at scales ranging from
individual buildings to scenes for downstream applications such as Digital Twin
City, Metaverse, LODs, etc. Such piece-wise planar models can be abstracted as
twins from 3D dense reconstructions. However, these models typically lack
realistic texture relative to the real building or scene, making them
unsuitable for vivid display or direct reference. In this paper, we present
TwinTex, the first automatic texture mapping framework to generate a
photo-realistic texture for a piece-wise planar proxy. Our method addresses
most challenges occurring in such twin texture generation. Specifically, for
each primitive plane, we first select a small set of photos with greedy
heuristics considering photometric quality, perspective quality and facade
texture completeness. Then, different levels of line features (LoLs) are
extracted from the set of selected photos to generate guidance for later steps.
With LoLs, we employ optimization algorithms to align texture with geometry
from local to global. Finally, we fine-tune a diffusion model with a multi-mask
initialization component and a new dataset to inpaint the missing region.
Experimental results on many buildings, indoor scenes and man-made objects of
varying complexity demonstrate the generalization ability of our algorithm. Our
approach surpasses state-of-the-art texture mapping methods in terms of
high-fidelity quality and reaches a human-expert production level with much
less effort. Project page: https://vcc.tech/research/2023/TwinTex.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, substantial advancements in pre-trained language models have
paved the way for the development of numerous non-English language versions,
with a particular focus on encoder-only and decoder-only architectures. While
Spanish language models encompassing BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT have exhibited
prowess in natural language understanding and generation, there remains a
scarcity of encoder-decoder models designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks
involving input-output pairs. This paper breaks new ground by introducing the
implementation and evaluation of renowned encoder-decoder architectures,
exclusively pre-trained on Spanish corpora. Specifically, we present Spanish
versions of BART, T5, and BERT2BERT-style models and subject them to a
comprehensive assessment across a diverse range of sequence-to-sequence tasks,
spanning summarization, rephrasing, and generative question answering. Our
findings underscore the competitive performance of all models, with BART and T5
emerging as top performers across all evaluated tasks. As an additional
contribution, we have made all models publicly available to the research
community, fostering future exploration and development in Spanish language
processing.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring surface cracks in infrastructure is crucial for structural health
monitoring. Automatic visual inspection offers an effective solution,
especially in hard-to-reach areas. Machine learning approaches have proven
their effectiveness but typically require large annotated datasets for
supervised training. Once a crack is detected, monitoring its severity often
demands precise segmentation of the damage. However, pixel-level annotation of
images for segmentation is labor-intensive. To mitigate this cost, one can
leverage explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to derive segmentations from
the explanations of a classifier, requiring only weak image-level supervision.
This paper proposes applying this methodology to segment and monitor surface
cracks. We evaluate the performance of various XAI methods and examine how this
approach facilitates severity quantification and growth monitoring. Results
reveal that while the resulting segmentation masks may exhibit lower quality
than those produced by supervised methods, they remain meaningful and enable
severity monitoring, thus reducing substantial labeling costs.

<p class="mathjax">Charts are common in literature across different scientific fields, conveying
rich information easily accessible to readers. Current chart-related tasks
focus on either chart perception which refers to extracting information from
the visual charts, or performing reasoning given the extracted data, e.g. in a
tabular form. In this paper, we aim to establish a unified and label-efficient
learning paradigm for joint perception and reasoning tasks, which can be
generally applicable to different downstream tasks, beyond the
question-answering task as specifically studied in peer works. Specifically,
StructChart first reformulates the chart information from the popular tubular
form (specifically linearized CSV) to the proposed Structured Triplet
Representations (STR), which is more friendly for reducing the task gap between
chart perception and reasoning due to the employed structured information
extraction for charts. We then propose a Structuring Chart-oriented
Representation Metric (SCRM) to quantitatively evaluate the performance for the
chart perception task. To enrich the dataset for training, we further explore
the possibility of leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing the
chart diversity in terms of both chart visual style and its statistical
information. Extensive experiments are conducted on various chart-related
tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and promising potential for a unified
chart perception-reasoning paradigm to push the frontier of chart
understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Following complex instructions in conversational assistants can be quite
daunting due to the shorter attention and memory spans when compared to reading
the same instructions. Hence, when conversational assistants walk users through
the steps of complex tasks, there is a need to structure the task into
manageable pieces of information of the right length and complexity. In this
paper, we tackle the recipes domain and convert reading structured instructions
into conversational structured ones. We annotated the structure of instructions
according to a conversational scenario, which provided insights into what is
expected in this setting. To computationally model the conversational step's
characteristics, we tested various Transformer-based architectures, showing
that a token-based approach delivers the best results. A further user study
showed that users tend to favor steps of manageable complexity and length, and
that the proposed methodology can improve the original web-based instructional
text. Specifically, 86% of the evaluated tasks were improved from a
conversational suitability point of view.

<p class="mathjax">Ordinary state-based peridynamic (OSB-PD) models have an unparalleled
capability to simulate crack propagation phenomena in solids with arbitrary
Poisson's ratio. However, their non-locality also leads to prohibitively high
computational cost. In this paper, a fast solution scheme for OSB-PD models
based on matrix operation is introduced, with which, the graphics processing
units (GPUs) are used to accelerate the computation. For the purpose of
comparison and verification, a commonly used solution scheme based on loop
operation is also presented. An in-house software is developed in MATLAB.
Firstly, the vibration of a cantilever beam is solved for validating the loop-
and matrix-based schemes by comparing the numerical solutions to those produced
by a FEM software. Subsequently, two typical dynamic crack propagation problems
are simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in
solving dynamic fracture problems. Finally, the simulation of the Brokenshire
torsion experiment is carried out by using the matrix-based scheme, and the
similarity in the shapes of the experimental and numerical broken specimens
further demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to deal with 3D
non-planar fracture problems. In addition, the speed-up of the matrix-based
scheme with respect to the loop-based scheme and the performance of the GPU
acceleration are investigated. The results emphasize the high computational
efficiency of the matrix-based implementation scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Creating resilient machine learning (ML) systems has become necessary to
ensure production-ready ML systems that acquire user confidence seamlessly. The
quality of the input data and the model highly influence the successful
end-to-end testing in data-sensitive systems. However, the testing approaches
of input data are not as systematic and are few compared to model testing. To
address this gap, this paper presents the Fault Injection for Undesirable
Learning in input Data (FIUL-Data) testing framework that tests the resilience
of ML models to multiple intentionally-triggered data faults. Data mutators
explore vulnerabilities of ML systems against the effects of different fault
injections. The proposed framework is designed based on three main ideas: The
mutators are not random; one data mutator is applied at an instance of time,
and the selected ML models are optimized beforehand. This paper evaluates the
FIUL-Data framework using data from analytical chemistry, comprising retention
time measurements of anti-sense oligonucleotide. Empirical evaluation is
carried out in a two-step process in which the responses of selected ML models
to data mutation are analyzed individually and then compared with each other.
The results show that the FIUL-Data framework allows the evaluation of the
resilience of ML models. In most experiments cases, ML models show higher
resilience at larger training datasets, where gradient boost performed better
than support vector regression in smaller training sets. Overall, the mean
squared error metric is useful in evaluating the resilience of models due to
its higher sensitivity to data mutation.

of Open-Ended Evolution (OEE). We utilize modular robots of fixed morphologies
whose controllers are subject to evolution. In both species, robots can send
and receive signals and perceive the relative positions of other robots in the
environment. Specifically, we introduce a feature we call a tagging system: it
modifies how individuals can perceive each other and is expected to increase
behavioral complexity. Our results show the emergence of adaptive strategies,
demonstrating the viability of inducing OEE through predator-prey dynamics

<p class="mathjax">The state-of-the-art neural video codecs have outperformed the most
sophisticated traditional codecs in terms of RD performance in certain cases.
However, utilizing them for practical applications is still challenging for two
major reasons. 1) Cross-platform computational errors resulting from floating
point operations can lead to inaccurate decoding of the bitstream. 2) The high
computational complexity of the encoding and decoding process poses a challenge
in achieving real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time
cross-platform neural video codec, which is capable of efficiently decoding of
720P video bitstream from other encoding platforms on a consumer-grade GPU.
First, to solve the problem of inconsistency of codec caused by the uncertainty
of floating point calculations across platforms, we design a calibration
transmitting system to guarantee the consistent quantization of entropy
parameters between the encoding and decoding stages. The parameters that may
have transboundary quantization between encoding and decoding are identified in
the encoding stage, and their coordinates will be delivered by auxiliary
transmitted bitstream. By doing so, these inconsistent parameters can be
processed properly in the decoding stage. Furthermore, to reduce the bitrate of
the auxiliary bitstream, we rectify the distribution of entropy parameters
using a piecewise Gaussian constraint. Second, to match the computational
limitations on the decoding side for real-time video codec, we design a
lightweight model. A series of efficiency techniques enable our model to
achieve 25 FPS decoding speed on NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model can achieve real-time decoding of 720P videos while
encoding on another platform. Furthermore, the real-time model brings up to a
maximum of 24.2\% BD-rate improvement from the perspective of PSNR with the
anchor H.265.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores a fine-grained version of the Watrous conjecture,
including the randomized and quantum algorithms with success probabilities
arbitrarily close to $1/2$. Our contributions include the following:
<br />i) An analysis of the optimal success probability of quantum and randomized
query algorithms of two fundamental partial symmetric Boolean functions given a
fixed number of queries. We prove that for any quantum algorithm computing
these two functions using $T$ queries, there exist randomized algorithms using
$\mathsf{poly}(T)$ queries that achieve the same success probability as the
quantum algorithm, even if the success probability is arbitrarily close to 1/2.
<br />ii) We establish that for any total symmetric Boolean function $f$, if a
quantum algorithm uses $T$ queries to compute $f$ with success probability
$1/2+\beta$, then there exists a randomized algorithm using $O(T^2)$ queries to
compute $f$ with success probability $1/2+\Omega(\delta\beta^2)$ on a
$1-\delta$ fraction of inputs, where $\beta,\delta$ can be arbitrarily small
positive values. As a corollary, we prove a randomized version of
Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture for total symmetric Boolean functions in the
regime where the success probability of algorithms can be arbitrarily close to
1/2.
<br />iii) We present polynomial equivalences for several fundamental complexity
measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions. Specifically, we first prove
that for certain partial symmetric Boolean functions, quantum query complexity
is at most quadratic in approximate degree for any error arbitrarily close to
1/2. Next, we show exact quantum query complexity is at most quadratic in
degree. Additionally, we give the tight bounds of several complexity measures,
indicating their polynomial equivalence.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance field is an emerging rendering method that generates
high-quality multi-view consistent images from a neural scene representation
and volume rendering. Although neural radiance field-based techniques are
robust for scene reconstruction, their ability to add or remove objects remains
limited. This paper proposes a new language-driven approach for object
manipulation with neural radiance fields through dataset updates. Specifically,
to insert a new foreground object represented by a set of multi-view images
into a background radiance field, we use a text-to-image diffusion model to
learn and generate combined images that fuse the object of interest into the
given background across views. These combined images are then used for refining
the background radiance field so that we can render view-consistent images
containing both the object and the background. To ensure view consistency, we
propose a dataset updates strategy that prioritizes radiance field training
with camera views close to the already-trained views prior to propagating the
training to remaining views. We show that under the same dataset updates
strategy, we can easily adapt our method for object insertion using data from
text-to-3D models as well as object removal. Experimental results show that our
method generates photorealistic images of the edited scenes, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction and neural radiance field
blending.

<p class="mathjax">With the acceleration of urbanization, traffic forecasting has become an
essential role in smart city construction. In the context of spatio-temporal
prediction, the key lies in how to model the dependencies of sensors. However,
existing works basically only consider the micro relationships between sensors,
where the sensors are treated equally, and their macroscopic dependencies are
neglected. In this paper, we argue to rethink the sensor's dependency modeling
from two hierarchies: regional and global perspectives. Particularly, we merge
original sensors with high intra-region correlation as a region node to
preserve the inter-region dependency. Then, we generate representative and
common spatio-temporal patterns as global nodes to reflect a global dependency
between sensors and provide auxiliary information for spatio-temporal
dependency learning. In pursuit of the generality and reality of node
representations, we incorporate a Meta GCN to calibrate the regional and global
nodes in the physical data space. Furthermore, we devise the cross-hierarchy
graph convolution to propagate information from different hierarchies. In a
nutshell, we propose a Hierarchical Information Enhanced Spatio-Temporal
prediction method, HIEST, to create and utilize the regional dependency and
common spatio-temporal patterns. Extensive experiments have verified the
leading performance of our HIEST against state-of-the-art baselines. We
publicize the code to ease reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the overview of the AuTexTification shared task as part
of the IberLEF 2023 Workshop in Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum, within the
framework of the SEPLN 2023 conference. AuTexTification consists of two
subtasks: for Subtask 1, participants had to determine whether a text is
human-authored or has been generated by a large language model. For Subtask 2,
participants had to attribute a machine-generated text to one of six different
text generation models. Our AuTexTification 2023 dataset contains more than
160.000 texts across two languages (English and Spanish) and five domains
(tweets, reviews, news, legal, and how-to articles). A total of 114 teams
signed up to participate, of which 36 sent 175 runs, and 20 of them sent their
working notes. In this overview, we present the AuTexTification dataset and
task, the submitted participating systems, and the results.

related revolution in the way we travel, commute and navigate within cities. As
a major effort of this transformation relies on Mobility Data Spaces for the
exchange of mobility data, the necessity to protect valuable data and formulate
conditions for data exchange arises. This paper presents key contributions to
the development of automated contract negotiation and data usage policies in
the Mobility Data Space. A comprehensive listing of policy patterns for usage
control is provided, addressing common requirements and scenarios in data
sharing and governance. The use of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is
proposed to formalize the collected policies, along with an extension of the
ODRL vocabulary for data space-specific properties.

<p class="mathjax">Effective representation of data is crucial in various machine learning
tasks, as it captures the underlying structure and context of the data.
Embeddings have emerged as a powerful technique for data representation, but
evaluating their quality and capacity to preserve structural and contextual
information remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this need by
proposing a method to measure the \textit{representation capacity} of
embeddings. The motivation behind this work stems from the importance of
understanding the strengths and limitations of embeddings, enabling researchers
and practitioners to make informed decisions in selecting appropriate embedding
models for their specific applications. By combining extrinsic evaluation
methods, such as classification and clustering, with t-SNE-based neighborhood
analysis, such as neighborhood agreement and trustworthiness, we provide a
comprehensive assessment of the representation capacity. Additionally, the use
of optimization techniques (bayesian optimization) for weight optimization (for
classification, clustering, neighborhood agreement, and trustworthiness)
ensures an objective and data-driven approach in selecting the optimal
combination of metrics. The proposed method not only contributes to advancing
the field of embedding evaluation but also empowers researchers and
practitioners with a quantitative measure to assess the effectiveness of
embeddings in capturing structural and contextual information. For the
evaluation, we use $3$ real-world biological sequence (proteins and nucleotide)
datasets and performed representation capacity analysis of $4$ embedding
methods from the literature, namely Spike2Vec, Spaced $k$-mers, PWM2Vec, and
AutoEncoder.

<p class="mathjax">Data-flow analysis is a general technique used to compute information of
interest at different points of a program and is considered to be a cornerstone
of static analysis. In this thesis, we consider interprocedural data-flow
analysis as formalized by the standard IFDS framework, which can express many
widely-used static analyses such as reaching definitions, live variables, and
null-pointer. We focus on the well-studied on-demand setting in which queries
arrive one-by-one in a stream and each query should be answered as fast as
possible. While the classical IFDS algorithm provides a polynomial-time
solution to this problem, it is not scalable in practice. Specifically, it
either requires a quadratic-time preprocessing phase or takes linear time per
query, both of which are untenable for modern huge codebases with hundreds of
thousands of lines. Previous works have already shown that parameterizing the
problem by the treewidth of the program's control-flow graph is promising and
can lead to significant gains in efficiency. Unfortunately, these results were
only applicable to the limited special case of same-context queries.
<br />In this work, we obtain significant speedups for the general case of
on-demand IFDS with queries that are not necessarily same-context. This is
achieved by exploiting a new graph sparsity parameter, namely the treedepth of
the program's call graph. Our approach is the first to exploit the sparsity of
control-flow graphs and call graphs at the same time and parameterize by both
treewidth and treedepth. We obtain an algorithm with a linear preprocessing
phase that can answer each query in constant time with respect to the input
size. Finally, we show experimental results demonstrating that our approach
significantly outperforms the classical IFDS and its on-demand variant.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the recent wide use of computational resources in cloud computing, new
resource provisioning challenges have been emerged. Resource provisioning
techniques must keep total costs to a minimum while meeting the requirements of
the requests. According to widely usage of cloud services, it seems more
challenging to develop effective schemes for provisioning services
cost-effectively; we have proposed a novel learning based resource provisioning
approach that achieves cost-reduction guarantees of demands. The contributions
of our optimized resource provisioning (ORP) approach are as follows. Firstly,
it is designed to provide a cost-effective method to efficiently handle the
provisioning of requested applications; while most of the existing models allow
only workflows in general which cares about the dependencies of the tasks, ORP
performs based on services of which applications comprised and cares about
their efficient provisioning totally. Secondly, it is a learning automata-based
approach which selects the most proper resources for hosting each service of
the demanded application; our approach considers both cost and service
requirements together for deploying applications. Thirdly, a comprehensive
evaluation is performed for three typical workloads: data-intensive,
process-intensive and normal applications. The experimental results show that
our method adapts most of the requirements efficiently, and furthermore the
resulting performance meets our design goals.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification allows a
model to adeptly classify retinal images from previously unseen domains with
various imaging conditions and patient demographics, thereby enhancing its
applicability in a wide range of clinical environments. In this study, we
explore the inherent capacity of variational autoencoders to disentangle the
latent space of fundus images, with an aim to obtain a more robust and
adaptable domain-invariant representation that effectively tackles the domain
shift encountered in DR datasets. Despite the simplicity of our approach, we
explore the efficacy of this classical method and demonstrate its ability to
outperform contemporary state-of-the-art approaches for this task using
publicly available datasets. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption
that highly sophisticated methods for DR classification are inherently superior
for domain generalization. This highlights the importance of considering simple
methods and adapting them to the challenging task of generalizing medical
images, rather than solely relying on advanced techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in the field of
continual learning, where neural networks struggle to retain prior knowledge
while assimilating new information. Most existing studies emphasize mitigating
this issue only when encountering new tasks, overlooking the significance of
the pre-task phase. Therefore, we shift the attention to the current task
learning stage, presenting a novel framework, C&amp;F (Create and Find Flatness),
which builds a flat training space for each task in advance. Specifically,
during the learning of the current task, our framework adaptively creates a
flat region around the minimum in the loss landscape. Subsequently, it finds
the parameters' importance to the current task based on their flatness degrees.
When adapting the model to a new task, constraints are applied according to the
flatness and a flat space is simultaneously prepared for the impending task. We
theoretically demonstrate the consistency between the created and found
flatness. In this manner, our framework not only accommodates ample parameter
space for learning new tasks but also preserves the preceding knowledge of
earlier tasks. Experimental results exhibit C&amp;F's state-of-the-art performance
as a standalone continual learning approach and its efficacy as a framework
incorporating other methods. Our work is available at

<p class="mathjax">Speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been a challenging task both
in industry and research. Recent methods mostly focus on deterministic deep
learning methods meaning that given a speech input, the output is always the
same. However, in reality, the non-verbal facial cues that reside throughout
the face are non-deterministic in nature. In addition, majority of the
approaches focus on 3D vertex based datasets and methods that are compatible
with existing facial animation pipelines with rigged characters is scarce. To
eliminate these issues, we present FaceDiffuser, a non-deterministic deep
learning model to generate speech-driven facial animations that is trained with
both 3D vertex and blendshape based datasets. Our method is based on the
diffusion technique and uses the pre-trained large speech representation model
HuBERT to encode the audio input. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to employ the diffusion method for the task of speech-driven 3D facial
animation synthesis. We have run extensive objective and subjective analyses
and show that our approach achieves better or comparable results in comparison
to the state-of-the-art methods. We also introduce a new in-house dataset that
is based on a blendshape based rigged character. We recommend watching the
accompanying supplementary video. The code and the dataset will be publicly

<p class="mathjax">Every day we face numerous lifestyle decisions, some dictated by habits and
some more conscious, which may or may not promote sustainable living. Aided by
digital technology, sustainable behaviors can diffuse within social groups and
inclusive communities. This paper outlines a longitudinal experimental study of
social influence in behavioral changes toward sustainability, in the context of
smart residential homes. Participants are residing in the housing on campus
referred to as KTH Live-In Lab, whose behaviors are observed w.r.t. key
lifestyle choices, such as food, resources, mobility, consumption, and
environmental citizenship. The focus is on the preparatory phase of the case
study and the challenges and limitations encountered during its setup. In
particular, this work proposes a definition of sustainability indicators for
environmentally significant behaviors, and hypothesizes that, through
digitalization of a household into a social network of interacting tenants,
sustainable living can be promoted. Preliminary results confirm the feasibility
of the proposed experimental methodology.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud computing as a fairly new commercial paradigm, widely investigated by
different researchers, already has a great range of challenges. Pricing is a
major problem in Cloud computing marketplace; as providers are competing to
attract more customers without knowing the pricing policies of each other. To
overcome this lack of knowledge, we model their competition by an
incomplete-information game. Considering the issue, this work proposes a
pricing policy related to the regret minimization algorithm and applies it to
the considered incomplete-information game. Based on the competition based
marketplace of the Cloud, providers update the distribution of their strategies
using the experienced regret. The idea of iteratively applying the algorithm
for updating probabilities of strategies causes the regret get minimized
faster. The experimental results show much more increase in profits of the
providers in comparison with other pricing policies. Besides, the efficiency of
a variety of regret minimization techniques in a simulated marketplace of Cloud
are discussed which have not been observed in the studied literature. Moreover,
return on investment of providers in considered organizations is studied and
promising results appeared.

<p class="mathjax">The competitive nature of Cloud marketplaces as new concerns in delivery of
services makes the pricing policies a crucial task for firms. so that, pricing
strategies has recently attracted many researchers. Since game theory can
handle such competing well this concern is addressed by designing a normal form
game between providers in current research. A committee is considered in which
providers register for improving their competition based pricing policies. The
functionality of game theory is applied to design dynamic pricing policies. The
usage of the committee makes the game a complete information one, in which each
player is aware of every others payoff functions. The players enhance their
pricing policies to maximize their profits. The contribution of this paper is
the quantitative modeling of Cloud marketplaces in form of a game to provide
novel dynamic pricing strategies; the model is validated by proving the
existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium of the game.

<p class="mathjax">Smart contracts are programs that are executed on the blockchain and can
hold, manage and transfer assets in the form of cryptocurrencies. The
contract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus,
i.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls and
keep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such as
Ethereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by malicious
parties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavy
computations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of a
function call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps prevent
DoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022,
on Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3
Billion USD. This thesis proposes "lazy contracts" as a solution to alleviate
these costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuring
that each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, while
preserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about the
state of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chain
execution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to the
contract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can only
happen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol can
identify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for the
entire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly.
Finally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Solidity
contracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January
2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by
55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees.

<p class="mathjax">Model initialization techniques are vital for improving the performance and
reliability of deep learning models in medical computer vision applications.
While much literature exists on non-medical images, the impacts on medical
images, particularly chest X-rays (CXRs) are less understood. Addressing this
gap, our study explores three deep model initialization techniques: Cold-start,
Warm-start, and Shrink and Perturb start, focusing on adult and pediatric
populations. We specifically focus on scenarios with periodically arriving data
for training, thereby embracing the real-world scenarios of ongoing data influx
and the need for model updates. We evaluate these models for generalizability
against external adult and pediatric CXR datasets. We also propose novel
ensemble methods: F-score-weighted Sequential Least-Squares Quadratic
Programming (F-SLSQP) and Attention-Guided Ensembles with Learnable Fuzzy
Softmax to aggregate weight parameters from multiple models to capitalize on
their collective knowledge and complementary representations. We perform
statistical significance tests with 95% confidence intervals and p-values to
analyze model performance. Our evaluations indicate models initialized with
ImageNet-pre-trained weights demonstrate superior generalizability over
randomly initialized counterparts, contradicting some findings for non-medical
images. Notably, ImageNet-pretrained models exhibit consistent performance
during internal and external testing across different training scenarios.
Weight-level ensembles of these models show significantly higher recall
(p&lt;0.05) during testing compared to individual models. Thus, our study
accentuates the benefits of ImageNet-pretrained weight initialization,
especially when used with weight-level ensembles, for creating robust and
generalizable deep learning solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Recent CNN and Transformer-based models tried to utilize frequency and
periodicity information for long-term time series forecasting. However, most
existing work is based on Fourier transform, which cannot capture fine-grained
and local frequency structure. In this paper, we propose a Wavelet-Fourier
Transform Network (WFTNet) for long-term time series forecasting. WFTNet
utilizes both Fourier and wavelet transforms to extract comprehensive
temporal-frequency information from the signal, where Fourier transform
captures the global periodic patterns and wavelet transform captures the local
ones. Furthermore, we introduce a Periodicity-Weighted Coefficient (PWC) to
adaptively balance the importance of global and local frequency patterns.
Extensive experiments on various time series datasets show that WFTNet
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the problem of face aging: generating past or
future facial images by incorporating age-related changes to the given face.
Previous aging methods rely solely on human facial image datasets and are thus
constrained by their inherent scale and bias. This restricts their application
to a limited generatable age range and the inability to handle large age gaps.
We propose FADING, a novel approach to address Face Aging via DIffusion-based
editiNG. We go beyond existing methods by leveraging the rich prior of
large-scale language-image diffusion models. First, we specialize a pre-trained
diffusion model for the task of face age editing by using an age-aware
fine-tuning scheme. Next, we invert the input image to latent noise and obtain
optimized null text embeddings. Finally, we perform text-guided local age
editing via attention control. The quantitative and qualitative analyses
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches with respect to
aging accuracy, attribute preservation, and aging quality.

<p class="mathjax">Camera calibration is a first and fundamental step in various computer vision
applications. Despite being an active field of research, Zhang's method remains
widely used for camera calibration due to its implementation in popular
toolboxes. However, this method initially assumes a pinhole model with
oversimplified distortion models. In this work, we propose a novel approach
that involves a pre-processing step to remove distortions from images by means
of Gaussian processes. Our method does not need to assume any distortion model
and can be applied to severely warped images, even in the case of multiple
distortion sources, e.g., a fisheye image of a curved mirror reflection. The
Gaussian processes capture all distortions and camera imperfections, resulting
in virtual images as though taken by an ideal pinhole camera with square
pixels. Furthermore, this ideal GP-camera only needs one image of a square grid
calibration pattern. This model allows for a serious upgrade of many algorithms
and applications that are designed in a pure projective geometry setting but
with a performance that is very sensitive to nonlinear lens distortions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simplifying Zhang's calibration
method, reducing the number of parameters and getting rid of the distortion
parameters and iterative optimization. We validate by means of synthetic data
and real world images. The contributions of this work include the construction
of a virtual ideal pinhole camera using Gaussian processes, a simplified
calibration method and lens distortion removal.

<p class="mathjax">In the past years, YOLO-series models have emerged as the leading approaches
in the area of real-time object detection. Many studies pushed up the baseline
to a higher level by modifying the architecture, augmenting data and designing
new losses. However, we find previous models still suffer from information
fusion problem, although Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation
Network (PANet) have alleviated this. Therefore, this study provides an
advanced Gatherand-Distribute mechanism (GD) mechanism, which is realized with
convolution and self-attention operations. This new designed model named as
Gold-YOLO, which boosts the multi-scale feature fusion capabilities and
achieves an ideal balance between latency and accuracy across all model scales.
Additionally, we implement MAE-style pretraining in the YOLO-series for the
first time, allowing YOLOseries models could be to benefit from unsupervised
pretraining. Gold-YOLO-N attains an outstanding 39.9% AP on the COCO val2017

<p class="mathjax">Compartmentalization is a form of defensive software design in which an
application is broken down into isolated but communicating components.
Retrofitting compartmentalization into existing applications is often thought
to be expensive from the engineering effort and performance overhead points of
view. Still, recent years have seen proposals of compartmentalization methods
with promises of low engineering efforts and reduced performance impact. ARM
Morello combines a modern ARM processor with an implementation of Capability
Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) aiming to provide efficient and
secure compartmentalization. Past works exploring CHERI-based
compartmentalization were restricted to emulated/FPGA prototypes.
<br />In this paper, we explore possible compartmentalization schemes with CHERI on
the Morello chip. We propose two approaches representing different trade-offs
in terms of engineering effort, security, scalability, and performance impact.
We describe and implement these approaches on a prototype OS running bare metal
on the Morello chip, compartmentalize two popular applications, and investigate
the performance overheads. Furthermore, we show that compartmentalization can
be achieved with an engineering cost that can be quite low if one is willing to
trade off on scalability and security, and that performance overheads are
similar to other intra-address space isolation mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">Ensembles of independently trained deep neural networks yield uncertainty
estimates that rival Bayesian networks in performance. They also offer sizable
improvements in terms of predictive performance over single models. However,
deep ensembles are not commonly used in environments with limited computational
budget -- such as autonomous driving -- since the complexity grows linearly
with the number of ensemble members. An important observation that can be made
for robotics applications, such as autonomous driving, is that data is
typically sequential. For instance, when an object is to be recognized, an
autonomous vehicle typically observes a sequence of images, rather than a
single image. This raises the question, could the deep ensemble be spread over
time?
<br />In this work, we propose and analyze Deep Ensembles Spread Over Time (DESOT).
The idea is to apply only a single ensemble member to each data point in the
sequence, and fuse the predictions over a sequence of data points. We implement
and experiment with DESOT for traffic sign classification, where sequences of
tracked image patches are to be classified. We find that DESOT obtains the
benefits of deep ensembles, in terms of predictive and uncertainty estimation
performance, while avoiding the added computational cost. Moreover, DESOT is
simple to implement and does not require sequences during training. Finally, we
find that DESOT, like deep ensembles, outperform single models for
out-of-distribution detection.

<p class="mathjax">Camera localization in 3D LiDAR maps has gained increasing attention due to
its promising ability to handle complex scenarios, surpassing the limitations
of visual-only localization methods. However, existing methods mostly focus on
addressing the cross-modal gaps, estimating camera poses frame by frame without
considering the relationship between adjacent frames, which makes the pose
tracking unstable. To alleviate this, we propose to couple the 2D-3D
correspondences between adjacent frames using the 2D-2D feature matching,
establishing the multi-view geometrical constraints for simultaneously
estimating multiple camera poses. Specifically, we propose a new 2D-3D pose
tracking framework, which consists: a front-end hybrid flow estimation network
for consecutive frames and a back-end pose optimization module. We further
design a cross-modal consistency-based loss to incorporate the multi-view
constraints during the training and inference process. We evaluate our proposed
framework on the KITTI and Argoverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
its superior performance compared to existing frame-by-frame 2D-3D pose
tracking methods and state-of-the-art vision-only pose tracking algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In an anonymous shared memory system, all inter-process communications are
via shared objects; however, unlike in standard systems, there is no a priori
agreement between processes on the names of shared objects [14,15].
Furthermore, the algorithms are required to be symmetric; that is, the
processes should execute precisely the same code, and the only way to
distinguish processes is by comparing identifiers for equality. For such a
system, read/write registers are called anonymous registers. It is known that
symmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion is solvable for any finite number of
processes using anonymous registers [1]. The main question left open in [14,15]
is the existence of starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithms for two or more
processes. We resolve this open question for memoryless algorithms, in which a
process that tries to enter its critical section does not use any information
about its previous attempts. Almost all known mutual exclusion algorithms are
memoryless. We show that (1) there is a symmetric memoryless starvation-free
mutual exclusion algorithm for two processes using $m \geq 7$ anonymous
registers if and only if $m$ is odd; and (2) there is no symmetric memoryless
starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithm for $n\geq 3$ processes using (any
number of) anonymous registers. Our impossibility result is the only example of
a system with fault-free processes, where global progress (i.e.,
deadlock-freedom) can be ensured, while individual progress to each process
(i.e., starvation-freedom) cannot. It complements a known result for systems
with failure-prone processes, that there are objects with lock-free
implementations but without wait-free implementations [2,5].

<p class="mathjax">In today's globalized world, effective communication with people from diverse
linguistic backgrounds has become increasingly crucial. While traditional
methods of language translation, such as written text or voice-only
translations, can accomplish the task, they often fail to capture the complete
context and nuanced information conveyed through nonverbal cues like facial
expressions and lip movements. In this paper, we present an end-to-end video
translation system that not only translates spoken language but also
synchronizes the translated speech with the lip movements of the speaker. Our
system focuses on translating educational lectures in various Indian languages,
and it is designed to be effective even in low-resource system settings. By
incorporating lip movements that align with the target language and matching
them with the speaker's voice using voice cloning techniques, our application
offers an enhanced experience for students and users. This additional feature
creates a more immersive and realistic learning environment, ultimately making
the learning process more effective and engaging.

<p class="mathjax">Classifying research output into context-specific label taxonomies is a
challenging and relevant downstream task, given the volume of existing and
newly published articles. We propose a method to enhance the performance of
article classification by enriching simple Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
pipelines with edge-heterogeneous graph representations. SciBERT is used for
node feature generation to capture higher-order semantics within the articles'
textual metadata. Fully supervised transductive node classification experiments
are conducted on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) ogbn-arxiv dataset and the
PubMed diabetes dataset, augmented with additional metadata from Microsoft
Academic Graph (MAG) and PubMed Central, respectively. The results demonstrate
that edge-heterogeneous graphs consistently improve the performance of all GNN
models compared to the edge-homogeneous graphs. The transformed data enable
simple and shallow GNN pipelines to achieve results on par with more complex
architectures. On ogbn-arxiv, we achieve a top-15 result in the OGB competition
with a 2-layer GCN (accuracy 74.61%), being the highest-scoring solution with
sub-1 million parameters. On PubMed, we closely trail SOTA GNN architectures
using a 2-layer GraphSAGE by including additional co-authorship edges in the
graph (accuracy 89.88%). The implementation is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Predictive algorithms are often trained by optimizing some loss function, to
which regularization functions are added to impose a penalty for violating
constraints. As expected, the addition of such regularization functions can
change the minimizer of the objective. It is not well-understood which
regularizers change the minimizer of the loss, and, when the minimizer does
change, how it changes. We use property elicitation to take first steps towards
understanding the joint relationship between the loss and regularization
functions and the optimal decision for a given problem instance. In particular,
we give a necessary and sufficient condition on loss and regularizer pairs for
when a property changes with the addition of the regularizer, and examine some
regularizers satisfying this condition standard in the fair machine learning
literature. We empirically demonstrate how algorithmic decision-making changes
as a function of both data distribution changes and hardness of the
constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Grammatical Error Detection and Correction (GEC) tools have proven useful for
native speakers and second language learners. Developing such tools requires a
large amount of parallel, annotated data, which is unavailable for most
languages. Synthetic data generation is a common practice to overcome the
scarcity of such data. However, it is not straightforward for morphologically
rich languages like Turkish due to complex writing rules that require
phonological, morphological, and syntactic information. In this work, we
present a flexible and extensible synthetic data generation pipeline for
Turkish covering more than 20 expert-curated grammar and spelling rules
(a.k.a., writing rules) implemented through complex transformation functions.
Using this pipeline, we derive 130,000 high-quality parallel sentences from
professionally edited articles. Additionally, we create a more realistic test
set by manually annotating a set of movie reviews. We implement three baselines
formulating the task as i) neural machine translation, ii) sequence tagging,
and iii) prefix tuning with a pretrained decoder-only model, achieving strong
results. Furthermore, we perform exhaustive experiments on out-of-domain
datasets to gain insights on the transferability and robustness of the proposed
approaches. Our results suggest that our corpus, GECTurk, is high-quality and
allows knowledge transfer for the out-of-domain setting. To encourage further
research on Turkish GEC, we release our datasets, baseline models, and the
synthetic data generation pipeline at https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/gecturk.

<p class="mathjax">This article unifies and generalizes fundamental results related to
$n$-process asynchronous crash-prone distributed computing. More precisely, it
proves that for every $0\leq k \leq n$, assuming that process failures occur
only before the number of participating processes bypasses a predefined
threshold that equals $n-k$ (a participating process is a process that has
executed at least one statement of its code), an asynchronous algorithm exists
that solves consensus for $n$ processes in the presence of $f$ crash failures
if and only if $f \leq k$. In a very simple and interesting way, the "extreme"
case $k=0$ boils down to the celebrated FLP impossibility result (1985, 1987).
Moreover, the second extreme case, namely $k=n$, captures the celebrated mutual
exclusion result by E.W. Dijkstra (1965) that states that mutual exclusion can
be solved for $n$ processes in an asynchronous read/write shared memory system
where any number of processes may crash (but only) before starting to
participate in the algorithm (that is, participation is not required, but once
a process starts participating it may not fail). More generally, the
possibility/impossibility stated above demonstrates that more failures can be
tolerated when they occur earlier in the computation (hence the title).

<p class="mathjax">We present C$\cdot$ASE, an efficient and effective framework that learns
conditional Adversarial Skill Embeddings for physics-based characters. Our
physically simulated character can learn a diverse repertoire of skills while
providing controllability in the form of direct manipulation of the skills to
be performed. C$\cdot$ASE divides the heterogeneous skill motions into distinct
subsets containing homogeneous samples for training a low-level conditional
model to learn conditional behavior distribution. The skill-conditioned
imitation learning naturally offers explicit control over the character's
skills after training. The training course incorporates the focal skill
sampling, skeletal residual forces, and element-wise feature masking to balance
diverse skills of varying complexities, mitigate dynamics mismatch to master
agile motions and capture more general behavior characteristics, respectively.
Once trained, the conditional model can produce highly diverse and realistic
skills, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and can be repurposed in various
downstream tasks. In particular, the explicit skill control handle allows a
high-level policy or user to direct the character with desired skill
specifications, which we demonstrate is advantageous for interactive character
animation.

<p class="mathjax">Cities around the world face a critical shortage of affordable and decent
housing. Despite its critical importance for policy, our ability to effectively
monitor and track progress in urban housing is limited. Deep learning-based
computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been successful in
the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but did not
fully utilize temporal images to track urban change as time-varying labels are
often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London
using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel
adaptation of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being
invariant to seasonal and daily changes without manual annotations. It
outperformed generic embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in
London's housing supply from street-level images, and distinguished between
major and minor change. This capability can provide timely information for
urban planning and policy decisions toward more liveable, equitable, and
sustainable cities.

<p class="mathjax">Rare event prediction involves identifying and forecasting events with a low
probability using machine learning and data analysis. Due to the imbalanced
data distributions, where the frequency of common events vastly outweighs that
of rare events, it requires using specialized methods within each step of the
machine learning pipeline, i.e., from data processing to algorithms to
evaluation protocols. Predicting the occurrences of rare events is important
for real-world applications, such as Industry 4.0, and is an active research
area in statistical and machine learning. This paper comprehensively reviews
the current approaches for rare event prediction along four dimensions: rare
event data, data processing, algorithmic approaches, and evaluation approaches.
Specifically, we consider 73 datasets from different modalities (i.e.,
numerical, image, text, and audio), four major categories of data processing,
five major algorithmic groupings, and two broader evaluation approaches. This
paper aims to identify gaps in the current literature and highlight the
challenges of predicting rare events. It also suggests potential research
directions, which can help guide practitioners and researchers.

<p class="mathjax">3D face reconstruction algorithms from images and videos are applied to many
fields, from plastic surgery to the entertainment sector, thanks to their
advantageous features. However, when looking at forensic applications, 3D face
reconstruction must observe strict requirements that still make its possible
role in bringing evidence to a lawsuit unclear. An extensive investigation of
the constraints, potential, and limits of its application in forensics is still
missing. Shedding some light on this matter is the goal of the present survey,
which starts by clarifying the relation between forensic applications and
biometrics, with a focus on face recognition. Therefore, it provides an
analysis of the achievements of 3D face reconstruction algorithms from
surveillance videos and mugshot images and discusses the current obstacles that
separate 3D face reconstruction from an active role in forensic applications.
Finally, it examines the underlying data sets, with their advantages and
limitations, while proposing alternatives that could substitute or complement
them.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, reinforcement learning and imitation learning have shown
great potential for controlling humanoid robots' motion. However, these methods
typically create simulation environments and rewards for specific tasks,
resulting in the requirements of multiple policies and limited capabilities for
tackling complex and unknown tasks. To overcome these issues, we present a
novel approach that combines adversarial imitation learning with large language
models (LLMs). This innovative method enables the agent to learn reusable
skills with a single policy and solve zero-shot tasks under the guidance of
LLMs. In particular, we utilize the LLM as a strategic planner for applying
previously learned skills to novel tasks through the comprehension of
task-specific prompts. This empowers the robot to perform the specified actions
in a sequence. To improve our model, we incorporate codebook-based vector
quantization, allowing the agent to generate suitable actions in response to
unseen textual commands from LLMs. Furthermore, we design general reward
functions that consider the distinct motion features of humanoid robots,
ensuring the agent imitates the motion data while maintaining goal orientation
without additional guiding direction approaches or policies. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first framework that controls humanoid robots using a
single learning policy network and LLM as a planner. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability in
complicated motion tasks.

<p class="mathjax">We present a comprehensive benchmark dataset for Knowledge Graph Question
Answering in Materials Science (KGQA4MAT), with a focus on metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs). A knowledge graph for metal-organic frameworks (MOF-KG) has
been constructed by integrating structured databases and knowledge extracted
from the literature. To enhance MOF-KG accessibility for domain experts, we aim
to develop a natural language interface for querying the knowledge graph. We
have developed a benchmark comprised of 161 complex questions involving
comparison, aggregation, and complicated graph structures. Each question is
rephrased in three additional variations, resulting in 644 questions and 161 KG
queries. To evaluate the benchmark, we have developed a systematic approach for
utilizing ChatGPT to translate natural language questions into formal KG
queries. We also apply the approach to the well-known QALD-9 dataset,
demonstrating ChatGPT's potential in addressing KGQA issues for different
platforms and query languages. The benchmark and the proposed approach aim to
stimulate further research and development of user-friendly and efficient
interfaces for querying domain-specific materials science knowledge graphs,
thereby accelerating the discovery of novel materials.

<p class="mathjax">Automata networks, and in particular Boolean networks, are used to model
diverse networks of interacting entities. The interaction graph of an automata
network is its most important parameter, as it represents the overall
architecture of the network. A continuous amount of work has been devoted to
infer dynamical properties of the automata network based on its interaction
graph only. Robert's theorem is the seminal result in this area; it states that
automata networks with an acyclic interaction graph converge to a unique fixed
point. The feedback bound can be viewed as an extension of Robert's theorem; it
gives an upper bound on the number of fixed points of an automata network based
on the size of a minimum feedback vertex set of its interaction graph. Boolean
networks can be viewed as self-mappings on the power set lattice of the set of
entities. In this paper, we consider self-mappings on a general complete
lattice. We make two conceptual contributions. Firstly, we can view a digraph
as a residuated mapping on the power set lattice; as such, we define a graph on
a complete lattice as a residuated mapping on that lattice. We extend and
generalise some results on digraphs to our setting. Secondly, we introduce a
generalised notion of dependency whereby any mapping $\phi$ can depend on any
other mapping $\alpha$. In fact, we are able to give four kinds of dependency
in this case. We can then vastly expand Robert's theorem to self-mappings on
general complete lattices; we similarly generalise the feedback bound. We then
obtain stronger results in the case where the lattice is a complete Boolean
algebra. We finally show how our results can be applied to prove the
convergence of automata networks.

<p class="mathjax">The celebrated notion of important separators bounds the number of small
$(S,T)$-separators in a graph which are 'farthest from $S$' in a technical
sense. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this powerful
algorithmic primitive that is phrased in terms of $k$-secluded vertex sets:
sets with an open neighborhood of size at most $k$.
<br />In this terminology, the bound on important separators says that there are at
most $4^k$ maximal $k$-secluded connected vertex sets $C$ containing $S$ but
disjoint from $T$. We generalize this statement significantly: even when we
demand that $G[C]$ avoids a finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden induced
subgraphs, the number of such maximal subgraphs is $2^{O(k)}$ and they can be
enumerated efficiently. This allows us to make significant improvements for two
problems from the literature.
<br />Our first application concerns the 'Connected $k$-Secluded $\mathcal{F}$-free
subgraph' problem, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite set of forbidden induced
subgraphs. Given a graph in which each vertex has a positive integer weight,
the problem asks to find a maximum-weight connected $k$-secluded vertex set $C
\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G[C]$ does not contain an induced subgraph
isomorphic to any $F \in \mathcal{F}$. The parameterization by $k$ is known to
be solvable in triple-exponential time via the technique of recursive
understanding, which we improve to single-exponential.
<br />Our second application concerns the deletion problem to scattered graph
classes. Here, the task is to find a vertex set of size at most $k$ whose
removal yields a graph whose each connected component belongs to one of the
prescribed graph classes $\Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_d$. We obtain a single-exponential
algorithm whenever each class $\Pi_i$ is characterized by a finite number of
forbidden induced subgraphs. This generalizes and improves upon earlier results
in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Human-robot collaboration has benefited users with higher efficiency towards
interactive tasks. Nevertheless, most collaborative schemes rely on complicated
human-machine interfaces, which might lack the requisite intuitiveness compared
with natural limb control. We also expect to understand human intent with low
training data requirements. In response to these challenges, this paper
introduces an innovative human-robot collaborative framework that seamlessly
integrates hand gesture and dynamic movement recognition, voice recognition,
and a switchable control adaptation strategy. These modules provide a
user-friendly approach that enables the robot to deliver the tools as per user
need, especially when the user is working with both hands. Therefore, users can
focus on their task execution without additional training in the use of
human-machine interfaces, while the robot interprets their intuitive gestures.
The proposed multimodal interaction framework is executed in the UR5e robot
platform equipped with a RealSense D435i camera, and the effectiveness is
assessed through a soldering circuit board task. The experiment results have
demonstrated superior performance in hand gesture recognition, where the static
hand gesture recognition module achieves an accuracy of 94.3\%, while the
dynamic motion recognition module reaches 97.6\% accuracy. Compared with human
solo manipulation, the proposed approach facilitates higher efficiency tool
delivery, without significantly distracting from human intents.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work in machine learning for healthcare has raised concerns about
patient privacy and algorithmic fairness. For example, previous work has shown
that patient self-reported race can be predicted from medical data that does
not explicitly contain racial information. However, the extent of data
identification is unknown, and we lack ways to develop models whose outcomes
are minimally affected by such information. Here we systematically investigated
the ability of time-series electronic health record data to predict patient
static information. We found that not only the raw time-series data, but also
learned representations from machine learning models, can be trained to predict
a variety of static information with area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve as high as 0.851 for biological sex, 0.869 for binarized
age and 0.810 for self-reported race. Such high predictive performance can be
extended to a wide range of comorbidity factors and exists even when the model
was trained for different tasks, using different cohorts, using different model
architectures and databases. Given the privacy and fairness concerns these
findings pose, we develop a variational autoencoder-based approach that learns
a structured latent space to disentangle patient-sensitive attributes from
time-series data. Our work thoroughly investigates the ability of machine
learning models to encode patient static information from time-series
electronic health records and introduces a general approach to protect
patient-sensitive attribute information for downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that
enables model training in communication efficient and privacy-preserving
manner. The standard optimization method in FL is Federated Averaging (FedAvg),
which performs multiple local SGD steps between communication rounds. FedAvg
has been considered to lack algorithm adaptivity compared to modern first-order
adaptive optimizations. In this paper, we propose new communication-efficient
FL algortithms based on two adaptive frameworks: local adaptivity (PreFed) and
server-side adaptivity (PreFedOp). Proposed methods adopt adaptivity by using a
novel covariance matrix preconditioner. Theoretically, we provide convergence
guarantees for our algorithms. The empirical experiments show our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performances on both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings.

<p class="mathjax">Blockwise self-attentional encoder models have recently emerged as one
promising end-to-end approach to simultaneous speech translation. These models
employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine
when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this
method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed
-- this scheme cannot directly show a single \textit{incremental} translation
to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \textit{controlling} the
quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam
search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency
control. We apply our framework to models trained for online or offline
translation and demonstrate that both types can be effectively used in online
mode.
<br />Experimental results on MuST-C show 0.6-3.6 BLEU improvement without changing
latency or 0.8-1.4 s latency improvement without changing quality.

<p class="mathjax">We present a method based on natural language processing (NLP), for studying
the influence of interest groups (lobbies) in the law-making process in the
European Parliament (EP). We collect and analyze novel datasets of lobbies'
position papers and speeches made by members of the EP (MEPs). By comparing
these texts on the basis of semantic similarity and entailment, we are able to
discover interpretable links between MEPs and lobbies. In the absence of a
ground-truth dataset of such links, we perform an indirect validation by
comparing the discovered links with a dataset, which we curate, of retweet
links between MEPs and lobbies, and with the publicly disclosed meetings of
MEPs. Our best method achieves an AUC score of 0.77 and performs significantly
better than several baselines. Moreover, an aggregate analysis of the
discovered links, between groups of related lobbies and political groups of
MEPs, correspond to the expectations from the ideology of the groups (e.g.,
center-left groups are associated with social causes). We believe that this
work, which encompasses the methodology, datasets, and results, is a step
towards enhancing the transparency of the intricate decision-making processes
within democratic institutions.

<p class="mathjax">Visual language navigation (VLN) is an embodied task demanding a wide range
of skills encompassing understanding, perception, and planning. For such a
multifaceted challenge, previous VLN methods totally rely on one model's own
thinking to make predictions within one round. However, existing models, even
the most advanced large language model GPT4, still struggle with dealing with
multiple tasks by single-round self-thinking. In this work, drawing inspiration
from the expert consultation meeting, we introduce a novel zero-shot VLN
framework. Within this framework, large models possessing distinct abilities
are served as domain experts. Our proposed navigation agent, namely DiscussNav,
can actively discuss with these experts to collect essential information before
moving at every step. These discussions cover critical navigation subtasks like
instruction understanding, environment perception, and completion estimation.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that discussions with domain
experts can effectively facilitate navigation by perceiving
instruction-relevant information, correcting inadvertent errors, and sifting
through in-consistent movement decisions. The performances on the
representative VLN task R2R show that our method surpasses the leading
zero-shot VLN model by a large margin on all metrics. Additionally, real-robot
experiments display the obvious advantages of our method over single-round
self-thinking.

<p class="mathjax">Current simultaneous speech translation models can process audio only up to a
few seconds long. Contemporary datasets provide an oracle segmentation into
sentences based on human-annotated transcripts and translations. However, the
segmentation into sentences is not available in the real world. Current speech
segmentation approaches either offer poor segmentation quality or have to trade
latency for quality. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation approach
for a low-latency end-to-end speech translation. We leverage the existing
speech translation encoder-decoder architecture with ST CTC and show that it
can perform the segmentation task without supervision or additional parameters.
To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first that allows an actual
end-to-end simultaneous speech translation, as the same model is used for
translation and segmentation at the same time. On a diverse set of language
pairs and in- and out-of-domain data, we show that the proposed approach
achieves state-of-the-art quality at no additional computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents Safurai-001, a new Large Language Model (LLM) with
significant potential in the domain of coding assistance. Driven by recent
advancements in coding LLMs, Safurai-001 competes in performance with the
latest models like WizardCoder [Xu et al., 2023], PanguCoder [Shen et al.,
2023] and Phi-1 [Gunasekar et al., 2023] but aims to deliver a more
conversational interaction. By capitalizing on the progress in data engineering
(including latest techniques of data transformation and prompt engineering) and
instruction tuning, this new model promises to stand toe-to-toe with recent
closed and open source developments. Recognizing the need for an efficacious
evaluation metric for coding LLMs, this paper also introduces GPT4-based
MultiParameters, an evaluation benchmark that harnesses varied parameters to
present a comprehensive insight into the models functioning and performance.
Our assessment shows that Safurai-001 can outperform GPT-3.5 by 1.58% and
WizardCoder by 18.78% in the Code Readability parameter and more.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method to modify a polygonal mesh in order to fit the
zero-isoline of a level set function by extending a standard body-fitted
strategy to a tessellation with arbitrarily-shaped elements. The novel level
set-fitted approach, in combination with a Discontinuous Galerkin finite
element approximation, provides an ideal setting to model physical problems
characterized by embedded or evolving complex geometries, since it allows
skipping any mesh post-processing in terms of grid quality. The proposed
methodology is firstly assessed on the linear elasticity equation, by verifying
the approximation capability of the level set-fitted approach when dealing with
configurations with heterogeneous material properties. Successively, we combine
the level set-fitted methodology with a minimum compliance topology
optimization technique, in order to deliver optimized layouts exhibiting crisp
boundaries and reliable mechanical performances. An extensive numerical test
campaign confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Current large language models (LLMs) can exhibit near-human levels of
performance on many natural language-based tasks, including open-domain
question answering. Unfortunately, at this time, they also convincingly
hallucinate incorrect answers, so that responses to questions must be verified
against external sources before they can be accepted at face value. In this
paper, we report two simple experiments to automatically validate generated
answers against a corpus. We base our experiments on questions and passages
from the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, and a retrieval pipeline consisting of
sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and neural rerankers. In the first
experiment, we validate the generated answer in its entirety. After presenting
a question to an LLM and receiving a generated answer, we query the corpus with
the combination of the question + generated answer. We then present the LLM
with the combination of the question + generated answer + retrieved answer,
prompting it to indicate if the generated answer can be supported by the
retrieved answer. In the second experiment, we consider the generated answer at
a more granular level, prompting the LLM to extract a list of factual
statements from the answer and verifying each statement separately. We query
the corpus with each factual statement and then present the LLM with the
statement and the corresponding retrieved evidence. The LLM is prompted to
indicate if the statement can be supported and make necessary edits using the
retrieved material. With an accuracy of over 80%, we find that an LLM is
capable of verifying its generated answer when a corpus of supporting material
is provided. However, manual assessment of a random sample of questions reveals
that incorrect generated answers are missed by this verification process. While
this verification process can reduce hallucinations, it can not entirely
eliminate them.

<p class="mathjax">Schema change is an unsolved problem in both live programming and local-first
software. We include in schema change any change to the expected shape of data,
whether that is expressed explicitly in a database schema or type system, or
whether those expectations are implicit in the behavior of the code. Schema
changes during live programming can create a mismatch between the code and data
in the running environment. Similarly, schema changes in local-first
programming can create mismatches between data in different replicas, and
between data in a replica and the code colocated with it. In all of these
situations the problem of schema change is to migrate or translate existing
data in coordination with changes to the code.
<br />This paper contributes a set of concrete scenarios involving schema change
that are offered as challenge problems to the live programming and local-first
communities. We hope that these problems will spur progress by providing
concrete objectives and a basis for comparing alternative solutions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the distributed localization problem for a network of
sensors placed in a three-dimensional space, in which sensors are able to
perform range measurements, i.e., measure the relative distance between them,
and exchange information on a network structure. First, we derive a necessary
and sufficient condition for node localizability using barycentric coordinates.
Then, building on this theoretical result, we design a distributed
localizability verification algorithm, in which we propose and employ a novel
distributed finite-time algorithm for sum consensus. Finally, we develop a
distributed localization algorithm based on conjugate gradient method, and we
derive a theoretical guarantee on its performance, which ensures finite-time
convergence to the exact position for all localizable nodes. The efficiency of
our algorithm compared to the existing ones from the state-of-the-art
literature is further demonstrated through numerical simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory segmentation refers to dividing a trajectory into meaningful
consecutive sub-trajectories. This paper focuses on trajectory segmentation for
3D rigid-body motions. Most segmentation approaches in the literature represent
the body's trajectory as a point trajectory, considering only its translation
and neglecting its rotation. We propose a novel trajectory representation for
rigid-body motions that incorporates both translation and rotation, and
additionally exhibits several invariant properties. This representation
consists of a geometric progress rate and a third-order trajectory-shape
descriptor. Concepts from screw theory were used to make this representation
time-invariant and also invariant to the choice of body reference point. This
new representation is validated for a self-supervised segmentation approach,
both in simulation and using real recordings of human-demonstrated pouring
motions. The results show a more robust detection of consecutive submotions
with distinct features and a more consistent segmentation compared to
conventional representations. We believe that other existing segmentation
methods may benefit from using this trajectory representation to improve their
invariance.

<p class="mathjax">Classical motion planning for robotic manipulation includes a set of general
algorithms that aim to minimize a scene-specific cost of executing a given
plan. This approach offers remarkable adaptability, as they can be directly
used off-the-shelf for any new scene without needing specific training
datasets. However, without a prior understanding of what diverse valid
trajectories are and without specially designed cost functions for a given
scene, the overall solutions tend to have low success rates. While
deep-learning-based algorithms tremendously improve success rates, they are
much harder to adopt without specialized training datasets. We propose EDMP, an
Ensemble-of-costs-guided Diffusion for Motion Planning that aims to combine the
strengths of classical and deep-learning-based motion planning. Our
diffusion-based network is trained on a set of diverse kinematically valid
trajectories. Like classical planning, for any new scene at the time of
inference, we compute scene-specific costs such as "collision cost" and guide
the diffusion to generate valid trajectories that satisfy the scene-specific
constraints. Further, instead of a single cost function that may be
insufficient in capturing diversity across scenes, we use an ensemble of costs
to guide the diffusion process, significantly improving the success rate
compared to classical planners. EDMP performs comparably with SOTA
deep-learning-based methods while retaining the generalization capabilities
primarily associated with classical planners.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved astonishing advances over
the past decade, defining state-of-the-art in several computer vision tasks.
CNNs are capable of learning robust representations of the data directly from
the RGB pixels. However, most image data are usually available in compressed
format, from which the JPEG is the most widely used due to transmission and
storage purposes demanding a preliminary decoding process that have a high
computational load and memory usage. For this reason, deep learning methods
capable of learning directly from the compressed domain have been gaining
attention in recent years. Those methods usually extract a frequency domain
representation of the image, like DCT, by a partial decoding, and then make
adaptation to typical CNNs architectures to work with them. One limitation of
these current works is that, in order to accommodate the frequency domain data,
the modifications made to the original model increase significantly their
amount of parameters and computational complexity. On one hand, the methods
have faster preprocessing, since the cost of fully decoding the images is
avoided, but on the other hand, the cost of passing the images though the model
is increased, mitigating the possible upside of accelerating the method. In
this paper, we propose a further study of the computational cost of deep models
designed for the frequency domain, evaluating the cost of decoding and passing
the images through the network. We also propose handcrafted and data-driven
techniques for reducing the computational complexity and the number of
parameters for these models in order to keep them similar to their RGB
baselines, leading to efficient models with a better trade off between
computational cost and accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">We present Kosmos-2.5, a multimodal literate model for machine reading of
text-intensive images. Pre-trained on large-scale text-intensive images,
Kosmos-2.5 excels in two distinct yet cooperative transcription tasks: (1)
generating spatially-aware text blocks, where each block of text is assigned
its spatial coordinates within the image, and (2) producing structured text
output that captures styles and structures into the markdown format. This
unified multimodal literate capability is achieved through a shared Transformer
architecture, task-specific prompts, and flexible text representations. We
evaluate Kosmos-2.5 on end-to-end document-level text recognition and
image-to-markdown text generation. Furthermore, the model can be readily
adapted for any text-intensive image understanding task with different prompts
through supervised fine-tuning, making it a general-purpose tool for real-world
applications involving text-rich images. This work also paves the way for the
future scaling of multimodal large language models.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the approximation efficiency of score functions by deep neural
networks in diffusion-based generative modeling. While existing approximation
theories utilize the smoothness of score functions, they suffer from the curse
of dimensionality for intrinsically high-dimensional data. This limitation is
pronounced in graphical models such as Markov random fields, common for image
distributions, where the approximation efficiency of score functions remains
unestablished.
<br />To address this, we observe score functions can often be well-approximated in
graphical models through variational inference denoising algorithms.
Furthermore, these algorithms are amenable to efficient neural network
representation. We demonstrate this in examples of graphical models, including
Ising models, conditional Ising models, restricted Boltzmann machines, and
sparse encoding models. Combined with off-the-shelf discretization error bounds
for diffusion-based sampling, we provide an efficient sample complexity bound
for diffusion-based generative modeling when the score function is learned by
deep neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces TRACE-GPT, which stands for Time-seRies
Anomaly-detection with Convolutional Embedding and Generative Pre-trained
Transformers. TRACE-GPT is designed to pre-train univariate time-series sensor
data and detect faults on unlabeled datasets in semiconductor manufacturing. In
semiconductor industry, classifying abnormal time-series sensor data from
normal data is important because it is directly related to wafer defect.
However, small, unlabeled, and even mixed training data without enough
anomalies make classification tasks difficult. In this research, we capture
features of time-series data with temporal convolutional embedding and
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to classify abnormal sequences from
normal sequences using cross entropy loss. We prove that our model shows better
performance than previous unsupervised models with both an open dataset, the
University of California Riverside (UCR) time-series classification archive,
and the process log of our Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment. Our model
has the highest F1 score at Equal Error Rate (EER) across all datasets and is
only 0.026 below the supervised state-of-the-art baseline on the open dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning
models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning
techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis,
especially with meta-learning. This systematic review gives a comprehensive
overview of few-shot learning in medical imaging. We searched the literature
systematically and selected 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023.
We clustered the articles based on medical outcomes, such as tumour
segmentation, disease classification, and image registration; anatomical
structure investigated (i.e. heart, lung, etc.); and the meta-learning method
used. For each cluster, we examined the papers' distributions and the results
provided by the state-of-the-art. In addition, we identified a generic pipeline
shared among all the studies. The review shows that few-shot learning can
overcome data scarcity in most outcomes and that meta-learning is a popular
choice to perform few-shot learning because it can adapt to new tasks with few
labelled samples. In addition, following meta-learning, supervised learning and
semi-supervised learning stand out as the predominant techniques employed to
tackle few-shot learning challenges in medical imaging and also best
performing. Lastly, we observed that the primary application areas
predominantly encompass cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal domains. This
systematic review aims to inspire further research to improve medical image
analysis and patient care.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous user interface (UI) agents aim to facilitate task automation by
interacting with the user interface without manual intervention. Recent studies
have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the
input-output requirement of LLMs, existing approaches are developed under a
sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs
to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted
actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference
inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we
introduce Auto-UI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the
interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on
application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique --
leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action
plans -- to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our
approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30K unique instructions,
spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web
shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 90% and an overall
action success rate of 74%. Code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">In Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), it is crucial to ensure the user's
comprehension of a reason for correction. Existing studies present tokens,
examples, and hints as to the basis for correction but do not directly explain
the reasons for corrections. Although methods that use Large Language Models
(LLMs) to provide direct explanations in natural language have been proposed
for various tasks, no such method exists for GEC. Generating explanations for
GEC corrections involves aligning input and output tokens, identifying
correction points, and presenting corresponding explanations consistently.
However, it is not straightforward to specify a complex format to generate
explanations, because explicit control of generation is difficult with prompts.
This study introduces a method called controlled generation with Prompt
Insertion (PI) so that LLMs can explain the reasons for corrections in natural
language. In PI, LLMs first correct the input text, and then we automatically
extract the correction points based on the rules. The extracted correction
points are sequentially inserted into the LLM's explanation output as prompts,
guiding the LLMs to generate explanations for the correction points. We also
create an Explainable GEC (XGEC) dataset of correction reasons by annotating
NUCLE, CoNLL2013, and CoNLL2014. Although generations from GPT-3 and ChatGPT
using original prompts miss some correction points, the generation control
using PI can explicitly guide to describe explanations for all correction
points, contributing to improved performance in generating correction reasons.

<p class="mathjax">We present SkeleTR, a new framework for skeleton-based action recognition. In
contrast to prior work, which focuses mainly on controlled environments, we
target more general scenarios that typically involve a variable number of
people and various forms of interaction between people. SkeleTR works with a
two-stage paradigm. It first models the intra-person skeleton dynamics for each
skeleton sequence with graph convolutions, and then uses stacked Transformer
encoders to capture person interactions that are important for action
recognition in general scenarios. To mitigate the negative impact of inaccurate
skeleton associations, SkeleTR takes relative short skeleton sequences as input
and increases the number of sequences. As a unified solution, SkeleTR can be
directly applied to multiple skeleton-based action tasks, including video-level
action classification, instance-level action detection, and group-level
activity recognition. It also enables transfer learning and joint training
across different action tasks and datasets, which result in performance
improvement. When evaluated on various skeleton-based action recognition
benchmarks, SkeleTR achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful model compression technique broadly
used in practical deep learning applications. It is focused on training a small
student network to mimic a larger teacher network. While it is widely known
that KD can offer an improvement to student generalization in i.i.d setting,
its performance under domain shift, i.e. the performance of student networks on
data from domains unseen during training, has received little attention in the
literature. In this paper we make a step towards bridging the research fields
of knowledge distillation and domain generalization. We show that weight
averaging techniques proposed in domain generalization literature, such as SWAD
and SMA, also improve the performance of knowledge distillation under domain
shift. In addition, we propose a simplistic weight averaging strategy that does
not require evaluation on validation data during training and show that it
performs on par with SWAD and SMA when applied to KD. We name our final
distillation approach Weight-Averaged Knowledge Distillation (WAKD).

<p class="mathjax">The Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT) is the most prototypical NP-complete
problem and of great practical relevance. One important class of solvers for
this problem are stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms that iteratively and
randomly update a candidate assignment. Recent breakthrough results in
theoretical computer science have established sufficient conditions under which
SLS solvers are guaranteed to efficiently solve a SAT instance, provided they
have access to suitable "oracles" that provide samples from an
instance-specific distribution, exploiting an instance's local structure.
Motivated by these results and the well established ability of neural networks
to learn common structure in large datasets, in this work, we train oracles
using Graph Neural Networks and evaluate them on two SLS solvers on random SAT
instances of varying difficulty. We find that access to GNN-based oracles
significantly boosts the performance of both solvers, allowing them, on
average, to solve 17% more difficult instances (as measured by the ratio
between clauses and variables), and to do so in 35% fewer steps, with
improvements in the median number of steps of up to a factor of 8. As such,
this work bridges formal results from theoretical computer science and
practically motivated research on deep learning for constraint satisfaction
problems and establishes the promise of purpose-trained SAT solvers with
performance guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">Learning-based controllers have demonstrated superior performance compared to
classical controllers in various tasks. However, providing safety guarantees is
not trivial. Safety, the satisfaction of state and input constraints, can be
guaranteed by augmenting the learned control policy with a safety filter. Model
predictive safety filters (MPSFs) are a common safety filtering approach based
on model predictive control (MPC). MPSFs seek to guarantee safety while
minimizing the difference between the proposed and applied inputs in the
immediate next time step. This limited foresight can lead to jerky motions and
undesired oscillations close to constraint boundaries, known as chattering. In
this paper, we reduce chattering by considering input corrections over a longer
horizon. Under the assumption of bounded model uncertainties, we prove
recursive feasibility using techniques from robust MPC. We verified the
proposed approach in both extensive simulation and quadrotor experiments. In
experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone, we show that, in addition to preserving
the desired safety guarantees, the proposed MPSF reduces chattering by more
than a factor of 4 compared to previous MPSF formulations.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding how local environments influence individual behaviors, such as
voting patterns or suicidal tendencies, is crucial in social science to reveal
and reduce spatial disparities and promote social well-being. With the
increasing availability of large-scale individual-level census data, new
analytical opportunities arise for social scientists to explore human behaviors
(e.g., political engagement) among social groups at a fine-grained level.
However, traditional statistical methods mostly focus on global, aggregated
spatial correlations, which are limited to understanding and comparing the
impact of local environments (e.g., neighborhoods) on human behaviors among
social groups. In this study, we introduce a new analytical framework for
analyzing multi-variate neighborhood effects between social groups. We then
propose NeighVi, an interactive visual analytics system that helps social
scientists explore, understand, and verify the influence of neighborhood
effects on human behaviors. Finally, we use a case study to illustrate the
effectiveness and usability of our system.

mechanistic model of human interactions with a pre-trained large language
model. This is achieved by introducing a simple GABM of social norm diffusion
in an organization. For educational purposes, the model is intentionally kept
simple. We examine a wide range of scenarios and the sensitivity of the results
to several changes in the prompt. We hope the article and the model serve as a
guide for building useful diffusion models that include realistic human
reasoning and decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Digital twins have attracted a great deal of recent attention from a wide
range of fields. A basic requirement for digital twins of nonlinear dynamical
systems is the ability to generate the system evolution and predict potentially
catastrophic emergent behaviors so as to providing early warnings. The digital
twin can then be used for system "health" monitoring in real time and for
predictive problem solving. In particular, if the digital twin forecasts a
possible system collapse in the future due to parameter drifting as caused by
environmental changes or perturbations, an optimal control strategy can be
devised and executed as early intervention to prevent the collapse. Two
approaches exist for constructing digital twins of nonlinear dynamical systems:
sparse optimization and machine learning. The basics of these two approaches
are described and their advantages and caveats are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Speech Recognition systems have been shown to be vulnerable to
adversarial attacks that manipulate the command executed on the device. Recent
research has focused on exploring methods to create such attacks, however, some
issues relating to Over-The-Air (OTA) attacks have not been properly addressed.
In our work, we examine the needed properties of robust attacks compatible with
the OTA model, and we design a method of generating attacks with arbitrary such
desired properties, namely the invariance to synchronization, and the
robustness to filtering: this allows a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against
ASR systems. We achieve these characteristics by constructing attacks in a
modified frequency domain through an inverse Fourier transform. We evaluate our
method on standard keyword classification tasks and analyze it in OTA, and we
analyze the properties of the cross-domain attacks to explain the efficiency of
the approach.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several computer
vision tasks and domains. Nevertheless, it still has a high computational cost
and demands a significant amount of parameters. Such requirements hinder the
use in resource-limited environments and demand both software and hardware
optimization. Another limitation is that deep models are usually specialized
into a single domain or task, requiring them to learn and store new parameters
for each new one. Multi-Domain Learning (MDL) attempts to solve this problem by
learning a single model that is capable of performing well in multiple domains.
Nevertheless, the models are usually larger than the baseline for a single
domain. This work tackles both of these problems: our objective is to prune
models capable of handling multiple domains according to a user-defined budget,
making them more computationally affordable while keeping a similar
classification performance. We achieve this by encouraging all domains to use a
similar subset of filters from the baseline model, up to the amount defined by
the user's budget. Then, filters that are not used by any domain are pruned
from the network. The proposed approach innovates by better adapting to
resource-limited devices while, to our knowledge, being the only work that
handles multiple domains at test time with fewer parameters and lower
computational complexity than the baseline model for a single domain.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-label classification can effectively identify the relevant labels of an
instance from a given set of labels. However,the modeling of the relationship
between the features and the labels is critical to the classification
performance. To this end, we propose a new multi-label classification method,
called Multi-Label Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy System (ML-TSK FS), to improve the
classification performance. The structure of ML-TSK FS is designed using fuzzy
rules to model the relationship between features and labels. The fuzzy system
is trained by integrating fuzzy inference based multi-label correlation
learning with multi-label regression loss. The proposed ML-TSK FS is evaluated
experimentally on 12 benchmark multi-label datasets. 1 The results show that
the performance of ML-TSK FS is competitive with existing methods in terms of
various evaluation metrics, indicating that it is able to model the
feature-label relationship effectively using fuzzy inference rules and enhances
the classification performance.

<p class="mathjax">Nonlinear tracking control enabling a dynamical system to track a desired
trajectory is fundamental to robotics, serving a wide range of civil and
defense applications. In control engineering, designing tracking control
requires complete knowledge of the system model and equations. We develop a
model-free, machine-learning framework to control a two-arm robotic manipulator
using only partially observed states, where the controller is realized by
reservoir computing. Stochastic input is exploited for training, which consists
of the observed partial state vector as the first and its immediate future as
the second component so that the neural machine regards the latter as the
future state of the former. In the testing (deployment) phase, the
immediate-future component is replaced by the desired observational vector from
the reference trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the control
framework using a variety of periodic and chaotic signals, and establish its
robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and uncertainties.

<p class="mathjax">To secure the digital images over insecure transmission channels, a new image
encryption algorithm Noise-Crypt is proposed in this paper. Noise-Crypt
integrates non-linear random noise, hybrid chaotic maps, and SHA-256 hashing
algorithm. The utilized hybrid chaotic maps are the logistic-tent and the
logistic-sine-cosine map. The hybrid chaotic maps enhance the pseudorandom
sequence generation and selection of substitution boxes, while the
logistic-sine-cosine map induces non-linearity in the algorithm through random
noise. This deliberate inclusion of noise contributes to increased resistance
against cryptanalysis. The proposed scheme has been evaluated for several
security parameters, such as differential attacks, entropy, correlation, etc.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed scheme, with
almost ideal values of entropy of 7.99 and correlation of -0.0040. Results of
the security analysis validate the potency of the proposed scheme in achieving
robust image encryption.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised multi-view representation learning has been extensively studied
for mining multi-view data. However, some critical challenges remain. On the
one hand, the existing methods cannot explore multi-view data comprehensively
since they usually learn a common representation between views, given that
multi-view data contains both the common information between views and the
specific information within each view. On the other hand, to mine the nonlinear
relationship between data, kernel or neural network methods are commonly used
for multi-view representation learning. However, these methods are lacking in
interpretability. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-view fuzzy
representation learning method based on the interpretable Takagi-Sugeno-Kang
(TSK) fuzzy system (MVRL_FS). The method realizes multi-view representation
learning from two aspects. First, multi-view data are transformed into a
high-dimensional fuzzy feature space, while the common information between
views and specific information of each view are explored simultaneously.
Second, a new regularization method based on L_(2,1)-norm regression is
proposed to mine the consistency information between views, while the geometric
structure of the data is preserved through the Laplacian graph. Finally,
extensive experiments on many benchmark multi-view datasets are conducted to
validate the superiority of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 4.0, ensuring secure data
transmission has become a critical concern. Among other data types, images are
widely transmitted and utilized across various IIoT applications, ranging from
sensor-generated visual data and real-time remote monitoring to quality control
in production lines. The encryption of these images is essential for
maintaining operational integrity, data confidentiality, and seamless
integration with analytics platforms. This paper addresses these critical
concerns by proposing a robust image encryption algorithm tailored for IIoT and
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The algorithm combines Rule-30 cellular automata
with chaotic scrambling and substitution. The Rule 30 cellular automata serves
as an efficient mechanism for generating pseudo-random sequences that enable
fast encryption and decryption cycles suitable for real-time sensor data in
industrial settings. Most importantly, it induces non-linearity in the
encryption algorithm. Furthermore, to increase the chaotic range and keyspace
of the algorithm, which is vital for security in distributed industrial
networks, a hybrid chaotic map, i.e., logistic-sine map is utilized. Extensive
security analysis has been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm. Results indicate that our algorithm achieves close-to-ideal values,
with an entropy of 7.99 and a correlation of 0.002. This enhances the
algorithm's resilience against potential cyber-attacks in the industrial
domain.

global temporal logic tasks. We define a specification language, called
extended capacity temporal logic (ECaTL), to describe the required global
tasks, including the number of times that a local or coupled signal temporal
logic (STL) task needs to be satisfied and the synchronous requirements on task
satisfaction. The robustness measure for ECaTL is formally designed. In
particular, the robustness for synchronous tasks is evaluated from both the
temporal and spatial perspectives. Mixed-integer linear constraints are
designed to encode ECaTL specifications, and a two-step optimization framework
is further proposed to realize task-satisfied motion planning with high spatial
robustness and synchronicity. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the
expressivity of ECaTL and the efficiency of the proposed control synthesis
approach.

to develop engaging and believable Social Chatbots (SCs) in community settings.
Motivated by the potential of fictional characters to enhance social
interactions, we introduce Storytelling Social Chatbots (SSCs) and the concept
of story engineering to transform fictional game characters into "live" social
entities within player communities. Our story engineering process includes
three steps: (1) Character and story creation, defining the SC's personality
and worldview, (2) Presenting Live Stories to the Community, allowing the SC to
recount challenges and seek suggestions, and (3) Communication with community
members, enabling interaction between the SC and users. We employed the LLM
GPT-3 to drive our SSC prototypes, "David" and "Catherine," and evaluated their
performance in an online gaming community, "DE (Alias)," on Discord. Our
mixed-method analysis, based on questionnaires (N=15) and interviews (N=8) with
community members, reveals that storytelling significantly enhances the
engagement and believability of SCs in community settings.

<p class="mathjax">Realistic reservoir simulation is known to be prohibitively expensive in
terms of computation time when increasing the accuracy of the simulation or by
enlarging the model grid size. One method to address this issue is to
parallelize the computation by dividing the model in several partitions and
using multiple CPUs to compute the result using techniques such as MPI and
multi-threading. Alternatively, GPUs are also a good candidate to accelerate
the computation due to their massively parallel architecture that allows many
floating point operations per second to be performed. The numerical iterative
solver takes thus the most computational time and is challenging to solve
efficiently due to the dependencies that exist in the model between cells. In
this work, we evaluate the OPM Flow simulator and compare several
state-of-the-art GPU solver libraries as well as custom developed solutions for
a BiCGStab solver using an ILU0 preconditioner and benchmark their performance
against the default DUNE library implementation running on multiple CPU
processors using MPI. The evaluated GPU software libraries include a manual
linear solver in OpenCL and the integration of several third party sparse
linear algebra libraries, such as cuSparse, rocSparse, and amgcl. To perform
our bench-marking, we use small, medium, and large use cases, starting with the
public test case NORNE that includes approximately 50k active cells and ending
with a large model that includes approximately 1 million active cells. We find
that a GPU can accelerate a single dual-threaded MPI process up to 5.6 times,
and that it can compare with around 8 dual-threaded MPI processes.

<p class="mathjax">Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to
high costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a
data-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions
based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural
language, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program
grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and
recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces
interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,
utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.
We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,
MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17
manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve
similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written
reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion
behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the
policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real
world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their
reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at

<p class="mathjax">Generation of plausible yet incorrect factual information, termed
hallucination, is an unsolved issue in large language models. We study the
ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to
correct their mistakes. We develop the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method
whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans
verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions
independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv)
generates its final verified response. In experiments, we show CoVe decreases
hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from
Wikidata, closed book MultiSpanQA and longform text generation.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we uncover the untapped potential of diffusion U-Net, which
serves as a "free lunch" that substantially improves the generation quality on
the fly. We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net
architecture to the denoising process and identify that its main backbone
primarily contributes to denoising, whereas its skip connections mainly
introduce high-frequency features into the decoder module, causing the network
to overlook the backbone semantics. Capitalizing on this discovery, we propose
a simple yet effective method-termed "FreeU" - that enhances generation quality
without additional training or finetuning. Our key insight is to strategically
re-weight the contributions sourced from the U-Net's skip connections and
backbone feature maps, to leverage the strengths of both components of the
U-Net architecture. Promising results on image and video generation tasks
demonstrate that our FreeU can be readily integrated to existing diffusion
models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, DreamBooth, ModelScope, Rerender and ReVersion,
to improve the generation quality with only a few lines of code. All you need
is to adjust two scaling factors during inference. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents DreamLLM, a learning framework that first achieves
versatile Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) empowered with frequently
overlooked synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation. DreamLLM
operates on two fundamental principles. The first focuses on the generative
modeling of both language and image posteriors by direct sampling in the raw
multimodal space. This approach circumvents the limitations and information
loss inherent to external feature extractors like CLIP, and a more thorough
multimodal understanding is obtained. Second, DreamLLM fosters the generation
of raw, interleaved documents, modeling both text and image contents, along
with unstructured layouts. This allows DreamLLM to learn all conditional,
marginal, and joint multimodal distributions effectively. As a result, DreamLLM
is the first MLLM capable of generating free-form interleaved content.
Comprehensive experiments highlight DreamLLM's superior performance as a
zero-shot multimodal generalist, reaping from the enhanced learning synergy.

<p class="mathjax">The AI community has made significant strides in developing powerful
foundation models, driven by large-scale multimodal datasets. However, in the
audio representation learning community, the present audio-language datasets
suffer from limitations such as insufficient volume, simplistic content, and
arduous collection procedures. To tackle these challenges, we present an
innovative and automatic audio caption generation pipeline based on a series of
public tools or APIs, and construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language
dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.9M audio-text pairs. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train popular models
on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks,
namely, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, environment classification.
In addition, we establish a novel test set and provide a benchmark for
audio-text tasks. The proposed dataset will be released at
https://auto-acd.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">Expecting intelligent machines to efficiently work in real world requires a
new method to understand unstructured information in unknown environments with
good accuracy, scalability and generalization, like human. Here, a memristive
neural computing based perceptual signal differential processing and learning
method for intelligent machines is presented, via extracting main features of
environmental information and applying associated encoded stimuli to
memristors, we successfully obtain human-like ability in processing
unstructured environmental information, such as amplification (&gt;720%) and
adaptation (&lt;50%) of mechanical stimuli. The method also exhibits good
scalability and generalization, validated in two typical applications of
intelligent machines: object grasping and autonomous driving. In the former, a
robot hand experimentally realizes safe and stable grasping, through learning
unknown object features (e.g., sharp corner and smooth surface) with a single
memristor in 1 ms. In the latter, the decision-making information of 10
unstructured environments in autonomous driving (e.g., overtaking cars,
pedestrians) are accurately (94%) extracted with a 40x25 memristor array. By
mimicking the intrinsic nature of human low-level perception mechanisms in
electronic memristive neural circuits, the proposed method is adaptable to
diverse sensing technologies, helping intelligent machines to generate smart
high-level decisions in real world.

<p class="mathjax">The use of deep learning to undertake shape analysis of the complexities of
the human head holds great promise. However, there have traditionally been a
number of barriers to accurate modelling, especially when operating on both a
global and local level. In this work, we will discuss the application of the
Swap Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (SD-VAE) with relevance to Crouzon,
Apert and Muenke syndromes. Although syndrome classification is performed on
the entire mesh, it is also possible, for the first time, to analyse the
influence of each region of the head on the syndromic phenotype. By
manipulating specific parameters of the generative model, and producing
procedure-specific new shapes, it is also possible to simulate the outcome of a
range of craniofacial surgical procedures. This opens new avenues to advance
diagnosis, aids surgical planning and allows for the objective evaluation of
surgical outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">CNN-based deep learning models for disease detection have become popular
recently. We compared the binary classification performance of eight prominent
deep learning models: DenseNet 121, DenseNet 169, DenseNet 201, EffecientNet
b0, EffecientNet lite4, GoogleNet, MobileNet, and ResNet18 for their binary
classification performance on combined Pulmonary Chest Xrays dataset. Despite
the widespread application in different fields in medical images, there remains
a knowledge gap in determining their relative performance when applied to the
same dataset, a gap this study aimed to address. The dataset combined Shenzhen,
China (CH) and Montgomery, USA (MC) data. We trained our model for binary
classification, calculated different parameters of the mentioned models, and
compared them. The models were trained to keep in mind all following the same
training parameters to maintain a controlled comparison environment. End of the
study, we found a distinct difference in performance among the other models
when applied to the pulmonary chest Xray image dataset, where DenseNet169
performed with 89.38 percent and MobileNet with 92.2 percent precision.

<p class="mathjax">Brain age prediction from MRI has become a popular imaging biomarker
associated with a wide range of neuropathologies. The datasets used for
training, however, are often skewed and imbalanced regarding demographics,
potentially making brain age prediction models susceptible to bias. We analyse
the commonly used ResNet-34 model by conducting a comprehensive subgroup
performance analysis and feature inspection. The model is trained on 1,215
T1-weighted MRI scans from Cam-CAN and IXI, and tested on UK Biobank
(n=42,786), split into six racial and biological sex subgroups. With the
objective of comparing the performance between subgroups, measured by the
absolute prediction error, we use a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by two
post-hoc Conover-Iman tests to inspect bias across race and biological sex. To
examine biases in the generated features, we use PCA for dimensionality
reduction and employ two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to identify
distribution shifts among subgroups. Our results reveal statistically
significant differences in predictive performance between Black and White,
Black and Asian, and male and female subjects. Seven out of twelve pairwise
comparisons show statistically significant differences in the feature
distributions. Our findings call for further analysis of brain age prediction
models.

<p class="mathjax">Opioids are an effective analgesic for acute and chronic pain, but also carry
a considerable risk of addiction leading to millions of opioid use disorder
(OUD) cases and tens of thousands of premature deaths in the United States
yearly. Estimating OUD risk prior to prescription could improve the efficacy of
treatment regimens, monitoring programs, and intervention strategies, but risk
estimation is typically based on self-reported data or questionnaires. We
develop an experimental design and computational methods that combines genetic
variants associated with OUD with behavioral features extracted from GPS and
Wi-Fi spatiotemporal coordinates to assess OUD risk. Since both OUD mobility
and genetic data do not exist for the same cohort, we develop algorithms to (1)
generate mobility features from empirical distributions and (2) synthesize
mobility and genetic samples assuming a level of comorbidity and relative
risks. We show that integrating genetic and mobility modalities improves risk
modelling using classification accuracy, area under the precision-recall and
receiver operator characteristic curves, and $F_1$ score. Interpreting the
fitted models suggests that mobility features have more influence on OUD risk,
although the genetic contribution was significant, particularly in linear
models. While there exists concerns with respect to privacy, security, bias,
and generalizability that must be evaluated in clinical trials before being
implemented in practice, our framework provides preliminary evidence that
behavioral and genetic features may improve OUD risk estimation to assist with
personalized clinical decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Global deep-learning weather prediction models have recently been shown to
produce forecasts that rival those from physics-based models run at operational
centers. It is unclear whether these models have encoded atmospheric dynamics,
or simply pattern matching that produces the smallest forecast error. Answering
this question is crucial to establishing the utility of these models as tools
for basic science. Here we subject one such model, Pangu-weather, to a set of
four classical dynamical experiments that do not resemble the model training
data. Localized perturbations to the model output and the initial conditions
are added to steady time-averaged conditions, to assess the propagation speed
and structural evolution of signals away from the local source. Perturbing the
model physics by adding a steady tropical heat source results in a classical
Matsuno--Gill response near the heating, and planetary waves that radiate into
the extratropics. A localized disturbance on the winter-averaged North Pacific
jet stream produces realistic extratropical cyclones and fronts, including the
spontaneous emergence of polar lows. Perturbing the 500hPa height field alone
yields adjustment from a state of rest to one of wind--pressure balance over ~6
hours. Localized subtropical low pressure systems produce Atlantic hurricanes,
provided the initial amplitude exceeds about 5 hPa, and setting the initial
humidity to zero eliminates hurricane development. We conclude that the model
encodes realistic physics in all experiments, and suggest it can be used as a
tool for rapidly testing ideas before using expensive physics-based models.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant
attention from the research community due to their exceptional performance and
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for
contextualizing speech recognition models incorporating LLMs. Our approach
casts speech recognition as a mixed-modal language modeling task based on a
pretrained LLM. We provide audio features, along with optional text tokens for
context, to train the system to complete transcriptions in a decoder-only
fashion. As a result, the system is implicitly incentivized to learn how to
leverage unstructured contextual information during training. Our empirical
results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance, with a 6% WER
reduction when additional textual context is provided. Moreover, we find that
our method performs competitively and improve by 7.5% WER overall and 17% WER
on rare words against a baseline contextualized RNN-T system that has been
trained on more than twenty five times larger speech dataset. Overall, we
demonstrate that by only adding a handful number of trainable parameters via
adapters, we can unlock contextualized speech recognition capability for the
pretrained LLM while keeping the same text-only input functionality.

<p class="mathjax">Gaussian processes are used in many machine learning applications that rely
on uncertainty quantification. Recently, computational tools for working with
these models in geometric settings, such as when inputs lie on a Riemannian
manifold, have been developed. This raises the question: can these intrinsic
models be shown theoretically to lead to better performance, compared to simply
embedding all relevant quantities into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and using the restriction
of an ordinary Euclidean Gaussian process? To study this, we prove optimal
contraction rates for intrinsic Mat\'ern Gaussian processes defined on compact
Riemannian manifolds. We also prove analogous rates for extrinsic processes
using trace and extension theorems between manifold and ambient Sobolev spaces:
somewhat surprisingly, the rates obtained turn out to coincide with those of
the intrinsic processes, provided that their smoothness parameters are matched
appropriately. We illustrate these rates empirically on a number of examples,
which, mirroring prior work, show that intrinsic processes can achieve better
performance in practice. Therefore, our work shows that finer-grained analyses
are needed to distinguish between different levels of data-efficiency of
geometric Gaussian processes, particularly in settings which involve small data
set sizes and non-asymptotic behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Discrete audio representation, aka audio tokenization, has seen renewed
interest driven by its potential to facilitate the application of text language
modeling approaches in audio domain. To this end, various compression and
representation-learning based tokenization schemes have been proposed. However,
there is limited investigation into the performance of compression-based audio
tokens compared to well-established mel-spectrogram features across various
speaker and speech related tasks. In this paper, we evaluate compression based
audio tokens on three tasks: Speaker Verification, Diarization and
(Multi-lingual) Speech Recognition. Our findings indicate that (i) the models
trained on audio tokens perform competitively, on average within $1\%$ of
mel-spectrogram features for all the tasks considered, and do not surpass them
yet. (ii) these models exhibit robustness for out-of-domain narrowband data,
particularly in speaker tasks. (iii) audio tokens allow for compression to 20x
compared to mel-spectrogram features with minimal loss of performance in speech
and speaker related tasks, which is crucial for low bit-rate applications, and
(iv) the examined Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) based audio tokenizer
exhibits a low-pass frequency response characteristic, offering a plausible
explanation for the observed results, and providing insight for future
tokenizer designs.

of its chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ (in $\mathbb{C}$) lie inside the disc
of radius $5.94 \Delta$ centered at $0$. This improves on the previously best
known bound of approximately $6.91\Delta$.
<br />We also obtain improved bounds for graphs of high girth. We prove that for
every $g$ there is a constant $K_g$ such that for any graph $G$ of maximum
degree at most $\Delta$ and girth at least $g$, the zeros of its chromatic
polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ lie inside the disc of radius $K_g \Delta$ centered at

particular, $K_g &lt; 5$ when $g \geq 5$ and $K_g &lt; 4$ when $g \geq 25$ and $K_g$
tends to approximately $3.86$ as $g \to \infty$.
<br />Key to the proof is a classical theorem of Whitney which allows us to relate
the chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$ to the generating function of so-called
broken-circuit-free forests in $G$. We also establish a zero-free disc for the
generating function of all forests in $G$ (aka the partition function of the
arboreal gas) which may be of independent interest.

algorithm designed to solve continuous-space mean field game (MFG) and mean
field control (MFC) problems in a unified manner. The proposed approach pairs
the actor-critic (AC) paradigm with a representation of the mean field
distribution via a parameterized score function, which can be efficiently
updated in an online fashion, and uses Langevin dynamics to obtain samples from
the resulting distribution. The AC agent and the score function are updated
iteratively to converge, either to the MFG equilibrium or the MFC optimum for a
given mean field problem, depending on the choice of learning rates. A
straightforward modification of the algorithm allows us to solve mixed mean
field control games (MFCGs). The performance of our algorithm is evaluated
using linear-quadratic benchmarks in the asymptotic infinite horizon framework.

which three different types of roofs were analyzed which are the flat, gable
and circular roof at different wind speed. The numerical analysis was performed
using FLUENT package based on values of k (turbulence kinetic energy) and
(dissipation rate of turbulence) based on partial differential equation. Also,
flat, and shallow escarpment terrains were considered during the simulation to
determine the coefficient of pressure at different wind speed for different
roof types. For the shallow escarpment terrain, a flat roof was considered at
different velocities and for the flat terrain, three different types of roofs
are considered which are the flat, gable and circular roof. It is observed that
as the wind speed increases, the coefficient of drag decreases. It also shows
the effect of vortex formed at the leeward direction of the building which
implies the higher the wind speed, the larger the vortex formed and the lower
the building ventilation and higher the damage on the roof of the building.
Based on the analysis, it is preferable to use a circular roof based on the
aerodynamic characteristics of wind around building walls and roofs.

<p class="mathjax">Differential privacy (DP) is the state-of-the-art framework for guaranteeing
privacy for individuals when releasing aggregated statistics or building
statistical/machine learning models from data. We develop the open-source R
package DPpack that provides a large toolkit of differentially private
analysis. The current version of DPpack implements three popular mechanisms for
ensuring DP: Laplace, Gaussian, and exponential. Beyond that, DPpack provides a
large toolkit of easily accessible privacy-preserving descriptive statistics
functions. These include mean, variance, covariance, and quantiles, as well as
histograms and contingency tables. Finally, DPpack provides user-friendly
implementation of privacy-preserving versions of logistic regression, SVM, and
linear regression, as well as differentially private hyperparameter tuning for
each of these models. This extensive collection of implemented differentially
private statistics and models permits hassle-free utilization of differential
privacy principles in commonly performed statistical analysis. We plan to
continue developing DPpack and make it more comprehensive by including more
differentially private machine learning techniques, statistical modeling and
inference in the future.

on developing models on certain datasets like IEMOCAP. The lack of data in the
domain of emotion modeling emerges as a challenge to evaluate models in the
other dataset, as well as to evaluate speech emotion recognition models that
work in a multilingual setting. This paper proposes an ensemble learning to
fuse results of pre-trained models for emotion share recognition from speech.
The models were chosen to accommodate multilingual data from English and
Spanish. The results show that ensemble learning can improve the performance of
the baseline model with a single model and the previous best model from the
late fusion. The performance is measured using the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient since the task is a regression problem with ranking values. A
Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.537 is reported for the test set,
while for the development set, the score is 0.524. These scores are higher than
the previous study of a fusion method from monolingual data, which achieved
scores of 0.476 for the test and 0.470 for the development.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate representation of tooth position is extremely important in
treatment. 3D dental image segmentation is a widely used method, however
labelled 3D dental datasets are a scarce resource, leading to the problem of
small samples that this task faces in many cases. To this end, we address this
problem with a pretrained SAM and propose a novel 3D-U-SAM network for 3D
dental image segmentation. Specifically, in order to solve the problem of using
2D pre-trained weights on 3D datasets, we adopted a convolution approximation
method; in order to retain more details, we designed skip connections to fuse
features at all levels with reference to U-Net. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated in ablation experiments, comparison
experiments, and sample size experiments.

<p class="mathjax">A central question for neuroscience is how to characterize brain
representations of perceptual and cognitive content. An ideal characterization
should distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise and
idiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computational
differences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by their
representational geometry, which is defined by the representational
dissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the roles
of individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes the
discriminability of stimuli. Here we explore a further step of abstraction:
from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We propose
topological representational similarity analysis (tRSA), an extension of
representational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses a family of
geo-topological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize the
topology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this new family of
statistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selection
using both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data. In the simulations, the
ground truth is a data-generating layer representation in a neural network
model and the models are the same and other layers in different model instances
(trained from different random seeds). In fMRI, the ground truth is a visual
area and the models are the same and other areas measured in different
subjects. Results show that topology-sensitive characterizations of population
codes are robust to noise and interindividual variability and maintain
excellent sensitivity to the unique representational signatures of different
neural network layers and brain regions.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies have increasingly acknowledged the advantages of incorporating
visual data into speech enhancement (SE) systems. In this paper, we introduce a
novel audio-visual SE approach, termed DCUC-Net (deep complex U-Net with
conformer network). The proposed DCUC-Net leverages complex domain features and
a stack of conformer blocks. The encoder and decoder of DCUC-Net are designed
using a complex U-Net-based framework. The audio and visual signals are
processed using a complex encoder and a ResNet-18 model, respectively. These
processed signals are then fused using the conformer blocks and transformed
into enhanced speech waveforms via a complex decoder. The conformer blocks
consist of a combination of self-attention mechanisms and convolutional
operations, enabling DCUC-Net to effectively capture both global and local
audio-visual dependencies. Our experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of DCUC-Net, as it outperforms the baseline model from the
COG-MHEAR AVSE Challenge 2023 by a notable margin of 0.14 in terms of PESQ.
Additionally, the proposed DCUC-Net performs comparably to a state-of-the-art
model and outperforms all other compared models on the Taiwan Mandarin speech
with video (TMSV) dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We propose and analyze the application of statistical functional depth
metrics for the selection of extreme scenarios in day-ahead grid planning. Our
primary motivation is screening of probabilistic scenarios for realized load
and renewable generation, in order to identify scenarios most relevant for
operational risk mitigation. To handle the high-dimensionality of the scenarios
across asset classes and intra-day periods, we employ functional measures of
depth to sub-select outlying scenarios that are most likely to be the riskiest
for the grid operation. We investigate a range of functional depth measures, as
well as a range of operational risks, including load shedding, operational
costs, reserves shortfall and variable renewable energy curtailment. The
effectiveness of the proposed screening approach is demonstrated through a case
study on the realistic Texas-7k grid.

<p class="mathjax">DNA sequence alignment involves assigning short DNA reads to the most
probable locations on an extensive reference genome. This process is crucial
for various genomic analyses, including variant calling, transcriptomics, and
epigenomics. Conventional methods, refined over decades, tackle this challenge
in two steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likely
positions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models
(LLM) in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric captures
semantic similarity, recent efforts have explored whether the same Transformer
architecture can produce numerical representations for DNA sequences. Such
models have shown early promise in tasks involving classification of short DNA
sequences, such as the detection of coding vs non-coding regions, as well as
the identification of enhancer and promoter sequences. Performance at sequence
classification tasks does not, however, translate to sequence alignment, where
it is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to successfully align every
read. We address this open problem by framing it as an Embed-Search-Align task.
In this framework, a novel encoder model DNA-ESA generates representations of
reads and fragments of the reference, which are projected into a shared vector
space where the read-fragment distance is used as surrogate for alignment. In
particular, DNA-ESA introduces: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervised
training of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich sequence-level
embeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on a
global scale. DNA-ESA is &gt;97% accurate when aligning 250-length reads onto a
human reference genome of 3 gigabases (single-haploid), far exceeds the
performance of 6 recent DNA-Transformer model baselines and shows task transfer
across chromosomes and species.

<p class="mathjax">Image-based systems have gained popularity owing to their capacity to provide
rich manufacturing status information, low implementation costs and high
acquisition rates. However, the complexity of the image background and various
anomaly patterns pose new challenges to existing matrix decomposition methods,
which are inadequate for modeling requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty of
the anomaly can cause anomaly contamination problems, making the designed model
and method highly susceptible to external disturbances. To address these
challenges, we propose a two-stage strategy anomaly detection method that
detects anomalies by identifying suspected patches (Ano-SuPs). Specifically, we
propose to detect the patches with anomalies by reconstructing the input image
twice: the first step is to obtain a set of normal patches by removing those
suspected patches, and the second step is to use those normal patches to refine
the identification of the patches with anomalies. To demonstrate its
effectiveness, we evaluate the proposed method systematically through
simulation experiments and case studies. We further identified the key
parameters and designed steps that impact the model's performance and
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we pose a hypothesis that the structure of communities in
complex networks may result from their latent fractal properties. This
hypothesis is based not only on the general observation that many real networks
have multilevel organization, which is reminiscent of the geometric
self-similarity of classical fractals. Quantitative arguments supporting this
hypothesis are: first, many non-fractal real complex networks that have a
well-defined community structure reveal fractal properties when suitably
diluted; second, the scale-free community size distributions observed in many
real networks directly relate to scale-invariant box mass distributions, which
have recently been described as a fundamental feature of fractal complex
networks. We test this hypothesis in a general model of evolving network with
community structure that exhibits dual scale invariance: at the level of node
degrees and community sizes, respectively. We show that, at least in this
model, the proposed hypothesis cannot be rejected. The argument for this is
that a kind of fractal core can be identified in the networks studied, which
appears as a macroscopic connected component when the edges between modules
identified by the community detection algorithm are removed in a supervised
manner.

<p class="mathjax">By integrating recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and generative
models into the emerging semantic communication (SC) paradigm, in this article
we put forward to a novel framework of language-oriented semantic communication
(LSC). In LSC, machines communicate using human language messages that can be
interpreted and manipulated via natural language processing (NLP) techniques
for SC efficiency. To demonstrate LSC's potential, we introduce three
innovative algorithms: 1) semantic source coding (SSC) which compresses a text
prompt into its key head words capturing the prompt's syntactic essence while
maintaining their appearance order to keep the prompt's context; 2) semantic
channel coding (SCC) that improves robustness against errors by substituting
head words with their lenghthier synonyms; and 3) semantic knowledge
distillation (SKD) that produces listener-customized prompts via in-context
learning the listener's language style. In a communication task for progressive
text-to-image generation, the proposed methods achieve higher perceptual
similarities with fewer transmissions while enhancing robustness in noisy
communication channels.

<p class="mathjax">U-Net and its variants have been widely used in medical image segmentation.
However, most current U-Net variants confine their improvement strategies to
building more complex encoder, while leaving the decoder unchanged or adopting
a simple symmetric structure. These approaches overlook the true functionality
of the decoder: receiving low-resolution feature maps from the encoder and
restoring feature map resolution and lost information through upsampling. As a
result, the decoder, especially its upsampling component, plays a crucial role
in enhancing segmentation outcomes. However, in 3D medical image segmentation,
the commonly used transposed convolution can result in visual artifacts. This
issue stems from the absence of direct relationship between adjacent pixels in
the output feature map. Furthermore, plain encoder has already possessed
sufficient feature extraction capability because downsampling operation leads
to the gradual expansion of the receptive field, but the loss of information
during downsampling process is unignorable. To address the gap in relevant
research, we extend our focus beyond the encoder and introduce neU-Net (i.e.,
not complex encoder U-Net), which incorporates a novel Sub-pixel Convolution
for upsampling to construct a powerful decoder. Additionally, we introduce
multi-scale wavelet inputs module on the encoder side to provide additional
information. Our model design achieves excellent results, surpassing other
state-of-the-art methods on both the Synapse and ACDC datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet
interaction with these models is mostly facilitated through text. Using
Text-To-Speech to synthesize LLM outputs typically results in notable latency,
which is impractical for fluent voice conversations. We propose LLM2Speech, an
architecture to synthesize speech while text is being generated by an LLM which
yields significant latency reduction. LLM2Speech mimics the predictions of a
non-streaming teacher model while limiting the exposure to future context in
order to enable streaming. It exploits the hidden embeddings of the LLM, a
by-product of the text generation that contains informative semantic context.
Experimental results show that LLM2Speech maintains the teacher's quality while
reducing the latency to enable natural conversations.

<p class="mathjax">We study how the complexity of the graph colouring problems star colouring
and restricted star colouring vary with the maximum degree of the graph.
Restricted star colouring (in short, rs colouring) is a variant of star
colouring. For $k\in \mathbb{N}$, a $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a function
$f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{Z}_k$ such that $f(u)\neq f(v)$ for every edge $uv$ of
$G$. A $k$-colouring of $G$ is called a $k$-star colouring of $G$ if there is
no path $u,v,w,x$ in $G$ with $f(u)=f(w)$ and $f(v)=f(x)$. A $k$-colouring of
$G$ is called a $k$-rs colouring of $G$ if there is no path $u,v,w$ in $G$ with
$f(v)&gt;f(u)=f(w)$. For $k\in \mathbb{N}$, the problem $k$-STAR COLOURABILITY
takes a graph $G$ as input and asks whether $G$ admits a $k$-star colouring.
The problem $k$-RS COLOURABILITY is defined similarly. Recently, Brause et al.
(Electron. J. Comb., 2022) investigated the complexity of 3-star colouring with
respect to the graph diameter. We study the complexity of $k$-star colouring
and $k$-rs colouring with respect to the maximum degree for all $k\geq 3$. For
$k\geq 3$, let us denote the least integer $d$ such that $k$-STAR COLOURABILITY
(resp. $k$-RS COLOURABILITY) is NP-complete for graphs of maximum degree $d$ by
$L_s^{(k)}$ (resp. $L_{rs}^{(k)}$).
<br />We prove that for $k=5$ and $k\geq 7$, $k$-STAR COLOURABILITY is NP-complete
for graphs of maximum degree $k-1$. We also show that $4$-RS COLOURABILITY is
NP-complete for planar 3-regular graphs of girth 5 and $k$-RS COLOURABILITY is
NP-complete for triangle-free graphs of maximum degree $k-1$ for $k\geq 5$.
Using these results, we prove the following: (i) for $k\geq 4$ and $d\leq k-1$,
$k$-STAR COLOURABILITY is NP-complete for $d$-regular graphs if and only if
$d\geq L_s^{(k)}$; and (ii) for $k\geq 4$, $k$-RS COLOURABILITY is NP-complete
for $d$-regular graphs if and only if $L_{rs}^{(k)}\leq d\leq k-1$.

<p class="mathjax">We consider speech enhancement for signals picked up in one noisy environment
that must be rendered to a listener in another noisy environment. For both
far-end noise reduction and near-end listening enhancement, it has been shown
that excessive focus on noise suppression or intelligibility maximization may
lead to excessive speech distortions and quality degradations in favorable
noise conditions, where intelligibility is already at ceiling level. Recently
[1,2] propose to remedy this with a minimum processing framework that either
reduces noise or enhances listening a minimum amount given that a certain
intelligibility criterion is still satisfied. Additionally, it has been shown
that joint consideration of both environments improves speech enhancement
performance. In this paper, we formulate a joint far- and near-end minimum
processing framework, that improves intelligibility while limiting speech
distortions in favorable noise conditions. We provide closed-form solutions to
specific boundary scenarios and investigate performance for the general case
using numerical optimization. We also show that concatenating existing minimum
processing far- and near-end enhancement methods preserves the effects of the
initial methods. Results show that the joint optimization can further improve
performance compared to the concatenated approach.

<p class="mathjax">Crafting an effective Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) solution for
dialects demands innovative approaches that not only address the data scarcity
issue but also navigate the intricacies of linguistic diversity. In this paper,
we address the aforementioned ASR challenge, focusing on the Tunisian dialect.
First, textual and audio data is collected and in some cases annotated. Second,
we explore self-supervision, semi-supervision and few-shot code-switching
approaches to push the state-of-the-art on different Tunisian test sets;
covering different acoustic, linguistic and prosodic conditions. Finally, and
given the absence of conventional spelling, we produce a human evaluation of
our transcripts to avoid the noise coming from spelling inadequacies in our
testing references. Our models, allowing to transcribe audio samples in a
linguistic mix involving Tunisian Arabic, English and French, and all the data
used during training and testing are released for public use and further
improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Primal-dual algorithms are frequently used for iteratively solving
large-scale convex optimization problems. The analysis of such algorithms is
usually done on a case-by-case basis, and the resulting guaranteed rates of
convergence can be conservative. Here we consider a class of first-order
algorithms for linearly constrained convex optimization problems, and provide a
linear matrix inequality (LMI) analysis framework for certifying worst-case
exponential convergence rates. Our approach builds on recent results for
interpolation of convex functions and linear operators, and our LMI directly
constructs a Lyapunov function certifying the guaranteed convergence rate. By
comparing to rates established in the literature, we show that our approach can
certify significantly faster convergence for this family of algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms are widely used to solve
difficult or large-scale optimization problems. There are many algorithms to
choose from, such as gradient descent and its accelerated variants such as
Polyak's Heavy Ball method or Nesterov's Fast Gradient method. It has long been
observed that iterative algorithms can be viewed as dynamical systems, and more
recently, as robust controllers. Here, the "uncertainty" in the dynamics is the
gradient of the function being optimized. Therefore, worst-case or average-case
performance can be analyzed using tools from robust control theory, such as
integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). In this tutorial paper, we show how such
an analysis can be carried out using an alternative Lyapunov-based approach.
This approach recovers the same performance bounds as with IQCs, but with the
added benefit of constructing a Lyapunov function.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, long short term memory
(LSTM), one kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), has been widely applied in
time series prediction.
<br />Like RNN, Transformer is designed to handle the sequential data. As
Transformer achieved great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
researchers got interested in Transformer's performance on time series
prediction, and plenty of Transformer-based solutions on long time series
forecasting have come out recently. However, when it comes to financial time
series prediction, LSTM is still a dominant architecture. Therefore, the
question this study wants to answer is: whether the Transformer-based model can
be applied in financial time series prediction and beat LSTM.
<br />To answer this question, various LSTM-based and Transformer-based models are
compared on multiple financial prediction tasks based on high-frequency limit
order book data. A new LSTM-based model called DLSTM is built and new
architecture for the Transformer-based model is designed to adapt for financial
prediction. The experiment result reflects that the Transformer-based model
only has the limited advantage in absolute price sequence prediction. The
LSTM-based models show better and more robust performance on difference
sequence prediction, such as price difference and price movement.

<p class="mathjax">Compressive focal plane arrays (FPA) enable cost-effective high-resolution
(HR) imaging by acquisition of several multiplexed measurements on a
low-resolution (LR) sensor. Multiplexed encoding of the visual scene is
typically performed via electronically controllable spatial light modulators
(SLM). An HR image is then reconstructed from the encoded measurements by
solving an inverse problem that involves the forward model of the imaging
system. To capture system non-idealities such as optical aberrations, a
mainstream approach is to conduct an offline calibration scan to measure the
system response for a point source at each spatial location on the imaging
grid. However, it is challenging to run calibration scans when using structured
SLMs as they cannot encode individual grid locations. In this study, we propose
a novel compressive FPA system based on online deep-learning calibration of
multiplexed LR measurements (CalibFPA). We introduce a piezo-stage that
locomotes a pre-printed fixed coded aperture. A deep neural network is then
leveraged to correct for the influences of system non-idealities in multiplexed
measurements without the need for offline calibration scans. Finally, a deep
plug-and-play algorithm is used to reconstruct images from corrected
measurements. On simulated and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that
CalibFPA outperforms state-of-the-art compressive FPA methods. We also report
analyses to validate the design elements in CalibFPA and assess computational
complexity.

<p class="mathjax">We make two contributions to the Isolation Forest method for anomaly and
outlier detection. The first contribution is an information-theoretically
motivated generalisation of the score function that is used to aggregate the
scores across random tree estimators. This generalisation allows one to take
into account not just the ensemble average across trees but instead the whole
distribution. The second contribution is an alternative scoring function at the
level of the individual tree estimator, in which we replace the depth-based
scoring of the Isolation Forest with one based on hyper-volumes associated to
an isolation tree's leaf nodes.
<br />We motivate the use of both of these methods on generated data and also
evaluate them on 34 datasets from the recent and exhaustive ``ADBench''
benchmark, finding significant improvement over the standard isolation forest
for both variants on some datasets and improvement on average across all
datasets for one of the two variants. The code to reproduce our results is made

<p class="mathjax">Solving linear systems is of great importance in numerous fields. In
particular, circulant systems are especially valuable for efficiently finding
numerical solutions to physics-related differential equations. Current quantum
algorithms like HHL or variational methods are either resource-intensive or may
fail to find a solution. We present an efficient algorithm based on convex
optimization of combinations of quantum states to solve for banded circulant
linear systems whose non-zero terms are within distance $K$ of the main
diagonal. By decomposing banded circulant matrices into cyclic permutations,
our approach produces approximate solutions to such systems with a combination
of quantum states linear to $K$, significantly improving over previous
convergence guarantees, which require quantum states exponential to $K$. We
propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm using the Hadamard test and the
quantum Fourier transform as subroutines and show its PromiseBQP-hardness.
Additionally, we introduce a quantum-inspired algorithm with similar
performance given sample and query access. We validate our methods with
classical simulations and actual IBM quantum computer implementation,
showcasing their applicability for solving physical problems such as heat
transfer.

<p class="mathjax">In root finding and optimization, there are many cases where there is a
closed set $A$ one does not the sequence constructed by one's favourite method
will converge to A (here, we do not assume extra properties on $A$ such as
being convex or connected). For example, if one wants to find roots, and one
chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a fact
which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that root.
In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point $z^*$ in
the next runs of one's algorithm.
<br />In this paper, we propose a new method aiming to achieve this: we divide the
cost function by an appropriate power of the distance function to $A$. This
idea is inspired by how one would try to find all roots of a function in 1
variable. We first explain the heuristic for this method in the case where the
minimum of the cost function is exactly 0, and then explain how to proceed if
the minimum is non-zero (allowing both positive and negative values). The
method is very suitable for iterative algorithms which have the descent
property. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to escape the basin of
attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach another component.
<br />Along the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current
literature. We provide several examples to illustrate the usefulness of the new
approach.
