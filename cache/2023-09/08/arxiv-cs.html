<p class="mathjax">The web is the most prominent application platform globally, thanks to its
vast user base. It started as a site platform in the 90s and morphed into an
application one over time as interactive web applications became a reality.
So-called single-page applications (SPAs) represent the current mainstream way
of developing web applications but they come with their drawbacks. Although
SPAs provide good developer experience, there is a cost for the users due to
the underlying technical assumptions. Disappearing frameworks question these
assumptions and provide a fresh start. The purpose of this short book is to
give a quick introduction to disappearing frameworks and show their meaning as
an emerging topic within the space of web application development.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been a surging demand for edge computing of image
processing and machine learning workloads. This has reignited interest in the
development of custom hardware accelerators that can deliver enhanced
performance and improved energy efficiency. These workloads frequently
demonstrate affine memory accesses and constant loop bounds. In this paper, we
introduce an ILP-based automatic scheduler for high-level synthesis, with a
specific emphasis on aggressive pipelining to enhance parallelism. In this
study, we propose a unified Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that
can identify pipelining opportunities along multiple loop and scalar
dimensions. Our multi-dimensional pipelining technique encompasses both inner
loop pipelining and dataflow optimizations of Vitis HLS, while also being
capable of handling more general memory access patterns compared to the
dataflow optimization in Vitis HLS. Furthermore, our approach enables the
generation of statically scheduled circuits, leading to improved resource
efficiency. We have integrated our scheduler into a high-level synthesis
compiler framework (HIR) based on MLIR and conducted performance evaluations.
Our findings reveal that our scheduler, in comparison to Vitis HLS, can achieve
more aggressive pipelining across multiple producer-consumer loop nests,
resulting in reduced overall execution latency. The producer-consumer pipelined
execution facilitated by our scheduler yields an average performance
improvement of 2.42X across a set of representative benchmarks when compared to
only loop pipelining. Furthermore, we achieved an average performance
improvement of 1.30X over Vitis HLS with dataflow optimizations.

<p class="mathjax">Security and energy-efficiency are critical for computing applications in
general and for edge applications in particular. Digital in-Memory Computing
(IMC) in SRAM cells have widely been studied to accelerate inference tasks to
maximize both throughput and energy efficiency for intelligent computing at the
edge. XOR operations have been of particular interest due to their wide
applicability in numerous applications that include binary neural networks and
encryption. However, existing IMC circuits for XOR acceleration are limited to
two rows in a memory array and extending the XOR parallelism to multiple rows
in an SRAM array has remained elusive. Further, SRAM is prone to both data
imprinting and data remanence security issues, which poses limitations on
security . Based on commerical Globalfoundries 22nm mode, we are proposing a
novel 9T SRAM cell such that multiple rows of data (entire array) can be XORed
in a massively parallel single cycle fashion. The new cell also supports
data-toggling within the SRAM cell efficiently to circumvent imprinting attacks
and erase the SRAM value in case of remanence attack.

<p class="mathjax">Logic Synthesis (LS) plays a vital role in chip design -- a cornerstone of
the semiconductor industry. A key task in LS is to transform circuits --
modeled by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) -- into simplified circuits with
equivalent functionalities. To tackle this task, many LS operators apply
transformations to subgraphs -- rooted at each node on an input DAG --
sequentially. However, we found that a large number of transformations are
ineffective, which makes applying these operators highly time-consuming. In
particular, we notice that the runtime of the Resub and Mfs2 operators often
dominates the overall runtime of LS optimization processes. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel data-driven LS operator paradigm, namely PruneX,
to reduce ineffective transformations. The major challenge of developing PruneX
is to learn models that well generalize to unseen circuits, i.e., the
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem. Thus, the major technical
contribution of PruneX is the novel circuit domain generalization framework,
which learns domain-invariant representations based on the
transformation-invariant domain-knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, PruneX
is the first approach to tackle the OOD problem in LS operators. We integrate
PruneX with the aforementioned Resub and Mfs2 operators. Experiments
demonstrate that PruneX significantly improves their efficiency while keeping
comparable optimization performance on industrial and very large-scale
circuits, achieving up to $3.1\times$ faster runtime.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct pathway from the brain to
external devices and have demonstrated great potential for assistive and
rehabilitation technologies. Endogenous BCIs based on electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals, such as motor imagery (MI) BCIs, can provide some level of
control. However, mastering spontaneous BCI control requires the users to
generate discriminative and stable brain signal patterns by imagery, which is
challenging and is usually achieved over a very long training time
(weeks/months). Here, we propose a human-machine joint learning framework to
boost the learning process in endogenous BCIs, by guiding the user to generate
brain signals towards an optimal distribution estimated by the decoder, given
the historical brain signals of the user. To this end, we firstly model the
human-machine joint learning process in a uniform formulation. Then a
human-machine joint learning framework is proposed: 1) for the human side, we
model the learning process in a sequential trial-and-error scenario and propose
a novel ``copy/new'' feedback paradigm to help shape the signal generation of
the subject toward the optimal distribution; 2) for the machine side, we
propose a novel adaptive learning algorithm to learn an optimal signal
distribution along with the subject's learning process. Specifically, the
decoder reweighs the brain signals generated by the subject to focus more on
``good'' samples to cope with the learning process of the subject. Online and
psuedo-online BCI experiments with 18 healthy subjects demonstrated the
advantages of the proposed joint learning process over co-adaptive approaches
in both learning efficiency and effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">A consensus report produced for the Air Force Research Laboratory by the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics documented a
prevalent and increasing desire to support human-Artificial Intelligence (AI)
teaming across military service branches. Sonalysts has begun an internal
initiative to explore the training of human-AI teams. The first step in this
effort is to develop a Synthetic Task Environment (STE) that is capable of
facilitating research on human-AI teams. We decided to use Joint All-Domain
Command and Control (JADC2) as a focus point for developing the STE because the
volume of sensor inputs and decision options within the JADC2 concept likely
requires the use of AI systems to enable timely decisions. Given this focus, we
engaged a number of Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) with Command and Control
experience to gain insight into developing a STE that embodied the teaming
challenges associated with JADC2. This report documents our initial engagement
with those stakeholders. The research team identified thirteen Sonalysts
employees with military backgrounds and Command and Control experience, and
invited them to participate. Twelve respondents completed the survey. The team
then analyzed the responses to identify themes that emerged and topics that
would benefit from further analysis. The results indicated that our SMEs were
amenable to research using tasks that were analogous to those encountered in
military environments, as long as they required teams to process a great deal
of incoming data to arrive at complex decisions. The SMEs felt that the testbed
should support 'teams of teams" that represented a matrixed organization, and
that it should support a robust array to spoken, text-based, and face-to-face
communications.

<p class="mathjax">A consensus report produced for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) by
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics documented a

offers a task environment that could support the breadth of research that
stakeholders plan to perform within this domain. As a result, we wanted to
sample the priorities of the relevant research community broadly, and the
effort documented in this report is our initial attempt to do so. We created a
survey that featured two types of questions. The first asked respondents to
report their agreement with STE features that we anticipated might be
important. The second represented open-ended questions that asked respondents
to specify their priorities within several dimensions of the anticipated STE.
The research team invited nineteen researchers from academic and Government
labs to participate, and 11 were able to complete the survey. The team analyzed
their responses to identify themes that emerged and topics that would benefit
from further analysis. The most significant finding of the survey was that a
number of researchers felt that various open-source STEs that would meet our
needs already exist. Researchers also emphasized the need for automated
transcription and coding tools to ease the burden of assessing inter-team
communications; the importance of robust data capture and export capabilities;
and the desirability of extensive flexibility across many aspects of the tool.

<p class="mathjax">Sonalysts is working on an initiative to expand our current expertise in
teaming to Human-Artificial Intelligence (AI) teams by developing original
research in this area. To provide a foundation for that research, Sonalysts is
investigating the development of a Synthetic Task Environment (STE). In a
previous report, we documented the findings of a recent outreach effort in
which we asked military Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and other researchers in
the Human-AI teaming domain to identify the qualities that they most valued in
a testbed. A surprising finding from that outreach was that several respondents
recommended that our team look into existing human-AI teaming testbeds, rather
than creating something new. Based on that recommendation, we conducted a
systematic investigation of the associated landscape. In this report, we
describe the results of that investigation. Building on the survey results, we
developed testbed evaluation criteria, identified potential testbeds, and
conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations of candidate testbeds. The
evaluation process led to five candidate testbeds for the research team to
consider. In the coming months, we will assess the viability of the various
alternatives and begin to execute our program of research.

<p class="mathjax">The academic community has made outstanding achievements in researching the
March algorithm. However, the current fault modeling method, which centers on
fault primitives, cannot be directly applied to analyzing the March algorithm.
This paper proposes a new test primitive. The test primitives, which decouple
the cell states from sensitization and detection operations, describe the
common features that must be possessed for the March algorithm to detect
corresponding faults, forming a highly flexible and scalable March algorithm
analysis unit. The theoretical analysis proves that the test primitives
demonstrate completeness, uniqueness, and conciseness. On this foundation, the
utilization of test primitives within the March analysis procedure is
elucidated.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic sign detection is a critical task in the operation of Autonomous
Vehicles (AV), as it ensures the safety of all road users. Current DNN-based
sign classification systems rely on pixel-level features to detect traffic
signs and can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. These attacks involve
small, imperceptible changes to a sign that can cause traditional classifiers
to misidentify the sign. We propose an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) based
approach for stop sign detection in AVs to address this issue. This method
utilises high-level features of a sign, such as its shape, colour, and text, to
detect categories of traffic signs. This approach is more robust against
adversarial attacks, as it mimics human-like perception and is less susceptible
to the limitations of current DNN classifiers. We consider two adversarial
attacking methods to evaluate our approach: Robust Physical Perturbation (PR2)
and Adversarial Camouflage (AdvCam). These attacks are able to deceive DNN
classifiers, causing them to misidentify stop signs as other signs with high
confidence. The results show that the proposed ILP-based technique is able to
correctly identify all targeted stop signs, even in the presence of PR2 and
ADvCam attacks. The proposed learning method is also efficient as it requires
minimal training data. Moreover, it is fully explainable, making it possible to
debug AVs.

<p class="mathjax">Optical hyperspectral cameras capture the spectral reflectance of materials.
Since many materials behave as heterogeneous intimate mixtures with which each
photon interacts differently, the relationship between spectral reflectance and
material composition is very complex. Quantitative validation of spectral
unmixing algorithms requires high-quality ground truth fractional abundance
data, which are very difficult to obtain. In this work, we generated a
comprehensive laboratory ground truth dataset of intimately mixed mineral
powders. For this, five clay powders (Kaolin, Roof clay, Red clay, mixed clay,
and Calcium hydroxide) were mixed homogeneously to prepare 325 samples of 60
binary, 150 ternary, 100 quaternary, and 15 quinary mixtures. Thirteen
different hyperspectral sensors have been used to acquire the reflectance
spectra of these mixtures in the visible, near, short, mid, and long-wavelength
infrared regions (350-15385) nm. {\color{black} Overlaps in wavelength regions
due to the operational ranges of each sensor} and variations in acquisition
conditions {\color{black} resulted in} a large amount of spectral variability.
Ground truth composition is given by construction, but to verify that the
generated samples are sufficiently homogeneous, XRD and XRF elemental analysis
is performed. We believe these data will be beneficial for validating advanced
methods for nonlinear unmixing and material composition estimation, including
studying spectral variability and training supervised unmixing approaches. The
datasets can be downloaded from the following link:

<p class="mathjax">In the context of general rough sets, the act of combining two things to form
another is not straightforward. The situation is similar for other theories
that concern uncertainty and vagueness. Such acts can be endowed with
additional meaning that go beyond structural conjunction and disjunction as in
the theory of $*$-norms and associated implications over $L$-fuzzy sets. In the
present research, algebraic models of acts of combining things in generalized
rough sets over lattices with approximation operators (called rough convenience
lattices) is invented. The investigation is strongly motivated by the desire to
model skeptical or pessimistic, and optimistic or possibilistic aggregation in
human reasoning, and the choice of operations is constrained by the
perspective. Fundamental results on the weak negations and implications
afforded by the minimal models are proved. In addition, the model is suitable
for the study of discriminatory/toxic behavior in human reasoning, and of ML
algorithms learning such behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of
animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes
and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities
and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show
heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile,
the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target
nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry
significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding
model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various
types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified
representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph
that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various
animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature
information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally,
we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext
tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link
prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that
consist of state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is a new method for enabling large
human groups to hold real-time networked conversations using a technique
modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms. Through the novel use of
conversational agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), the CSI
structure simultaneously enables local dialog among small deliberative groups
and global propagation of conversational content across a larger population. In
this way, CSI combines the benefits of small-group deliberative reasoning and
large-scale collective intelligence. In this pilot study, participants
deliberating in conversational swarms (via text chat) (a) produced 30% more
contributions (p&lt;0.05) than participants deliberating in a standard centralized
chat room and (b) demonstrated 7.2% less variance in contribution quantity.
These results indicate that users contributed more content and participated
more evenly when using the CSI structure.

<p class="mathjax">Low-power event-based analog front-ends (AFE) are a crucial component
required to build efficient end-to-end neuromorphic processing systems for edge
computing. Although several neuromorphic chips have been developed for
implementing spiking neural networks (SNNs) and solving a wide range of sensory
processing tasks, there are only a few general-purpose analog front-end devices
that can be used to convert analog sensory signals into spikes and interfaced
to neuromorphic processors. In this work, we present a novel, highly
configurable analog front-end chip, denoted as SPAIC (signal-to-spike converter
for analog AI computation), that offers a general-purpose dual-mode analog
signal-to-spike encoding with delta modulation and pulse frequency modulation,
with tunable frequency bands. The ASIC is designed in a 180 nm process. It
supports and encodes a wide variety of signals spanning 4 orders of magnitude
in frequency, and provides an event-based output that is compatible with
existing neuromorphic processors. We validated the ASIC for its functions and
present initial silicon measurement results characterizing the basic building
blocks of the chip.

<p class="mathjax">While Evidence Theory (Demster-Shafer Theory, Belief Functions Theory) is
being increasingly used in data fusion, its potentialities in the Social and
Life Sciences are often obscured by lack of awareness of its distinctive
features. With this paper we stress that Evidence Theory can express the
uncertainty deriving from the fear that events may materialize, that one has
not been able to figure out. By contrast, Probability Theory must limit itself
to the possibilities that a decision-maker is currently envisaging.
<br />Subsequently, we illustrate how Dempster-Shafer's combination rule relates to
Bayes' Theorem for various versions of Probability Theory and discuss which
applications of Information Theory can be enhanced by Evidence Theory. Finally,
we illustrate our claims with an example where Evidence Theory is used to make
sense of the partially overlapping, partially contradictory solutions that
appear in an auditing exercise.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most common things that a genealogist is tasked with is the
gathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person
interviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can
provide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the
ability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical
constraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the
interviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a
lower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this
study presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first
chatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores
the viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and
usability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a
chatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct
an interview may be longer than if the user had used ancestry.com or
participated in an in-person interview, the number of mistakes made and the
level of confusion from the user regarding the UI and process required is lower
than the other two methods. Note that the final metric regarding the user's
confusion is not applicable for the in-person interview sessions due to its
lack of a UI. With refinement, we believe this use of a chatbot could be a
valuable tool for genealogists, especially when dealing with interviewees who
are based in other countries where it is not possible to conduct an in-person
interview.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language understanding and
in-context learning abilities including natural language processing (NLP) tasks
and challenging mathematical reasoning. However, due to the lack of
process-supervision, applying PLMs to mathematical reasoning tasks often fail
to generate correct reasoning steps and final answer even though solutions have
high probabilities. To unleash the mathematical reasoning of finetuned-LLMs
without any further fineutuning steps, we propose a method to endow LLMs with
immediate reaction and delicate reasoning system via Monte Carlo Tree
Search(MCTS) and a light energy function to rank the decision steps. In
particular, We first re-formalize the finetuned-LLMs to a Residual-based Energy
Model~(Residual-EBM) and apply noise contrastive estimation to estimate the
parameters of energy function . Then we use MCTS with energy function as path
verifier to search the output space and evaluating the reasoning path. Through
extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k
and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our method that improve
the pass@1 of the finetuned-model without further finetuning or RLHF alignment
by a substantial margin.

<p class="mathjax">In program synthesis, an intelligent system takes in a set of user-generated
examples and returns a program that is logically consistent with these
examples. The usage of Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework has been successful
in building \emph{pragmatic} program synthesizers that return programs which --
in addition to being logically consistent -- account for the fact that a user
chooses their examples informatively. However, the computational burden of
running the RSA algorithm has restricted the application of pragmatic program
synthesis to domains with a small number of possible programs. This work
presents a novel method of amortizing the RSA algorithm by leveraging a
\emph{global pragmatic ranking} -- a single, total ordering of all the
hypotheses. We prove that for a pragmatic synthesizer that uses a single
demonstration, our global ranking method exactly replicates RSA's ranked
responses. We further empirically show that global rankings effectively
approximate the full pragmatic synthesizer in an online, multi-demonstration
setting. Experiments on two program synthesis domains using our pragmatic
ranking method resulted in orders of magnitudes of speed ups compared to the
RSA synthesizer, while outperforming the standard, non-pragmatic synthesizer.

<p class="mathjax">Drug repositioning-a promising strategy for discovering new therapeutic uses
for existing drugs-has been increasingly explored in the computational science
literature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of
drug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a
novel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as
pharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug
repositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific
evidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge
graph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes
derived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that
exhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in
the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed
biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information.
Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of
the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with
target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our
case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility,
while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge
the gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in
drug repositioning research.

<p class="mathjax">Any sports competition needs a timetable, specifying when and where teams
meet each other. The recent International Timetabling Competition (ITC2021) on
sports timetabling showed that, although it is possible to develop general
algorithms, the performance of each algorithm varies considerably over the
problem instances. This paper provides an instance space analysis for sports
timetabling, resulting in powerful insights into the strengths and weaknesses
of eight state-of-the-art algorithms. Based on machine learning techniques, we
propose an algorithm selection system that predicts which algorithm is likely
to perform best when given the characteristics of a sports timetabling problem
instance. Furthermore, we identify which characteristics are important in
making that prediction, providing insights in the performance of the
algorithms, and suggestions to further improve them. Finally, we assess the
empirical hardness of the instances. Our results are based on large
computational experiments involving about 50 years of CPU time on more than 500
newly generated problem instances.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding customer behavior in retail stores plays a crucial role in
improving customer satisfaction by adding personalized value to services.
Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction
of customers with a store items and other people, providing store managers with
insight into customer preferences. Several solutions aim to utilize this data
by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However,
current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets,
utilizing conventional methods to detect behaviors. They do not use deep
learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are powerful methods in
the field of computer vision. Furthermore, these methods provide limited
figures when visualizing the behavioral data acquired by the system. In this
study, we propose a framework that includes three primary parts: mathematical
modeling of customer behaviors, behavior analysis using an efficient deep
learning based system, and individual and group behavior visualization. Each
module and the entire system were validated using data from actual situations
in a retail store.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly significant
for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning
models. While saliency maps have stolen the show for the last few years in the
XAI field, their ability to reflect models' internal processes has been
questioned. Although less in the spotlight, example-based XAI methods have
continued to improve. It encompasses methods that use examples as explanations
for a machine learning model's predictions. This aligns with the psychological
mechanisms of human reasoning and makes example-based explanations natural and
intuitive for users to understand. Indeed, humans learn and reason by forming
mental representations of concepts based on examples.
<br />This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in natural
example-based XAI, describing the pros and cons of each approach. A "natural"
example simply means that it is directly drawn from the training data without
involving any generative process. The exclusion of methods that require
generating examples is justified by the need for plausibility which is in some
regards required to gain a user's trust. Consequently, this paper will explore
the following family of methods: similar examples, counterfactual and
semi-factual, influential instances, prototypes, and concepts. In particular,
it will compare their semantic definition, their cognitive impact, and added
values. We hope it will encourage and facilitate future work on natural
example-based XAI.

<p class="mathjax">We carefully evaluate a number of algorithms for learning in a federated
environment, and test their utility for a variety of image classification
tasks. We consider many issues that have not been adequately considered before:
whether learning over data sets that do not have diverse sets of images affects
the results; whether to use a pre-trained feature extraction "backbone"; how to
evaluate learner performance (we argue that classification accuracy is not
enough), among others. Overall, across a wide variety of settings, we find that
vertically decomposing a neural network seems to give the best results, and
outperforms more standard reconciliation-used methods.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition is a complex task due to the inherent subjectivity in
both the perception and production of emotions. The subjectivity of emotions
poses significant challenges in developing accurate and robust computational
models. This thesis examines critical facets of emotion recognition, beginning
with the collection of diverse datasets that account for psychological factors
in emotion production.
<br />To handle the challenge of non-representative training data, this work
collects the Multimodal Stressed Emotion dataset, which introduces controlled
stressors during data collection to better represent real-world influences on
emotion production. To address issues with label subjectivity, this research
comprehensively analyzes how data augmentation techniques and annotation
schemes impact emotion perception and annotator labels. It further handles
natural confounding variables and variations by employing adversarial networks
to isolate key factors like stress from learned emotion representations during
model training. For tackling concerns about leakage of sensitive demographic
variables, this work leverages adversarial learning to strip sensitive
demographic information from multimodal encodings. Additionally, it proposes
optimized sociological evaluation metrics aligned with cost-effective,
real-world needs for model testing.
<br />This research advances robust, practical emotion recognition through
multifaceted studies of challenges in datasets, labels, modeling, demographic
and membership variable encoding in representations, and evaluation. The
groundwork has been laid for cost-effective, generalizable emotion recognition
models that are less likely to encode sensitive demographic information.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
<br />To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Graph Generation (SGG) has achieved significant progress recently.
However, most previous works rely heavily on fixed-size entity representations
based on bounding box proposals, anchors, or learnable queries. As each
representation's cardinality has different trade-offs between performance and
computation overhead, extracting highly representative features efficiently and
dynamically is both challenging and crucial for SGG. In this work, a novel
architecture called RepSGG is proposed to address the aforementioned
challenges, formulating a subject as queries, an object as keys, and their
relationship as the maximum attention weight between pairwise queries and keys.
With more fine-grained and flexible representation power for entities and
relationships, RepSGG learns to sample semantically discriminative and
representative points for relationship inference. Moreover, the long-tailed
distribution also poses a significant challenge for generalization of SGG. A
run-time performance-guided logit adjustment (PGLA) strategy is proposed such
that the relationship logits are modified via affine transformations based on
run-time performance during training. This strategy encourages a more balanced
performance between dominant and rare classes. Experimental results show that
RepSGG achieves the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on the Visual
Genome and Open Images V6 datasets with fast inference speed, demonstrating the
efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methods.

to accurately perform arithmetic operations, particularly multiplication of &gt;8
digits, and operations involving decimals and fractions, without the use of
calculator tools. This paper aims to challenge this misconception. With
sufficient training data, a 2 billion-parameter language model can accurately
perform multi-digit arithmetic operations with almost 100% accuracy without
data leakage, significantly surpassing GPT-4 (whose multi-digit multiplication
accuracy is only 4.3%). We also demonstrate that our MathGLM, fine-tuned from
GLM-10B on a dataset with additional multi-step arithmetic operations and math
problems described in text, achieves similar performance to GPT-4 on a
5,000-samples Chinese math problem test set.

growing interest within the scientific community and among policy makers. Open
access indicators are being calculated. In its 2019 ranking, the ''Centre for
Science and Technology Studies'' (CWTS) provides the number and the share of OA
publications per institution. This gives an idea of the degree of openness of
institutions. However, not taking into account the disciplinary specificities
and the specialization of institutions makes comparisons based on the shares of
OA publications biased. We show that OA publishing practices vary considerably
according to discipline. As a result, we propose two methods to normalize OA

conditional access model when the memory available to the testing algorithm is
bounded. In both scenarios, the samples appear in an online fashion and the
goal is to test the properties of distribution using an optimal number of
samples subject to a memory constraint on how many samples can be stored at a
given time. First, we provide a trade-off between the sample complexity and the
space complexity for testing identity when the samples are drawn according to
the conditional access oracle. We then show that we can learn a succinct
representation of a monotone distribution efficiently with a memory constraint
on the number of samples that are stored that is almost optimal. We also show
that the algorithm for monotone distributions can be extended to a larger class

<p class="mathjax">The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients
by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical
labs, and hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated
cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays
the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related
statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT)
for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the
operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the
real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics
and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as
well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such
synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new
GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the
CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and
fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version.
EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer
messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate
EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score
are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL.
Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random
selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall
performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in
EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Video Object Segmentation (VOS) has emerged as a
complementary method to Video Object Tracking (VOT). VOS focuses on classifying
all the pixels around the target, allowing for precise shape labeling, while
VOT primarily focuses on the approximate region where the target might be.
However, traditional segmentation modules usually classify pixels frame by
frame, disregarding information between adjacent frames.
<br />In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that addresses this limitation by
analyzing the motion pattern using the inherent tensor structure. The tensor
structure, obtained through Tucker2 tensor decomposition, proves to be
effective in describing the target's motion. By incorporating this information,
we achieved competitive results on Four benchmarks LaSOT\cite{fan2019lasot},
AVisT\cite{noman2022avist}, OTB100\cite{7001050}, and
GOT-10k\cite{huang2019got} LaSOT\cite{fan2019lasot} with SOTA. Furthermore, the
proposed tracker is capable of real-time operation, adding value to its
practical application.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of traditional Knowledge Graph
(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural
Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent
perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history
temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from
history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths to
model historical path information related to queries on history temporal graph
for the reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not
only attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive
settings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence
through history temporal graphs.

<p class="mathjax">We study automated intrusion response for an IT infrastructure and formulate
the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed
stochastic game. To solve the game we follow an approach where attack and
defense strategies co-evolve through reinforcement learning and self-play
toward an equilibrium. Solutions proposed in previous work prove the
feasibility of this approach for small infrastructures but do not scale to
realistic scenarios due to the exponential growth in computational complexity
with the infrastructure size. We address this problem by introducing a method
that recursively decomposes the game into subgames which can be solved in
parallel. Applying optimal stopping theory we show that the best response
strategies in these subgames exhibit threshold structures, which allows us to
compute them efficiently. To solve the decomposed game we introduce an
algorithm called Decompositional Fictitious Self-Play (DFSP), which learns Nash
equilibria through stochastic approximation. We evaluate the learned strategies
in an emulation environment where real intrusions and response actions can be
executed. The results show that the learned strategies approximate an
equilibrium and that DFSP significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
algorithm for a realistic infrastructure configuration.

<p class="mathjax">Today, malware is one of the primary cyberthreats to organizations. Malware
has pervaded almost every type of computing device including the ones having
limited memory, battery and computation power such as mobile phones, tablets
and embedded devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Consequently, the
privacy and security of the malware infected systems and devices have been
heavily jeopardized. In recent years, researchers have leveraged machine
learning based strategies for malware detection and classification. Malware
analysis approaches can only be employed in resource constrained environments
if the methods are lightweight in nature. In this paper, we present MALITE, a
lightweight malware analysis system, that can classify various malware families
and distinguish between benign and malicious binaries. MALITE converts a binary
into a gray scale or an RGB image and employs low memory and battery power
consuming as well as computationally inexpensive malware analysis strategies.
We have designed MALITE-MN, a lightweight neural network based architecture and
MALITE-HRF, an ultra lightweight random forest based method that uses histogram
features extracted by a sliding window. We evaluate the performance of both on
six publicly available datasets (Malimg, Microsoft BIG, Dumpware10, MOTIF,
Drebin and CICAndMal2017), and compare them to four state-of-the-art malware
classification techniques. The results show that MALITE-MN and MALITE-HRF not
only accurately identify and classify malware but also respectively consume
several orders of magnitude lower resources (in terms of both memory as well as
computation capabilities), making them much more suitable for resource
constrained environments.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the widespread use of smartphones with high-quality digital cameras
and easy access to a wide range of software apps for recording, editing, and
sharing videos and images, as well as the deep learning AI platforms, a new
phenomenon of 'faking' videos has emerged. Deepfake algorithms can create fake
images and videos that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic ones.
Therefore, technologies that can detect and assess the integrity of digital
visual media are crucial. Deepfakes, also known as deep learning-based fake
videos, have become a major concern in recent years due to their ability to
manipulate and alter images and videos in a way that is virtually
indistinguishable from the original. These deepfake videos can be used for
malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation, impersonating individuals,
and creating fake news. Deepfake detection technologies use various approaches
such as facial recognition, motion analysis, and audio-visual synchronization
to identify and flag fake videos. However, the rapid advancement of deepfake
technologies has made it increasingly difficult to detect these videos with
high accuracy. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the
current state of deepfake creation and detection technologies. We examine the
various deep learning-based approaches used for creating deepfakes, as well as
the techniques used for detecting them. Additionally, we analyze the
limitations and challenges of current deepfake detection methods and discuss
future research directions in this field. Overall, the paper highlights the
importance of continued research and development in deepfake detection
technologies in order to combat the negative impact of deepfakes on society and
ensure the integrity of digital visual media.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a new symbolic corpus of musical themes from the complete
Star Wars trilogies (Episodes I-IX) by John Williams. The corpus files are made
available in multiple formats (.krn, .sib, and .musicxml) and include melodic,
harmonic, and formal information. The Star Wars Thematic Corpus (SWTC) contains
a total of 64 distinctive, recurring, and symbolically meaningful themes and
motifs, commonly referred to as leitmotifs. Through this corpus we also
introduce a new humdrum standard for non-functional harmony encodings, **harte,
based on Harte (2005, 2010). This report details the motivation, describes the
transcription and encoding processes, and provides some brief summary
statistics. While relatively small in scale, the SWTC represents a unified
collection from one of the most prolific and influential composers of the 20th
century, and the under-studied subset of film and multimedia musical material
in general. We hope the SWTC will provide insights into John Williams'
compositional style, as well as prove useful in comparisons against other
thematic corpora from film and beyond.

<p class="mathjax">Electronic invoicing is another area where blockchain technology is being
used. Additionally, it has the power to alter how payments are made, invoices
are issued, and transactions are validated. Using a blockchain-based invoicing
system will enable smooth payments from a customer's digital wallet to a
business's digital wallet. Transactions are simple to track and monitor, and
the blockchain may be used to retrieve an exchange's full history. Sometimes
shopkeepers create fake bills and submit them to the higher tax-paying
authorities. To bring transparency to this billing system between customers,
shopkeepers, and tax-paying authorities billing system using blockchain is to
be implemented using the concept of Blockchain and make the billing system in
our country work smoothly. Blockchain technology can revolutionize the
invoicing and payment process by providing a secure, transparent and
tamper-proof system. A blockchain-based billing system can facilitate smooth
payments, allow for easy tracking and monitoring of transactions, and provide a
tamper-proof history of all exchanges. The use of blockchain can prevent fraud
and increase transparency among customers, shopkeepers, and tax-paying
authorities. Furthermore, it can streamline the process by using digital
wallets for both customers and businesses, reducing time and resources for
traditional invoicing methods. Overall, blockchain technology can bring greater
efficiency and trust to the billing system, benefiting all parties involved. It
can prevent fraud, increase transparency and streamline the invoicing and
payment process. This technology can create a more secure and efficient billing

<p class="mathjax">Visualizing spatial structures in 3D ensembles is challenging due to the vast
amounts of information that need to be conveyed. Memory and time constraints
make it unfeasible to pre-compute and store the correlations between all pairs
of domain points. We propose the embedding of adaptive correlation sampling
into chord diagrams with hierarchical edge bundling to alleviate these
constraints. Entities representing spatial regions are arranged along the
circular chord layout via a space-filling curve, and Bayesian optimal sampling
is used to efficiently estimate the maximum occurring correlation between any
two points from different regions. Hierarchical edge bundling reduces visual
clutter and emphasizes the major correlation structures. By selecting an edge,
the user triggers a focus diagram in which only the two regions connected via
this edge are refined and arranged in a specific way in a second chord layout.
For visualizing correlations between two different variables, which are not
symmetric anymore, we switch to showing a full correlation matrix. This avoids
drawing the same edges twice with different correlation values. We introduce
GPU implementations of both linear and non-linear correlation measures to
further reduce the time that is required to generate the context and focus
views, and to even enable the analysis of correlations in a 1000-member
ensemble.

<p class="mathjax">We present a deep-dive into a real-world robotic learning system that, in
previous work, was shown to be capable of hundreds of table tennis rallies with
a human and has the ability to precisely return the ball to desired targets.
This system puts together a highly optimized perception subsystem, a high-speed
low-latency robot controller, a simulation paradigm that can prevent damage in
the real world and also train policies for zero-shot transfer, and automated
real world environment resets that enable autonomous training and evaluation on
physical robots. We complement a complete system description, including
numerous design decisions that are typically not widely disseminated, with a
collection of studies that clarify the importance of mitigating various sources
of latency, accounting for training and deployment distribution shifts,
robustness of the perception system, sensitivity to policy hyper-parameters,
and choice of action space. A video demonstrating the components of the system
and details of experimental results can be found at

<p class="mathjax">This study considers a novel full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) system using hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture,
which allows for simultaneous uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission over
the same frequency band. Particularly, our objective is to mitigate the strong
self-interference (SI) solely on the design of UL and DL RF beamforming stages
jointly with sub-array selection (SAS) for transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
sub-arrays at base station (BS). Based on the measured SI channel in an
anechoic chamber, we propose a min-SI beamforming scheme with SAS, which
applies perturbations to the beam directivity to enhance SI suppression in UL
and DL beam directions. To solve this challenging nonconvex optimization
problem, we propose a swarm intelligence-based algorithmic solution to find the
optimal perturbations as well as the Tx and Rx sub-arrays to minimize SI
subject to the directivity degradation constraints for the UL and DL beams. The
results show that the proposed min-SI BF scheme can achieve SI suppression as
high as 78 dB in FD mMIMO systems.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel approach to performing fitness approximation in genetic
algorithms (GAs) using machine-learning (ML) models, focusing on evolutionary
agents in Gymnasium (game) simulators -- where fitness computation is costly.
Maintaining a dataset of sampled individuals along with their actual fitness
scores, we continually update throughout an evolutionary run a
fitness-approximation ML model. We compare different methods for: 1) switching
between actual and approximate fitness, 2) sampling the population, and 3)
weighting the samples. Experimental findings demonstrate significant
improvement in evolutionary runtimes, with fitness scores that are either
identical or slightly lower than that of the fully run GA -- depending on the
ratio of approximate-to-actual-fitness computation. Our approach is generic and
can be easily applied to many different domains.

<p class="mathjax">Dexterous manipulation tasks involving contact-rich interactions pose a
significant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation
learning algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered
robotic hands to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance
non-prehensile forces, and control large degrees of freedom. Reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and
capacity to autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its
real-world application is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large
number of samples, reset the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this
work, we introduce an efficient system for learning dexterous manipulation
skills with RL to alleviate these challenges. The main idea of our approach is
the integration of recent advances in sample-efficient RL and replay buffer
bootstrapping. This combination allows us to utilize data from different tasks
or objects as a starting point for training new tasks, significantly improving
learning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes the real-world training
cycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based pickup policy as
well as learned reward functions, eliminating the need for manual resets and
reward engineering. We demonstrate the benefits of reusing past data as replay
buffer initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisition of
intricate manipulation skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic
hand. (Videos: https://sites.google.com/view/reboot-dexterous)

we introduce a metric which automatically identifies the shortcomings of an
audio caption by detecting the misses and false alarms in a candidate caption

<p class="mathjax">Efficient polyp segmentation in healthcare plays a critical role in enabling
early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, the segmentation of polyps
presents numerous challenges, including the intricate distribution of
backgrounds, variations in polyp sizes and shapes, and indistinct boundaries.
Defining the boundary between the foreground (i.e. polyp itself) and the
background (surrounding tissue) is difficult. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose Multi-Scale Edge-Guided Attention Network (MEGANet) tailored
specifically for polyp segmentation within colonoscopy images. This network
draws inspiration from the fusion of a classical edge detection technique with
an attention mechanism. By combining these techniques, MEGANet effectively
preserves high-frequency information, notably edges and boundaries, which tend
to erode as neural networks deepen. MEGANet is designed as an end-to-end
framework, encompassing three key modules: an encoder, which is responsible for
capturing and abstracting the features from the input image, a decoder, which
focuses on salient features, and the Edge-Guided Attention module (EGA) that
employs the Laplacian Operator to accentuate polyp boundaries. Extensive
experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, on five benchmark datasets,
demonstrate that our EGANet outperforms other existing SOTA methods under six
evaluation metrics. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Patients undergoing chest X-rays (CXR) often endure multiple lung diseases.
When evaluating a patient's condition, due to the complex pathologies, subtle
texture changes of different lung lesions in images, and patient condition
differences, radiologists may make uncertain even when they have experienced
long-term clinical training and professional guidance, which makes much noise
in extracting disease labels based on CXR reports. In this paper, we re-extract
disease labels from CXR reports to make them more realistic by considering
disease severity and uncertainty in classification. Our contributions are as
follows: 1. We re-extracted the disease labels with severity and uncertainty by
a rule-based approach with keywords discussed with clinical experts. 2. To
further improve the explainability of chest X-ray diagnosis, we designed a
multi-relationship graph learning method with an expert uncertainty-aware loss
function. 3. Our multi-relationship graph learning method can also interpret
the disease classification results. Our experimental results show that models
considering disease severity and uncertainty outperform previous
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">3D image reconstruction from a limited number of 2D images has been a
long-standing challenge in computer vision and image analysis. While deep
learning-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in this area,
existing deep networks often fail to effectively utilize the shape structures
of objects presented in images. As a result, the topology of reconstructed
objects may not be well preserved, leading to the presence of artifacts such as
discontinuities, holes, or mismatched connections between different parts. In
this paper, we propose a shape-aware network based on diffusion models for 3D
image reconstruction, named SADIR, to address these issues. In contrast to
previous methods that primarily rely on spatial correlations of image
intensities for 3D reconstruction, our model leverages shape priors learned
from the training data to guide the reconstruction process. To achieve this, we
develop a joint learning network that simultaneously learns a mean shape under
deformation models. Each reconstructed image is then considered as a deformed
variant of the mean shape. We validate our model, SADIR, on both brain and
cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Experimental results show that our
method outperforms the baselines with lower reconstruction error and better
preservation of the shape structure of objects within the images.

<p class="mathjax">Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a wireless communication technology
that enables a wide range of applications, from smart cities to industrial
automation. As a part of the 5G extension, NB-IoT promises to connect billions
of devices with low-power and low-cost requirements. However, with the advent
of quantum computers, the incoming NB-IoT era is already under threat by these
devices, which might break the conventional cryptographic algorithms that can
be adapted to secure NB-IoT devices on large scale. In this context, we
investigate the feasibility of using post-quantum key exchange and signature
algorithms for securing NB-IoT applications. We develop a realistic ns-3
environment to represent the characteristics of NB-IoT networks and analyze the
usage of post-quantum algorithms to secure communication. Our findings suggest
that using NIST-selected post-quantum key-exchange protocol Kyber does not
introduce significant overhead, but post-quantum signature schemes can result
in impractical latency times and lower throughputs

<p class="mathjax">There has been significant research on developing pretrained transformer
architectures for multimodal-to-text generation tasks. Albeit performance
improvements, such models are frequently overparameterized, hence suffer from
hallucination and large memory footprint making them challenging to deploy on
edge devices. In this paper, we address both these issues for the application
of automated audio captioning. First, we propose a data augmentation technique
for generating hallucinated audio captions and show that similarity based on an
audio-text shared latent space is suitable for detecting hallucination. Then,
we propose a parameter efficient inference time faithful decoding algorithm
that enables smaller audio captioning models with performance equivalent to
larger models trained with more data. During the beam decoding step, the
smaller model utilizes an audio-text shared latent representation to
semantically align the generated text with corresponding input audio. Faithful
guidance is introduced into the beam probability by incorporating the cosine
similarity between latent representation projections of greedy rolled out
intermediate beams and audio clip. We show the efficacy of our algorithm on
benchmark datasets and evaluate the proposed scheme against baselines using
conventional audio captioning and semantic similarity metrics while
illustrating tradeoffs between performance and complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Tensor network techniques, known for their low-rank approximation ability
that breaks the curse of dimensionality, are emerging as a foundation of new
mathematical methods for ultra-fast numerical solutions of high-dimensional
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Here, we present a mixed Tensor Train
(TT)/Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) approach for the numerical solution of
time-independent Boltzmann Neutron Transport equations (BNTEs) in Cartesian
geometry. Discretizing a realistic three-dimensional (3D) BNTE by (i) diamond
differencing, (ii) multigroup-in-energy, and (iii) discrete ordinate
collocation leads to huge generalized eigenvalue problems that generally
require a matrix-free approach and large computer clusters. Starting from this
discretization, we construct a TT representation of the PDE fields and discrete
operators, followed by a QTT representation of the TT cores and solving the
tensorized generalized eigenvalue problem in a fixed-point scheme with tensor
network optimization techniques. We validate our approach by applying it to two
realistic examples of 3D neutron transport problems, currently solved by the
PARallel TIme-dependent SN (PARTISN) solver. We demonstrate that our TT/QTT
method, executed on a standard desktop computer, leads to a yottabyte
compression of the memory storage, and more than 7500 times speedup with a
discrepancy of less than 1e-5 when compared to the PARTISN solution.

higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency
domain}. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers
a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for
diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the
diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model
without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning. RDM achieves
state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256$\times$256,
surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin. All the

<p class="mathjax">The analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an important step
in remote sensing applications, and it is a challenging problem due to its
inherent speckle noise. One typical solution is to model the data using the
$G_I^0$ distribution and extract its roughness information, which in turn can
be used in posterior imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification and
interpretation. This leads to the need of quick and reliable estimation of the
roughness parameter from SAR data, especially with high resolution images.
Unfortunately, traditional parameter estimation procedures are slow and prone
to estimation failures. In this work, we proposed a neural network-based
estimation framework that first learns how to predict underlying parameters of
$G_I^0$ samples and then can be used to estimate the roughness of unseen data.
We show that this approach leads to an estimator that is quicker, yields less
estimation error and is less prone to failures than the traditional estimation
procedures for this problem, even when we use a simple network. More
importantly, we show that this same methodology can be generalized to handle
image inputs and, even if trained on purely synthetic data for a few seconds,
is able to perform real time pixel-wise roughness estimation for high
resolution real SAR imagery.

<p class="mathjax">Source camera identification in digital videos is the problem of associating
an unknown digital video with its source device, within a closed set of
possible devices. The existing techniques in source detection of digital videos
try to find a fingerprint of the actual source in the video in form of PRNU
(Photo Response Non--Uniformity), and match it against the SPN (Sensor Pattern
Noise) of each possible device. The highest correlation indicates the correct
source. We investigate the problem of identifying a video source through a
feature based approach using machine learning. In this paper, we present a
blind forensic technique of video source authentication and identification,
based on feature extraction, feature selection and subsequent source
classification. The main aim is to determine whether a claimed source for a
video is actually its original source. If not, we identify its original source.
Our experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method compared
to traditional fingerprint based technique.

due to limited human motor control. This study demonstrates the next
generation, cooperatively controlled Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER 3.0), a

targeting accuracy and resolution for subretinal injections. The system design
and basic kinematics are reported and a deflection model for the incorporated
delta stage and validation experiments are presented. This model optimizes the
delta stage parameters, maximizing the global conditioning index and minimizing
torsional compliance. Five tests measuring accuracy, repeatability, and
deflection show the optimized stage design achieves a tip accuracy of &lt;30
$\mu$m, tip repeatability of 9.3 $\mu$m and 0.02{\deg}, and deflections between
20-350 $\mu$m/N. Future work will use updated control models to refine tip

<p class="mathjax">Joint Embedding Architecture-based self-supervised learning methods have
attributed the composition of data augmentations as a crucial factor for their
strong representation learning capabilities. While regional dropout strategies
have proven to guide models to focus on lesser indicative parts of the objects
in supervised methods, it hasn't been adopted by self-supervised methods for
generating positive pairs. This is because the regional dropout methods are not
suitable for the input sampling process of the self-supervised methodology.
Whereas dropping informative pixels from the positive pairs can result in
inefficient training, replacing patches of a specific object with a different
one can steer the model from maximizing the agreement between different
positive pairs. Moreover, joint embedding representation learning methods have
not made robustness their primary training outcome. To this end, we propose the
ViewMix augmentation policy, specially designed for self-supervised learning,
upon generating different views of the same image, patches are cut and pasted
from one view to another. By leveraging the different views created by this
augmentation strategy, multiple joint embedding-based self-supervised
methodologies obtained better localization capability and consistently
outperformed their corresponding baseline methods. It is also demonstrated that
incorporating ViewMix augmentation policy promotes robustness of the
representations in the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our
experimentation and analysis of compute times suggest that ViewMix augmentation
doesn't introduce any additional overhead compared to other counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Code review is a fundamental process in software development that plays a
critical role in ensuring code quality and reducing the likelihood of errors
and bugs. However, code review might be complex, subjective, and
time-consuming. Comment generation and code refinement are two key tasks of
this process and their automation has traditionally been addressed separately
in the literature using different approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep-learning architecture, DISCOREV, based on cross-task knowledge
distillation that addresses these two tasks simultaneously. In our approach,
the fine-tuning of the comment generation model is guided by the code
refinement model. We implemented this guidance using two strategies,
feedback-based learning objective and embedding alignment objective. We
evaluated our approach based on cross-task knowledge distillation by comparing
it to the state-of-the-art methods that are based on independent training and
fine-tuning. Our results show that our approach generates better review
comments as measured by the BLEU score.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a highly controllable voice manipulation system that can perform
any-to-any voice conversion (VC) and prosody modulation simultaneously.
State-of-the-art VC systems can transfer sentence-level characteristics such as
speaker, emotion, and speaking style. However, manipulating the frame-level
prosody, such as pitch, energy and speaking rate, still remains challenging.
Our proposed model utilizes a frame-level prosody feature to effectively
transfer such properties. Specifically, pitch and energy trajectories are
integrated in a prosody conditioning module and then fed alongside speaker and
contents embeddings to a diffusion-based decoder generating a converted speech
mel-spectrogram. To adjust the speaking rate, our system includes a
self-supervised model based post-processing step which allows improved
controllability. The proposed model showed comparable speech quality and
improved intelligibility compared to a SOTA approach. It can cover a varying
range of fundamental frequency (F0), energy and speed modulation while
maintaining converted speech quality.

<p class="mathjax">The lack of quality labeled data is one of the main bottlenecks for training
Deep Learning models. As the task increases in complexity, there is a higher
penalty for overfitting and unstable learning. The typical paradigm employed
today is Self-Supervised learning, where the model attempts to learn from a
large corpus of unstructured and unlabeled data and then transfer that
knowledge to the required task. Some notable examples of self-supervision in
other modalities are BERT for Large Language Models, Wav2Vec for Speech
Recognition, and the Masked AutoEncoder for Vision, which all utilize
Transformers to solve a masked prediction task. GeoAI is uniquely poised to
take advantage of the self-supervised methodology due to the decades of data
collected, little of which is precisely and dependably annotated. Our goal is
to extract building and road segmentations from Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
that provide a detailed topography of the earths surface. The proposed
architecture is the Masked Autoencoder pre-trained on ImageNet (with the
limitation that there is a large domain discrepancy between ImageNet and DEM)
with an UperNet Head for decoding segmentations. We tested this model with 450
and 50 training images only, utilizing roughly 5% and 0.5% of the original data
respectively. On the building segmentation task, this model obtains an 82.1%
Intersection over Union (IoU) with 450 Images and 69.1% IoU with only 50
images. On the more challenging road detection task the model obtains an 82.7%
IoU with 450 images and 73.2% IoU with only 50 images. Any hand-labeled dataset
made today about the earths surface will be immediately obsolete due to the
constantly changing nature of the landscape. This motivates the clear necessity
for data-efficient learners that can be used for a wide variety of downstream
tasks.

and efficient approach for producing accurate and robust surrogate modeling. In
this paper, a new framework that utilizes Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN) to solve PDE-based problems for the creation of surrogate models for
steady-state flow-thermal engineering design applications is introduced. The
surrogate models developed through this framework are demonstrated on several
use cases from electronics cooling to biomechanics. Additionally, it is
demonstrated how these trained surrogate models can be combined with design
optimization methods to improve the efficiency and reduced the cost of the
design process. The former is shown through several realistic 3D examples and
the latter via a detailed cost-benefit trade off. Overall, the findings of this
paper demonstrate that hybrid data-PINN surrogate models combined with
optimization algorithms can solve realistic design optimization and have
potential in a wide variety of application areas.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, researchers have investigated the relationship between proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), difference quotients (DQs), and pointwise in
time error bounds for POD reduced order models of partial differential
equations. In a recent work (Eskew and Singler, Adv. Comput. Math., 49, 2023,
no. 2, Paper No. 13), a new approach to POD with DQs was developed that is more
computationally efficient than the standard DQ POD approach and it also retains
the guaranteed pointwise in time error bounds of the standard method. In this
work, we extend this new DQ POD approach to the case of second difference
quotients (DDQs). Specifically, a new POD method utilizing DDQs and only one
snapshot and one DQ is developed and used to prove ROM error bounds for the
damped wave equation. This new approach eliminates data redundancy in the
standard DDQ POD approach that uses all of the snapshots, DQs, and DDQs. We
show that this new DDQ approach also has pointwise in time data error bounds
similar to DQ POD and use it to prove pointwise and energy ROM error bounds. We
provide numerical results for the POD errors and ROM errors to demonstrate the
theoretical results. We also explore an application of POD to simulating ROMs
past the training interval for collecting the snapshot data for the standard
POD approach and the DDQ POD method.

<p class="mathjax">A new class of vulnerabilities related to speculative and out-of-order
execution, fault-injection, and microarchitectural side channels rose to
attention in 2018. The techniques behind the transient execution
vulnerabilities were not new, but the combined application of the techniques
was more sophisticated, and the security impact more severe, than previously
considered possible. Numerous mitigations have been proposed and implemented
for variants of the transient execution vulnerabilities. While Meltdown-type
exception-based transient execution vulnerabilities have proven to be
tractable, Spectre-type vulnerabilities and other speculation-based transient
execution vulnerabilities have been far more resistant to countermeasures. A
few proposed mitigations have been widely adopted by hardware vendors and
software developers, but combining those commonly deployed mitigations does not
produce an effective and comprehensive solution, it only protects against a
small subset of the variants. Over the years, newly proposed mitigations have
been trending towards more effective and comprehensive approaches with better
performance, and yet, older mitigations remain the most popular despite limited
security benefits and prohibitive performance penalties. If we continue this
way, we can look forward to many generations of hardware debilitated by
performance penalties from increasing layers of mitigations as new variants are
discovered, and yet still vulnerable to both known and future variants.

<p class="mathjax">Dialect identification is a critical task in speech processing and language
technology, enhancing various applications such as speech recognition, speaker
verification, and many others. While most research studies have been dedicated
to dialect identification in widely spoken languages, limited attention has
been given to dialect identification in low-resource languages, such as
Romanian. To address this research gap, we introduce RoDia, the first dataset
for Romanian dialect identification from speech. The RoDia dataset includes a
varied compilation of speech samples from five distinct regions of Romania,
covering both urban and rural environments, totaling 2 hours of manually
annotated speech data. Along with our dataset, we introduce a set of
competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. The top scoring
model achieves a macro F1 score of 59.83% and a micro F1 score of 62.08%,
indicating that the task is challenging. We thus believe that RoDia is a
valuable resource that will stimulate research aiming to address the challenges
of Romanian dialect identification. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/codrut2/RoDia.

<p class="mathjax">To address the increasing vulnerability of power grids, significant attention
has been focused on the attack detection and impact mitigation. However, it is
still unclear how to effectively and quickly recover the cyber and physical
networks from a cyberattack. In this context, this paper presents the first
investigation of the Cyber Recovery from Dynamic load altering Attack (CRDA).
Considering the interconnection among electricity, transportation, and cyber
networks, two essential sub-tasks are formulated for the CRDA: i) Optimal
design of repair crew routes to remove installed malware and ii) Adaptive
adjustment of system operation to eliminate the mitigation costs while
guaranteeing stability. To achieve this, linear stability constraints are
obtained by estimating the related eigenvalues under the variation of multiple
IBR droop gains based on the sensitivity information of strategically selected
sampling points. Moreover, to obtain the robust recovery strategy, the
potential counter-measures from the adversary during the recovery process are
modeled as maximizing the attack impact of remaining compromised resources in
each step. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem can be finally
formulated for the CRDA with the primary objective to reset involved droop
gains and secondarily to repair all compromised loads. Case studies are
performed in the modified IEEE 39-bus power system to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed CRDA compared to the benchmark case.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing concern surrounding gun violence in the United States has led
to a focus on developing systems to improve public safety. One approach to
developing such a system is to detect and track shooters, which would help
prevent or mitigate the impact of violent incidents. In this paper, we proposed
detecting shooters as a whole, rather than just guns, which would allow for
improved tracking robustness, as obscuring the gun would no longer cause the
system to lose sight of the threat. However, publicly available data on
shooters is much more limited and challenging to create than a gun dataset
alone. Therefore, we explore the use of domain randomization and transfer
learning to improve the effectiveness of training with synthetic data obtained
from Unreal Engine environments. This enables the model to be trained on a
wider range of data, increasing its ability to generalize to different
situations. Using these techniques with YOLOv8 and Deep OC-SORT, we implemented
an initial version of a shooter tracking system capable of running on edge
hardware, including both a Raspberry Pi and a Jetson Nano.

<p class="mathjax">Researchers have extensively explored how password creation policies
influence the security and usability of user-chosen passwords, producing
evidence-based policy guidelines. However, for web authentication to improve in
practice, websites must actually implement these recommendations. To date,
there has been limited investigation into what password creation policies are
actually deployed by sites. Existing works are mostly dated and all studies
relied on manual evaluations, assessing a small set of sites (at most 150,
skewed towards top sites). Thus, we lack a broad understanding of the password
policies used today. In this paper, we develop an automated technique for
inferring a website's password creation policy, and apply it at scale to
measure the policies of over 20K sites, over two orders of magnitude (135x)
more sites than prior work. Our findings identify the common policies deployed,
potential causes of weak policies, and directions for improving authentication
in practice. Ultimately, our study provides the first large-scale understanding
of password creation policies on the web.

<p class="mathjax">Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning is a challenge presented by binary
classification problems where there is an abundance of unlabeled data along
with a small number of positive data instances, which can be used to address
chronic disease screening problem. State-of-the-art PU learning methods have
resulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the
differences among distinct populations. To address this issue, we present a
novel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed
to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in
tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary
decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then
aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the
tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery
data augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in
individual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an
adversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a
model fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in
robust binary classification results. We demonstrate the superior performance
of PUtree as well as its variants on two benchmarks and a new
diabetes-prediction dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Motion Prediction (MP) of multiple surroundings agents is a crucial task in
arbitrarily complex environments, from simple robots to Autonomous Driving
Stacks (ADS). Current techniques tackle this problem using end-to-end
pipelines, where the input data is usually a rendered top-view of the physical
information and the past trajectories of the most relevant agents; leveraging
this information is a must to obtain optimal performance. In that sense, a
reliable ADS must produce reasonable predictions on time. However, despite many
approaches use simple ConvNets and LSTMs to obtain the social latent features,
State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models might be too complex for real-time applications
when using both sources of information (map and past trajectories) as well as
little interpretable, specially considering the physical information. Moreover,
the performance of such models highly depends on the number of available inputs
for each particular traffic scenario, which are expensive to obtain,
particularly, annotated High-Definition (HD) maps.
<br />In this work, we propose several efficient baselines for the well-known
Argoverse 1 Motion Forecasting Benchmark. We aim to develop compact models
using SOTA techniques for MP, including attention mechanisms and GNNs. Our
lightweight models use standard social information and interpretable map
information such as points from the driveable area and plausible centerlines by
means of a novel preprocessing step based on kinematic constraints, in
opposition to black-box CNN-based or too-complex graphs methods for map
encoding, to generate plausible multimodal trajectories achieving up-to-pair
accuracy with less operations and parameters than other SOTA methods. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Cram3r95/mapfe4mp .

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention for their
energy-efficient machine learning capabilities, utilizing bio-inspired
activation functions and sparse binary spike-data representations. While recent
SNN algorithmic advances achieve high accuracy on large-scale computer vision
tasks, their energy-efficiency claims rely on certain impractical estimation
metrics. This work studies two hardware benchmarking platforms for large-scale
SNN inference, namely SATA and SpikeSim. SATA is a sparsity-aware
systolic-array accelerator, while SpikeSim evaluates SNNs implemented on
In-Memory Computing (IMC) based analog crossbars. Using these tools, we find
that the actual energy-efficiency improvements of recent SNN algorithmic works
differ significantly from their estimated values due to various hardware
bottlenecks. We identify and address key roadblocks to efficient SNN deployment
on hardware, including repeated computations &amp; data movements over timesteps,
neuronal module overhead, and vulnerability of SNNs towards crossbar
non-idealities.

In this method, first the Haar wavelet features are extracted from iris images.
The advantage of using these features is the high-speed extraction, as well as
being unique to each iris. Then the back propagation neural network (BPNN) is
used as a classifier. In this system, the BPNN parallel algorithms and their
implementation on GPUs have been used by the aid of CUDA in order to speed up
the learning process. Finally, the system performance and the speeding outcomes
in a way that this algorithm is done in series are presented.

<p class="mathjax">Variability constraints are an integral part of the requirements for a
configurable system. The constraints specified in the requirements on the legal
combinations of options define the space of potential valid configurations for
the system-to-be. This paper reports on our experience with the
variability-related requirements constraints of a flight software framework
used by multiple space missions. A challenge that we saw for practitioners
using the current framework, now open-sourced, is that the specifications of
its variability-related requirements and constraints are dispersed across
several documents, rather than being centralized in the software requirements
specification. Such dispersion can contribute to misunderstandings of the
side-effects of design choices, increased effort for developers, and bugs
during operations. Based on our experience, we propose a new software
variability model, similar to a product-line feature model, in the flight
software framework. We describe the structured technique by which our model is
developed, demonstrate its use, and evaluate it on a key service module of the
flight software. Results show that our lightweight modeling technique helped
find missing and inconsistent variability-related requirements and constraints.
More generally, we suggest that a variability modeling technique such as this
can be an efficient way for developers to centralize the specification and
improve the analysis of dispersed variability-related requirements and
constraints in other configurable systems.

Crank-Nisolson method is developed for the stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger
equation driven by a multiplicative noise with non-periodic boundary
conditions. The proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the computational
cost while maintaining the similar conservation laws. Numerical experiments are
dedicated to illustrating the capability of the algorithm for different spatial
dimensions, as well as the various initial conditions. In particular, we
compare the performance of the overlapping domain decomposition splitting
algorithm with the stochastic multi-symplectic method in [S. Jiang, L. Wang and
J. Hong, Commun. Comput. Phys., 2013] and the finite difference splitting
scheme in [J. Cui, J. Hong, Z. Liu and W. Zhou, J. Differ. Equ., 2019]. We
observe that our proposed algorithm has excellent computational efficiency and
is highly competitive. It provides a useful tool for solving stochastic partial

Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), their operational endurance can be
significantly enhanced. This paper explores the computationally complex problem
of cooperative UAV-UGV routing for vast area surveillance within the speed and
fuel constraints, presenting a sequential multi-agent planning framework for
achieving feasible and optimally satisfactory solutions. By considering the UAV
fuel limits and utilizing a minimum set cover algorithm, we determine UGV
refueling stops, which in turn facilitate UGV route planning at the first step
and through a task allocation technique and energy constrained vehicle routing
problem modeling with time windows (E-VRPTW) we achieve the UAV route at the
second step of the framework. The effectiveness of our multi-agent strategy is
demonstrated through the implementation on 30 different task scenarios across 3
different scales. This work offers significant insight into the collaborative
advantages of UAV-UGV systems and introduces heuristic approaches to bypass
computational challenges and swiftly reach high-quality solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Video anomaly detection is a challenging task due to the lack in approaches
for representing samples. The visual representations of most existing
approaches are limited by short-term sequences of observations which cannot
provide enough clues for achieving reasonable detections. In this paper, we
propose to completely represent the motion patterns of objects by learning from
long-term sequences. Firstly, a Stacked State Machine (SSM) model is proposed
to represent the temporal dependencies which are consistent across long-range
observations. Then SSM model functions in predicting future states based on
past ones, the divergence between the predictions with inherent normal patterns
and observed ones determines anomalies which violate normal motion patterns.
Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach on the
dataset and existing ones. Improvements over state-of-the-art methods can be
observed. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Effective music mixing requires technical and creative finesse, but clear
communication with the client is crucial. The mixing engineer must grasp the
client's expectations, and preferences, and collaborate to achieve the desired
sound. The tacit agreement for the desired sound of the mix is often
established using guides like reference songs and demo mixes exchanged between
the artist and the engineer and sometimes verbalised using semantic terms. This
paper presents the findings of a two-phased exploratory study aimed at
understanding how professional mixing engineers interact with clients and use
their feedback to guide the mixing process. For phase one, semi-structured
interviews were conducted with five mixing engineers with the aim of gathering
insights about their communication strategies, creative processes, and
decision-making criteria. Based on the inferences from these interviews, an
online questionnaire was designed and administered to a larger group of 22
mixing engineers during the second phase. The results of this study shed light
on the importance of collaboration, empathy, and intention in the mixing
process, and can inform the development of smart multi-track mixing systems
that better support these practices. By highlighting the significance of these
findings, this paper contributes to the growing body of research on the
collaborative nature of music production and provides actionable
recommendations for the design and implementation of innovative mixing tools.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance
on various downstream tasks by utilizing knowledge learned from large data. In
general, the performance of VLMs on target tasks can be further improved by
prompt tuning, which adds context to the input image or text. By leveraging
data from target tasks, various prompt-tuning methods have been studied in the
literature. A key to prompt tuning is the feature space alignment between two
modalities via learnable vectors with model parameters fixed. We observed that
the alignment becomes more effective when embeddings of each modality are
`well-arranged' in the latent space. Inspired by this observation, we proposed
distribution-aware prompt tuning (DAPT) for vision-language models, which is
simple yet effective. Specifically, the prompts are learned by maximizing
inter-dispersion, the distance between classes, as well as minimizing the
intra-dispersion measured by the distance between embeddings from the same
class. Our extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves generalizability. The code is available at
https://github.com/mlvlab/DAPT.

<p class="mathjax">Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been
powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges
on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by
PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language
models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in
natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions
from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values,
then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next
optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling
salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to
find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we
demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed
prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Defects, or bugs, often form during software development. Identifying the
root cause of defects is essential to improve code quality, evaluate testing
methods, and support defect prediction. Examples of defect-inducing changes can
be found using the SZZ algorithm to trace the textual history of defect-fixing
changes back to the defect-inducing changes that they fix in line-based code.
The line-based approach of the SZZ method is ineffective for visual code that
represents source code graphically rather than textually. In this paper we
adapt SZZ for visual code and present the "SZZ Visual Code" (SZZ-VC) algorithm,
that finds changes in visual code based on the differences of graphical
elements rather than differences of lines to detect defect-inducing changes. We
validated the algorithm for an industry-made AAA video game and 20 music visual
programming defects across 12 open source projects. Our results show that
SZZ-VC is feasible for detecting defects in visual code for 3 different visual
programming languages.

<p class="mathjax">Instruction tuning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to become
interactive. While many instruction tuning datasets exist in English, there is
a noticeable lack in other languages. Also, their effectiveness has not been
well verified in non-English languages. We construct a Japanese instruction
dataset by expanding and filtering existing datasets and apply the dataset to a
Japanese pre-trained base model. We performed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) tuning
on both Japanese and English existing models using our instruction dataset. We
evaluated these models from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. As
a result, the effectiveness of Japanese instruction datasets is confirmed. The
results also indicate that even with relatively small LLMs, performances in
downstream tasks would be improved through instruction tuning. Our instruction

<p class="mathjax">Video game development increasingly relies on using visual programming
languages as the primary way to build video game features. The aim of using
visual programming is to move game logic into the hands of game designers, who
may not be as well versed in textual coding. In this paper, we empirically
observe that there are more defect-inducing commits containing visual code than
textual code in a AAA video game project codebase. This indicates that the
existing textual code Just-in-Time (JIT) defect prediction models under
evaluation by Electronic Arts (EA) may be ineffective as they do not account
for changes in visual code. Thus, we focus our research on constructing visual
code defect prediction models that encompass visual code metrics and evaluate
the models against defect prediction models that use language agnostic
features, and textual code metrics. We test our models using features extracted
from the historical codebase of a AAA video game project, as well as the
historical codebases of 70 open source projects that use textual and visual
code. We find that defect prediction models have better performance overall in
terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Mathews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) when incorporating visual code features for projects that
contain more commits with visual code than textual code.

<p class="mathjax">The Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as an improved communication system
that has revolutionized traditional lifestyles. To function successfully, IoT
requires a combination of cloud, fog, and edge computing architectures. Few
studies have addressed cloud, fog, and edge computing simultaneously, comparing
them and their issues, although several studies have looked into ways of
integrating IoT with either one or two computing systems. Thus, this review
provides a thorough understanding of IoT integration with these three computing
architectures, as well as their respective applications and limitations. It
also highlights the advantages, unresolved issues, future opportunities and
directions of IoT integration with the computing systems to advance the IoT.
IoT can use the Cloud's almost limitless resources to overcome technology
restrictions, such as data processing, storage, and transmission. While edge
computing can outperform cloud computing in many circumstances, IoT and edge
computing become increasingly integrated as IoT devices increase. Cloud
computing also poses a few issues, including managing time-sensitive IoT
applications like video gaming, simulation, and streaming, which can be
addressed by fog computing integrated with IoT. Due to the proximity of fog
computing resources to the edge, data transfers and communication delays to the
cloud can be reduced as a result of combining the two. The integration of IoT
with cloud, fog, and edge computing will create new business prototypes and
opportunities. Since IoT has the potential to greatly enhance connectivity
infrastructure as an inevitable component of the future internet, further study
is needed before it can be fully integrated.

<p class="mathjax">Decisions made by machine learning models may have lasting impacts over time,
making long-term fairness a crucial consideration. It has been shown that when
ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static
settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases
in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness
notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term
bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate
that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness
since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps
during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion
called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers
varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the
sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term
Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This
makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias,
leading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three
sequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly
reduces bias and maintains high utility. Code is available at
https://github.com/Yuancheng-Xu/ELBERT.

<p class="mathjax">Open Information Extraction (OIE) task aims at extracting structured facts
from unstructured text, typically in the form of (subject, relation, object)
triples. Despite the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as
a general task solver, they lag behind state-of-the-art (supervised) methods in
OIE tasks due to two key issues. First, LLMs struggle to distinguish irrelevant
context from relevant relations and generate structured output due to the
restrictions on fine-tuning the model. Second, LLMs generates responses
autoregressively based on probability, which makes the predicted relations lack
confidence. In this paper, we assess the capabilities of LLMs in improving the
OIE task. Particularly, we propose various in-context learning strategies to
enhance LLM's instruction-following ability and a demonstration uncertainty
quantification module to enhance the confidence of the generated relations. Our
experiments on three OIE benchmark datasets show that our approach holds its

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently gained significant
interest as an emerging technology for future wireless networks thanks to its
potential for improving the coverage probability in challenging propagation
environments. This paper studies an RIS-assisted propagation environment, where
a source transmits data to a destination in the presence of a weak direct link.
We analyze and compare RIS designs based on long-term and short-term channel
statistics in terms of coverage probability and ergodic rate. For the
considered optimization designs, we derive closed-form expressions for the
coverage probability and ergodic rate, which explicitly unveil the impact of
both the propagation environment and the RIS on the system performance. Besides
the optimization of the RIS phase profile, we formulate an RIS placement
optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the coverage probability by
relying only on partial channel state information. An efficient algorithm is
proposed based on the gradient ascent method. Simulation results are
illustrated in order to corroborate the analytical framework and findings. The
proposed RIS phase profile is shown to outperform several heuristic benchmarks
in terms of outage probability and ergodic rate. In addition, the proposed RIS
placement strategy provides an extra degree of freedom that remarkably improves
system performance.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is designed to preserve data privacy during model
training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and
only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative
learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine
attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak
private information about the local training data, and they can also be
maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this
paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and
simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our
approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into
the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against
Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee
of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same
client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive
experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate
the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by
comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our
experiments show the efficacy of our framework and demonstrate its ability to
improve system robustness against Byzantine attacks while achieving a strong
privacy guarantee.

shared global components and personalized local components. We introduce a mode

present a method that decomposes the problem into (a) proving that the program
only leaks information it has declassified via assume annotations already
widely used in deductive program verification; and (b) auditing the
declassifications against a declarative security policy. We show how condition
(a) can be enforced by an extension of the existing program logic SecCSL, and
how (b) can be checked by proving a set of simple entailments. Part of the
challenge is to define respective semantic soundness criteria and to formally

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present an approach to image enhancement with diffusion
model in underwater scenes. Our method adapts conditional denoising diffusion
probabilistic models to generate the corresponding enhanced images by using the
underwater images and the Gaussian noise as the inputs. Additionally, in order
to improve the efficiency of the reverse process in the diffusion model, we
adopt two different ways. We firstly propose a lightweight transformer-based
denoising network, which can effectively promote the time of network forward
per iteration. On the other hand, we introduce a skip sampling strategy to
reduce the number of iterations. Besides, based on the skip sampling strategy,
we propose two different non-uniform sampling methods for the sequence of the
time step, namely piecewise sampling and searching with the evolutionary
algorithm. Both of them are effective and can further improve performance by
using the same steps against the previous uniform sampling. In the end, we
conduct a relative evaluation of the widely used underwater enhancement
datasets between the recent state-of-the-art methods and the proposed approach.
The experimental results prove that our approach can achieve both competitive
performance and high efficiency. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous across various domains,
transforming the way we interact with information and conduct research.
However, most high-performing LLMs remain confined behind proprietary walls,
hindering scientific progress. Most open-source LLMs, on the other hand, are
limited in their ability to support longer sequence lengths, which is a key
requirement for many tasks that require inference over an input context. To
address this, we have trained XGen, a series of 7B parameter models on up to 8K
sequence length for up to 1.5T tokens. We have also finetuned the XGen models
on public-domain instructional data, creating their instruction-tuned
counterparts (XGen-Inst). We open-source our models for both research
advancements and commercial applications. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks
shows that XGen models achieve comparable or better results when compared with
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs. Our targeted evaluation on long sequence
modeling tasks shows the benefits of our 8K-sequence models over 2K-sequence
open-source LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel deep learning approach for analyzing massive
underwater acoustic data by leveraging a model trained on a broad spectrum of
non-underwater (aerial) sounds. Recognizing the challenge in labeling vast
amounts of underwater data, we propose a two-fold methodology to accelerate
this labor-intensive procedure.
<br />The first part of our approach involves PCA and UMAP visualization of the
underwater data using the feature vectors of an aerial sound recognition model.
This enables us to cluster the data in a two dimensional space and listen to
points within these clusters to understand their defining characteristics. This
innovative method simplifies the process of selecting candidate labels for
further training.
<br />In the second part, we train a neural network model using both the selected
underwater data and the non-underwater dataset. We conducted a quantitative
analysis to measure the precision, recall, and F1 score of our model for
recognizing airgun sounds, a common type of underwater sound. The F1 score
achieved by our model exceeded 84.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in analyzing underwater acoustic data.
<br />The methodology presented in this paper holds significant potential to reduce
the amount of labor required in underwater data analysis and opens up new
possibilities for further research in the field of cross-domain data analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal models have gained significant success in recent years. Standard
multimodal approaches often assume unchanged modalities from training stage to
inference stage. In practice, however, many scenarios fail to satisfy such
assumptions with missing modalities during inference, leading to limitations on
where multimodal models can be applied. While existing methods mitigate the
problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, it increases unnecessary
computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large,
deployed systems. To solve the problem from both sides, we propose a novel
guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking
advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality
models for inference. Real-life experiment in violence detection shows that our
proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform
its traditionally trained counterparts while maintaining the same inference
cost.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a novel diffusion model called that generates
multiview-consistent images from a single-view image. Using pretrained
large-scale 2D diffusion models, recent work Zero123 demonstrates the ability
to generate plausible novel views from a single-view image of an object.
However, maintaining consistency in geometry and colors for the generated
images remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized
multiview diffusion model that models the joint probability distribution of
multiview images, enabling the generation of multiview-consistent images in a
single reverse process. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of all
the generated images at every step of the reverse process through a 3D-aware
feature attention mechanism that correlates the corresponding features across
different views. Experiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with high
consistency across different views, thus making it well-suited for various 3D
generation tasks such as novel-view-synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.

for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, but second-order ones are still
in lack. This work proposes novel second-order discretization in time and
finite volume discretization in space for modified PNP equations that
incorporate effects arising from ionic steric interactions and dielectric
inhomogeneity. A multislope method on unstructured meshes is proposed to
reconstruct positive, accurate approximations of mobilities on faces of control
volumes. Numerical analysis proves that the proposed numerical schemes are able
to unconditionally ensure the existence of positive numerical solutions,
original energy dissipation, mass conservation, and preservation of steady
states at discrete level. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to
demonstrate numerical accuracy and performance in preserving properties of
physical significance. Applications in ion permeation through a 3D nanopore
show that the modified PNP model, equipped with the proposed schemes, has
promising applications in the investigation of ion selectivity and
rectification. The proposed second-order discretization can be extended to
design temporal second-order schemes with original energy dissipation for a
type of gradient flow problems with entropy.

<p class="mathjax">To protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep neural networks
(DNNs), black-box DNN watermarks, which are embedded into the prediction
behavior of DNN models on a set of specially-crafted samples, have gained
increasing popularity in both academy and industry. Watermark robustness is
usually implemented against attackers who steal the protected model and
obfuscate its parameters for watermark removal. Recent studies empirically
prove the robustness of most black-box watermarking schemes against known
removal attempts.
<br />In this paper, we propose a novel Model Inversion-based Removal Attack
(\textsc{Mira}), which is watermark-agnostic and effective against most of
mainstream black-box DNN watermarking schemes. In general, our attack pipeline
exploits the internals of the protected model to recover and unlearn the
watermark message. We further design target class detection and recovered
sample splitting algorithms to reduce the utility loss caused by \textsc{Mira}
and achieve data-free watermark removal on half of the watermarking schemes. We
conduct comprehensive evaluation of \textsc{Mira} against ten mainstream
black-box watermarks on three benchmark datasets and DNN architectures.
Compared with six baseline removal attacks, \textsc{Mira} achieves strong
watermark removal effects on the covered watermarks, preserving at least $90\%$
of the stolen model utility, under more relaxed or even no assumptions on the
dataset availability.

<p class="mathjax">A 360-degree (omni-directional) image provides an all-encompassing spherical
view of a scene. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in
synthesising 360-degree images from conventional narrow field of view (NFoV)
images captured by digital cameras and smartphones, for providing immersive
experiences in various scenarios such as virtual reality. Yet, existing methods
typically fall short in synthesizing intricate visual details or ensure the
generated images align consistently with user-provided prompts. In this study,
autoregressive omni-aware generative network (AOG-Net) is proposed for
360-degree image generation by out-painting an incomplete 360-degree image
progressively with NFoV and text guidances joinly or individually. This
autoregressive scheme not only allows for deriving finer-grained and
text-consistent patterns by dynamically generating and adjusting the process
but also offers users greater flexibility to edit their conditions throughout
the generation process. A global-local conditioning mechanism is devised to
comprehensively formulate the outpainting guidance in each autoregressive step.
Text guidances, omni-visual cues, NFoV inputs and omni-geometry are encoded and
further formulated with cross-attention based transformers into a global stream
and a local stream into a conditioned generative backbone model. As AOG-Net is
compatible to leverage large-scale models for the conditional encoder and the
generative prior, it enables the generation to use extensive open-vocabulary
text guidances. Comprehensive experiments on two commonly used 360-degree image
datasets for both indoor and outdoor settings demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our proposed method. Our code will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Current machine learning methods struggle to solve Bongard problems, which
are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set
of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not
a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for
natural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy
(where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of
ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many
existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do
not incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely
instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical
issue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object
classification, the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can only be
distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a
variety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and
demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new
state-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%)
and strong performance on the original Bongard problem set (60.84%).

<p class="mathjax">Advances in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have almost entirely closed the
gap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels.
However, recent performance improvements have often come \textit{at the cost of
significantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose
Curriculum Batch Size (CBS), \textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which
exploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small
unlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually
increased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of
dataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is
demonstrated on all settings. We apply CBS, strong labeled augmentation,
Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) \citep{FlexMatch} to FixMatch \citep{FixMatch}
and term the new SSL algorithm Fast FixMatch. We perform an ablation study to
show that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce
training computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal
performance. Fast FixMatch also achieves substantially higher data utilization
compared to previous state-of-the-art. Fast FixMatch achieves between
$2.1\times$ - $3.4\times$ reduced training computations on CIFAR-10 with all
but 40, 250 and 4000 labels removed, compared to vanilla FixMatch, while
attaining the same cited state-of-the-art error rate \citep{FixMatch}. Similar
results are achieved for CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10. Finally, Fast MixMatch
achieves between $2.6\times$ - $3.3\times$ reduced training computations in
federated SSL tasks and online/streaming learning SSL tasks, which further
demonstrate the generializbility of Fast MixMatch to different scenarios and
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">I explore two questions in this thesis: how can computer science be used to
fight human trafficking? And how can computer vision create a sense of touch?
<br />I use natural language processing (NLP) to monitor the United States illicit
massage industry (IMI), a multi-billion dollar industry that offers not just
therapeutic massages but also commercial sexual services. Employees of this
industry are often immigrant women with few job opportunities, leaving them
vulnerable to fraud, coercion, and other facets of human trafficking.
Monitoring spatiotemporal trends helps prevent trafficking in the IMI. By
creating datasets with three publicly-accessible websites: Google Places,
Rubmaps, and AMPReviews, combined with NLP techniques such as bag-of-words and
Word2Vec, I show how to derive insights into the labor pressures and language
barriers that employees face, as well as the income, demographics, and societal
pressures affecting sex buyers. I include a call-to-action to other researchers
given these datasets. I also consider how to creating synthetic financial data,
which can aid with counter-trafficking in the banking sector. I use an
agent-based model to create both tabular and payee-recipient graph data.
<br />I then consider the role of computer vision in making tactile sensors. I
report on a novel sensor, the Digger Finger, that adapts the Gelsight sensor to
finding objects in granular media. Changes include using a wedge shape to
facilitate digging, replacing the internal lighting LEDs with fluorescent
paint, and adding a vibrator motor to counteract jamming. Finally, I also show
how to use a webcam and a printed reference marker, or fiducial, to create a
low-cost six-axis force-torque sensor. This sensor is up to a hundred times
less expensive than commercial sensors, allowing for a wider range of
applications. For this and earlier chapters I release design files and code as
open source.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) has been recognized as a
promising solution to enhance the computational capability and sustainable
energy supply for low-power wireless devices (WDs). However, when the
communication links between the hybrid access point (HAP) and WDs are hostile,
the energy transfer efficiency and task offloading rate are compromised. To
tackle this problem, we propose to employ multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs) to WP-MEC networks. Based on the practical IRS phase shift
model, we formulate a total computation rate maximization problem by jointly
optimizing downlink/uplink IRSs passive beamforming, downlink energy
beamforming and uplink multi-user detection (MUD) vector at HAPs, task
offloading power and local computing frequency of WDs, and the time slot
allocation. Specifically, we first derive the optimal time allocation for
downlink wireless energy transmission (WET) to IRSs and the corresponding
energy beamforming. Next, with fixed time allocation for the downlink WET to
WDs, the original optimization problem can be divided into two independent
subproblems. For the WD charging subproblem, the optimal IRSs passive
beamforming is derived by utilizing the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method and the penalty-based optimization technique, and for the offloading
computing subproblem, we propose a joint optimization framework based on the
fractional programming (FP) method. Finally, simulation results validate that
our proposed optimization method based on the practical phase shift model can
achieve a higher total computation rate compared to the baseline schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Despite substantial efforts dedicated to the design of heuristic models for
omnidirectional (i.e., 360$^\circ$) image quality assessment (OIQA), a
conspicuous gap remains due to the lack of consideration for the diversity of
viewing behaviors that leads to the varying perceptual quality of 360$^\circ$
images. Two critical aspects underline this oversight: the neglect of viewing
conditions that significantly sway user gaze patterns and the overreliance on a
single viewport sequence from the 360$^\circ$ image for quality inference. To
address these issues, we introduce a unique generative scanpath representation
(GSR) for effective quality inference of 360$^\circ$ images, which aggregates
varied perceptual experiences of multi-hypothesis users under a predefined
viewing condition. More specifically, given a viewing condition characterized
by the starting point of viewing and exploration time, a set of scanpaths
consisting of dynamic visual fixations can be produced using an apt scanpath
generator. Following this vein, we use the scanpaths to convert the 360$^\circ$
image into the unique GSR, which provides a global overview of gazed-focused
contents derived from scanpaths. As such, the quality inference of the
360$^\circ$ image is swiftly transformed to that of GSR. We then propose an
efficient OIQA computational framework by learning the quality maps of GSR.
Comprehensive experimental results validate that the predictions of the
proposed framework are highly consistent with human perception in the
spatiotemporal domain, especially in the challenging context of locally
distorted 360$^\circ$ images under varied viewing conditions. The code will be
released at https://github.com/xiangjieSui/GSR

<p class="mathjax">Referring video object segmentation aims to segment a referent throughout a
video sequence according to a natural language expression. It requires aligning
the natural language expression with the objects' motions and their dynamic
associations at the global video level but segmenting objects at the frame
level. To achieve this goal, we propose to simultaneously maintain a global
referent token and a sequence of object queries, where the former is
responsible for capturing video-level referent according to the language
expression, while the latter serves to better locate and segment objects with
each frame. Furthermore, to explicitly capture object motions and
spatial-temporal cross-modal reasoning over objects, we propose a novel
temporal collection-distribution mechanism for interacting between the global
referent token and object queries. Specifically, the temporal collection
mechanism collects global information for the referent token from object
queries to the temporal motions to the language expression. In turn, the
temporal distribution first distributes the referent token to the referent
sequence across all frames and then performs efficient cross-frame reasoning
between the referent sequence and object queries in every frame. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all
benchmarks consistently and significantly.

<p class="mathjax">Planning and prediction are two important modules of autonomous driving and
have experienced tremendous advancement recently. Nevertheless, most existing
methods regard planning and prediction as independent and ignore the
correlation between them, leading to the lack of consideration for interaction
and dynamic changes of traffic scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose
InteractionNet, which leverages transformer to share global contextual
reasoning among all traffic participants to capture interaction and
interconnect planning and prediction to achieve joint. Besides, InteractionNet
deploys another transformer to help the model pay extra attention to the
perceived region containing critical or unseen vehicles. InteractionNet
outperforms other baselines in several benchmarks, especially in terms of
safety, which benefits from the joint consideration of planning and
forecasting. The code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) is a widely-used approach in robotics that
employs visual information to guide robots towards desired positions. However,
occlusions in this approach can lead to visual servoing failure and degrade the
control performance due to the obstructed vision feature points that are
essential for providing visual feedback. In this paper, we propose a Control
Barrier Function (CBF) based controller that enables occlusion-free IBVS tasks
by automatically adjusting the robot's configuration to keep the feature points
in the field of view and away from obstacles. In particular, to account for
measurement noise of the feature points, we develop the Probabilistic Control
Barrier Certificates (PrCBC) using control barrier functions that encode the
chance-constrained occlusion avoidance constraints under uncertainty into
deterministic admissible control space for the robot, from which the resulting
configuration of robot ensures that the feature points stay occlusion free from
obstacles with a satisfying predefined probability. By integrating such
constraints with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, the sequence of
optimized control inputs can be derived to achieve the primary IBVS task while
enforcing the occlusion avoidance during robot movements. Simulation results
are provided to validate the performance of our proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Account abstraction allows a contract wallet to initiate transaction
execution. Thus, account abstraction is useful for preserving the privacy of
externally owned accounts (EOAs) because it can remove a transaction issued
from an EOA to the contract wallet and hides who issued the transaction by
additionally employing anonymous authentication procedures such as ring
signatures. However, unconditional anonymity is undesirable in practice because
it prevents to reveal who is accountable for a problem when it arises. Thus,
maintaining a balancing between anonymity and accountability is important.
<br />In this paper, we propose an anonymous yet accountable contract wallet
system. In addition to account abstraction, the proposed system also utilizes
accountable ring signatures (Bootle et al., ESORICS 2015). The proposed system
provides (1) anonymity of a transaction issuer that hides who agreed with
running the contract wallet, and (2) accountability of the issuer, which allows
the issuer to prove they agreed with running the contract wallet. Moreover, due
to a security requirement of accountable ring signatures, the transaction
issuer cannot claim that someone else issued the transaction. This
functionality allows us to clarify the accountability involved in issuing a
transaction. In addition, the proposed system allows an issuer to employ a
typical signature scheme, e.g., ECDSA, together with the ring signature scheme.
This functionality can be considered an extension of the common
multi-signatures that require a certain number of ECDSA signatures to run a
contract wallet. The proposed system was implemented using zkSync (Solidity).
We discuss several potential applications of the proposed system, i.e., medical
information sharing and asset management.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art visual grounding models can achieve high detection accuracy,
but they are not designed to distinguish between all objects versus only
certain objects of interest. In natural language, in order to specify a
particular object or set of objects of interest, humans use determiners such as
"my", "either" and "those". Determiners, as an important word class, are a type
of schema in natural language about the reference or quantity of the noun.
Existing grounded referencing datasets place much less emphasis on determiners,
compared to other word classes such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. This makes
it difficult to develop models that understand the full variety and complexity
of object referencing. Thus, we have developed and released the DetermiNet
dataset , which comprises 250,000 synthetically generated images and captions
based on 25 determiners. The task is to predict bounding boxes to identify
objects of interest, constrained by the semantics of the given determiner. We
find that current state-of-the-art visual grounding models do not perform well
on the dataset, highlighting the limitations of existing models on reference
and quantification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing importance of data privacy protection, various
privacy-preserving machine learning methods have been proposed. In the
clustering domain, various algorithms with a federated learning framework
(i.e., federated clustering) have been actively studied and showed high
clustering performance while preserving data privacy. However, most of the base
clusterers (i.e., clustering algorithms) used in existing federated clustering
algorithms need to specify the number of clusters in advance. These algorithms,
therefore, are unable to deal with data whose distributions are unknown or
continually changing. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
privacy-preserving continual federated clustering algorithm. In the proposed
algorithm, an adaptive resonance theory-based clustering algorithm capable of
continual learning is used as a base clusterer. Therefore, the proposed
algorithm inherits the ability of continual learning. Experimental results with
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior
clustering performance to state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms
while realizing data privacy protection and continual learning ability. The
source code is available at \url{https://github.com/Masuyama-lab/FCAC}.

<p class="mathjax">The contact-free sensing nature of Wi-Fi has been leveraged to achieve
privacy breaches, yet existing attacks relying on Wi-Fi CSI (channel state
information) demand hacking Wi-Fi hardware to obtain desired CSIs. Since such
hacking has proven prohibitively hard due to compact hardware, its feasibility
in keeping up with fast-developing Wi-Fi technology becomes very questionable.
To this end, we propose WiKI-Eve to eavesdrop keystrokes on smartphones without
the need for hacking. WiKI-Eve exploits a new feature, BFI (beamforming
feedback information), offered by latest Wi-Fi hardware: since BFI is
transmitted from a smartphone to an AP in clear-text, it can be overheard
(hence eavesdropped) by any other Wi-Fi devices switching to monitor mode. As
existing keystroke inference methods offer very limited generalizability,
WiKI-Eve further innovates in an adversarial learning scheme to enable its
inference generalizable towards unseen scenarios. We implement WiKI-Eve and
conduct extensive evaluation on it; the results demonstrate that WiKI-Eve
achieves 88.9% inference accuracy for individual keystrokes and up to 65.8%
top-10 accuracy for stealing passwords of mobile applications (e.g., WeChat).

<p class="mathjax">Despite the fact that the state-of-the-art fuzzers can generate inputs
efficiently, existing fuzz drivers still cannot adequately cover entries in
libraries. Most of these fuzz drivers are crafted manually by developers, and
their quality depends on the developers' understanding of the code. Existing
works have attempted to automate the generation of fuzz drivers by learning API
usage from code and execution traces. However, the generated fuzz drivers are
limited to a few specific call sequences by the code being learned. To address
these challenges, we present HOPPER, which can fuzz libraries without requiring
any domain knowledge to craft fuzz drivers. It transforms the problem of
library fuzzing into the problem of interpreter fuzzing. The interpreters
linked against libraries under test can interpret the inputs that describe
arbitrary API usage. To generate semantically correct inputs for the
interpreter, HOPPER learns the intra- and inter-API constraints in the
libraries and mutates the program with grammar awareness. We implemented HOPPER
and evaluated its effectiveness on 11 real-world libraries against manually
crafted fuzzers and other automatic solutions. Our results show that HOPPER
greatly outperformed the other fuzzers in both code coverage and bug finding,
having uncovered 25 previously unknown bugs that other fuzzers couldn't.
Moreover, we have demonstrated that the proposed intra- and inter-API
constraint learning methods can correctly learn constraints implied by the
library and, therefore, significantly improve the fuzzing efficiency. The
experiment results indicate that HOPPER is able to explore a vast range of API
usages for library fuzzing out of the box.

<p class="mathjax">Quantitative Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during in-situ straining
experiment is able to reveal the motion of dislocations -- linear defects in
the crystal lattice of metals. In the domain of materials science, the
knowledge about the location and movement of dislocations is important for
creating novel materials with superior properties. A long-standing problem,
however, is to identify the position and extract the shape of dislocations,
which would ultimately help to create a digital twin of such materials. In this
work, we quantitatively compare state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods,
including Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8. The dislocation masks as the results of the
instance segmentation are converted to mathematical lines, enabling
quantitative analysis of dislocation length and geometry -- important
information for the domain scientist, which we then propose to include as a
novel length-aware quality metric for estimating the network performance. Our
segmentation pipeline shows a high accuracy suitable for all domain-specific,
further post-processing. Additionally, our physics-based metric turns out to
perform much more consistently than typically used pixel-wise metrics.

<p class="mathjax">A metaverse breaks the boundaries of time and space between people, realizing
a more realistic virtual experience, improving work efficiency, and creating a
new business model. Blockchain, as one of the key supporting technologies for a
metaverse design, provides a trusted interactive environment. However, the rich
and varied scenes of a metaverse have led to excessive consumption of on-chain
resources, raising the threshold for ordinary users to join, thereby losing the
human-centered design. Therefore, we propose an adaptive and modular
blockchain-enabled architecture for a decentralized metaverse to address these
issues. The solution includes an adaptive consensus/ledger protocol based on a
modular blockchain, which can effectively adapt to the ever-changing scenarios
of the metaverse, reduce resource consumption, and provide a secure and
reliable interactive environment. In addition, we propose the concept of
Non-Fungible Resource (NFR) to virtualize idle resources. Users can establish a
temporary trusted environment and rent others' NFR to meet their computing
needs. Finally, we simulate and test our solution based on XuperChain, and the
experimental results prove the feasibility of our design.

<p class="mathjax">Stroke-based rendering aims to recreate an image with a set of strokes. Most
existing methods render complex images using an uniform-block-dividing
strategy, which leads to boundary inconsistency artifacts. To solve the
problem, we propose Compositional Neural Painter, a novel stroke-based
rendering framework which dynamically predicts the next painting region based
on the current canvas, instead of dividing the image plane uniformly into
painting regions. We start from an empty canvas and divide the painting process
into several steps. At each step, a compositor network trained with a phasic RL
strategy first predicts the next painting region, then a painter network
trained with a WGAN discriminator predicts stroke parameters, and a stroke
renderer paints the strokes onto the painting region of the current canvas.
Moreover, we extend our method to stroke-based style transfer with a novel
differentiable distance transform loss, which helps preserve the structure of
the input image during stroke-based stylization. Extensive experiments show our
model outperforms the existing models in both stroke-based neural painting and
stroke-based stylization. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, many mammographic image analysis methods have been
introduced for improving cancer classification tasks. Two major issues of
mammogram classification tasks are leveraging multi-view mammographic
information and class-imbalance handling. In the first problem, many multi-view
methods have been released for concatenating features of two or more views for
the training and inference stage. Having said that, most multi-view existing
methods are not explainable in the meaning of feature fusion, and treat many
views equally for diagnosing. Our work aims to propose a simple but novel
method for enhancing examined view (main view) by leveraging low-level feature
information from the auxiliary view (ipsilateral view) before learning the
high-level feature that contains the cancerous features. For the second issue,
we also propose a simple but novel malignant mammogram synthesis framework for
upsampling minor class samples. Our easy-to-implement and no-training framework
has eliminated the current limitation of the CutMix algorithm which is
unreliable synthesized images with random pasted patches, hard-contour
problems, and domain shift problems. Our results on VinDr-Mammo and CMMD
datasets show the effectiveness of our two new frameworks for both multi-view
training and synthesizing mammographic images, outperforming the previous
conventional methods in our experimental settings.

<p class="mathjax">Video frame interpolation is an important low-level vision task, which can
increase frame rate for more fluent visual experience. Existing methods have
achieved great success by employing advanced motion models and synthesis
networks. However, the spatial redundancy when synthesizing the target frame
has not been fully explored, that can result in lots of inefficient
computation. On the other hand, the computation compression degree in frame
interpolation is highly dependent on both texture distribution and scene
motion, which demands to understand the spatial-temporal information of each
input frame pair for a better compression degree selection. In this work, we
propose a novel two-stage frame interpolation framework termed WaveletVFI to
address above problems. It first estimates intermediate optical flow with a
lightweight motion perception network, and then a wavelet synthesis network
uses flow aligned context features to predict multi-scale wavelet coefficients
with sparse convolution for efficient target frame reconstruction, where the
sparse valid masks that control computation in each scale are determined by a
crucial threshold ratio. Instead of setting a fixed value like previous
methods, we find that embedding a classifier in the motion perception network
to learn a dynamic threshold for each sample can achieve more computation
reduction with almost no loss of accuracy. On the common high resolution and
animation frame interpolation benchmarks, proposed WaveletVFI can reduce
computation up to 40% while maintaining similar accuracy, making it perform
more efficiently against other state-of-the-arts. Code is available at
https://github.com/ltkong218/WaveletVFI.

<p class="mathjax">Class activation mapping~(CAM), a visualization technique for interpreting
deep learning models, is now commonly used for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation~(WSSS) and object localization~(WSOL). It is the weighted
aggregation of the feature maps by activating the high class-relevance ones.
Current CAM methods achieve it relying on the training outcomes, such as
predicted scores~(forward information), gradients~(backward information), etc.
However, when with small-scale data, unstable training may lead to less
effective model outcomes and generate unreliable weights, finally resulting in
incorrect activation and noisy CAM seeds. In this paper, we propose an
outcome-agnostic CAM approach, called BroadCAM, for small-scale weakly
supervised applications. Since broad learning system (BLS) is independent to
the model learning, BroadCAM can avoid the weights being affected by the
unreliable model outcomes when with small-scale data. By evaluating BroadCAM on
VOC2012 (natural images) and BCSS-WSSS (medical images) for WSSS and
OpenImages30k for WSOL, BroadCAM demonstrates superior performance than
existing CAM methods with small-scale data (less than 5\%) in different CNN
architectures. It also achieves SOTA performance with large-scale training
data. Extensive qualitative comparisons are conducted to demonstrate how
BroadCAM activates the high class-relevance feature maps and generates reliable
CAMs when with small-scale training data.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of a collaboration with Berger-Levrault, an IT company
producing information systems, we are working on migrating Microsoft Access
monolithic applications to the web front-end and microservices back-end. Like
in most software migrations, developers must learn the target technology, and
they will be in charge of the evolution of the migrated system in the future.
To respond to this problem, we propose the developers take over the migration
project. To enable the developers to drive the migration to the target systems,
we propose an Interactive, Iterative, Tooled, Rule-Based Migration approach.
The contributions of this article are (i) an iterative, interactive process to
language, library, GUI and architectural migration; (ii) proposal of a set of
artefacts required to support such an approach; (iii) three different
validations of the approach: (a) library and paradigm usage migration to Java
and Pharo, (b) tables and queries migration to Java and Typescript, (c) form
migration to Java Springboot and Typescript Angular.

<p class="mathjax">The amount and dissemination rate of media content accessible online is
nowadays overwhelming. Recommender Systems filter this information into
manageable streams or feeds, adapted to our personal needs or preferences. It
is of utter importance that algorithms employed to filter information do not
distort or cut out important elements from our perspectives of the world. Under
this principle, it is essential to involve diverse views and teams from the
earliest stages of their design and development. This has been highlighted, for
instance, in recent European Union regulations such as the Digital Services
Act, via the requirement of risk monitoring, including the risk of
discrimination, and the AI Act, through the requirement to involve people with
diverse backgrounds in the development of AI systems. We look into the
geographic diversity of the recommender systems research community,
specifically by analyzing the affiliation countries of the authors who
contributed to the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) during the
last 15 years. This study has been carried out in the framework of the
Diversity in AI - DivinAI project, whose main objective is the long-term
monitoring of diversity in AI forums through a set of indexes.

identifying duplicate audio tracks. Our method applies persistent homology on
local spectral decompositions of audio signals, using filtered cubical
complexes computed from mel-spectrograms. By encoding the audio content in
terms of local Betti curves, our topological audio fingerprints enable accurate
detection of time-aligned audio matchings. Experimental results demonstrate the
accuracy of our algorithm in the detection of tracks with the same audio

<p class="mathjax">The Kemeny method is one of the popular tools for rank aggregation. However,
computing an optimal Kemeny ranking is NP-hard. Consequently, the computational
task of finding a Kemeny ranking has been studied under the lens of
parameterized complexity with respect to many parameters. We first present a
comprehensive relationship, both theoretical and empirical, among these
parameters. Further, we study the problem of computing all distinct Kemeny
rankings under the lens of parameterized complexity. We consider the target
Kemeny score, number of candidates, average distance of input rankings, maximum
range of any candidate, and unanimity width as our parameters. For all these
parameters, we already have FPT algorithms. We find that any desirable number
of Kemeny rankings can also be found without substantial increase in running
time. We also present FPT approximation algorithms for Kemeny rank aggregation
with respect to these parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Latent factor models are the dominant backbones of contemporary recommender
systems (RSs) given their performance advantages, where a unique vector
embedding with a fixed dimensionality (e.g., 128) is required to represent each
entity (commonly a user/item). Due to the large number of users and items on
e-commerce sites, the embedding table is arguably the least memory-efficient
component of RSs. For any lightweight recommender that aims to efficiently
scale with the growing size of users/items or to remain applicable in
resource-constrained settings, existing solutions either reduce the number of
embeddings needed via hashing, or sparsify the full embedding table to switch
off selected embedding dimensions. However, as hash collision arises or
embeddings become overly sparse, especially when adapting to a tighter memory
budget, those lightweight recommenders inevitably have to compromise their
accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel compact embedding framework for RSs,
namely Compositional Embedding with Regularized Pruning (CERP). Specifically,
CERP represents each entity by combining a pair of embeddings from two
independent, substantially smaller meta-embedding tables, which are then
jointly pruned via a learnable element-wise threshold. In addition, we
innovatively design a regularized pruning mechanism in CERP, such that the two
sparsified meta-embedding tables are encouraged to encode information that is
mutually complementary. Given the compatibility with agnostic latent factor
models, we pair CERP with two popular recommendation models for extensive
experiments, where results on two real-world datasets under different memory
budgets demonstrate its superiority against state-of-the-art baselines. The
codebase of CERP is available in https://github.com/xurong-liang/CERP.

<p class="mathjax">In the new generation of wireless communication systems, reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) have become competitive network
components to achieve intelligent and reconfigurable network environments.
However, existing work has not fully studied the deployment freedom of
STAR-RIS, which limits further improvements in network communication
performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution based on a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically deploy STAR-RIS and hybrid
beamforming to improve the total communication rate of users in mobile wireless
networks. The paper constructs a STAR-RIS assisted multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) mobile wireless network and jointly optimizes the
dynamic deployment strategy of STAR-RIS and the hybrid beamforming strategy to
maximize the long-term total communication rate of users. To solve this
problem, the paper uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to
optimize the deployment of STAR-RIS and the joint beamforming strategy of
STAR-RIS and the base station. The trained policy can maximize the downlink
transmission rate of the system and meet the real-time decision-making needs of
the system. Numerical simulation results show that compared with the
traditional scheme without using STAR-RIS and fixed STAR-RIS deployment, the
PPO method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the total
communication rate of wireless network users in the service area.

<p class="mathjax">We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless
computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled, but rather there
is a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache. We present a
model for such caching policies which captures the trade-off between this cost
and the cost of cache misses. We characterize optimal caching policies in
general and apply this characterization by deriving a closed form for Hawkes
processes. Since optimal policies for Hawkes processes depend on the history of
arrivals, we also develop history-independent policies which achieve
near-optimal average performance. We evaluate the performances of the optimal
policy and approximate polices using simulations and a data trace of Azure
Functions, Microsoft's FaaS (Function as a Service) platform for serverless

<p class="mathjax">In social situations, individuals often encounter communication challenges,
particularly when adapting to new environments. While some studies have
acknowledged the potential of AR social games to aid in effective socialization
to some extent, little attention has been given to AR HMD-based games
specifically designed to facilitate social interactions. In response, we
propose AR.S.Space, an AR HMD-based social game that employs augmented reality
features to engage users with virtual social agents through asynchronous
communication. The game aims to mitigate the unease associated with initial
social interactions and foster long-term connections. To assess its efficacy, a
user study was conducted within a specific scenario (an office space),
gathering quantitative data and qualitative feedback through questionnaires and
interviews. The findings highlight the game's potential to enhance
socialization in small-scale environments. Moreover, the study offers valuable
design guidelines for future research and the application of AR social games in
similar settings.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) has shown a strong capability of learning
dynamic graphs by exploiting both spatial and temporal features. Although DGNN
has recently received considerable attention by AI community and various DGNN
models have been proposed, building a distributed system for efficient DGNN
training is still challenging. It has been well recognized that how to
partition the dynamic graph and assign workloads to multiple GPUs plays a
critical role in training acceleration. Existing works partition a dynamic
graph into snapshots or temporal sequences, which only work well when the graph
has uniform spatio-temporal structures. However, dynamic graphs in practice are
not uniformly structured, with some snapshots being very dense while others are
sparse. To address this issue, we propose DGC, a distributed DGNN training
system that achieves a 1.25x - 7.52x speedup over the state-of-the-art in our
testbed. DGC's success stems from a new graph partitioning method that
partitions dynamic graphs into chunks, which are essentially subgraphs with
modest training workloads and few inter connections. This partitioning
algorithm is based on graph coarsening, which can run very fast on large
graphs. In addition, DGC has a highly efficient run-time, powered by the
proposed chunk fusion and adaptive stale aggregation techniques. Extensive
experimental results on 3 typical DGNN models and 4 popular dynamic graph
datasets are presented to show the effectiveness of DGC.

<p class="mathjax">React Native is a widely-used open-source framework that facilitates the
development of cross-platform mobile apps. The framework enables JavaScript
code to interact with native-side code, such as Objective-C/Swift for iOS and
Java/Kotlin for Android, via a communication mechanism provided by React
Native. However, previous research and tools have overlooked this mechanism,
resulting in incomplete analysis of React Native app code. To address this
limitation, we have developed REUNIFY, a prototype tool that integrates the
JavaScript and native-side code of React Native apps into an intermediate
language that can be processed by the Soot static analysis framework. By doing
so, REUNIFY enables the generation of a comprehensive model of the app's
behavior. Our evaluation indicates that, by leveraging REUNIFY, the Soot-based
framework can improve its coverage of static analysis for the 1,007 most
popular React Native Android apps, augmenting the number of lines of Jimple
code by 70%. Additionally, we observed an average increase of 84% in new nodes
reached in the callgraph for these apps, after integrating REUNIFY. When
REUNIFY is used for taint flow analysis, an average of two additional privacy
leaks were identified. Overall, our results demonstrate that REUNIFY
significantly enhances the Soot-based framework's capability to analyze React
Native Android apps.

<p class="mathjax">Since the origins of the Internet, various vulnerabilities exploiting the IP
fragmentation process have plagued IPv4 protocol, many leading to a wide range
of attacks. IPv6 modified the handling of fragmentations and introduced a
specific extension header, not solving the related problems, as proved by
extensive literature. One of the primary sources of problems has been the
overlapping fragments, which result in unexpected or malicious packets when
reassembled. To overcome the problem related to fragmentation, the authors of
RFC 5722 decided that IPv6 hosts MUST silently drop overlapping fragments.
<br />Since then, several studies have proposed methodologies to check if IPv6
hosts accept overlapping fragments and are still vulnerable to related attacks.
However, some of the above methodologies have not been proven complete or need
to be more accurate. In this paper we propose a novel model to check IPv6
fragmentation handling specifically suited for the reassembling strategies of
modern operating systems. Previous models, indeed, considered OS reassembly
policy as byte-based. However, nowadays, reassembly policies are
fragment-based, making previous models inadequate. Our model leverages the
commutative property of the checksum, simplifying the whole assessing process.
Starting with this new model, we were able to better evaluate the RFC-5722 and
RFC-9099 compliance of modern operating systems against fragmentation handling.
Our results suggest that IPv6 fragmentation can still be considered a threat
and that more effort is needed to solve related security issues.

<p class="mathjax">This study investigates the use of causal narratives in public social media
communications by U.S. public agencies over the first fifteen months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We extract causal narratives in the form of cause/effect
pairs from official communications, analyzing the resulting semantic network to
understand the structure and dependencies among concepts within agency
discourse and the evolution of that discourse over time. We show that although
the semantic network of causally-linked claims is complex and dynamic, there is
considerable consistency across agencies in their causal assertions. We also
show that the position of concepts within the structure of causal discourse has
a significant impact on message retransmission net of controls, an important
engagement outcome.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting objects using mobile
robots in the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League, with a primary
focus on detecting the ball. The challenge lies in detecting a dynamic object
in varying lighting conditions and blurred images caused by fast movements. To
address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network
architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic
platforms. The proposed CNN is trained to achieve high precision classification
of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial
positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing
high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily
rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a
composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic
weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of
100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an
execution time of around 170 $\mu$s per hypotheses. By combining the proposed
approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on
average, can be achieved compared to the original CNN. Overall, this paper
provides an efficient solution for an enhanced detection of objects, especially
the ball, in computationally constrained robotic platforms.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes a robust Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) framework that
mitigates the negative transfer problem by incorporating a robust
target-supervision strategy. It leverages ensemble learning and includes
diverse, complementary label feedback, alleviating the effect of incorrect
feedback and promoting pseudo-label refinement. Rather than relying exclusively
on first-order moments for distribution alignment, our approach offers explicit
objectives to optimize intra-class compactness and inter-class separation with
the inferred source prototypes and highly-confident target samples in a
domain-invariant fashion. Notably, we ensure source data privacy by eliminating
the need to access the source data during the adaptation phase through a priori
inference of source prototypes. We conducted a series of comprehensive
experiments, including an ablation analysis, covering a range of partial domain
adaptation tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets corroborate
our framework's enhanced robustness and generalization, demonstrating its
superiority over existing state-of-the-art PDA approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Rising inequality is a critical concern for contemporary societies globally,
to the extent that emerging high-growth economies such as China have identified
common prosperity as a central goal. Yet, the role and mechanisms of digital
disruptions as a cause of inequality and the effectiveness of existing remedies
such as taxation, are poorly understood. Particularly the implications of the
complex process of technological adoption that requires extensive social
validation beyond weak ties. Similarly, the implications of globalization in
the hyperconnected landscape of the 21st century remains unexplored.
<br />This study aims to shed light in these multifaceted issues. Our findings
indicate that network connectivity and the presence of wide bridges between
clusters are pivotal factors. We also show the limited utility of taxation as a
countermeasure against inequality. Interestingly, the research reveals that the
strategic injection of small cohorts of entrepreneurs can expedite technology
adoption even when connectivity remains moderate, impacting inequality.

<p class="mathjax">Storytelling with family photos, as an important mode of reminiscence-based
activities, can be instrumental in promoting intergenerational communication
between grandparents and grandchildren by strengthening generation bonds and
shared family values. Motivated by challenges that existing technology
approaches encountered for improving intergenerational storytelling (e.g., the
need to hold the tablet, the potential view detachment from the physical world
in Virtual Reality (VR)), we sought to find new ways of using Augmented Reality
(AR) to support intergenerational storytelling, which offers new capabilities
(e.g., 3D models, new interactivity) to enhance the expression for the
storyteller. We conducted a two-part exploratory study, where pairs of
grandparents and grandchildren 1) participated in an in-person storytelling
activity with a semi-structured interview 2) and then a participatory design
session with AR technology probes that we designed to inspire their
exploration. Our findings revealed insights into the possible ways of
intergenerational storytelling, the feasibility and usages of AR in
facilitating it, and the key design implications for leveraging AR in
intergenerational storytelling.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Graph Generation (SGG) plays a pivotal role in downstream
vision-language tasks. Existing SGG methods typically suffer from poor
compositional generalizations on unseen triplets. They are generally trained on
incompletely annotated scene graphs that contain dominant triplets and tend to
bias toward these seen triplets during inference. To address this issue, we
propose a Triplet Calibration and Reduction (T-CAR) framework in this paper. In
our framework, a triplet calibration loss is first presented to regularize the
representations of diverse triplets and to simultaneously excavate the unseen
triplets in incompletely annotated training scene graphs. Moreover, the unseen
space of scene graphs is usually several times larger than the seen space since
it contains a huge number of unrealistic compositions. Thus, we propose an
unseen space reduction loss to shift the attention of excavation to reasonable
unseen compositions to facilitate the model training. Finally, we propose a
contextual encoder to improve the compositional generalizations of unseen
triplets by explicitly modeling the relative spatial relations between subjects
and objects. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves consistent
improvements for zero-shot SGG over state-of-the-art methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/jkli1998/T-CAR.

<p class="mathjax">A new numerical continuum \textit{one-domain} approach (ODA) solver is
presented for the simulation of the transfer processes between a free fluid and
a porous medium. The solver is developed in the \textit{mesoscopic} scale
framework, where a continuous variation of the physical parameters of the
porous medium (e.g., porosity and permeability) is assumed. The
Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations are solved along with the continuity equation,
under the hypothesis of incompressible fluid. The porous medium is assumed to
be fully saturated and can potentially be anisotropic. The domain is
discretized with unstructured meshes allowing local refinements. A fractional
time step procedure is applied, where one predictor and two corrector steps are
solved within each time iteration. The predictor step is solved in the
framework of a marching in space and time procedure, with some important
numerical advantages. The two corrector steps require the solution of large
linear systems, whose matrices are sparse, symmetric and positive definite,
with $\mathcal{M}$-matrix property over Delaunay-meshes. A fast and efficient
solution is obtained using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The
discretization adopted for the two corrector steps can be regarded as a
Two-Point-Flux-Approximation (TPFA) scheme, which, unlike the standard TPFA
schemes, does not require the grid mesh to be $\mathbf{K}$-orthogonal, (with
$\mathbf{K}$ the anisotropy tensor). As demonstrated with the provided test
cases, the proposed scheme correctly retains the anisotropy effects within the
porous medium. Furthermore, it overcomes the restrictions of existing
mesoscopic scale one-domain approachs proposed in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Rising urban populations have led to a surge in vehicle use and made traffic
monitoring and management indispensable. Acoustic traffic monitoring (ATM)
offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to more computationally
expensive methods of monitoring traffic such as those involving computer vision
technologies. In this paper, we present MVD and MVDA: two open datasets for the
development of acoustic traffic monitoring and vehicle-type classification
algorithms, which contain audio recordings of moving vehicles. The dataset
contain four classes- Trucks, Cars, Motorbikes, and a No-vehicle class.
Additionally, we propose a novel and efficient way to accurately classify these
acoustic signals using cepstrum and spectrum based local and global audio
features, and a multi-input neural network. Experimental results show that our
methodology improves upon the established baselines of previous works and
achieves an accuracy of 91.98% and 96.66% on MVD and MVDA Datasets,
respectively. Finally, the proposed model was deployed through an Android
application to make it accessible for testing and demonstrate its efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Security and dependability of devices are paramount for the IoT ecosystem.
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT) is the de facto standard
and the most common alternative for those limited devices that cannot leverage
HTTP. However, the MQTT protocol was designed with no security concern since
initially designed for private networks of the oil and gas industry. Since MQTT
is widely used for real applications, it is under the lens of the security
community, also considering the widespread attacks targeting IoT devices.
Following this direction research, in this paper we present an empirical
security evaluation of several widespread implementations of MQTT system
components, namely five broker libraries and three client libraries. While the
results of our research do not capture very critical flaws, there are several
scenarios where some libraries do not fully adhere to the standard and leave
some margins that could be maliciously exploited and potentially cause system
inconsistencies.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection in low-light scenarios has attracted much attention in the
past few years. A mainstream and representative scheme introduces enhancers as
the pre-processing for regular detectors. However, because of the disparity in
task objectives between the enhancer and detector, this paradigm cannot shine
at its best ability. In this work, we try to arouse the potential of enhancer +
detector. Different from existing works, we extend the illumination-based
enhancers (our newly designed or existing) as a scene decomposition module,
whose removed illumination is exploited as the auxiliary in the detector for
extracting detection-friendly features. A semantic aggregation module is
further established for integrating multi-scale scene-related semantic
information in the context space. Actually, our built scheme successfully
transforms the "trash" (i.e., the ignored illumination in the detector) into
the "treasure" for the detector. Plenty of experiments are conducted to reveal
our superiority against other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be public
if it is accepted.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the remarkable success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for
image synthesis, we study LDM for text-to-video generation, which is a
formidable challenge due to the computational and memory constraints during
both model training and inference. A single LDM is usually only capable of
generating a very limited number of video frames. Some existing works focus on
separate prediction models for generating more video frames, which suffer from
additional training cost and frame-level jittering, however. In this paper, we
propose a framework called "Reuse and Diffuse" dubbed $\textit{VidRD}$ to
produce more frames following the frames already generated by an LDM.
Conditioned on an initial video clip with a small number of frames, additional
frames are iteratively generated by reusing the original latent features and
following the previous diffusion process. Besides, for the autoencoder used for
translation between pixel space and latent space, we inject temporal layers
into its decoder and fine-tune these layers for higher temporal consistency. We
also propose a set of strategies for composing video-text data that involve
diverse content from multiple existing datasets including video datasets for
action recognition and image-text datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves good results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in diffusion models such as ControlNet have enabled
geometrically controllable, high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However,
none of them addresses the question of adding such controllability to
text-to-3D generation. In response, we propose Text2Control3D, a controllable
text-to-3D avatar generation method whose facial expression is controllable
given a monocular video casually captured with hand-held camera. Our main
strategy is to construct the 3D avatar in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
optimized with a set of controlled viewpoint-aware images that we generate from
ControlNet, whose condition input is the depth map extracted from the input
video. When generating the viewpoint-aware images, we utilize cross-reference
attention to inject well-controlled, referential facial expression and
appearance via cross attention. We also conduct low-pass filtering of Gaussian
latent of the diffusion model in order to ameliorate the viewpoint-agnostic
texture problem we observed from our empirical analysis, where the
viewpoint-aware images contain identical textures on identical pixel positions
that are incomprehensible in 3D. Finally, to train NeRF with the images that
are viewpoint-aware yet are not strictly consistent in geometry, our approach
considers per-image geometric variation as a view of deformation from a shared
3D canonical space. Consequently, we construct the 3D avatar in a canonical
space of deformable NeRF by learning a set of per-image deformation via
deformation field table. We demonstrate the empirical results and discuss the
effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid evolution and diversification of Internet applications, their
communication-quality criteria are continuously evolving. To globally optimize
communication quality, the Internet's control plane thus needs to optimize
inter-domain paths on diverse criteria, and should provide flexibility for
adding new criteria or modifying existing ones. However, existing inter-domain
routing protocols and proposals satisfy these requirements at best to a limited
degree.
<br />We propose IREC, an inter-domain routing architecture that enables
multi-criteria path optimization with extensible criteria through parallel
execution and real-time addition of independent routing algorithms, together
with the possibility for end domains to express their desired criteria to the
control plane. We show IREC's viability by implementing it on a global testbed,
and use simulations on a realistic Internet topology to demonstrate IREC's
potential for path optimization in real-world deployments.

<p class="mathjax">For traditional modular software systems, "high cohesion, low coupling" is a
recommended setting while it remains so for microservice architectures.
However, coupling phenomena commonly exist therein which are caused by
cross-service calls and dependencies. In addition, it is noticeable that teams
for microservice projects can also suffer from high coupling issues in terms of
their cross-service contribution, which can inevitably result in technical debt
and high managerial costs. Such organizational coupling needs to be detected
and mitigated in time to prevent future losses. Therefore, this paper proposes
an automatable approach to evaluate the organizational couple by investigating
the microservice ownership and cross-service contribution.

encompassing various techniques and methodologies to ensure the quality and
reliability of software systems. However, with the advent of generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems, new challenges arise in the testing
domain. These systems, capable of generating novel and creative outputs,
introduce unique complexities that require novel testing approaches. In this
paper, I aim to explore the challenges posed by generative AI systems and
discuss potential opportunities for future research in the field of testing. I
will touch on the specific characteristics of GenAI systems that make
traditional testing techniques inadequate or insufficient. By addressing these

<p class="mathjax">Person Re-identification (ReID) plays a more and more crucial role in recent
years with a wide range of applications. Existing ReID methods are suffering
from the challenges of misalignment and occlusions, which degrade the
performance dramatically. Most methods tackle such challenges by utilizing
external tools to locate body parts or exploiting matching strategies.
Nevertheless, the inevitable domain gap between the datasets utilized for
external tools and the ReID datasets and the complicated matching process make
these methods unreliable and sensitive to noises. In this paper, we propose a
Region Generation and Assessment Network (RGANet) to effectively and
efficiently detect the human body regions and highlight the important regions.
In the proposed RGANet, we first devise a Region Generation Module (RGM) which
utilizes the pre-trained CLIP to locate the human body regions using semantic
prototypes extracted from text descriptions. Learnable prompt is designed to
eliminate domain gap between CLIP datasets and ReID datasets. Then, to measure
the importance of each generated region, we introduce a Region Assessment
Module (RAM) that assigns confidence scores to different regions and reduces
the negative impact of the occlusion regions by lower scores. The RAM consists
of a discrimination-aware indicator and an invariance-aware indicator, where
the former indicates the capability to distinguish from different identities
and the latter represents consistency among the images of the same class of
human body regions. Extensive experimental results for six widely-used
benchmarks including three tasks (occluded, partial, and holistic) demonstrate
the superiority of RGANet against state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Citation field learning is to segment a citation string into fields of
interest such as author, title, and venue. Extracting such fields from
citations is crucial for citation indexing, researcher profile analysis, etc.
User-generated resources like academic homepages and Curriculum Vitae, provide
rich citation field information. However, extracting fields from these
resources is challenging due to inconsistent citation styles, incomplete
sentence syntax, and insufficient training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel algorithm, CIFAL (citation field learning by anchor
learning), to boost the citation field learning performance. CIFAL leverages
the anchor learning, which is model-agnostic for any Pre-trained Language
Model, to help capture citation patterns from the data of different citation
styles. The experiments demonstrate that CIFAL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in citation field learning, achieving a 2.83% improvement in
field-level F1-scores. Extensive analysis of the results further confirms the
effectiveness of CIFAL quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">In intent detection tasks, leveraging meaningful semantic information from
intent labels can be particularly beneficial for few-shot scenarios. However,
existing few-shot intent detection methods either ignore the intent labels,
(e.g. treating intents as indices) or do not fully utilize this information
(e.g. only using part of the intent labels). In this work, we present an
end-to-end One-to-All system that enables the comparison of an input utterance
with all label candidates. The system can then fully utilize label semantics in
this way. Experiments on three few-shot intent detection tasks demonstrate that
One-to-All is especially effective when the training resource is extremely
scarce, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 1-, 3- and 5-shot settings.
Moreover, we present a novel pretraining strategy for our model that utilizes
indirect supervision from paraphrasing, enabling zero-shot cross-domain
generalization on intent detection tasks. Our code is at

<p class="mathjax">Large language models, particularly those akin to the rapidly progressing GPT
series, are gaining traction for their expansive influence. While there is keen
interest in their applicability within medical domains such as psychology,
tangible explorations on real-world data remain scant. Concurrently, users on
social media platforms are increasingly vocalizing personal sentiments; under
specific thematic umbrellas, these sentiments often manifest as negative
emotions, sometimes escalating to suicidal inclinations. Timely discernment of
such cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively
intervene and potentially avert dire circumstances. Our study ventured into
this realm by experimenting on two pivotal tasks: suicidal risk and cognitive
distortion identification on Chinese social media platforms. Using supervised
learning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large
language models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the
large language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily
attributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably,
while GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows
significant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. To
our knowledge, this investigation stands as the maiden attempt at gauging large
language models on Chinese social media tasks. This study underscores the
forward-looking and transformative implications of using large language models
in the field of psychology. It lays the groundwork for future applications in
psychological research and practice.

<p class="mathjax">Software-Defined Networking (SDN) significantly simplifies programming,
reconfiguring, and optimizing network devices, such as switches and routers.
The de facto standard for programmming SDN devices is the P4 language. However,
the flexibility and power of P4, and SDN more generally, gives rise to
important risks. As a number of incidents at major cloud providers have shown,
errors in SDN programs can compromise the availability of networks, leaving
them in a non-functional state. The focus of this paper are errors in
control-plane programs that interact with P4-enabled network devices via the
standardized P4Runtime API. For clients of the P4Runtime API it is easy to make
mistakes that lead to catastrophic failures, despite the use of Google's
Protocol Buffers as an interface definition language.
<br />This paper proposes P4R-Type, a novel verified P4Runtime API for Scala that
performs static checks for P4 control plane operations, ruling out mismatches
between P4 tables, allowed actions, and action parameters. As a formal
foundation of P4R-Type, we present the $F_{\text{P4R}}$ calculus and its typing
system, which ensure that well-typed programs never get stuck by issuing
invalid P4Runtime operations. We evaluate the safety and flexibility of
P4R-Type with 3 case studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that formalises P4Runtime control plane applications, and a typing
discipline ensuring the correctness of P4Runtime operations.

<p class="mathjax">Learning-based techniques, especially advanced Large Language Models (LLMs)
for code, have gained considerable popularity in various software engineering
(SE) tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing better
learning-based models and pay less attention to the properties of datasets.
Learning-based models, including popular LLMs for code, heavily rely on data,
and the data's properties (e.g., data distribution) could significantly affect
their behavior. We conducted an exploratory study on the distribution of SE
data and found that such data usually follows a skewed distribution (i.e.,
long-tailed distribution) where a small number of classes have an extensive
collection of samples, while a large number of classes have very few samples.
We investigate three distinct SE tasks and analyze the impacts of long-tailed
distribution on the performance of LLMs for code. Our experimental results
reveal that the long-tailed distribution has a substantial impact on the
effectiveness of LLMs for code. Specifically, LLMs for code perform between
30.0\% and 254.0\% worse on data samples associated with infrequent labels
compared to data samples of frequent labels. Our study provides a better
understanding of the effects of long-tailed distributions on popular LLMs for
code and insights for the future development of SE automation.

<p class="mathjax">As an essential component part of the Intelligent Transportation System
(ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic
issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has
been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and
sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection
methods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive
data obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises
privacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a
federated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared
in the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited
computing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further
propose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively
lighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby
reducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing
capabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to
edge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an
improved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse
ratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show
that the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while
saving considerable communication costs.

<p class="mathjax">As many types of IoT devices worm their way into numerous settings and many
aspects of our daily lives, awareness of their presence and functionality
becomes a source of major concern. Hidden IoT devices can snoop (via sensing)
on nearby unsuspecting users, and impact the environment where unaware users
are present, via actuation. This prompts, respectively, privacy and
security/safety issues. The dangers of hidden IoT devices have been recognized
and prior research suggested some means of mitigation, mostly based on traffic
analysis or using specialized hardware to uncover devices. While such
approaches are partially effective, there is currently no comprehensive
approach to IoT device transparency. Prompted in part by recent privacy
regulations (GDPR and CCPA), this paper motivates and constructs a
privacy-agile Root-of-Trust architecture for IoT devices, called PAISA:
Privacy-Agile IoT Sensing and Actuation. It guarantees timely and secure
announcements about IoT devices' presence and their capabilities. PAISA has two
components: one on the IoT device that guarantees periodic announcements of its
presence even if all device software is compromised, and the other that runs on
the user device, which captures and processes announcements. Notably, PAISA
requires no hardware modifications; it uses a popular off-the-shelf Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE) -- ARM TrustZone. This work also comprises a fully
functional (open-sourced) prototype implementation of PAISA, which includes: an
IoT device that makes announcements via IEEE 802.11 WiFi beacons and an Android
smartphone-based app that captures and processes announcements. Both security
and performance of PAISA design and prototype are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Face analysis tasks have a wide range of applications, but the universal
facial representation has only been explored in a few works. In this paper, we
explore high-performance pre-training methods to boost the face analysis tasks
such as face alignment and face parsing. We propose a self-supervised
pre-training framework, called \textbf{\it Mask Contrastive Face (MCF)}, with
mask image modeling and a contrastive strategy specially adjusted for face
domain tasks. To improve the facial representation quality, we use feature map
of a pre-trained visual backbone as a supervision item and use a partially
pre-trained decoder for mask image modeling. To handle the face identity during
the pre-training stage, we further use random masks to build contrastive
learning pairs. We conduct the pre-training on the LAION-FACE-cropped dataset,
a variants of LAION-FACE 20M, which contains more than 20 million face images
from Internet websites. For efficiency pre-training, we explore our framework
pre-training performance on a small part of LAION-FACE-cropped and verify the
superiority with different pre-training settings. Our model pre-trained with
the full pre-training dataset outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
multiple downstream tasks. Our model achieves 0.932 NME$_{diag}$ for AFLW-19
face alignment and 93.96 F1 score for LaPa face parsing. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">As it is empirically observed that Vision Transformers (ViTs) are quite
insensitive to the order of input tokens, the need for an appropriate
self-supervised pretext task that enhances the location awareness of ViTs is
becoming evident. To address this, we present DropPos, a novel pretext task
designed to reconstruct Dropped Positions. The formulation of DropPos is
simple: we first drop a large random subset of positional embeddings and then
the model classifies the actual position for each non-overlapping patch among
all possible positions solely based on their visual appearance. To avoid
trivial solutions, we increase the difficulty of this task by keeping only a
subset of patches visible. Additionally, considering there may be different
patches with similar visual appearances, we propose position smoothing and
attentive reconstruction strategies to relax this classification problem, since
it is not necessary to reconstruct their exact positions in these cases.
Empirical evaluations of DropPos show strong capabilities. DropPos outperforms
supervised pre-training and achieves competitive results compared with
state-of-the-art self-supervised alternatives on a wide range of downstream
benchmarks. This suggests that explicitly encouraging spatial reasoning
abilities, as DropPos does, indeed contributes to the improved location
awareness of ViTs. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/DropPos.

<p class="mathjax">Measuring distance or similarity between time-series data is a fundamental
aspect of many applications including classification and clustering. Existing
measures may fail to capture similarities due to local trends (shapes) and may
even produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks
for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable
for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for
applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that
are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a
decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable
"closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each
column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to
compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis
that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of
DTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also
demonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to
Dynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends
rather than scale play a decisive role.

<p class="mathjax">Modern science and industry rely on computational models for simulation,
prediction, and data analysis. Spatial blind source separation (SBSS) is a
model used to analyze spatial data. Designed explicitly for spatial data
analysis, it is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, a
challenge to its practical use is setting two complex tuning parameters, which
requires parameter space analysis. In this paper, we focus on sensitivity
analysis (SA). SBSS parameters and outputs are spatial data, which makes SA
difficult as few SA approaches in the literature assume such complex data on
both sides of the model. Based on the requirements in our design study with
statistics experts, we developed a visual analytics prototype for data type
agnostic visual sensitivity analysis that fits SBSS and other contexts. The
main advantage of our approach is that it requires only dissimilarity measures
for parameter settings and outputs. We evaluated the prototype heuristically
with visualization experts and through interviews with two SBSS experts. In
addition, we show the transferability of our approach by applying it to
microclimate simulations. Study participants could confirm suspected and known
parameter-output relations, find surprising associations, and identify
parameter subspaces to examine in the future. During our design study and
evaluation, we identified challenging future research opportunities.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is important to leverage the full potential
of machine learning (ML). In practice, users are often interested in
multi-objective (MO) problems, i.e., optimizing potentially conflicting
objectives, like accuracy and energy consumption. To tackle this, the vast
majority of MO-ML algorithms return a Pareto front of non-dominated machine
learning models to the user. Optimizing the hyperparameters of such algorithms
is non-trivial as evaluating a hyperparameter configuration entails evaluating
the quality of the resulting Pareto front. In literature, there are known
indicators that assess the quality of a Pareto front (e.g., hypervolume, R2) by
quantifying different properties (e.g., volume, proximity to a reference
point). However, choosing the indicator that leads to the desired Pareto front
might be a hard task for a user. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
interactive HPO approach tailored towards multi-objective ML leveraging
preference learning to extract desiderata from users that guide the
optimization. Instead of relying on the user guessing the most suitable
indicator for their needs, our approach automatically learns an appropriate
indicator. Concretely, we leverage pairwise comparisons of distinct Pareto
fronts to learn such an appropriate quality indicator. Then, we optimize the
hyperparameters of the underlying MO-ML algorithm towards this learned
indicator using a state-of-the-art HPO approach. In an experimental study
targeting the environmental impact of ML, we demonstrate that our approach
leads to substantially better Pareto fronts compared to optimizing based on a
wrong indicator pre-selected by the user, and performs comparable in the case
of an advanced user knowing which indicator to pick.

distributed across the edge-cloud continuum. FaaS functions are stateless by
nature, leading to high elasticity and transparent invocation. Supporting
stateful applications, however, requires integrating data storage in FaaS,
which is not trivial in an edge-cloud environment.
<br />We propose Enoki, an architecture for stateful FaaS computing replicated
across the edge-cloud continuum. Enoki integrates a replicated key-value store
with single-node FaaS systems at edge and cloud nodes in order to provide
low-latency local data access for functions without breaking the abstraction of

<p class="mathjax">Multiple works have leveraged the public Bitcoin ledger to estimate the
revenue cybercriminals obtain from their victims. Estimations focusing on the
same target often do not agree, due to the use of different methodologies, seed
addresses, and time periods. These factors make it challenging to understand
the impact of their methodological differences. Furthermore, they underestimate
the revenue due to the (lack of) coverage on the target's payment addresses,
but how large this impact remains unknown.
<br />In this work, we perform the first systematic analysis on the estimation of
cybercrime bitcoin revenue. We implement a tool that can replicate the
different estimation methodologies. Using our tool we can quantify, in a
controlled setting, the impact of the different methodology steps. In contrast
to what is widely believed, we show that the revenue is not always
underestimated. There exist methodologies that can introduce huge
overestimation. We collect 30,424 payment addresses and use them to compare the
financial impact of 6 cybercrimes (ransomware, clippers, sextortion, Ponzi
schemes, giveaway scams, exchange scams) and of 141 cybercriminal groups. We
observe that the popular multi-input clustering fails to discover addresses for
40% of groups. We quantify, for the first time, the impact of the (lack of)
coverage on the estimation. For this, we propose two techniques to achieve high
coverage, possibly nearly complete, on the DeadBolt server ransomware. Our
expanded coverage enables estimating DeadBolt's revenue at $2.47M, 39 times
higher than the estimation using two popular Internet scan engines.

<p class="mathjax">In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled samples can be utilized through
augmentation and consistency regularization. However, we observed certain
samples, even undergoing strong augmentation, are still correctly classified
with high confidence, resulting in a loss close to zero. It indicates that
these samples have been already learned well and do not provide any additional
optimization benefits to the model. We refer to these samples as ``naive
samples". Unfortunately, existing SSL models overlook the characteristics of
naive samples, and they just apply the same learning strategy to all samples.
To further optimize the SSL model, we emphasize the importance of giving
attention to naive samples and augmenting them in a more diverse manner. Sample
adaptive augmentation (SAA) is proposed for this stated purpose and consists of
two modules: 1) sample selection module; 2) sample augmentation module.
Specifically, the sample selection module picks out {naive samples} based on
historical training information at each epoch, then the naive samples will be
augmented in a more diverse manner in the sample augmentation module. Thanks to
the extreme ease of implementation of the above modules, SAA is advantageous
for being simple and lightweight. We add SAA on top of FixMatch and FlexMatch
respectively, and experiments demonstrate SAA can significantly improve the
models. For example, SAA helped improve the accuracy of FixMatch from 92.50% to
94.76% and that of FlexMatch from 95.01% to 95.31% on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-3D generation from a single-view image is a popular but challenging
task in 3D vision. Although numerous methods have been proposed, existing works
still suffer from the inconsistency issues, including 1) semantic
inconsistency, 2) geometric inconsistency, and 3) saturation inconsistency,
resulting in distorted, overfitted, and over-saturated generations. In light of
the above issues, we present Consist3D, a three-stage framework Chasing for
semantic-, geometric-, and saturation-Consistent Text-to-3D generation from a
single image, in which the first two stages aim to learn parameterized
consistency tokens, and the last stage is for optimization. Specifically, the
semantic encoding stage learns a token independent of views and estimations,
promoting semantic consistency and robustness. Meanwhile, the geometric
encoding stage learns another token with comprehensive geometry and
reconstruction constraints under novel-view estimations, reducing overfitting
and encouraging geometric consistency. Finally, the optimization stage benefits
from the semantic and geometric tokens, allowing a low classifier-free guidance
scale and therefore preventing oversaturation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Consist3D produces more consistent, faithful, and photo-realistic 3D
assets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, Consist3D
also allows background and object editing through text prompts.

<p class="mathjax">Irregular terrain has a pronounced effect on the propagation of seismic and
acoustic wavefields but is not straightforwardly reconciled with structured
finite-difference (FD) methods used to model such phenomena. Methods currently
detailed in the literature are generally limited in scope application-wise or
non-trivial to apply to real-world geometries. With this in mind, a general
immersed boundary treatment capable of imposing a range of boundary conditions
in a relatively equation-agnostic manner has been developed, alongside a
framework implementing this approach, intending to complement emerging
code-generation paradigms. The approach is distinguished by the use of
N-dimensional Taylor-series extrapolants constrained by boundary conditions
imposed at some suitably-distributed set of surface points. The extrapolation
process is encapsulated in modified derivative stencils applied in the vicinity
of the boundary, utilizing hyperspherical support regions. This method ensures
boundary representation is consistent with the FD discretization: both must be
considered in tandem. Furthermore, high-dimensional and vector boundary
conditions can be applied without approximation prior to discretization. A
consistent methodology can thus be applied across free and rigid surfaces with
the first and second-order acoustic wave equation formulations. Application to
both equations is demonstrated, and numerical examples based on analytic and
real-world topography implementing free and rigid surfaces in 2D and 3D are
presented.

<p class="mathjax">The roll out of new mobile network generations poses hard challenges due to
various factors such as cost-benefit tradeoffs, existing infrastructure, and
new technology aspects. In particular, one of the main challenges for the 5G
deployment lies in optimal 5G radio coverage while accounting for diverse
service performance metrics. This paper introduces a Deep Learning-based
approach to assist in 5G radio planning by utilizing data from
previous-generation cells. Our solution relies on a custom graph representation
to leverage the information available from existing cells, and employs a Graph
Neural Network (GNN) model to process such data efficiently. In our evaluation,
we test its potential to model the transition from 4G to 5G NSA using
real-world data from a UK mobile network operator. The experimental results
show that our solution achieves high accuracy in predicting key performance
indicators in new 5G cells, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)~&lt;17\%
when evaluated on samples from the same area where it was trained. Moreover, we
test its generalization capability over various geographical areas not included
in the training, achieving a MAPE~&lt;19\%. This suggests beneficial properties
for achieving robust solutions applicable to 5G planning in new areas without
the need of retraining.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a method for determining the area explored by a
line-sweep sensor during an area-covering mission in a two-dimensional plane.
Accurate knowledge of the explored area is crucial for various applications in
robotics, such as mapping, surveillance, and coverage optimization. The
proposed method leverages the concept of coverage measure of the environment
and its relation to the topological degree in the plane, to estimate the extent
of the explored region. In addition, we extend the approach to uncertain
coverage measure values using interval analysis. This last contribution allows
for a guaranteed characterization of the explored area, essential considering
the often critical character of area-covering missions. Finally, this paper
also proposes a novel algorithm for computing the topological degree in the
2-dimensional plane, for all the points inside an area of interest, which
differs from existing solutions that compute the topological degree for single
points. The applicability of the method is evaluated through a real-world
experiment.

<p class="mathjax">Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are the primary power source in various
applications due to their high energy and power density. Their market was
estimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. However, the widespread
adoption of Li-ion batteries has resulted in counterfeit cell production, which
can pose safety hazards to users. Counterfeit cells can cause explosions or
fires, and their prevalence in the market makes it difficult for users to
detect fake cells. Indeed, current battery authentication methods can be
susceptible to advanced counterfeiting techniques and are often not adaptable
to various cells and systems. In this paper, we improve the state of the art on
battery authentication by proposing two novel methodologies, DCAuth and
EISthentication, which leverage the internal characteristics of each cell
through Machine Learning models. Our methods automatically authenticate
lithium-ion battery models and architectures using data from their regular
usage without the need for any external device. They are also resilient to the
most common and critical counterfeit practices and can scale to several
batteries and devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
methodologies, we analyze time-series data from a total of 20 datasets that we
have processed to extract meaningful features for our analysis. Our methods
achieve high accuracy in battery authentication for both architectures (up to
0.99) and models (up to 0.96). Moreover, our methods offer comparable
identification performances. By using our proposed methodologies, manufacturers
can ensure that devices only use legitimate batteries, guaranteeing the
operational state of any system and safety measures for the users.

<p class="mathjax">Recent popularity surrounds large AI language models due to their impressive
natural language capabilities. They contribute significantly to
language-related tasks, including prompt-based learning, making them valuable
for various specific tasks. This approach unlocks their full potential,
enhancing precision and generalization. Research communities are actively
exploring their applications, with ChatGPT receiving recognition. Despite
extensive research on large language models, their potential in recommendation
scenarios still needs to be explored. This study aims to fill this gap by
investigating ChatGPT's capabilities as a zero-shot recommender system. Our
goals include evaluating its ability to use user preferences for
recommendations, reordering existing recommendation lists, leveraging
information from similar users, and handling cold-start situations. We assess
ChatGPT's performance through comprehensive experiments using three datasets
(MovieLens Small, Last.FM, and Facebook Book). We compare ChatGPT's performance
against standard recommendation algorithms and other large language models,
such as GPT-3.5 and PaLM-2. To measure recommendation effectiveness, we employ
widely-used evaluation metrics like Mean Average Precision (MAP), Recall,
Precision, F1, normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), Item Coverage,
Expected Popularity Complement (EPC), Average Coverage of Long Tail (ACLT),
Average Recommendation Popularity (ARP), and Popularity-based Ranking-based
Equal Opportunity (PopREO). Through thoroughly exploring ChatGPT's abilities in
recommender systems, our study aims to contribute to the growing body of
research on the versatility and potential applications of large language
models. Our experiment code is available on the GitHub repository:

task performance for speech data. We propose Modified Barlow Twins (MBT) with
normalized latents to enforce scale-invariance and evaluate on speaker

MBT improves representation generalization over original BT, especially when
fine-tuning with limited target data. This highlights the importance of
designing objectives that encourage invariant and transferable representations.
Our analysis provides insights into how the BT learning objective can be

SmartNICs have resource multiplexing limitations. For example, existing
solutions lack multi-tenancy capabilities such as performance isolation and QoS
provisioning for compute and IO resources. Compared to standard NIC data paths
with a well-defined set of offloaded functions, unpredictable execution times
of SmartNIC kernels make conventional approaches for multi-tenancy and QoS
insufficient. We fill this gap with OSMOSIS, a SmartNICs resource manager
co-design. OSMOSIS extends existing OS mechanisms to enable dynamic hardware
resource multiplexing on top of the on-path packet processing data plane. We
implement OSMOSIS within an open-source RISC-V-based 400Gbit/s SmartNIC. Our
performance results demonstrate that OSMOSIS fully supports multi-tenancy and
enables broader adoption of SmartNICs in datacenters with low overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Motivation: We explored how explainable AI (XAI) can help to shed light into
the inner workings of neural networks for protein function prediction, by
extending the widely used XAI method of integrated gradients such that latent
representations inside of transformer models, which were finetuned to Gene
Ontology term and Enzyme Commission number prediction, can be inspected too.
Results: The approach enabled us to identify amino acids in the sequences that
the transformers pay particular attention to, and to show that these relevant
sequence parts reflect expectations from biology and chemistry, both in the
embedding layer and inside of the model, where we identified transformer heads
with a statistically significant correspondence of attribution maps with ground

many proteins. Availability and Implementation: Source code can be accessed at

<p class="mathjax">The rapidly advancing domain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has
sparked significant interests in developing techniques to make AI systems more
transparent and understandable. Nevertheless, in real-world contexts, the
methods of explainability and their evaluation strategies present numerous
limitations.Moreover, the scope of responsible AI extends beyond just
explainability. In this paper, we explore these limitations and discuss their
implications in a boarder context of responsible AI when considering other

computer vision applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and
augmented reality. This task finds another important application in sports
analytics and, in this work, we present a novel method for 3D basketball
localization from a single calibrated image. Our approach predicts the object's
height in pixels in image space by estimating its projection onto the ground
plane within the image, leveraging the image itself and the object's location
as inputs. The 3D coordinates of the ball are then reconstructed by exploiting
the known projection matrix. Extensive experiments on the public DeepSport
dataset, which provides ground truth annotations for 3D ball location alongside
camera calibration information for each image, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, offering substantial accuracy improvements compared to recent work.
Our work opens up new possibilities for enhanced ball tracking and
understanding, advancing computer vision in diverse domains. The source code of

Traditional deep learning methods face two challenges: efficiently using
information in long speech sequences and high computational costs. To address
these, we introduce the Spiking Structured State Space Model (Spiking-S4). This
approach merges the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) with the
long-range sequence modeling capabilities of Structured State Space Models
(S4), offering a compelling solution. Evaluation on the DNS Challenge and
VoiceBank+Demand Datasets confirms that Spiking-S4 rivals existing Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) methods but with fewer computational resources, as
evidenced by reduced parameters and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs).

<p class="mathjax">Chase-Lev deque is a concurrent data structure designed for efficient load
balancing in multiprocessor scheduling. It employs a work-stealing strategy,
where each thread possesses its own work-stealing deque to store tasks, and
idle threads steal tasks from other threads. However, given the inherent risk
of bugs in software, particularly in a multiprocessor environment, it is
crucial to formally establish the correctness of programs and data structures.
To our knowledge, no formal verification work for the Chase-Lev deque has met
three key criteria: (1) utilizing a minimal trusted computing base, (2) using a
realistic and unrestricted implementation, and (3) proving a strong
specification.
<br />In this thesis, we address this gap by presenting the formal verification of
the Chase-Lev deque using a concurrent separation logic. Our work is mechanized
in the Coq proof assistant, and our verified implementation is both realistic
and unbounded in terms of the number of tasks it can handle. Also, we adopt
linearizability as the specification, as it is widely recognized as a strong
specification for concurrent data structures. Consequently, our work satisfies
all three aforementioned criteria for formal verification. Additionally, we
extend our verification to support safe memory reclamation, and provide a basis
for verifying the Chase-Lev deque in the relaxed memory model.

carry-generation logic is proposed. The carry-generation logic is based on the
sorting network, and it can generate a carry bit within 2 logical stages other
than 3 stages as in previous school book full adders. Collaborating with the
adjusted full adder logic, the proposed (7,2) compressor achieves using only 11
basic logical stages. Testing this new design in a binary arry with 7 rows and
8 columns, and the result shows that this design have higher proformance than
previous designs. This method is suitable for high proformance cases in

from a predetermined set of contents, considering the additional context
indicated by users' interactions with a chat interface. We evaluate ranking
metrics, user experience, and fairness of recommendations, comparing a
personalised and a non-personalised version of the system, in a between-subject

non-personalised in terms of accuracy and general user satisfaction, while both
versions increase the visibility of items which are not in the top of the
recommendation lists. However, both versions present inconsistent behavior in
terms of fairness, as the system may generate recommendations which are not

<p class="mathjax">We present ProvG-Searcher, a novel approach for detecting known APT behaviors
within system security logs. Our approach leverages provenance graphs, a
comprehensive graph representation of event logs, to capture and depict data
provenance relations by mapping system entities as nodes and their interactions
as edges. We formulate the task of searching provenance graphs as a subgraph
matching problem and employ a graph representation learning method. The central
component of our search methodology involves embedding of subgraphs in a vector
space where subgraph relationships can be directly evaluated. We achieve this
through the use of order embeddings that simplify subgraph matching to
straightforward comparisons between a query and precomputed subgraph
representations. To address challenges posed by the size and complexity of
provenance graphs, we propose a graph partitioning scheme and a
behavior-preserving graph reduction method. Overall, our technique offers
significant computational efficiency, allowing most of the search computation
to be performed offline while incorporating a lightweight comparison step
during query execution. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate
that ProvG-Searcher achieves superior performance, with an accuracy exceeding
99% in detecting query behaviors and a false positive rate of approximately
0.02%, outperforming other approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The Lipschitz bound, a technique from robust statistics, can limit the
maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account
associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method
for examining the output stability of machine learning models without incurring
additional computation costs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which
operate on non-Euclidean data, have gained significant attention. However, no
previous research has investigated the GNN Lipschitz bounds to shed light on
stabilizing model outputs, especially when working on non-Euclidean data with
inherent biases. Given the inherent biases in common graph data used for GNN
training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output
perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during
training. Recently, despite the Lipschitz constant's use in controlling the
stability of Euclideanneural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz
constant remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs,
especially within fairness contexts. To narrow this gap, we begin with the
general GNNs operating on an attributed graph, and formulate a Lipschitz bound
to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input.
Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz constant of a GNN
model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from
data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's
effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training
dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can
effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and
fairness.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the interactions of agents trained with deep reinforcement
learning is crucial for deploying agents in games or the real world. In the
former, unreasonable actions confuse players. In the latter, that effect is
even more significant, as unexpected behavior cause accidents with potentially
grave and long-lasting consequences for the involved individuals. In this work,
we propose using program synthesis to imitate reinforcement learning policies
after seeing a trajectory of the action sequence. Programs have the advantage
that they are inherently interpretable and verifiable for correctness. We adapt
the state-of-the-art program synthesis system DreamCoder for learning concepts
in grid-based environments, specifically, a navigation task and two miniature
versions of Atari games, Space Invaders and Asterix. By inspecting the
generated libraries, we can make inferences about the concepts the black-box
agent has learned and better understand the agent's behavior. We achieve the
same by visualizing the agent's decision-making process for the imitated
sequences. We evaluate our approach with different types of program
synthesizers based on a search-only method, a neural-guided search, and a
language model fine-tuned on code.

<p class="mathjax">An essential quantity in quantum information theory is the von Neumann
entropy which depends entirely on the quantum density operator. Once known, the
density operator reveals the statistics of observables in a quantum process,
and the corresponding von Neumann Entropy yields the full information content.
However, the state, or density operator, of a given system may be unknown.
Quantum state observers have been proposed to infer the unknown state of a
quantum system. In this note, we show (i) that the von Neumann entropy of the
state estimate produced by our quantum state observer is exponentially
convergent to that of the system's true state, and (ii) the relative entropy
between the system and observer's state converges exponentially to zero as long
as the system starts in a full-rank state.

<p class="mathjax">Sarcasm detection is a binary classification task that aims to determine
whether a given utterance is sarcastic. Over the past decade, sarcasm detection
has evolved from classical pattern recognition to deep learning approaches,
where features such as user profile, punctuation and sentiment words have been
commonly employed for sarcasm detection. In real-life sarcastic expressions,
behaviors without explicit sentimental cues often serve as carriers of implicit
sentimental meanings. Motivated by this observation, we proposed a dual-channel
sarcasm detection model named BNS-Net. The model considers behavior and
sentence conflicts in two channels. Channel 1: Behavior-level Conflict Channel
reconstructs the text based on core verbs while leveraging the modified
attention mechanism to highlight conflict information. Channel 2:
Sentence-level Conflict Channel introduces external sentiment knowledge to
segment the text into explicit and implicit sentences, capturing conflicts
between them. To validate the effectiveness of BNS-Net, several comparative and
ablation experiments are conducted on three public sarcasm datasets. The
analysis and evaluation of experimental results demonstrate that the BNS-Net
effectively identifies sarcasm in text and achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one proposed solution to large model sizes and
slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25
proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years.
Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often
impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good
illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022.
Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture
Distillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final
performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only
improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final
performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a
suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the
student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of
insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of
two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are
optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the
field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models
and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only
two out of eight techniques can compete with our simple baseline on the ADE20K
dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recently unsupervised machine learning based systems have been developed to
detect zero-day Web attacks, which can effectively enhance existing Web
Application Firewalls (WAFs). However, prior arts only consider detecting
attacks on specific domains by training particular detection models for the
domains. These systems require a large amount of training data, which causes a
long period of time for model training and deployment. In this paper, we
propose RETSINA, a novel meta-learning based framework that enables zero-day
Web attack detection across different domains in an organization with limited
training data. Specifically, it utilizes meta-learning to share knowledge
across these domains, e.g., the relationship between HTTP requests in
heterogeneous domains, to efficiently train detection models. Moreover, we
develop an adaptive preprocessing module to facilitate semantic analysis of Web
requests across different domains and design a multi-domain representation
method to capture semantic correlations between different domains for
cross-domain model training. We conduct experiments using four real-world
datasets on different domains with a total of 293M Web requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that RETSINA outperforms the existing
unsupervised Web attack detection methods with limited training data, e.g.,
RETSINA needs only 5-minute training data to achieve comparable detection
performance to the existing methods that train separate models for different
domains using 1-day training data. We also conduct real-world deployment in an
Internet company. RETSINA captures on average 126 and 218 zero-day attack
requests per day in two domains, respectively, in one month.

<p class="mathjax">With strong representation capabilities, pretrained vision-language models
are widely used in vision and language navigation (VLN). However, most of them
are trained on web-crawled general-purpose datasets, which incurs a
considerable domain gap when used for VLN tasks. Another challenge for VLN is
how the agent understands the contextual relations between actions on a
trajectory and performs cross-modal alignment sequentially. In this paper, we
propose a novel Prompt-bAsed coNtext- and Domain-Aware (PANDA) pretraining
framework to address these problems. It performs prompting in two stages. In
the domain-aware stage, we apply a low-cost prompt tuning paradigm to learn
soft visual prompts from an in-domain dataset for equipping the pretrained
models with object-level and scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks.
Furthermore, in the context-aware stage, we design a set of hard context
prompts to capture the sequence-level semantics and instill both out-of-context
and contextual knowledge in the instruction into cross-modal representations.
They enable further tuning of the pretrained models via contrastive learning.
Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show the superiority of PANDA
compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 19 subjects who received a clinical
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as of 5 pathological controls
have been collected and analysed by Raman spectroscopy (RS). We investigated
whether the raw and preprocessed Raman spectra could be used to distinguish AD
from controls. First, we applied standard Machine Learning (ML) methods
obtaining unsatisfactory results. Then, we applied ML to a set of topological
descriptors extracted from raw spectra, achieving a very good classification
accuracy (&gt;87%). Although our results are preliminary, they indicate that RS
and topological analysis together may provide an effective combination to
confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis of AD. The next steps will include
enlarging the dataset of CSF samples to validate the proposed method better
and, possibly, to understand if topological data analysis could support the
characterization of AD subtypes.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks dramatically change the output of an otherwise accurate
learning system using a seemingly inconsequential modification to a piece of
input data. Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which
are robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible
to small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here,
we show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working
with high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and
generalisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems
arise with high probability -- notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the
(otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and
robustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same
phenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on
standard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise
fails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising
takeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier's decision surface
from training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being
detected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counterintuitively, using
additive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for
eradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial
training is required.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been a surge in interest in NLP driven by ChatGPT.
ChatGPT, a transformer-based generative language model of substantial scale,
exhibits versatility in performing various tasks based on natural language.
Nevertheless, large language models often exhibit poor performance in solving
mathematics questions that require reasoning. Prior research has demonstrated
the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in enhancing reasoning
capabilities. Now, we aim to investigate whether fine-tuning a model for the
generation of Prolog codes, a logic language, and subsequently passing these
codes to a compiler can further improve accuracy. Consequently, we employ
chain-of-thought to fine-tune LLaMA7B as a baseline model and develop other
fine-tuned LLaMA7B models for the generation of Prolog code, Prolog code +
chain-of-thought, and chain-of-thought + Prolog code, respectively. The results
reveal that the Prolog generation model surpasses the baseline in performance,
while the combination generation models do not yield significant improvements.
The Prolog corpus based on GSM8K and the correspondingly finetuned Prolog
generation model based on LLaMA7B are released to the research community.

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms enable largely unrestricted many-to-many
communication. In times of crisis, they offer a space for collective
sense-making and gave rise to new social phenomena (e.g. open-source
investigations). However, they also serve as a tool for threat actors to
conduct cyber-enabled social influence operations (CeSIOs) in order to shape
public opinion and interfere in decision-making processes. CeSIOs rely on the
employment of sock puppet accounts to engage authentic users in online
communication, exert influence, and subvert online discourse. Large Language
Models (LLMs) may further enhance the deceptive properties of sock puppet
accounts. Recent LLMs are able to generate targeted and persuasive text which
is for the most part indistinguishable from human-written content -- ideal
features for covert influence. This article reviews recent developments at the
intersection of LLMs and influence operations, summarizes LLMs' salience, and
explores the potential impact of LLM-instrumented sock puppet accounts for
CeSIOs. Finally, mitigation measures for the near future are highlighted.

the commonly used machine learning methods. Such application is motivated by
the need to test bonobos in their enclosure using touch screen devices without
human assistance. This work introduces a newly acquired dataset based on bonobo
recordings generated semi-automatically. The recordings are weakly labelled and
fed to a macaque detector in order to spatially detect the individual present
in the video. Handcrafted features coupled with different classification
algorithms and deep-learning methods using a ResNet architecture are
investigated for bonobo identification. Performance is compared in terms of
classification accuracy on the splits of the database using different data
separation methods. We demonstrate the importance of data preparation and how a
wrong data separation can lead to false good results. Finally, after a
meaningful separation of the data, the best classification performance is
obtained using a fine-tuned ResNet model and reaches 75% of accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Safety is an essential asset when learning control policies for physical
systems, as violating safety constraints during training can lead to expensive
hardware damage. In response to this need, the field of safe learning has
emerged with algorithms that can provide probabilistic safety guarantees
without knowledge of the underlying system dynamics. Those algorithms often
rely on Gaussian process inference. Unfortunately, Gaussian process inference
scales cubically with the number of data points, limiting applicability to
high-dimensional and embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a safe
learning algorithm that provides probabilistic safety guarantees but leverages
the Nadaraya-Watson estimator instead of Gaussian processes. For the
Nadaraya-Watson estimator, we can reach logarithmic scaling with the number of
data points. We provide theoretical guarantees for the estimates, embed them
into a safe learning algorithm, and show numerical experiments on a simulated
seven-degrees-of-freedom robot manipulator.

to establish a series of new bounds on their parameters. We introduce and study
a refined notion of weight distribution that captures the code's locality.
Using a duality result analogous to a MacWilliams identity, we then derive an

Using a dual distance bound and the theory of generalized weights, we obtain

<p class="mathjax">The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in
applications ranging from surveillance and first-aid missions to industrial
automation involving cooperation with other machines or humans. To maximize
area coverage and reduce mission latency, swarms of collaborating drones have
become a significant research direction. However, this approach requires open
challenges in positioning, mapping, and communications to be addressed. This
work describes a distributed mapping system based on a swarm of nano-UAVs,
characterized by a limited payload of 35 g and tightly constrained on-board
sensing and computing capabilities. Each nano-UAV is equipped with four
64-pixel depth sensors that measure the relative distance to obstacles in four
directions. The proposed system merges the information from the swarm and
generates a coherent grid map without relying on any external infrastructure.
The data fusion is performed using the iterative closest point algorithm and a
graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm, running entirely
on-board the UAV's low-power ARM Cortex-M microcontroller with just 192 kB of
SRAM memory. Field results gathered in three different mazes from a swarm of up
to 4 nano-UAVs prove a mapping accuracy of 12 cm and demonstrate that the
mapping time is inversely proportional to the number of agents. The proposed
framework scales linearly in terms of communication bandwidth and on-board
computational complexity, supporting communication between up to 20 nano-UAVs
and mapping of areas up to 180 m2 with the chosen configuration requiring only
50 kB of memory.

<p class="mathjax">Because neuronal networks are intricate systems composed of interconnected
neurons, their control poses challenges owing to their nonlinearity and
complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to design control input to a
neuronal network to manipulate the firing patterns of modules within the
network. We propose a methodology for designing a control input based on
temporal deep unfolding-based model predictive control (TDU-MPC), a control
methodology based on the deep unfolding technique actively investigated in the
context of wireless signal processing. During the method development, we
address the unique characteristics of neuron dynamics, such as zero gradients
in firing times, by approximating input currents using a sigmoid function. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed via numerical simulations. In
networks with 15 and 30 neurons, the control was achieved to switch the firing
frequencies of two modules without directly applying control inputs. This study
includes a tailored methodology for networked neurons, the extension of TDU-MPC
to nonlinear systems with reset dynamics, and the achievement of desired firing
patterns in neuronal networks.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a novel Shape Memory Alloy spring actuated continuum
robotic neck that derives inspiration from pennate muscle architecture. The
proposed design has 2DOF, and experimental studies reveal that the designed
joint can replicate the human head's anthropomorphic range of motion. We
enumerate the analytical modelling for SMA actuators and the kinematic model of
the proposed design configuration. A series of experiments were conducted to
assess the performance of the anthropomorphic neck by measuring the range of
motion with varying input currents. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted
to validate the analytical model of the SMA Multiphysics and the continuum
backbone. The existing humanoid necks have been powered by conventional
actuators that have relatively low energy efficiency and are prone to wear. The
current research envisages application of nonconventional actuator such as SMA
springs with specific geometric configuration yielding high power to weight
ratio that delivers smooth motion for continuum robots as demonstrated in this
present work.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a prominent data representation and
management paradigm. Being usually underpinned by a schema (e.g. an ontology),
KGs capture not only factual information but also contextual knowledge. In some
tasks, a few KGs established themselves as standard benchmarks. However, recent
works outline that relying on a limited collection of datasets is not
sufficient to assess the generalization capability of an approach. In some
data-sensitive fields such as education or medicine, access to public datasets
is even more limited. To remedy the aforementioned issues, we release PyGraft,
a Python-based tool that generates highly customized, domain-agnostic schemas
and knowledge graphs. The synthesized schemas encompass various RDFS and OWL
constructs, while the synthesized KGs emulate the characteristics and scale of
real-world KGs. Logical consistency of the generated resources is ultimately
ensured by running a description logic (DL) reasoner. By providing a way of
generating both a schema and KG in a single pipeline, PyGraft's aim is to
empower the generation of a more diverse array of KGs for benchmarking novel
approaches in areas such as graph-based machine learning (ML), or more
generally KG processing. In graph-based ML in particular, this should foster a
more holistic evaluation of model performance and generalization capability,
thereby going beyond the limited collection of available benchmarks. PyGraft is

<p class="mathjax">Short-term load forecasting is of paramount importance in the efficient
operation and planning of power systems, given its inherent non-linear and
dynamic nature. Recent strides in deep learning have shown promise in
addressing this challenge. However, these methods often grapple with
hyperparameter sensitivity, opaqueness in interpretability, and high
computational overhead for real-time deployment. In this paper, I propose a
novel solution that surmounts these obstacles. Our approach harnesses the power
of the Particle-Swarm Optimization algorithm to autonomously explore and
optimize hyperparameters, a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to discern the
salient features crucial for accurate forecasting, and a streamlined framework
for computational efficiency. Our method undergoes rigorous evaluation using a
genuine electricity demand dataset. The results underscore its superiority in
terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Notably, our Mean
Absolute Percentage Error of 1.9376 marks a significant advancement over
existing state-of-the-art approaches, heralding a new era in short-term load
forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer the
relationships between a human and an object. Arguably, training supervised
models for this task from scratch presents challenges due to the performance
drop over rare classes and the high computational cost and time required to
handle long-tailed distributions of HOIs in complex HOI scenes in realistic
settings. This observation motivates us to design an HOI detector that can be
trained even with long-tailed labeled data and can leverage existing knowledge
from pre-trained models. Inspired by the powerful generalization ability of the
large Vision-Language Models (VLM) on classification and retrieval tasks, we
propose an efficient Adaptive HOI Detector with Concept-guided Memory (ADA-CM).
ADA-CM has two operating modes. The first mode makes it tunable without
learning new parameters in a training-free paradigm. Its second mode
incorporates an instance-aware adapter mechanism that can further efficiently
boost performance if updating a lightweight set of parameters can be afforded.
Our proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art on the
HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets with much less training time. Code can be found at

<p class="mathjax">Several one-fits-all intervention policies were introduced by the Online
Social Networks (OSNs) platforms to mitigate potential harms. Nevertheless,
some studies showed the limited effectiveness of these approaches. An
alternative to this would be a user-centered design of intervention policies.
In this context, we study the susceptibility of users to undesired behavior in
communities on OSNs. In particular, we explore their reaction to specific
events. Our study shows that communities develop different undesired behavior
patterns in reaction to specific events. These events can significantly alter
the behavior of the community and invert the dynamics of behavior within the
whole network. Our findings stress out the importance of understanding the
reasons behind the changes in users' reactions and highlights the need of
fine-tuning the research to the individual's level. It paves the way towards
building better OSNs' intervention strategies centered on the user.

<p class="mathjax">Vision algorithm-based robotic arm grasping system is one of the robotic arm
systems that can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. It uses algorithms to
automatically identify the location of the target and guide the robotic arm to
grasp it, which has more flexible features than the teachable robotic arm
grasping system. However, for some food packages, their transparent packages or
reflective materials bring challenges to the recognition of vision algorithms,
and traditional vision algorithms cannot achieve high accuracy for these
packages. In addition, in the process of robotic arm grasping, the positioning
on the z-axis height still requires manual setting of parameters, which may
cause errors. Based on the above two problems, we designed a sorting system for
food packaging using deep learning algorithms and structured light 3D
reconstruction technology. Using a pre-trained MASK R-CNN model to recognize
the class of the object in the image and get its 2D coordinates, then using
structured light 3D reconstruction technique to calculate its 3D coordinates,
and finally after the coordinate system conversion to guide the robotic arm for
grasping. After testing, it is shown that the method can fully automate the
recognition and grasping of different kinds of food packages with high
accuracy. Using this method, it can help food manufacturers to reduce
production costs and improve production efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">A common setting in multitask reinforcement learning (RL) demands that an
agent rapidly adapt to various stationary reward functions randomly sampled
from a fixed distribution. In such situations, the successor representation
(SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation by
decoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from a
specific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks are
rarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on the
availability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting this
disjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginal
utility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\lambda$
representation ($\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policy
evaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as several
other state representations from the literature. We establish the $\lambda$R's
formal properties and examine its normative advantages in the context of
machine learning, as well as its usefulness for studying natural behaviors,
particularly foraging.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes word {segmentation} granularity in Korean language
processing. From a word separated by blank space, which is termed an eojeol, to
a sequence of morphemes in Korean, there are multiple possible levels of word
segmentation granularity in Korean. For specific language processing and corpus
annotation tasks, several different granularity levels have been proposed and
utilized, because the agglutinative languages including Korean language have a
one-to-one mapping between functional morpheme and syntactic category. Thus, we
analyze these different granularity levels, presenting the examples of Korean
language processing systems for future reference. Interestingly, the
granularity by separating only functional morphemes including case markers and
verbal endings, and keeping other suffixes for morphological derivation results
in the optimal performance for phrase structure parsing. This contradicts
previous best practices for Korean language processing, which has been the de
facto standard for various applications that require separating all morphemes.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting natural gas consumption, considering seasonality and trends, is
crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of
obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to
its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this
raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy
security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of
natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model
collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream
processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed
approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas
consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting
models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point
detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a
different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model
collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are
defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of
detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic
baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a
lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure
employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting
forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for
continual learning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Roof plane segmentation from airborne LiDAR point clouds is an important
technology for 3D building model reconstruction. One of the key issues of plane
segmentation is how to design powerful features that can exactly distinguish
adjacent planar patches. The quality of point feature directly determines the
accuracy of roof plane segmentation. Most of existing approaches use
handcrafted features to extract roof planes. However, the abilities of these
features are relatively low, especially in boundary area. To solve this
problem, we propose a boundary-aware point clustering approach in Euclidean and
embedding spaces constructed by a multi-task deep network for roof plane
segmentation. We design a three-branch network to predict semantic labels,
point offsets and extract deep embedding features. In the first branch, we
classify the input data as non-roof, boundary and plane points. In the second
branch, we predict point offsets for shifting each point toward its respective
instance center. In the third branch, we constrain that points of the same
plane instance should have the similar embeddings. We aim to ensure that points
of the same plane instance are close as much as possible in both Euclidean and
embedding spaces. However, although deep network has strong feature
representative ability, it is still hard to accurately distinguish points near
plane instance boundary. Therefore, we first group plane points into many
clusters in the two spaces, and then we assign the rest boundary points to
their closest clusters to generate final complete roof planes. In this way, we
can effectively reduce the influence of unreliable boundary points. In
addition, we construct a synthetic dataset and a real dataset to train and
evaluate our approach. The experiments results show that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">HTTP-based Trojan is extremely threatening, and it is difficult to be
effectively detected because of its concealment and confusion. Previous
detection methods usually are with poor generalization ability due to outdated
datasets and reliance on manual feature extraction, which makes these methods
always perform well under their private dataset, but poorly or even fail to
work in real network environment. In this paper, we propose an HTTP-based
Trojan detection model via the Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Features of
traffics (HSTF-Model) based on the formalized description of traffic
spatio-temporal behavior from both packet level and flow level. In this model,
we employ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial information and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract temporal information. In addition, we
present a dataset consisting of Benign and Trojan HTTP Traffic (BTHT-2018).
Experimental results show that our model can guarantee high accuracy (the F1 of
98.62%-99.81% and the FPR of 0.34%-0.02% in BTHT-2018). More importantly, our
model has a huge advantage over other related methods in generalization
ability. HSTF-Model trained with BTHT-2018 can reach the F1 of 93.51% on the
public dataset ISCX-2012, which is 20+% better than the best of related machine
learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Maternal health remains a pervasive challenge in developing and
underdeveloped countries. Inadequate access to basic antenatal Ultrasound (US)
examinations, limited resources such as primary health services and
infrastructure, and lack of skilled healthcare professionals are the major
concerns. To improve the quality of maternal care, robot-assisted antenatal US
systems with teleoperable and autonomous capabilities were introduced. However,
the existing teleoperation systems rely on standard video stream-based
approaches that are constrained by limited immersion and scene awareness. Also,
there is no prior work on autonomous antenatal robotic US systems that automate
standardized scanning protocols. To that end, this paper introduces a novel
Virtual Reality (VR) platform for robotic antenatal ultrasound, which enables
sonologists to control a robotic arm over a wired network. The effectiveness of
the system is enhanced by providing a reconstructed 3D view of the environment
and immersing the user in a VR space. Also, the system facilitates a better
understanding of the anatomical surfaces to perform pragmatic scans using 3D
models. Further, the proposed robotic system also has autonomous capabilities;
under the supervision of the sonologist, it can perform the standard six-step
approach for obstetric US scanning recommended by the ISUOG. Using a 23-week
fetal phantom, the proposed system was demonstrated to technology and academia
experts at MEDICA 2022 as a part of the KUKA Innovation Award. The positive
feedback from them supports the feasibility of the system. It also gave an
insight into the improvisations to be carried out to make it a clinically
viable system.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based architectures have recently demonstrated remarkable
performance in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. However, such models
are likely to disregard crucial visual cues and often rely on multimodal
shortcuts and inherent biases of the language modality to predict the correct
answer, a phenomenon commonly referred to as lack of visual grounding. In this
work, we alleviate this shortcoming through a novel architecture for visual
question answering that leverages common sense reasoning as a supervisory
signal. Reasoning supervision takes the form of a textual justification of the
correct answer, with such annotations being already available on large-scale
Visual Common Sense Reasoning (VCR) datasets. The model's visual attention is
guided toward important elements of the scene through a similarity loss that
aligns the learned attention distributions guided by the question and the
correct reasoning. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that
the proposed approach can boost the model's visual perception capability and
lead to performance increase, without requiring training on explicit grounding
annotations.

<p class="mathjax">An adjacency sketching or implicit labeling scheme for a family $\cal F$ of
graphs is a method that defines for any $n$ vertex $G \in \cal F$ an assignment
of labels to each vertex in $G$, so that the labels of two vertices tell you
whether or not they are adjacent. The goal is to come up with labeling schemes
that use as few bits as possible to represent the labels. By using randomness
when assigning labels, it is sometimes possible to produce adjacency sketches
with much smaller label sizes, but this comes at the cost of introducing some
probability of error. Both deterministic and randomized labeling schemes have
been extensively studied, as they have applications for distributed data
structures and deeper connections to universal graphs and communication
complexity. The main question of interest is which graph families have schemes
using short labels, usually $O(\log n)$ in the deterministic case or constant
for randomized sketches.
<br />In this work we consider the resilience of probabilistic adjacency sketches
against an adversary making adaptive queries to the labels. This differs from
the previously analyzed probabilistic setting which is ``one shot". We show
that in the adaptive adversarial case the size of the labels is tightly related
to the maximal degree of the graphs in $\cal F$. This results in a stronger
characterization compared to what is known in the non-adversarial setting. In
more detail, we construct sketches that fail with probability $\varepsilon$ for
graphs with maximal degree $d$ using $2d\log (1/\varepsilon)$ bit labels and
show that this is roughly the best that can be done for any specific graph of
maximal degree $d$, e.g.\ a $d$-ary tree.

<p class="mathjax">Training a generative model with limited number of samples is a challenging
task. Current methods primarily rely on few-shot model adaption to train the
network. However, in scenarios where data is extremely limited (less than 10),
the generative network tends to overfit and suffers from content degradation.
To address these problems, we propose a novel phasic content fusing few-shot
diffusion model with directional distribution consistency loss, which targets
different learning objectives at distinct training stages of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we design a phasic training strategy with phasic content
fusion to help our model learn content and style information when t is large,
and learn local details of target domain when t is small, leading to an
improvement in the capture of content, style and local details. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel directional distribution consistency loss that ensures the
consistency between the generated and source distributions more efficiently and
stably than the prior methods, preventing our model from overfitting. Finally,
we propose a cross-domain structure guidance strategy that enhances structure
consistency during domain adaptation. Theoretical analysis, qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
few-shot generative model adaption tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">In lending, where prices are specific to both customers and products, having
a well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential to
effective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived from
observational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of
``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,
the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.
We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing
pricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the
reaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we
simulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on
mortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of
parametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual
bid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such as
logistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias.
In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learning
and show their capability to overcome selection bias in pricing data.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating the effects of treatments with an associated dose on an instance's
outcome, the "dose response", is relevant in a variety of domains, from
healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as
continuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational
data, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the
allocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have
shown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate
individual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection
bias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to
estimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced
representation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued
treatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a
continuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed
benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learn
treatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respect
to other state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Thanks to the complementary nature of millimeter wave radar and camera, deep
learning-based radar-camera 3D object detection methods may reliably produce
accurate detections even in low-visibility conditions. This makes them
preferable to use in autonomous vehicles' perception systems, especially as the
combined cost of both sensors is cheaper than the cost of a lidar. Recent
radar-camera methods commonly perform feature-level fusion which often involves
projecting the radar points onto the same plane as the image features and
fusing the extracted features from both modalities. While performing fusion on
the image plane is generally simpler and faster, projecting radar points onto
the image plane flattens the depth dimension of the point cloud which might
lead to information loss and makes extracting the spatial features of the point
cloud harder. We proposed ClusterFusion, an architecture that leverages the
local spatial features of the radar point cloud by clustering the point cloud
and performing feature extraction directly on the point cloud clusters before
projecting the features onto the image plane. ClusterFusion achieved the
state-of-the-art performance among all radar-monocular camera methods on the
test slice of the nuScenes dataset with 48.7% nuScenes detection score (NDS).
We also investigated the performance of different radar feature extraction
strategies on point cloud clusters: a handcrafted strategy, a learning-based
strategy, and a combination of both, and found that the handcrafted strategy
yielded the best performance. The main goal of this work is to explore the use
of radar's local spatial and point-wise features by extracting them directly
from radar point cloud clusters for a radar-monocular camera 3D object
detection method that performs cross-modal feature fusion on the image plane.

<p class="mathjax">Malicious communication behavior is the network communication behavior
generated by malware (bot-net, spyware, etc.) after victim devices are
infected. Experienced adversaries often hide malicious information in HTTP
traffic to evade detection. However, related detection methods have inadequate
generalization ability because they are usually based on artificial feature
engineering and outmoded datasets. In this paper, we propose an HTTP-based
Malicious Communication traffic Detection Model (HMCD-Model) based on generated
adversarial flows and hierarchical traffic features. HMCD-Model consists of two
parts. The first is a generation algorithm based on WGAN-GP to generate
HTTP-based malicious communication traffic for data enhancement. The second is
a hybrid neural network based on CNN and LSTM to extract hierarchical
spatial-temporal features of traffic. In addition, we collect and publish a
dataset, HMCT-2020, which consists of large-scale malicious and benign traffic
during three years (2018-2020). Taking the data in HMCT-2020(18) as the
training set and the data in other datasets as the test set, the experimental
results show that the HMCD-Model can effectively detect unknown HTTP-based
malicious communication traffic. It can reach F1 = 98.66% in the dataset
HMCT-2020(19-20), F1 = 90.69% in the public dataset CIC-IDS-2017, and F1 =
83.66% in the real traffic, which is 20+% higher than other representative
methods on average. This validates that HMCD-Model has the ability to discover
unknown HTTP-based malicious communication behavior.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we adopted a retrospective approach to examine and compare
five existing popular sentence encoders, i.e., Sentence-BERT, Universal
Sentence Encoder (USE), LASER, InferSent, and Doc2vec, in terms of their
performance on downstream tasks versus their capability to capture basic
semantic properties. Initially, we evaluated all five sentence encoders on the
popular SentEval benchmark and found that multiple sentence encoders perform
quite well on a variety of popular downstream tasks. However, being unable to
find a single winner in all cases, we designed further experiments to gain a
deeper understanding of their behavior. Specifically, we proposed four semantic
evaluation criteria, i.e., Paraphrasing, Synonym Replacement, Antonym
Replacement, and Sentence Jumbling, and evaluated the same five sentence
encoders using these criteria. We found that the Sentence-Bert and USE models
pass the paraphrasing criterion, with SBERT being the superior between the two.
LASER dominates in the case of the synonym replacement criterion.
Interestingly, all the sentence encoders failed the antonym replacement and
jumbling criteria. These results suggest that although these popular sentence
encoders perform quite well on the SentEval benchmark, they still struggle to
capture some basic semantic properties, thus, posing a daunting dilemma in NLP
research.

<p class="mathjax">The latest advancements in AI and deep learning have led to a breakthrough in
large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing
systems.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in the autonomous driving stack by
enabling autonomous vehicles to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents.
Goal-based prediction models have gained traction in recent years for
addressing the multimodal nature of future trajectories. Goal-based prediction
models simplify multimodal prediction by first predicting 2D goal locations of
agents and then predicting trajectories conditioned on each goal. However, a
single 2D goal location serves as a weak inductive bias for predicting the
whole trajectory, often leading to poor map compliance, i.e., part of the
trajectory going off-road or breaking traffic rules. In this paper, we improve
upon goal-based prediction by proposing the Path-based prediction (PBP)
approach. PBP predicts a discrete probability distribution over reference paths
in the HD map using the path features and predicts trajectories in the
path-relative Frenet frame. We applied the PBP trajectory decoder on top of the
HiVT scene encoder and report results on the Argoverse dataset. Our experiments
show that PBP achieves competitive performance on the standard trajectory
prediction metrics, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of map compliance.

<p class="mathjax">The evaluation of clustering results is difficult, highly dependent on the
evaluated data set and the perspective of the beholder. There are many
different clustering quality measures, which try to provide a general measure
to validate clustering results. A very popular measure is the Silhouette. We
discuss the efficient medoid-based variant of the Silhouette, perform a
theoretical analysis of its properties, provide two fast versions for the
direct optimization, and discuss the use to choose the optimal number of
clusters. We combine ideas from the original Silhouette with the well-known PAM
algorithm and its latest improvements FasterPAM. One of the versions guarantees
equal results to the original variant and provides a run speedup of $O(k^2)$.
In experiments on real data with 30000 samples and $k$=100, we observed a
10464$\times$ speedup compared to the original PAMMEDSIL algorithm.
Additionally, we provide a variant to choose the optimal number of clusters
directly.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last decades, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been intensively
studied by the Machine Learning community. Despite its versatility and
excellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is a
time-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute the
training process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that the
convergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batch
SGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGD
convergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which is
prone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations across
many distributed processes.
<br />In this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralized
and asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronization
among nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide a
bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\epsilon^{-1})$ for
the convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness between
models, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\epsilon$
is a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, when
gradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\hat{S}_{avg}\hat{S}_{max}}\epsilon^{-1})$, with
$\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the average
and maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixed
stepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. We
anticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGD
by a broad community of researchers and developers.

<p class="mathjax">Synthetic Time Series Generation (TSG) is crucial in a range of applications,
including data augmentation, anomaly detection, and privacy preservation.
Although significant strides have been made in this field, existing methods
exhibit three key limitations: (1) They often benchmark against similar model
types, constraining a holistic view of performance capabilities. (2) The use of
specialized synthetic and private datasets introduces biases and hampers
generalizability. (3) Ambiguous evaluation measures, often tied to custom
networks or downstream tasks, hinder consistent and fair comparison.
<br />To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textsf{TSGBench}, the inaugural
TSG Benchmark, designed for a unified and comprehensive assessment of TSG
methods. It comprises three modules: (1) a curated collection of publicly
available, real-world datasets tailored for TSG, together with a standardized
preprocessing pipeline; (2) a comprehensive evaluation measures suite including
vanilla measures, new distance-based assessments, and visualization tools; (3)
a pioneering generalization test rooted in Domain Adaptation (DA), compatible
with all methods. We have conducted extensive experiments across ten real-world
datasets from diverse domains, utilizing ten advanced TSG methods and twelve
evaluation measures, all gauged through \textsf{TSGBench}. The results
highlight its remarkable efficacy and consistency. More importantly,
\textsf{TSGBench} delivers a statistical breakdown of method rankings,
illuminating performance variations across different datasets and measures, and
offering nuanced insights into the effectiveness of each method.

<p class="mathjax">Motion planning is the soul of robot decision making. Classical planning
algorithms like graph search and reaction-based algorithms face challenges in
cases of dense and dynamic obstacles. Deep learning algorithms generate
suboptimal one-step predictions that cause many collisions. Reinforcement
learning algorithms generate optimal or near-optimal time-sequential
predictions. However, they suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal converged
results, and overfittings. This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm for robotic
motion planning: long short-term memory (LSTM) pooling and skip connection for
attention-based discrete soft actor critic (LSA-DSAC). First, graph network
(relational graph) and attention network (attention weight) interpret the
environmental state for the learning of the discrete soft actor critic
algorithm. The expressive power of attention network outperforms that of graph
in our task by difference analysis of these two representation methods.
However, attention based DSAC faces the overfitting problem in training.
Second, the skip connection method is integrated to attention based DSAC to
mitigate overfitting and improve convergence speed. Third, LSTM pooling is
taken to replace the sum operator of attention weigh and eliminate overfitting
by slightly sacrificing convergence speed at early-stage training. Experiments
show that LSA-DSAC outperforms the state-of-the-art in training and most
evaluations. The physical robot is also implemented and tested in the real
world.

<p class="mathjax">Recognising reinforced concrete defects (RCDs) is a crucial element for
determining the structural integrity, traffic safety and durability of bridges.
However, most of the existing datasets in the RCD domain are derived from a
small number of bridges acquired in specific camera poses, lighting conditions
and with fixed hardware. These limitations question the usability of models
trained on such open-source data in real-world scenarios. We address this
problem by testing such models on our "dacl1k" dataset, a highly diverse RCD
dataset for multi-label classification based on building inspections including
1,474 images. Thereby, we trained the models on different combinations of
open-source data (meta datasets) which were subsequently evaluated both
extrinsically and intrinsically. During extrinsic evaluation, we report metrics
on dacl1k and the meta datasets. The performance analysis on dacl1k shows
practical usability of the meta data, where the best model shows an Exact Match
Ratio of 32%. Additionally, we conduct an intrinsic evaluation by clustering
the bottleneck features of the best model derived from the extrinsic evaluation
in order to find out, if the model has learned distinguishing datasets or the
classes (RCDs) which is the aspired goal. The dacl1k dataset and our trained
models will be made publicly available, enabling researchers and practitioners
to put their models to the real-world test.

<p class="mathjax">Color image completion is a challenging problem in computer vision, but
recent research has shown that quaternion representations of color images
perform well in many areas. These representations consider the entire color
image and effectively utilize coupling information between the three color
channels. Consequently, low-rank quaternion matrix completion (LRQMC)
algorithms have gained significant attention. We propose a method based on
quaternion Qatar Riyal decomposition (QQR) and quaternion $L_{2,1}$-norm called
QLNM-QQR. This new approach reduces computational complexity by avoiding the
need to calculate the QSVD of large quaternion matrices. We also present two
improvements to the QLNM-QQR method: an enhanced version called IRQLNM-QQR that
uses iteratively reweighted quaternion $L_{2,1}$-norm minimization and a method
called QLNM-QQR-SR that integrates sparse regularization. Our experiments on
natural color images and color medical images show that IRQLNM-QQR outperforms
QLNM-QQR and that the proposed QLNM-QQR-SR method is superior to several
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the problem of inertial navigation system (INS)
filter design through the lens of symmetry. The extended Kalman filter (EKF)
and its variants, have been the staple of INS filtering for 50 years; however,
recent advances in inertial navigation systems have exploited matrix Lie group
structure to design stochastic filters and state observers that have been shown
to display superior performance compared to classical solutions. In this work
we consider the case where a vehicle has an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. We show that all the
modern variants of the EKF for these sensors can be interpreted as the recently
proposed Equivariant Filter (EqF) design methodology applied to different
choices of symmetry group for the INS problem. This leads us to propose two new
symmetries for the INS problem that have not been considered in the prior
literature, and provide a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses
of all the different algorithms. We believe the collection of symmetries that
we present here capture all the sensible choices of symmetry for this problem
and sensor suite, and that the analysis provided is indicative of the relative
real-world performance potential of the different algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Space-time shift keying-aided orthogonal time frequency space
modulation-based multiple access (STSK-OTFS-MA) is proposed for reliable uplink
transmission in high-Doppler scenarios. As a beneficial feature of our
STSK-OTFS-MA system, extra information bits are mapped onto the indices of the
active dispersion matrices, which allows the system to enjoy the joint benefits
of both STSK and OTFS signalling. Due to the fact that both the time-, space-
and DD-domain degrees of freedom are jointly exploited, our STSK-OTFS-MA
achieves increased diversity and coding gains. To mitigate the potentially
excessive detection complexity, the sparse structure of the equivalent
transmitted symbol vector is exploited, resulting in a pair of low-complexity
near-maximum likelihood (ML) multiuser detection algorithms. Explicitly, we
conceive a progressive residual check-based greedy detector (PRCGD) and an
iterative reduced-space check-based detector (IRCD). Then, we derive both the
unconditional single-user pairwise error probability (SU-UPEP) and a tight bit
error ratio (BER) union-bound for our single-user STSK-OTFS-MA system employing
the ML detector. Furthermore, the discrete-input continuous-output memoryless
channel (DCMC) capacity of the proposed system is derived. The optimal
dispersion matrices (DMs) are designed based on the maximum attainable
diversity and coding gain metrics. Finally, it is demonstrated that our
STSK-OTFS-MA system achieves both a lower BER and a higher DCMC capacity than
its conventional spatial modulation (SM) {and its orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. As a benefit, the proposed system strikes a
compelling BER vs. system complexity as well as BER vs. detection complexity
trade-offs.

<p class="mathjax">Many downstream inference tasks for knowledge graphs, such as relation
prediction, have been handled successfully by knowledge graph embedding
techniques in the transductive setting. To address the inductive setting
wherein new entities are introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time,
more recent work opts for models which learn implicit representations of the
knowledge graph through a complex function of a network's subgraph structure,
often parametrized by graph neural network architectures. These come at the
cost of increased parametrization, reduced interpretability and limited
generalization to other downstream inference tasks. In this work, we bridge the
gap between traditional transductive knowledge graph embedding approaches and
more recent inductive relation prediction models by introducing a generalized
form of harmonic extension which leverages representations learned through
transductive embedding methods to infer representations of new entities
introduced at inference time as in the inductive setting. This harmonic
extension technique provides the best such approximation, can be implemented
via an efficient iterative scheme, and can be employed to answer a family of
conjunctive logical queries over the knowledge graph, further expanding the
capabilities of transductive embedding methods. In experiments on a number of
large-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, we find that this approach
for extending the functionality of transductive knowledge graph embedding
models to perform knowledge graph completion and answer logical queries in the
inductive setting is competitive with--and in some scenarios
outperforms--several state-of-the-art models derived explicitly for such
inductive tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in the field of deep learning and impressive performance of
deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand
for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is
of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of
DNNs.
<br />In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components
in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been
introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of
safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant
for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has
already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI
safety such as ISO PAS 8800.
<br />While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this
paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and
safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional
categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional
teams to jointly address the concerns.

<p class="mathjax">Small devices are frequently used in IoT and smart-city applications to
perform periodic dedicated tasks with soft deadlines. This work focuses on
developing methods to derive efficient power-management methods for periodic
tasks on small devices. We first study the limitations of the existing Linux
built-in methods used in small devices. We illustrate three typical
workload/system patterns that are challenging to manage with Linux's built-in
solutions. We develop a reinforcement-learning-based technique with temporal
encoding to derive an effective DVFS governor even with the presence of the
three system patterns. The derived governor uses only one performance counter,
the same as the built-in Linux mechanism, and does not require an explicit task
model for the workload. We implemented a prototype system on the Nvidia Jetson
Nano Board and experimented with it with six applications, including two
self-designed and four benchmark applications. Under different deadline
constraints, our approach can quickly derive a DVFS governor that can adapt to
performance requirements and outperform the built-in Linux approach in energy
saving. On Mibench workloads, with performance slack ranging from 0.04 s to 0.4
s, the proposed method can save 3% - 11% more energy compared to Ondemand.
AudioReg and FaceReg applications tested have 5%- 14% energy-saving
improvement. We have open-sourced the implementation of our in-kernel quantized
neural network engine. The codebase can be found at:

<p class="mathjax">Sentiment analysis is a pivotal task in the domain of natural language
processing. It encompasses both text-level sentiment polarity classification
and word-level Part of Speech(POS) sentiment polarity determination. Such
analysis challenges models to understand text holistically while also
extracting nuanced information. With the rise of Large Language Models(LLMs),
new avenues for sentiment analysis have opened. This paper proposes enhancing
performance by leveraging the Mutual Reinforcement Effect(MRE) between
individual words and the overall text. It delves into how word polarity
influences the overarching sentiment of a passage. To support our research, we
annotated four novel Sentiment Text Classification and Part of Speech(SCPOS)
datasets, building upon existing sentiment classification datasets.
Furthermore, we developed a Universal Sentiment Analysis(USA) model, with a
7-billion parameter size. Experimental results revealed that our model
surpassed the performance of gpt-3.5-turbo across all four datasets,
underscoring the significance of MRE in sentiment analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Story ideation is a critical part of the story-writing process. It is
challenging to support computationally due to its exploratory and subjective
nature. Tropes, which are recurring narrative elements across stories, are
essential in stories as they shape the structure of narratives and our
understanding of them. In this paper, we propose to use tropes as an
intermediate representation of stories to approach story ideation. We present
TaleStream, a canvas system that uses tropes as building blocks of stories
while providing steerable suggestions of story ideas in the form of tropes. Our
trope suggestion methods leverage data from the tvtropes.org wiki. We find that
97% of the time, trope suggestions generated by our methods provide better
story ideation materials than random tropes. Our system evaluation suggests
that TaleStream can support writers' creative flow and greatly facilitates
story development. Tropes, as a rich lexicon of narratives with available
examples, play a key role in TaleStream and hold promise for story-creation
support systems.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the $ARMOR_D$ methods as novel approaches to enhancing the
adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a
new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an
infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport
(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by
maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the
information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against
adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$
against $FGSM$ and $98.18\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing
the error rate by more than $19.7\%$ and $37.2\%$ respectively compared to
prior methods. Similarly, in malware detection, a discrete (binary) data
domain, $ARMOR_D$ improves the robustified accuracy under $rFGSM^{50}$ attack
compared to the previous best-performing adversarial training methods by
$37.0\%$ while lowering false negative and false positive rates by $51.1\%$ and
$57.53\%$, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this paper to provide the solution microservices architecture as a
popular alternative to monolithic architecture. It discusses the advantages of
microservices and the challenges that organizations face when transitioning
from a monolithic system. It presents a case study of a financial application
and proposed techniques for identifying microservices on monolithic systems
using domain-driven development concepts. In recent years, microservices
architecture has emerged as a new architectural style in the software
development industry. As legacy monolithic software becomes too large to
manage, many large corporations are considering converting their traditional
monolithic systems into small-scale, self-contained microservices. However,
migrating from monolithic to microservices architecture is a difficult and
challenging task. It presents a comparison of the two architectural styles and
discusses the difficulties that led companies to switch to microservices. The
study's findings suggest that the proposed technique can improve work
performance and establish clear models, but it may not be useful for systems
with lower levels of complexity. This research paper has practical implications
for software architects and developers who are considering migrating from
monolithic to microservices architecture.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce two new extensions to the beam search algorithm based on
conformal predictions (CP) to produce sets of sequences with theoretical
coverage guarantees. The first method is very simple and proposes
dynamically-sized subsets of beam search results but, unlike typical CP
procedures, has an upper bound on the achievable guarantee depending on a
post-hoc calibration measure. Our second algorithm introduces the conformal set
prediction procedure as part of the decoding process, producing a variable beam
width which adapts to the current uncertainty. While more complex, this
procedure can achieve coverage guarantees selected a priori. We provide
marginal coverage bounds for each method, and evaluate them empirically on a
selection of tasks drawing from natural language processing and chemistry.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) and their
impact on power system stability and operation, the concept of
stability-constrained optimization has drawn significant attentions from
researchers. In order to manage the parametric uncertainty due to inaccurate
modeling that influences the system dynamics, this work proposes a
distributionally robust stability constraint formulation, where the propagation
mechanism from uncertainty of the system dynamic parameters to the stability
constraint coefficients is established and managed. Since these coefficients
are connected to the uncertain parameters through highly nonlinear and implicit
functions, an approximation approach utilizing Taylor expansion and the Delta
method is developed to estimate the statistical moments of the stability
constraint coefficients based on the first and second-order derivatives, with
which an ambiguity set for the distributionally robust optimization can be
formulated. The accuracy of the uncertainty propagation as well as the
effectiveness of the distributionally robust stability constraints are
demonstrated through detailed case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus system.

<p class="mathjax">In many parts of the world, the use of vast amounts of data collected on
public roadways for autonomous driving has increased. In order to detect and
anonymize pedestrian faces and nearby car license plates in actual road-driving
scenarios, there is an urgent need for effective solutions. As more data is
collected, privacy concerns regarding it increase, including but not limited to
pedestrian faces and surrounding vehicle license plates. Normal and fisheye
cameras are the two common camera types that are typically mounted on
collection vehicles. With complex camera distortion models, fisheye camera
images were deformed in contrast to regular images. It causes computer vision
tasks to perform poorly when using numerous deep learning models. In this work,
we pay particular attention to protecting privacy while yet adhering to several
laws for fisheye camera photos taken by driverless vehicles. First, we suggest
a framework for extracting face and plate identification knowledge from several
teacher models. Our second suggestion is to transform both the image and the
label from a regular image to fisheye-like data using a varied and realistic
fisheye transformation. Finally, we run a test using the open-source PP4AV
dataset. The experimental findings demonstrated that our model outperformed
baseline methods when trained on data from autonomous vehicles, even when the
data were softly labeled. The implementation code is available at our github:

<p class="mathjax">This work investigates the nuanced algorithm design choices for deep learning
in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which
admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a
multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource
tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,
sparsely-initialized MLP models; these networks sometimes outperform tuned
random forests.

<p class="mathjax">This work studies the performance of an event-based control approach, namely
level-triggered sampling, in a standard multidimensional single-integrator
setup. We falsify a conjecture from the literature that the deployed $p$-norm
in the triggering condition supposedly has no impact on the performance of the
sampling scheme in that setting. In particular, we show for the considered
setup that the usage of the maximum norm instead of the Euclidean norm induces
a performance deterioration of level-triggered sampling for sufficiently large
system dimensions, when compared to periodic control at the same sampling rate.
Moreover, we investigate the performance for other $p$-norms in simulation and
observe that it degrades with increasing $p$. In addition, our findings reveal
the previously unknown role of the triggering rule in the cause of a recently
discovered phenomenon: Previous work has shown for a single-integrator
consensus setup that the commonly observed performance advantage of event-based
control over periodic control can be lost in distributed settings with a
cooperative control goal. In our work, we obtain similar results for a
non-cooperative setting only by adjusting the norm in the level-triggered
sampling scheme. We therefore demonstrate that the performance degradation
found in the distributed setting originates from the triggering rule and not
from the considered cooperative control goal.

<p class="mathjax">RRAM-based multi-core systems improve the energy efficiency and performance
of CNNs. Thereby, the distributed parallel execution of convolutional layers
causes critical data dependencies that limit the potential speedup. This paper
presents synchronization techniques for parallel inference of convolutional
layers on RRAM-based CIM architectures. We propose an architecture optimization
that enables efficient data exchange and discuss the impact of different
architecture setups on the performance. The corresponding compiler algorithms
are optimized for high speedup and low memory consumption during CNN inference.
We achieve more than 99% of the theoretical acceleration limit with a marginal
data transmission overhead of less than 4% for state-of-the-art CNN benchmarks.

With respect to the proposed MLSD, we introduce a new family of

<p class="mathjax">Existing neural field representations for 3D object reconstruction either (1)
utilize object-level representations, but suffer from low-quality details due
to conditioning on a global latent code, or (2) are able to perfectly
reconstruct the observations, but fail to utilize object-level prior knowledge
to infer unobserved regions. We present SimNP, a method to learn category-level
self-similarities, which combines the advantages of both worlds by connecting
neural point radiance fields with a category-level self-similarity
representation. Our contribution is two-fold. (1) We design the first neural
point representation on a category level by utilizing the concept of coherent
point clouds. The resulting neural point radiance fields store a high level of
detail for locally supported object regions. (2) We learn how information is
shared between neural points in an unconstrained and unsupervised fashion,
which allows to derive unobserved regions of an object during the
reconstruction process from given observations. We show that SimNP is able to
outperform previous methods in reconstructing symmetric unseen object regions,
surpassing methods that build upon category-level or pixel-aligned radiance
fields, while providing semantic correspondences between instances

<p class="mathjax">Notions of graph similarity provide alternative perspective on the graph
isomorphism problem and vice-versa. In this paper, we consider measures of
similarity arising from mismatch norms as studied in Gervens and Grohe: the
edit distance $\delta_{\mathcal{E}}$, and the metrics arising from
$\ell_p$-operator norms, which we denote by $\delta_p$ and $\delta_{|p|}$. We
address the following question: can these measures of similarity be used to
design polynomial-time approximation algorithms for graph isomorphism? We show
that computing an optimal value of $\delta_{\mathcal{E}}$ is \NP-hard on pairs
of graphs with the same number of edges. In addition, we show that computing
optimal values of $\delta_p$ and $\delta_{|p|}$ is \NP-hard even on pairs of
$1$-planar graphs with the same degree sequence and bounded degree. These two
results improve on previous known ones, which did not examine the restricted
case where the pairs of graphs are required to have the same number of edges.
<br />Finally, we study similarity problems on strongly regular graphs and prove
some near optimal inequalities with interesting consequences on the
computational complexity of graph and group isomorphism.

<p class="mathjax">Scene reconstruction in the presence of high-speed motion and low
illumination is important in many applications such as augmented and virtual
reality, drone navigation, and autonomous robotics. Traditional motion
estimation techniques fail in such conditions, suffering from too much blur in
the presence of high-speed motion and strong noise in low-light conditions.
Single-photon cameras have recently emerged as a promising technology capable
of capturing hundreds of thousands of photon frames per second thanks to their
high speed and extreme sensitivity. Unfortunately, traditional computer vision
techniques are not well suited for dealing with the binary-valued photon data
captured by these cameras because these are corrupted by extreme Poisson noise.
Here we present a method capable of estimating extreme scene motion under
challenging conditions, such as low light or high dynamic range, from a
sequence of high-speed image frames such as those captured by a single-photon
camera. Our method relies on iteratively improving a motion estimate by
grouping and aggregating frames after-the-fact, in a stratified manner. We
demonstrate the creation of high-quality panoramas under fast motion and
extremely low light, and super-resolution results using a custom single-photon
camera prototype. For code and supplemental material see our

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel human body model formulated by an extensive set of
anthropocentric measurements, which is capable of generating a wide range of
human body shapes and poses. The proposed model enables direct modeling of
specific human identities through a deep generative architecture, which can
produce humans in any arbitrary pose. It is the first of its kind to have been
trained end-to-end using only synthetically generated data, which not only
provides highly accurate human mesh representations but also allows for precise
anthropometry of the body. Moreover, using a highly diverse animation library,
we articulated our synthetic humans' body and hands to maximize the diversity
of the learnable priors for model training. Our model was trained on a dataset
of $100k$ procedurally-generated posed human meshes and their corresponding
anthropometric measurements. Our synthetic data generator can be used to
generate millions of unique human identities and poses for non-commercial
academic research purposes.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments in text-conditioned image generative models have
revolutionized the production of realistic results. Unfortunately, this has
also led to an increase in privacy violations and the spread of false
information, which requires the need for traceability, privacy protection, and
other security measures. However, existing text-to-image paradigms lack the
technical capabilities to link traceable messages with image generation. In
this study, we introduce a novel task for the joint generation of text to image
and watermark (T2IW). This T2IW scheme ensures minimal damage to image quality
when generating a compound image by forcing the semantic feature and the
watermark signal to be compatible in pixels. Additionally, by utilizing
principles from Shannon information theory and non-cooperative game theory, we
are able to separate the revealed image and the revealed watermark from the
compound image. Furthermore, we strengthen the watermark robustness of our
approach by subjecting the compound image to various post-processing attacks,
with minimal pixel distortion observed in the revealed watermark. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated remarkable achievements in image quality,
watermark invisibility, and watermark robustness, supported by our proposed set
of evaluation metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Spherical polygons used in practice are nice, but the spherical
point-in-polygon problem (SPiP) has long eluded solutions based on the winding
number (wn). That a punctured sphere is simply connected is to blame. As a
workaround, we prove that requiring the boundary of a spherical polygon to
never intersect its antipode is sufficient to reduce its SPiP problem to the
planar, point-in-polygon (PiP) problem, whose state-of-the-art solution uses wn
and does not utilize known interior points (KIP). We refer to such spherical
polygons as boundary antipode-excluding (BAE) and show that all spherical
polygons fully contained within an open hemisphere is BAE. We document two
successful reduction methods, one based on rotation and the other on shearing,
and address a common concern. Both reduction algorithms, when combined with a
wn-PiP algorithm, solve SPiP correctly and efficiently for BAE spherical
polygons. The MATLAB code provided demonstrates scenarios that are problematic
for previous work.

<p class="mathjax">Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the
weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original
models

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks employing error back-propagation for learning can suffer
from exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous solutions have been
proposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions to
linear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which is
particularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models where
back-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to prime
the learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.
This is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a global
neuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allow
for slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, an
error must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and the
intensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. The
advantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free from
normalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrich
the learning. We present a mathematical derivation of the learning rule in
z-space and demonstrate the real-time performance with a robotic platform. The
results show a significant improvement in the speed of convergence compared to
that of the conventional back-propagation.

<p class="mathjax">High Dynamic Range (HDR) content creation has become an important topic for
modern media and entertainment sectors, gaming and Augmented/Virtual Reality
industries. Many methods have been proposed to recreate the HDR counterparts of
input Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images/videos given a single exposure or
multi-exposure LDRs. The state-of-the-art methods focus primarily on the
preservation of the reconstruction's structural similarity and the pixel-wise
accuracy. However, these conventional approaches do not emphasize preserving
the artistic intent of the images in terms of human visual perception, which is
an essential element in media, entertainment and gaming. In this paper, we
attempt to study and fill this gap. We propose an architecture called
ArtHDR-Net based on a Convolutional Neural Network that uses multi-exposed LDR
features as input. Experimental results show that ArtHDR-Net can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in terms of the HDR-VDP-2 score (i.e., mean
opinion score index) while reaching competitive performance in terms of PSNR
and SSIM.

<p class="mathjax">Drift in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where the statistical
properties of data or context, in which the model operates, change over time
leading to a decrease in its performance. Therefore, maintaining a constant
monitoring process for machine learning model performance is crucial in order
to proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,
supervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently
lead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed
unsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first
step involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,
and the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,
we employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target
distributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the
subset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models
retrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance
on online customer experience quality metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Learning for Demonstration (LfD) enables robots to acquire new skills by
imitating expert demonstrations, allowing users to communicate their
instructions in an intuitive manner. Recent progress in LfD often relies on
kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation as the medium for users to specify the
demonstrations. Kinesthetic teaching requires physical handling of the robot,
while teleoperation demands proficiency with additional hardware. This paper
introduces an alternative paradigm for LfD called Diagrammatic Teaching.
Diagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the user
to sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these are
then synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.
Additionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning
(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varying
probability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to find
corresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model of
motion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimic
those sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.
We empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,
which include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful approach in deep learning that
leverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model
performance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various
tasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in
sharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance
improvements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL
framework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from
pixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task
Attention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms to
incorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four
medical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:
radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two
different target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion
segmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19
diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical
imaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN
demonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely
used MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance
improvement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relative
decrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposed
MTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improve
their accuracy across domains.

<p class="mathjax">Adaptive interfaces can help users perform sequential decision-making tasks
like robotic teleoperation given noisy, high-dimensional command signals (e.g.,
from a brain-computer interface). Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machine
learning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend to
be limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users in
practice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to
address this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actions
using a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To address
the challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop a
novel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for a
given trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist users
who can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels through
a user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task by
using their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from their
webcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigation
more often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise user
commands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate on
a simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Lander
game with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves over
baseline interfaces in these domains as well. Extensive ablation experiments
with simulated user commands empirically motivate each component of our method.

<p class="mathjax">Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is considered as a major step in the
evolution of next-generation cellular networks given its support for open
interfaces and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) into the deployment,
operation, and maintenance of RAN. However, due to the openness of the O-RAN
architecture, such AI models are inherently vulnerable to various adversarial
machine learning (ML) attacks, i.e., adversarial attacks which correspond to
slight manipulation of the input to the ML model. In this work, we showcase the
vulnerability of an example ML model used in O-RAN, and experimentally deploy
it in the near-real time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC). Our
ML-based interference classifier xApp (extensible application in near-RT RIC)
tries to classify the type of interference to mitigate the interference effect
on the O-RAN system. We demonstrate the first-ever scenario of how such an xApp
can be impacted through an adversarial attack by manipulating the data stored
in a shared database inside the near-RT RIC. Through a rigorous performance
analysis deployed on a laboratory O-RAN testbed, we evaluate the performance in
terms of capacity and the prediction accuracy of the interference classifier
xApp using both clean and perturbed data. We show that even small adversarial
attacks can significantly decrease the accuracy of ML application in near-RT
RIC, which can directly impact the performance of the entire O-RAN deployment.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks (NNs) have been shown to learn complex control laws
successfully, often with performance advantages or decreased computational cost
compared to alternative methods. Neural network controllers (NNCs) are,
however, highly sensitive to disturbances and uncertainty, meaning that it can
be challenging to make satisfactory robustness guarantees for systems with
these controllers. This problem is exacerbated when considering multi-agent
NN-controlled systems, as existing reachability methods often scale poorly for
large systems. This paper addresses the problem of finding overapproximations
of forward reachable sets for discrete-time uncertain multi-agent systems with
distributed NNC architectures. We first reformulate the dynamics, making the
system more amenable to reachablility analysis. Next, we take advantage of the
distributed architecture to split the overall reachability problem into smaller
problems, significantly reducing computation time. We use quadratic
constraints, along with a convex representation of uncertainty in each agent's
model, to form semidefinite programs, the solutions of which give
overapproximations of forward reachable sets for each agent. Finally, the
methodology is tested on two realistic examples: a platoon of vehicles and a
power network system.

<p class="mathjax">Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific
events, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations.
This is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically
important events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have
limitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting
to estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a
classification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the
events. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training
data points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving
the predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a
novel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.
Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that
performs robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our
approach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in
the absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with
deep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of
uncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis
methods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results
indicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting
time-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance. Our
implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/ahmedhshahin/CenTime.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP and
multimodal tasks. Despite these successes, their development faces two main
challenges: (i) high computational cost; and (ii) difficulty in conducting fair
and objective evaluations. LLMs are prohibitively expensive, making it feasible
for only a few major players to undertake their training, thereby constraining
both research and application opportunities. This underscores the importance of
cost-effective LLM training. In this paper, we utilize a growth strategy to
significantly reduce LLM training cost. We demonstrate that an LLM with 101B
parameters and 0.31TB tokens can be trained on a $100K budget. We also adopt a
systematic evaluation paradigm for the IQ evaluation of LLMs, in complement to
existing evaluations that focus more on knowledge-oriented abilities. We
introduce our benchmark including evaluations on important aspects of
intelligence including symbolic mapping, itrule understanding, pattern mining,
and anti-interference. Such evaluations minimize the potential impact of
memorization. Experimental results show that our model FLM-101B, trained with a
budget of $100K, achieves comparable performance to powerful and well-known
models, eg GPT-3 and GLM-130B, especially in the IQ benchmark evaluations with
contexts unseen in training data. The checkpoint of FLM-101B will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/FLM-101B.

<p class="mathjax">Training deep learning models for video classification from audio-visual data
commonly requires immense amounts of labeled training data collected via a
costly process. A challenging and underexplored, yet much cheaper, setup is
few-shot learning from video data. In particular, the inherently multi-modal
nature of video data with sound and visual information has not been leveraged
extensively for the few-shot video classification task. Therefore, we introduce
a unified audio-visual few-shot video classification benchmark on three
datasets, i.e. the VGGSound-FSL, UCF-FSL, ActivityNet-FSL datasets, where we
adapt and compare ten methods. In addition, we propose AV-DIFF, a
text-to-feature diffusion framework, which first fuses the temporal and
audio-visual features via cross-modal attention and then generates multi-modal
features for the novel classes. We show that AV-DIFF obtains state-of-the-art
performance on our proposed benchmark for audio-visual (generalised) few-shot
learning. Our benchmark paves the way for effective audio-visual classification
when only limited labeled data is available. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/ExplainableML/AVDIFF-GFSL.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of private membership aggregation (PMA), in which a
user counts the number of times a certain element is stored in a system of
independent parties that store arbitrary sets of elements from a universal
alphabet. The parties are not allowed to learn which element is being counted
by the user. Further, neither the user nor the other parties are allowed to
learn the stored elements of each party involved in the process. PMA is a
generalization of the recently introduced problem of $K$ private set
intersection ($K$-PSI). The $K$-PSI problem considers a set of $M$ parties
storing arbitrary sets of elements, and a user who wants to determine if a
certain element is repeated at least at $K$ parties out of the $M$ parties
without learning which party has the required element and which party does not.
To solve the general problem of PMA, we dissect it into four categories based
on the privacy requirement and the collusions among databases/parties. We map
these problems into equivalent private information retrieval (PIR) problems. We
propose achievable schemes for each of the four variants of the problem based
on the concept of cross-subspace alignment (CSA). The proposed schemes achieve
\emph{linear} communication complexity as opposed to the state-of-the-art
$K$-PSI scheme that requires \emph{exponential} complexity even though our PMA
problems contain more security and privacy constraints.

given administrative service unit, known as a Continuum of Care. Further, we
specifically advocate for the network sampling method known as Respondent

estimates of totals and proportions for hard-to-reach populations in contexts
where a sampling frame (e.g., housing addresses) not available. To make the RDS
estimator work for estimating the total number of unsheltered people, we
introduce a new method that leverages administrative data from the HUD-mandated
Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). The HMIS provides high-quality
counts and demographics for people experiencing homelessness who sleep in
emergency shelters. We then demonstrate this method using network data
collected in Nashville, TN, combined with simulation methods to illustrate the
efficacy of this approach. Finally, we end with discussing how this could be

<p class="mathjax">Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased
remarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural language
instructions. However, an open research question concerns the inherent biases
of trained models and their responses. For instance, if the data used to tune
an LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, we
might expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeks
to de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With this
demonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Rather
than aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. To
this end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questions
and select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer this
question using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selected
biases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, we
identified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derived
an instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of one
of these demographics. This paper presents OpinionGPT, illustrates how we
trained the bias-aware model and showcases the web application (available at
https://opiniongpt.informatik.hu-berlin.de).

<p class="mathjax">Envision an intelligent agent capable of assisting users in conducting
forecasting tasks through intuitive, natural conversations, without requiring
in-depth knowledge of the underlying machine learning (ML) processes. A
significant challenge for the agent in this endeavor is to accurately
comprehend the user's prediction goals and, consequently, formulate precise ML
tasks. In this paper, we take a pioneering step towards this ambitious goal by
introducing a new concept called Forecast Utterance and then focus on the
automatic and accurate interpretation of users' prediction goals from these
utterances. Specifically, we frame the task as a slot-filling problem, where
each slot corresponds to a specific aspect of the goal prediction task. We then
employ two zero-shot methods for solving the slot-filling task, namely: 1)
Entity Extraction (EE), and 2) Question-Answering (QA) techniques. Our
experiments, conducted with three meticulously crafted data sets, validate the
viability of our ambitious goal and demonstrate the effectiveness of both EE
and QA techniques in interpreting Forecast Utterances.

<p class="mathjax">Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine
learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various
frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.
However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the
difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation
algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation
protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing
HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not
available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress
compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good
evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria
and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are
challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and
Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically
achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using
proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously
unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our
improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter
optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence
research progress, within this important field going forward.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task format in
the research of large language models (LLMs). Our work shows that LLMs exhibit
an inherent "selection bias" in MCQs, which refers to LLMs' preferences to
select options located at specific positions (like "Option C"). This bias is
prevalent across various LLMs, making their performance vulnerable to option
position changes in MCQs. We identify that one primary cause resulting in
selection bias is option numbering, i.e., the ID symbols A/B/C/D associated
with the options. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a new method called
PriDe. PriDe first decomposes the observed model prediction distribution into
an intrinsic prediction over option contents and a prior distribution over
option IDs. It then estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a
small number of test samples, which is used to debias the subsequent test
samples. We demonstrate that, as a label-free, inference-time method, PriDe
achieves a more effective and computation-efficient debiasing than strong
baselines. We further show that the priors estimated by PriDe generalize well
across different domains, highlighting its practical potential in broader
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone
to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen
during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing
hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on
retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains
the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained
from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,
exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown
to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by
Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge
and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the
truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for
example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by
12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably
generate truthful facts.

<p class="mathjax">The task of audio captioning is similar in essence to tasks such as image and
video captioning. However, it has received much less attention. We propose
three desiderata for captioning audio -- (i) fluency of the generated text,
(ii) faithfulness of the generated text to the input audio, and the somewhat
related (iii) audibility, which is the quality of being able to be perceived
based only on audio. Our method is a zero-shot method, i.e., we do not learn to
perform captioning. Instead, captioning occurs as an inference process that
involves three networks that correspond to the three desired qualities: (i) A
Large Language Model, in our case, for reasons of convenience, GPT-2, (ii) A
model that provides a matching score between an audio file and a text, for
which we use a multimodal matching network called ImageBind, and (iii) A text
classifier, trained using a dataset we collected automatically by instructing
GPT-4 with prompts designed to direct the generation of both audible and
inaudible sentences. We present our results on the AudioCap dataset,
demonstrating that audibility guidance significantly enhances performance
compared to the baseline, which lacks this objective.

<p class="mathjax">Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful
for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide
interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,
most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,
narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all
human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and
complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate
descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models
in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for
evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and
compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function
INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building
blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that
resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions
of the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed
across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world
complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We
evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce
code-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that an
off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can
sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,
proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,
LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local
corruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the
performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are
applied to real-world models.

<p class="mathjax">We present ArtiGrasp, a novel method to synthesize bi-manual hand-object
interactions that include grasping and articulation. This task is challenging
due to the diversity of the global wrist motions and the precise finger control
that are necessary to articulate objects. ArtiGrasp leverages reinforcement
learning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global and
local hand pose. Our framework unifies grasping and articulation within a
single policy guided by a single hand pose reference. Moreover, to facilitate
the training of the precise finger control required for articulation, we
present a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts with
single-hand manipulation of stationary objects and continues with multi-agent
training including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate our
method, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task that
involves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requires
grasping, relocation, and articulation. We show our method's efficacy towards
this task. We further demonstrate that our method can generate motions with
noisy hand-object pose estimates from an off-the-shelf image-based regressor.

<p class="mathjax">Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the
recently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object
detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often
require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,
followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are
costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we
presentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides
high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists
of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,
contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data
in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit
semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with
detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,
we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing
detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in
diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised
pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised
learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up
data, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.

<p class="mathjax">We present InstructDiffusion, a unifying and generic framework for aligning
computer vision tasks with human instructions. Unlike existing approaches that
integrate prior knowledge and pre-define the output space (e.g., categories and
coordinates) for each vision task, we cast diverse vision tasks into a
human-intuitive image-manipulating process whose output space is a flexible and
interactive pixel space. Concretely, the model is built upon the diffusion
process and is trained to predict pixels according to user instructions, such
as encircling the man's left shoulder in red or applying a blue mask to the
left car. InstructDiffusion could handle a variety of vision tasks, including
understanding tasks (such as segmentation and keypoint detection) and
generative tasks (such as editing and enhancement). It even exhibits the
ability to handle unseen tasks and outperforms prior methods on novel datasets.
This represents a significant step towards a generalist modeling interface for
vision tasks, advancing artificial general intelligence in the field of
computer vision.

<p class="mathjax">Flow-based propagation and spatiotemporal Transformer are two mainstream
mechanisms in video inpainting (VI). Despite the effectiveness of these
components, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their
performance. Previous propagation-based approaches are performed separately
either in the image or feature domain. Global image propagation isolated from
learning may cause spatial misalignment due to inaccurate optical flow.
Moreover, memory or computational constraints limit the temporal range of
feature propagation and video Transformer, preventing exploration of
correspondence information from distant frames. To address these issues, we
propose an improved framework, called ProPainter, which involves enhanced
ProPagation and an efficient Transformer. Specifically, we introduce
dual-domain propagation that combines the advantages of image and feature
warping, exploiting global correspondences reliably. We also propose a
mask-guided sparse video Transformer, which achieves high efficiency by
discarding unnecessary and redundant tokens. With these components, ProPainter
outperforms prior arts by a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR while maintaining
appealing efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a spatiotemporal traffic prediction approach for NextG
mobile networks, ensuring the service-level agreements (SLAs) of each network
slice. Our approach is multivariate, multi-step, and spatiotemporal. Leveraging
20 radio access network (RAN) features, peak traffic hour data, and
mobility-based clustering, we propose a parametric SLA-based loss function to
guarantee an SLA violation rate. We focus on single-cell, multi-cell, and
slice-based prediction approaches and present a detailed comparative analysis
of their performances, strengths, and limitations.
<br />First, we address the application of single-cell and multi-cell training
architectures. While single-cell training offers individual cell-level
prediction, multi-cell training involves training a model using traffic from
multiple cells from the same or different base stations. We show that the
single-cell approach outperforms the multi-cell approach and results in test
loss improvements of 11.4% and 38.1% compared to baseline SLA-based and
MAE-based models, respectively.
<br />Next, we explore slice-based traffic prediction. We present single-slice and
multi-slice methods for slice-based downlink traffic volume prediction, arguing
that multi-slice prediction offers a more accurate forecast. The slice-based
model we introduce offers substantial test loss improvements of 28.2%, 36.4%,
and 55.6% compared to our cell-based model, the baseline SLA-based model, and
the baseline MAE-based model, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Not all camouflages are equally effective, as even a partially visible
contour or a slight color difference can make the animal stand out and break
its camouflage. In this paper, we address the question of what makes a
camouflage successful, by proposing three scores for automatically assessing
its effectiveness. In particular, we show that camouflage can be measured by
the similarity between background and foreground features and boundary
visibility. We use these camouflage scores to assess and compare all available
camouflage datasets. We also incorporate the proposed camouflage score into a
generative model as an auxiliary loss and show that effective camouflage images
or videos can be synthesised in a scalable manner. The generated synthetic
dataset is used to train a transformer-based model for segmenting camouflaged
animals in videos. Experimentally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art camouflage
breaking performance on the public MoCA-Mask benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Training data for video segmentation are expensive to annotate. This impedes
extensions of end-to-end algorithms to new video segmentation tasks, especially
in large-vocabulary settings. To 'track anything' without training on video
data for every individual task, we develop a decoupled video segmentation
approach (DEVA), composed of task-specific image-level segmentation and
class/task-agnostic bi-directional temporal propagation. Due to this design, we
only need an image-level model for the target task (which is cheaper to train)
and a universal temporal propagation model which is trained once and
generalizes across tasks. To effectively combine these two modules, we use
bi-directional propagation for (semi-)online fusion of segmentation hypotheses
from different frames to generate a coherent segmentation. We show that this
decoupled formulation compares favorably to end-to-end approaches in several
data-scarce tasks including large-vocabulary video panoptic segmentation,
open-world video segmentation, referring video segmentation, and unsupervised
video object segmentation. Code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Due to the difficulty in scaling up, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
seem to be falling from grace on the task of text-conditioned image synthesis.
Sparsely-activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has recently been demonstrated as a
valid solution to training large-scale models with limited computational
resources. Inspired by such a philosophy, we present Aurora, a GAN-based
text-to-image generator that employs a collection of experts to learn feature
processing, together with a sparse router to help select the most suitable
expert for each feature point. To faithfully decode the sampling stochasticity
and the text condition to the final synthesis, our router adaptively makes its
decision by taking into account the text-integrated global latent code. At
64x64 image resolution, our model trained on LAION2B-en and COYO-700M achieves
6.2 zero-shot FID on MS COCO. We release the code and checkpoints to facilitate
the community for further development.

<p class="mathjax">We present ImageBind-LLM, a multi-modality instruction tuning method of large
language models (LLMs) via ImageBind. Existing works mainly focus on language
and image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can
respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,
and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.
During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space
between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features
transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in
LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free
and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of
ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior
multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the
multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and
processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding
enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image
features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the
training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,
ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate
significant language generation quality. Code is released at

introducing vulnerability graphs, related to attack graphs, this paper provides
background theory and a subsequent method for solving significant cybersecurity
problems with quantum computing. The example given is to prioritize patches by
expressing the connectivity of various vulnerabilities on a network with a QUBO
and then solving this with quantum annealing. Such a solution is then proved to
remove all kill-chains (paths to security compromise) on a network. The results
demonstrate that the quantum computer's solve time is almost constant compared
to the exponential increase in classical solve time for vulnerability graphs of
expected real world density. As such, this paper presents a novel example of
advantageous quantum vulnerability analysis.

Value Iteration (VI) and State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) are
implemented along with the off-policy technique of Q-Learning. The models are
trained and tested on a dataset comprising multiple years of stock market data
from 2000-2023. The analysis presents the results and findings from training
and testing the models using two different time periods: one including the
COVID-19 pandemic years and one excluding them. The results indicate that
including market data from the COVID-19 period in the training dataset leads to
superior performance compared to the baseline strategies. During testing, the
on-policy approaches (VI and SARSA) outperform Q-learning, highlighting the
influence of bias-variance tradeoff and the generalization capabilities of
simpler policies. However, it is noted that the performance of Q-learning may
vary depending on the stability of future market conditions. Future work is
suggested, including experiments with updated Q-learning policies during
testing and trading diverse individual stocks. Additionally, the exploration of
alternative economic indicators for training the models is proposed.

<p class="mathjax">Surveillance systems have emerged as crucial elements in upholding peace and
security in the modern world. Their ubiquity aids in monitoring suspicious
activities effectively. However, in densely populated environments, continuous
active monitoring becomes impractical, necessitating the development of
intelligent surveillance systems. AI integration in the surveillance domain was
a big revolution, however, speed issues have prevented its widespread
implementation in the field. It has been observed that quantum artificial
intelligence has led to a great breakthrough. Quantum artificial
intelligence-based surveillance systems have shown to be more accurate as well
as capable of performing well in real-time scenarios, which had never been seen
before. In this research, a RentinaNet model is integrated with Quantum CNN and
termed as Quantum-RetinaNet. By harnessing the Quantum capabilities of QCNN,
Quantum-RetinaNet strikes a balance between accuracy and speed. This innovative
integration positions it as a game-changer, addressing the challenges of active
monitoring in densely populated scenarios. As demand for efficient surveillance
solutions continues to grow, Quantum-RetinaNet offers a compelling alternative
to existing CNN models, upholding accuracy standards without sacrificing
real-time performance. The unique attributes of Quantum-RetinaNet have
far-reaching implications for the future of intelligent surveillance. With its
enhanced processing speed, it is poised to revolutionize the field, catering to
the pressing need for rapid yet precise monitoring. As Quantum-RetinaNet
becomes the new standard, it ensures public safety and security while pushing
the boundaries of AI in surveillance.

<p class="mathjax">With the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined and
adaptable tools to handle the analysis continues to grow. In response to this
need, we introduce Auto Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA), an autonomous AI
agent based on a large language model designed explicitly for conventional
omics data analysis. AutoBA simplifies the analytical process by requiring
minimal user input while delivering detailed step-by-step plans for various
bioinformatics tasks. Through rigorous validation by expert bioinformaticians,
AutoBA's robustness and adaptability are affirmed across a diverse range of
omics analysis cases, including whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and spatial transcriptomics. AutoBA's
unique capacity to self-design analysis processes based on input data
variations further underscores its versatility. Compared with online
bioinformatic services, AutoBA deploys the analysis locally, preserving data
privacy. Moreover, different from the predefined pipeline, AutoBA has
adaptability in sync with emerging bioinformatics tools. Overall, AutoBA
represents a convenient tool, offering robustness and adaptability for complex
omics data analysis.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce EGIC, a novel generative image compression method that allows
traversing the distortion-perception curve efficiently from a single model.
Specifically, we propose an implicitly encoded variant of image interpolation
that predicts the residual between a MSE-optimized and GAN-optimized decoder
output. On the receiver side, the user can then control the impact of the
residual on the GAN-based reconstruction. Together with improved GAN-based
building blocks, EGIC outperforms a wide-variety of perception-oriented and
distortion-oriented baselines, including HiFiC, MRIC and DIRAC, while
performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to
implement, very lightweight (e.g. 0.18x model parameters compared to HiFiC) and
provides excellent interpolation characteristics, which makes it a promising
candidate for practical applications targeting the low bit range.

<p class="mathjax">Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models are typically well
described by their representation as a partial Fourier series of the input
features, with frequencies uniquely determined by the feature map's generator
Hamiltonians. Ordinarily, these data-encoding generators are chosen in advance,
fixing the space of functions that can be represented. In this work we consider
a generalization of quantum models to include a set of trainable parameters in
the generator, leading to a trainable frequency (TF) quantum model. We
numerically demonstrate how TF models can learn generators with desirable
properties for solving the task at hand, including non-regularly spaced
frequencies in their spectra and flexible spectral richness. Finally, we
showcase the real-world effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an
improved accuracy in solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a TF model with
only a single parameter added to each encoding operation. Since TF models
encompass conventional fixed frequency models, they may offer a sensible
default choice for variational quantum machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel approach for efficiently generating quantum feature maps
for quantum-enhanced support vector machines, a kernel-based classifier,
enabling access to high-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method employs a
multi-objective genetic algorithm that simultaneously maximizes classification
accuracy while minimizing both the local and non-local gate costs of the
quantum feature map's circuit. To achieve this, we define distinct fitness
functions for local gates and entanglement gates. Comparisons with classical
classifiers are given in order to understand the advantages of using quantum
machine learning. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that the optimal
configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a
proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement, contrary to previous
literature where non-local gates were largely suppressed.
<br />Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes of data can be
effectively leveraged to determine the number of non-local gates required for
the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can
significantly aid in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement
parameter, in various quantum programming packages like quiskit.org based on
data analysis. Our findings offer valuable guidance for enhancing the
efficiency and accuracy of quantum machine learning algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications
in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in
clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences
are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent
contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models
trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage
generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a
surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based
on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral
biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In
this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS),
a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of
the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel
mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is
conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent
code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular
schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed
state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and
quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS
was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models.
To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream
tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at
inference.

<p class="mathjax">As deeper and more complex models are developed for the task of sound event
localization and detection (SELD), the demand for annotated spatial audio data
continues to increase. Annotating field recordings with 360$^{\circ}$ video
takes many hours from trained annotators, while recording events within
motion-tracked laboratories are bounded by cost and expertise. Because of this,
localization models rely on a relatively limited amount of spatial audio data
in the form of spatial room impulse response (SRIR) datasets, which limits the
progress of increasingly deep neural network based approaches. In this work, we
demonstrate that simulated geometrical acoustics can provide an appealing
solution to this problem. We use simulated geometrical acoustics to generate a
novel SRIR dataset that can train a SELD model to provide similar performance
to that of a real SRIR dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate using simulated
data to augment existing datasets, improving on benchmarks set by state of the
art SELD models. We explore the potential and limitations of geometric acoustic
simulation for localization and event detection. We also propose further
studies to verify the limitations of this method, as well as further methods to
generate synthetic data for SELD tasks without the need to record more data.

<p class="mathjax">Interpolators are unstable. For example, the mininum $\ell_2$ norm least
square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.
<br />Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach for segmenting kidney
parenchyma and kidney abnormalities to support clinicians in identifying and
quantifying renal abnormalities such as cysts, lesions, masses, metastases, and
primary tumors. Our end-to-end segmentation method was trained on 215
contrast-enhanced thoracic-abdominal CT scans, with half of these scans
containing one or more abnormalities.
<br />We began by implementing our own version of the original 3D U-Net network and
incorporated four additional components: an end-to-end multi-resolution
approach, a set of task-specific data augmentations, a modified loss function
using top-$k$, and spatial dropout. Furthermore, we devised a tailored
post-processing strategy. Ablation studies demonstrated that each of the four
modifications enhanced kidney abnormality segmentation performance, while three
out of four improved kidney parenchyma segmentation. Subsequently, we trained
the nnUNet framework on our dataset. By ensembling the optimized 3D U-Net and
the nnUNet with our specialized post-processing, we achieved marginally
superior results.
<br />Our best-performing model attained Dice scores of 0.965 and 0.947 for
segmenting kidney parenchyma in two test sets (20 scans without abnormalities
and 30 with abnormalities), outperforming an independent human observer who
scored 0.944 and 0.925, respectively. In segmenting kidney abnormalities within
the 30 test scans containing them, the top-performing method achieved a Dice
score of 0.585, while an independent second human observer reached a score of
0.664, suggesting potential for further improvement in computerized methods.

<p class="mathjax">Ising machines have emerged as a promising solution for rapidly solving
NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, surpassing the capabilities of
traditional computing methods. By efficiently determining the ground state of
the Hamiltonian during the annealing process, Ising machines can effectively
complement CPUs in tackling optimization challenges. To realize these Ising
machines, a bi-stable oscillator is essential to emulate the atomic spins and
interactions of the Ising model. This study introduces a Josephson parametric
oscillator (JPO)-based tile structure, serving as a fundamental unit for
scalable superconductor-based Ising machines. Leveraging the bi-stable nature
of JPOs, which are superconductor-based oscillators, the proposed machine can
operate at frequencies of 7.5GHz while consuming significantly less power (by
three orders of magnitude) than CMOS-based systems. Furthermore, the
compatibility of the proposed tile structure with the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller
(LHZ) architecture ensures its viability for large-scale integration. We
conducted simulations of the tile in a noisy environment to validate its
functionality. We verified its operational characteristics by comparing the
results with the analytical solution of its Hamiltonian model. This
verification demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the JPO-based
tile in implementing Ising machines, opening new avenues for efficient and
scalable combinatorial optimization in quantum computing.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate segmentation of punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) are
fundamental for the timely diagnosis and treatment of related developmental
disorders. Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is
challenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast,
and the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing
learning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this
challenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of
PWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the idea of counterfactual reasoning coupled with the
auxiliary task of brain tissue segmentation to learn fine-grained positional
and morphological representations of PWMLs for accurate localization and
segmentation. A simple and easy-to-implement deep-learning framework (i.e.,
DeepPWML) is accordingly designed. It combines the lesion counterfactual map
with the tissue probability map to train a lightweight PWML segmentation
network, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a real-clinical dataset
of infant T1w MR images. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We present a data-driven model for ground-motion synthesis using a Generative
Adversarial Neural Operator (GANO) that combines recent advancements in machine
learning and open access strong motion data sets to generate three-component
acceleration time histories conditioned on moment magnitude ($M$), rupture
distance ($R_{rup}$), time-average shear-wave velocity at the top $30m$
($V_{S30}$), and tectonic environment or style of faulting. We use Neural
Operators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model
training is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the
conditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as
cGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify
the cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We
lastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the
framework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier
amplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through
residual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with
conventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.
Results show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for
the corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at
short distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of
short distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is
also well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of
training data. Applications of the presented framework include generation of
risk-targeted ground motions for site-specific engineering applications.

<p class="mathjax">Cerebrovascular disease is one of the major diseases facing the world today.
Automatic segmentation of intracranial artery (IA) in digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences is an important step in the diagnosis of vascular
related diseases and in guiding neurointerventional procedures. While, a single
image can only show part of the IA within the contrast medium according to the
imaging principle of DSA technology. Therefore, 2D DSA segmentation methods are
unable to capture the complete IA information and treatment of cerebrovascular
diseases. We propose A timing sequence image segmentation network with U-shape,
called TSI-Net, which incorporates a bi-directional ConvGRU module (BCM) in the
encoder. The network incorporates a bi-directional ConvGRU module (BCM) in the
encoder, which can input variable-length DSA sequences, retain past and future
information, segment them into 2D images. In addition, we introduce a sensitive
detail branch (SDB) at the end for supervising fine vessels. Experimented on
the DSA sequence dataset DIAS, the method performs significantly better than
state-of-the-art networks in recent years. In particular, it achieves a Sen
evaluation metric of 0.797, which is a 3% improvement compared to other
methods.

<p class="mathjax">The image source method (ISM) is often used to simulate room acoustics due to
its ease of use and computational efficiency. The standard ISM is limited to
simulations of room impulse responses between point sources and omnidirectional
receivers. In this work, the ISM is extended using spherical harmonic
directivity coefficients to include acoustic diffraction effects due to source
and receiver transducers mounted on physical devices, which are typically
encountered in practical situations. The proposed method is verified using
finite element simulations of various loudspeaker and microphone configurations
in a rectangular room. It is shown that the accuracy of the proposed method is
related to the sizes, shapes, number, and positions of the devices inside a
room. A simplified version of the proposed method, which can significantly
reduce computational effort, is also presented. The proposed method and its
simplified version can simulate room transfer functions more accurately than
currently available image source methods and can aid the development and
evaluation of speech and acoustic signal processing algorithms, including
speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis, and acoustic parameter estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Image segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, providing
valuable information that helps to make an accurate diagnosis. In recent years,
deep learning-based automatic image segmentation methods have achieved
outstanding results in medical images. In this paper, inspired by the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model that has received much attention for
its impressive accuracy and powerful generalization ability in 2D still image
segmentation, we propose a SAM3D that targets at 3D volumetric medical images
and utilizes the pre-trained features from the SAM encoder to capture
meaningful representations of input images. Different from other existing
SAM-based volumetric segmentation methods that perform the segmentation by
dividing the volume into a set of 2D slices, our model takes the whole 3D
volume image as input and processes it simply and effectively that avoids
training a significant number of parameters. Extensive experiments are
conducted on multiple medical image datasets to demonstrate that our network
attains competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods in 3D
medical segmentation tasks while being significantly efficient in terms of
parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Pathologists routinely use immunohistochemical (IHC)-stained tissue slides
against MelanA in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained slides to
improve their accuracy in diagnosing melanomas. The use of diagnostic Deep
Learning (DL)-based support systems for automated examination of tissue
morphology and cellular composition has been well studied in standard
H&amp;E-stained tissue slides. In contrast, there are few studies that analyze IHC
slides using DL. Therefore, we investigated the separate and joint performance
of ResNets trained on MelanA and corresponding H&amp;E-stained slides. The MelanA
classifier achieved an area under receiver operating characteristics curve
(AUROC) of 0.82 and 0.74 on out of distribution (OOD)-datasets, similar to the
H&amp;E-based benchmark classification of 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. A combined
classifier using MelanA and H&amp;E achieved AUROCs of 0.85 and 0.81 on the OOD
datasets. DL MelanA-based assistance systems show the same performance as the
benchmark H&amp;E classification and may be improved by multi stain classification
to assist pathologists in their clinical routine.

<p class="mathjax">A novel and fully distributed optimization method is proposed for the
distributed robust convex program (DRCP) over a time-varying unbalanced
directed network without imposing any differentiability assumptions. Firstly, a
tractable approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the
semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints and
restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a proper positive
parameter, which will be iteratively solved by a random-fixed projection
algorithm. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for
locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with
guaranteed feasibility. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the
DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand
constraints and populating the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of
constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time convergence of the distributed
optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on
uniformly local consensus and zeroth-order optimality under uniformly strongly
connected graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus
approach converges within a finite number of iterations. Finally, the
effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

<p class="mathjax">Diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration
pose a significant risk to vision, highlighting the importance of precise
segmentation of retinal vessels for the tracking and diagnosis of progression.
However, existing vessel segmentation methods that heavily rely on
encoder-decoder structures struggle to capture contextual information about
retinal vessel configurations, leading to challenges in reconciling semantic
disparities between encoder and decoder features. To address this, we propose a
novel feature enhancement segmentation network (FES-Net) that achieves accurate
pixel-wise segmentation without requiring additional image enhancement steps.
FES-Net directly processes the input image and utilizes four prompt
convolutional blocks (PCBs) during downsampling, complemented by a shallow
upsampling approach to generate a binary mask for each class. We evaluate the
performance of FES-Net on four publicly available state-of-the-art datasets:
DRIVE, STARE, CHASE, and HRF. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the
superior performance of FES-Net compared to other competitive approaches
documented in the existing literature.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces the Trinary decision tree, an algorithm designed to
improve the handling of missing data in decision tree regressors and
classifiers. Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume
that missing values contain any information about the response. Both
theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random
(MCAR), and Informative Missingness (IM)). Notably, the Trinary tree
outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes
(MIA) approach, shows robust performance in all types of missingness. Despite
the potential drawback of slower training speed, the Trinary tree offers a
promising and more accurate method of handling missing data in decision tree
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to examine brain functionality by
detecting alteration in oxygenated blood flow that arises with brain activity.
In this study, complexity specific image categorization across different visual
datasets is performed using fMRI time series (TS) to understand differences in
neuronal activities related to vision. Publicly available BOLD5000 dataset is
used for this purpose, containing fMRI scans while viewing 5254 images of
diverse categories, drawn from three standard computer vision datasets: COCO,
ImageNet and SUN. To understand vision, it is important to study how brain
functions while looking at different images. To achieve this, spatial encoding
of fMRI BOLD TS has been performed that uses classical Gramian Angular Field
(GAF) and Markov Transition Field (MTF) to obtain 2D BOLD TS, representing
images of COCO, Imagenet and SUN. For classification, individual GAF and MTF
features are fed into regular CNN. Subsequently, parallel CNN model is employed
that uses combined 2D features for classifying images across COCO, Imagenet and
SUN. The result of 2D CNN models is also compared with 1D LSTM and Bi-LSTM that
utilizes raw fMRI BOLD signal for classification. It is seen that parallel CNN
model outperforms other network models with an improvement of 7% for
multi-class classification. Clinical relevance- The obtained result of this
analysis establishes a baseline in studying how differently human brain
functions while looking at images of diverse complexities.

<p class="mathjax">In quantum computing and quantum information processing, graph states are a
specific type of quantum states which are commonly used in quantum networking
and quantum error correction. A recurring problem is finding a transformation
from a given source graph state to a desired target graph state using only
local operations. Recently it has been shown that deciding transformability is
already NP-hard. In this paper, we present a CNF encoding for both local and
non-local graph state operations, corresponding to one- and two-qubit Clifford
gates and single-qubit Pauli measurements. We use this encoding in a
bounded-model-checking set-up to synthesize the desired transformation. For a
completeness threshold, we provide an upper bound on the length of the
transformation if it exists. We evaluate the approach in two settings: the
first is the synthesis of the ubiquitous GHZ state from a random graph state
where we can vary the number of qubits, while the second is based on a proposed
14 node quantum network. We find that the approach is able to synthesize
transformations for graphs up to 17 qubits in under 30 minutes.

treated with the MATLAB continuation and bifurcation toolbox pde2path. The
basic setup consists in solving the PDEs for the normal displacement of an
immersed surface $X\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ and subsequent update of $X$ in each
continuation step, combined with bifurcation detection and localization,
followed by possible branch switching. Examples treated include some minimal
surfaces such as Enneper's surface and a Schwarz-P-family, some non-zero
constant mean curvature surfaces such as liquid bridges and nodoids, and some
4th order biomembrane models. In all of these we find interesting symmetry
breaking bifurcations. Some of these are (semi)analytically known and thus are

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation (DA) is a key factor in medical image analysis, such as in
prostate cancer (PCa) detection on magnetic resonance images. State-of-the-art
computer-aided diagnosis systems still rely on simplistic spatial
transformations to preserve the pathological label post transformation.
However, such augmentations do not substantially increase the organ as well as
tumor shape variability in the training set, limiting the model's ability to
generalize to unseen cases with more diverse localized soft-tissue
deformations. We propose a new anatomy-informed transformation that leverages
information from adjacent organs to simulate typical physiological deformations
of the prostate and generates unique lesion shapes without altering their
label. Due to its lightweight computational requirements, it can be easily
integrated into common DA frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
augmentation on a dataset of 774 biopsy-confirmed examinations, by evaluating a
state-of-the-art method for PCa detection with different augmentation settings.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of speech enhancement is to improve speech signal quality and
intelligibility from a noisy microphone signal. In many applications, it is
crucial to enable processing with small computational complexity and minimal
requirements regarding access to future signal samples (look-ahead). This paper
presents signal-based causal DCCRN that improves online single-channel speech
enhancement by reducing the required look-ahead and the number of network
parameters. The proposed modifications include complex filtering of the signal,
application of overlapped-frame prediction, causal convolutions and
deconvolutions, and modification of the loss function. Results of performed
experiments indicate that the proposed model with overlapped signal prediction
and additional adjustments, achieves similar or better performance than the
original DCCRN in terms of various speech enhancement metrics, while it reduces
the latency and network parameter number by around 30%.

<p class="mathjax">Models based on U-like structures have improved the performance of medical
image segmentation. However, the single-layer decoder structure of U-Net is too
"thin" to exploit enough information, resulting in large semantic differences
between the encoder and decoder parts. Things get worse if the number of
training sets of data is not sufficiently large, which is common in medical
image processing tasks where annotated data are more difficult to obtain than
other tasks. Based on this observation, we propose a novel U-Net model named
MS-UNet for the medical image segmentation task in this study. Instead of the
single-layer U-Net decoder structure used in Swin-UNet and TransUnet, we
specifically design a multi-scale nested decoder based on the Swin Transformer
for U-Net. The proposed multi-scale nested decoder structure allows the feature
mapping between the decoder and encoder to be semantically closer, thus
enabling the network to learn more detailed features. In addition, we propose a
novel edge loss and a plug-and-play fine-tuning Denoising module, which not
only effectively improves the segmentation performance of MS-UNet, but could
also be applied to other models individually. Experimental results show that
MS-UNet could effectively improve the network performance with more efficient
feature learning capability and exhibit more advanced performance, especially
in the extreme case with a small amount of training data, and the proposed Edge
loss and Denoising module could significantly enhance the segmentation
performance of MS-UNet.

<p class="mathjax">Triplet Markov chains are general generative models for sequential data which
take into account three kinds of random variables: (noisy) observations, their
associated discrete labels and latent variables which aim at strengthening the
distribution of the observations and their associated labels. However, in
practice, we do not have at our disposal all the labels associated to the
observations to estimate the parameters of such models. In this paper, we
propose a general framework based on a variational Bayesian inference to train
parameterized triplet Markov chain models in a semi-supervised context. The
generality of our approach enables us to derive semi-supervised algorithms for

<p class="mathjax">The concept of antidistinguishability of quantum states has been studied to
investigate foundational questions in quantum mechanics. It is also called
quantum state elimination, because the goal of such a protocol is to guess
which state, among finitely many chosen at random, the system is not prepared
in (that is, it can be thought of as the first step in a process of
elimination). Antidistinguishability has been used to investigate the reality
of quantum states, ruling out $\psi$-epistemic ontological models of quantum
mechanics [Pusey et al., Nat. Phys., 8(6):475-478, 2012]. Thus, due to the
established importance of antidistinguishability in quantum mechanics,
exploring it further is warranted. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
study of the optimal error exponent -- the rate at which the optimal error
probability vanishes to zero asymptotically -- for classical and quantum
antidistinguishability. We derive an exact expression for the optimal error
exponent in the classical case and show that it is given by the classical
Chernoff--Hellinger divergence. Our work thus provides this multi-variate
divergence with a meaningful operational interpretation as the optimal error
exponent for antidistinguishing a set of probability measures. We provide
several bounds on the optimal error exponent in the quantum case: a lower bound
given by the best pairwise Chernoff divergence of the states, an upper bound in
terms of max-relative entropy, and lower and upper bounds in terms of minimal
and maximal quantum Chernoff--Hellinger divergences. It remains an open problem
to obtain an explicit expression for the optimal error exponent for quantum
antidistinguishability.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, deep learning-based methods achieved promising performance in
nuclei detection and classification applications. However, training deep
learning-based methods requires a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in 3D images. An
alternative approach is to adapt weak-annotation methods, such as labeling each
nucleus with a point, but this method does not extend from 2D histopathology
images (for which it was originally developed) to 3D immunofluorescent images.
The reason is that 3D images contain multiple channels (z-axis) for nuclei and
different markers separately, which makes training using point annotations
difficult. To address this challenge, we propose the Label-efficient
Contrastive learning-based (LECL) model to detect and classify various types of
nuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images. Previous methods use Maximum Intensity
Projection (MIP) to convert immunofluorescent images with multiple slices to 2D
images, which can cause signals from different z-stacks to falsely appear
associated with each other. To overcome this, we devised an Extended Maximum
Intensity Projection (EMIP) approach that addresses issues using MIP.
Furthermore, we performed a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) approach for
weakly supervised settings. We conducted experiments on cardiovascular datasets
and found that our proposed framework is effective and efficient in detecting
and classifying various types of nuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images.

<p class="mathjax">Early detection of cardiac dysfunction through routine screening is vital for
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is
the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,
with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.
However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is
time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated
approach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms
for estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple
artificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using
off-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning
(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting
structures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even
with limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting
converges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while
bypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more
efficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data
scenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in
medical applications.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there is a growing interest in combining techniques
attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental
results, using synthetic and real data sets, show that this new optimization
algorithm achieves better performance than any of the three previous
optimization approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Subatomic particle track reconstruction (tracking) is a vital task in
High-Energy Physics experiments. Tracking is exceptionally computationally
challenging and fielded solutions, relying on traditional algorithms, do not
scale linearly. Machine Learning (ML) assisted solutions are a promising
answer. We argue that a complexity-reduced problem description and the data
representing it, will facilitate the solution exploration workflow. We provide
the REDuced VIrtual Detector (REDVID) as a complexity-reduced detector model
and particle collision event simulator combo. REDVID is intended as a
simulation-in-the-loop, to both generate synthetic data efficiently and to
simplify the challenge of ML model design. The fully parametric nature of our
tool, with regards to system-level configuration, while in contrast to
physics-accurate simulations, allows for the generation of simplified data for
research and education, at different levels. Resulting from the reduced
complexity, we showcase the computational efficiency of REDVID by providing the
computational cost figures for a multitude of simulation benchmarks. As a
simulation and a generative tool for ML-assisted solution design, REDVID is
highly flexible, reusable and open-source. Reference data sets generated with
REDVID are publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Animal communication is frequently studied with conventional network
representations that link pairs of individuals who interact, for example,
through vocalisation. However, acoustic signals often have multiple
simultaneous receivers, or receivers integrate information from multiple
signallers, meaning these interactions are not dyadic. Additionally, non-dyadic
social structures often shape an individual's behavioural response to vocal
communication. Recently, major advances have been made in the study of these
non-dyadic, higher-order networks (e.g., hypergraphs and simplicial complexes).
Here, we show how these approaches can provide new insights into vocal
communication through three case studies that illustrate how higher-order
network models can: a) alter predictions made about the outcome of
vocally-coordinated group departures; b) generate different patterns of song
synchronisation than models that only include dyadic interactions; and c)
inform models of cultural evolution of vocal communication. Together, our
examples highlight the potential power of higher-order networks to study animal
vocal communication. We then build on our case studies to identify key
challenges in applying higher-order network approaches in this context and
outline important research questions these techniques could help answer.

<p class="mathjax">Given pairwise comparisons between multiple items, how to rank them so that
the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log
n)$ samples. Our theoretical analysis improves upon the state-of-the-art
results in terms of sample complexity, and our numerical experiments confirm
these theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers an empirical risk minimization problem under
heavy-tailed settings, where data does not have finite variance, but only has
$p$-th moment with $p \in (1,2)$. Instead of using estimation procedure based
on truncated observed data, we choose the optimizer by minimizing the risk
value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable
Catoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type
influence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds via
using generalized generic chaining methods. Moreover, we take computational
issues into consideration. We especially theoretically investigate two types of
optimization methods, robust gradient descent algorithm and empirical
risk-based methods. With an extensive numerical study, we find that the
optimizer based on empirical risks via Catoni-style estimation indeed shows
better performance than other baselines. It indicates that estimation directly
based on truncated data may lead to unsatisfactory results.

<p class="mathjax">Early warnings for dynamical transitions in complex systems or
high-dimensional observation data are essential in many real world
applications, such as gene mutation, brain diseases, natural disasters,
financial crises, and engineering reliability. To effectively extract early
warning signals, we develop a novel approach: the directed anisotropic
diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in low-dimensional
manifold. Applying the methodology to authentic electroencephalogram (EEG)
data, we successfully find the appropriate effective coordinates, and derive
early warning signals capable of detecting the tipping point during the state
transition. Our method bridges the latent dynamics with the original dataset.
The framework is validated to be accurate and effective through numerical
experiments, in terms of density and transition probability. It is shown that
the second coordinate holds meaningful information for critical transition in
various evaluation metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works have demonstrated that the sample complexity of gradient-based
learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.

of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\tilde{O}(k^2 d^4
\log(1/\delta) / \alpha^2 \varepsilon)$ samples are sufficient to estimate a
mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample
complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural
assumptions on the GMMs.
<br />To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier
indicating that, unlike Gaussians, GMMs do not admit a locally small cover

$\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ has as its vertices all $n!$ bijections from $V(X)$ to
$V(Y)$, with bijections $\sigma, \tau$ adjacent if and only if they differ on
two adjacent elements of $V(X)$ whose mappings are adjacent in $Y$. We consider
the setting where $X$ and $Y$ are both edge-subgraphs of $K_{r,r}$: due to a
parity obstruction, $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is always disconnected in this setting.
Sharpening a result of Bangachev, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ respectively have
minimum degrees $\delta(X)$ and $\delta(Y)$ and they satisfy $\delta(X) +
\delta(Y) \geq \lfloor 3r/2 \rfloor + 1$, then $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has exactly
two connected components. This proves that the cutoff for $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ to
avoid isolated vertices is equal to the cutoff for $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ to have
exactly two connected components. We also consider a probabilistic setup in
which we fix $Y$ to be $K_{r,r}$, but randomly generate $X$ by including each
edge in $K_{r,r}$ independently with probability $p$. Invoking a result of Zhu,
we exhibit a phase transition phenomenon with threshold function $(\log r)/r$:
below the threshold, $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has more than two connected components
with high probability, while above the threshold, $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ has
exactly two connected components with high probability. Altogether, our results
settle a conjecture and completely answer two problems of Alon, Defant, and
Kravitz.

(x,y+\delta), (x+\delta,y')$, where $\delta \neq 0$. How big can $S$ be?
Trivially, $n \le |S| \le n^2$. Slight improvements on these bounds are
obtained from Shkredov's upper bound for the corners problem [Shk06], which
shows that $|S| \le O(n^2/(\log \log n)^c)$ for some small $c &gt; 0$, and a

<br />Could it be that for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, $|S| \le O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$?
We show that if so, this would rule out obtaining $\omega = 2$ using a large
family of abelian groups in the group-theoretic framework of Cohn, Kleinberg,
Szegedy and Umans [CU03,CKSU05] (which is known to capture the best bounds on
$\omega$ to date), for which no barriers are currently known. Furthermore, an
upper bound of $O(n^{4/3 - \varepsilon})$ for any fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ would
rule out a conjectured approach to obtain $\omega = 2$ of [CKSU05]. Along the
way, we encounter several problems that have much stronger constraints and that

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning is commonly used to reconstruct HDR images from LDR images. LDR
stack-based methods are used for single-image HDR reconstruction, generating an
HDR image from a deep learning-generated LDR stack. However, current methods
generate the stack with predetermined exposure values (EVs), which may limit
the quality of HDR reconstruction. To address this, we propose the continuous
exposure value representation (CEVR), which uses an implicit function to
generate LDR images with arbitrary EVs, including those unseen during training.
Our approach generates a continuous stack with more images containing diverse
EVs, significantly improving HDR reconstruction. We use a cycle training
strategy to supervise the model in generating continuous EV LDR images without
corresponding ground truths. Our CEVR model outperforms existing methods, as
demonstrated by experimental results.
