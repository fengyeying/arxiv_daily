<p class="mathjax">This research aims to improve the user interface of SIAK-NG (Next Generation
Academic Information System), the academic portal website of the University of
Indonesia through a design thinking approach. Despite being in existence for
several decades and undergoing multiple improvements, there has been no
specific effort to evaluate the quality of the user interface. In line with the
revamping of SIAK-NG according to the University of Indonesia 2019-2024 master
plan, this study aims to provide the necessary insights. The research focuses
on redesigning the website interface of SIAK-NG to address user complaints and
difficulties, particularly related to the unsatisfactory interface design. The
Design Thinking approach is employed to generate solutions that meet the needs
of active University of Indonesia students who are the primary users. Through
methods such as storyboarding, empathy mapping, usability testing, and others,
the author will design recommendations that align with user requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Wellbore friction is one of the biggest concerns when drilling due to its
relation to the total cost. The catenary concept was introduced to reduce
wellbore friction, but it requires detailed analyses. This project would fill
this gap. A catenary shape is simply the natural shape of a rope, chain, or
drill string. The drill string will then hang freely inside the wellbore.
Perfectly, there should be no contact between the hole and the string, and thus
no friction. Torque and drag should be minimized this way. A case study is
introduced to examine the outcome between Catenary Trajectory Design and
traditional 2D Arc design. The calculation procedure of Catenary Trajectory and
2D Arc Design can be found in an MS Excel spreadsheet which is easy to use and
reliable for designing catenary well trajectories for extended-reach wells.

<p class="mathjax">The outbreak of the New Coronavirus has significantly increased the
vulnerability of medical staff. This paper addresses the safety and stress
relief of medical personnel by proposing a solution to the scheduling problem
of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in a stochastic environment. Considering the
stochastic nature of travel and service times for AMRs affected by the
surrounding environment, the routes of AMRs are planned to minimize the daily
cost of the hospital (including the AMR fixed cost, penalty cost of violating
the time window, and transportation cost). To efficiently generate high-quality
solutions, we identify several properties and incorporate them into an improved
Tabu Search (I-TS) algorithm for problem-solving. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the I-TS algorithm outperforms existing methods by producing
higher-quality solutions. By leveraging the characteristics of medical request
environments, we intelligently allocate an appropriate number of AMRs to
efficiently provide services, resulting in substantial cost reductions for
hospitals and enhanced utilization of medical resources. These findings confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic programming model in determining
the optimal number of AMRs and their corresponding service routes across
various environmental settings.

<p class="mathjax">This project was built from a pre-existing architecture that facilitates the
planning and automatic execution of drone routes in a known space through a 3D
virtual reality environment. Our work consisted in extending this architecture
by integrating a new web component, making use of a 3D map API, to facilitate
to people who do not have access to virtual reality hardware, the possibility
of planning flight routes that have as parameters the &lt;latitude, longitude&gt;
with respect to the globe and also a component in meters that represents the
height at which the drone rises in a certain point. Additionally, the
configuration possibilities of a route were extended in order to take advantage
of one of the components that gives more value and potential to unmanned
aircrafts: the use of the camera in multiple contexts and scenarios. The
extension of this solution allows the user to assign different camera tasks
along the route, see in real time what the camera is capturing and, after the
flight, retrieve the multimedia content that was created

<p class="mathjax">How to make artificial intelligence (AI) systems safe and aligned with human
values is an open research question. Proposed solutions tend toward relying on
human intervention in uncertain situations, learning human values and
intentions through training or observation, providing off-switches,
implementing isolation or simulation environments, or extrapolating what people
would want if they had more knowledge and more time to think. Law-based
approaches--such as inspired by Isaac Asimov--have not been well regarded. This
paper makes a case that effective legal systems are the best way to address AI
safety. Law is defined as any rules that codify prohibitions and prescriptions
applicable to particular agents in specified domains/contexts and includes
processes for enacting, managing, enforcing, and litigating such rules.

<p class="mathjax">This paper contextualises the common queries of "why is crypto crashing?" and
"why is crypto down?", the research transcends beyond the frequent market
fluctuations to unravel how cryptocurrencies fundamentally work and the
step-by-step process on how to create a cryptocurrency.
<br />The study examines blockchain technologies and their pivotal role in the
evolving Metaverse, shedding light on topics such as how to invest in
cryptocurrency, the mechanics behind crypto mining, and strategies to
effectively buy and trade cryptocurrencies. Through an interdisciplinary
approach, the research transitions from the fundamental principles of fintech
investment strategies to the overarching implications of blockchain within the
Metaverse. Alongside exploring machine learning potentials in financial sectors
and risk assessment methodologies, the study critically assesses whether
developed or developing nations are poised to reap greater benefits from these
technologies. Moreover, it probes into both enduring and dubious crypto
projects, drawing a distinct line between genuine blockchain applications and
Ponzi-like schemes. The conclusion resolutely affirms the continuing dominance
of blockchain technologies, underlined by a profound exploration of their
intrinsic value and a reflective commentary by the author on the potential
risks confronting individual investors.

aviation industry and emphasizes the need for comprehensive research. It
focuses on two main areas: analyzing exceedance events and statistically
evaluating non-exceedance data. The challenges of current approaches lie in
insufficient cause analysis for exceedances. The proposed solutions involve
data preprocessing, reliability assessment, quantifying flight control using
neural networks, exploratory data analysis, flight personnel skill evaluation
with machine learning, and establishing real-time automated warnings. These
endeavors aim to enhance flight safety, personnel assessment, and warning
mechanisms, contributing to a safer and more efficient civil aviation sector.

<p class="mathjax">Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for medicine and
healthcare, the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in
real-world clinical practice. In recent years, concerns have been raised about
the technical, clinical, ethical and legal risks associated with medical AI. To
increase real world adoption, it is essential that medical AI tools are trusted
and accepted by patients, clinicians, health organisations and authorities.
This work describes the FUTURE-AI guideline as the first international
consensus framework for guiding the development and deployment of trustworthy
AI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI consortium was founded in 2021 and
currently comprises 118 inter-disciplinary experts from 51 countries
representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinicians, ethicists,
and social scientists. Over a two-year period, the consortium defined guiding
principles and best practices for trustworthy AI through an iterative process
comprising an in-depth literature review, a modified Delphi survey, and online
consensus meetings. The FUTURE-AI framework was established based on 6 guiding
principles for trustworthy AI in healthcare, i.e. Fairness, Universality,
Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Through consensus, a
set of 28 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, legal
and socio-ethical dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of
medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment,
and monitoring. FUTURE-AI is a risk-informed, assumption-free guideline which
provides a structured approach for constructing medical AI tools that will be
trusted, deployed and adopted in real-world practice. Researchers are
encouraged to take the recommendations into account in proof-of-concept stages
to facilitate future translation towards clinical practice of medical AI.

<p class="mathjax">One of the core goals of responsible AI development is ensuring high-quality
training datasets. Many researchers have pointed to the importance of the
annotation step in the creation of high-quality data, but less attention has
been paid to the work that enables data annotation. We define this work as the
design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the
creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are
made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe
five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation
processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context
of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors
condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design. Two
internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling. These
directly shape the design of the ground truth schema. Discussions of what
constitutes high-quality data need to pay attention to the factors that shape
and constrain what is possible to be created, to ensure responsible AI design.

<p class="mathjax">In the 2023-2024 academic year, the widespread availability of generative
artificial intelligence, exemplified by ChatGPT's 1.6 billion monthly visits,
is set to impact academic integrity. With 77% of high school students
previously reporting engagement in dishonest behaviour, the rise of AI-driven
writing assistance, dubbed 'AI-giarism' by Chan (<a href="/abs/2306.03358">arXiv:2306.03358v2</a>), will make
plagiarism more accessible and less detectable. While these concerns are
urgent, they also raise broader questions about the revolutionary nature of
this technology, including autonomy, data privacy, copyright, and equity. This
paper aims to explore generative AI from a social justice perspective,
examining the training of these models, the inherent biases, and the potential
injustices in detecting AI-generated writing.

<p class="mathjax">With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, an increasing
number of individuals and organizations have begun exploring its potential to
enhance productivity and improve product quality across various sectors. The
field of education is no exception. However, it is vital to notice that
artificial intelligence adoption in education dates back to the 1960s. In light
of this historical context, this white paper serves as the inaugural piece in a
four-part series that elucidates the role of AI in education. The series delves
into topics such as its potential, successful applications, limitations,
ethical considerations, and future trends. This initial article provides a
comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the recent developments
within the generative artificial intelligence sphere.

<p class="mathjax">The paper underscores how decentralization in sports betting addresses the
drawbacks of traditional centralized platforms, ensuring transparency,
security, and lower fees. Non-custodial solutions empower bettors with
ownership of funds, bypassing geographical restrictions. Decentralized
platforms enhance security, privacy, and democratic decision-making. However,
decentralized sports betting necessitates automated market makers (AMMs) for
efficient liquidity provision. Existing AMMs like Uniswap lack alignment with
fair odds, creating risks for liquidity providers. To mitigate this, the paper
introduces UBET AMM (UAMM), utilizing smart contracts and algorithms to price
sports odds fairly. It establishes an on-chain betting framework, detailing
market creation, UAMM application, collateral liquidity pools, and experiments
that exhibit positive outcomes. UAMM enhances decentralized sports betting by
ensuring liquidity, decentralized pricing, and global accessibility, promoting
trustless and efficient betting.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge tracing consists in predicting the performance of some students on
new questions given their performance on previous questions, and can be a prior
step to optimizing assessment and learning. Deep knowledge tracing (DKT) is a
competitive model for knowledge tracing relying on recurrent neural networks,
even if some simpler models may match its performance. However, little is known
about why DKT works so well. In this paper, we frame deep knowledge tracing as
a encoderdecoder architecture. This viewpoint not only allows us to propose
better models in terms of performance, simplicity or expressivity but also
opens up promising avenues for future research directions. In particular, we
show on several small and large datasets that a simpler decoder, with possibly
fewer parameters than the one used by DKT, can predict student performance
better.

<p class="mathjax">Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of live polling and real-time
feedback tools gained traction in higher education to enhance student
engagement and learning outcomes. Integrating live polling activities has been
shown to boost attention, participation, and understanding of course materials.
However, recent changes in learning behaviours due to the pandemic necessitate
a reevaluation of these active learning technologies. In this context, our
study focuses on the Computer Science (CS) domain, investigating the impact of
Live Polling Quizzes (LPQs) in undergraduate CS lectures. These quizzes
comprise fact-based, formally defined questions with clear answers, aiming to
enhance engagement, learning outcomes, and overall perceptions of the course
module. A survey was conducted among 70 undergraduate CS students, attending CS
modules with and without LPQs. The results revealed that while LPQs contributed
to higher attendance, other factors likely influenced attendance rates more
significantly. LPQs were generally viewed positively, aiding comprehension and
maintaining student attention and motivation. However, careful management of
LPQ frequency is crucial to prevent overuse for some students and potential
reduced motivation. Clear instructions for using the polling software were also
highlighted as essential.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We
argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are
mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our
interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find
in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by
disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social
functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI,
how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite
so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal
inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the
cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being
framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human
condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this
dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that
generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some
eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this
task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with
such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential
human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we
outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI
generated media means.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have excited scientists across
fields; in medicine, one source of excitement is the potential applications of
LLMs trained on electronic health record (EHR) data. But there are tough
questions we must first answer if health care institutions are interested in
having LLMs trained on their own data; should they train an LLM from scratch or
fine-tune it from an open-source model? For healthcare institutions with a
predefined budget, what are the biggest LLMs they can afford? In this study, we
take steps towards answering these questions with an analysis on dataset sizes,
model sizes, and costs for LLM training using EHR data. This analysis provides
a framework for thinking about these questions in terms of data scale, compute

<p class="mathjax">The deployment of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns regarding
their cultural misalignment and potential ramifications on individuals from
various cultural norms. Existing work investigated political and social biases
and public opinions rather than their cultural values. To address this
limitation, the proposed Cultural Alignment Test (CAT) quantifies cultural
alignment using Hofstede's cultural dimension framework, which offers an
explanatory cross-cultural comparison through the latent variable analysis. We
apply our approach to assess the cultural values embedded in state-of-the-art
LLMs, such as: ChatGPT and Bard, across diverse cultures of countries: United
States (US), Saudi Arabia, China, and Slovakia, using different prompting
styles and hyperparameter settings. Our results not only quantify cultural
alignment of LLMs with certain countries, but also reveal the difference
between LLMs in explanatory cultural dimensions. While all LLMs did not provide
satisfactory results in understanding cultural values, GPT-4 exhibited the
highest CAT score for the cultural values of the US.

<p class="mathjax">Artemis is an interactive learning system that organizes courses, hosts
lecture content and interactive exercises, conducts exams, and creates
automatic assessments with individual feedback. Research shows that students
have unique capabilities, previous experiences, and expectations. However, the
course content on current learning systems, including Artemis, is not tailored
to a student's competencies. The main goal of this paper is to describe how to
make Artemis capable of competency-based education and provide individual
course content based on the unique characteristics of every student. We show
how instructors can define relations between competencies to create a
competency relation graph, how Artemis measures and visualizes the student's
progress toward mastering a competency, and how the progress can generate a
personalized learning path for students that recommends relevant learning
resources. Finally, we present the results of a user study regarding the
usability of the newly designed competency visualization and give an outlook on
possible improvements and future visions.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of Internet of things (IoT) technology has revolutionized urban
living, offering immense potential for smart cities in which smart home, smart
infrastructure, and smart industry are essential aspects that contribute to the
development of intelligent urban ecosystems. The integration of smart home
technology raises concerns regarding data privacy and security, while smart
infrastructure implementation demands robust networking and interoperability
solutions. Simultaneously, deploying IoT in industrial settings faces
challenges related to scalability, standardization, and data management. This
research paper offers a systematic literature review of published research in
the field of IoT in smart cities including 55 relevant primary studies that
have been published in reputable journals and conferences. This extensive
literature review explores and evaluates various aspects of smart home, smart
infrastructure, and smart industry and the challenges like security and
privacy, smart sensors, interoperability and standardization. We provide a
unified perspective, as we seek to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
smart cities while overcoming security concerns. It then explores their
potential for collective integration and impact on the development of smart
cities. Furthermore, this study addresses the challenges associated with each
component individually and explores their combined impact on enhancing urban
efficiency and sustainability. Through a comprehensive analysis of security
concerns, this research successfully integrates these IoT components in a
unified approach, presenting a holistic framework for building smart cities of
the future. Integrating smart home, smart infrastructure, and smart industry,
this research highlights the significance of an integrated approach in
developing smart cities.

<p class="mathjax">Deep generative models produce data according to a learned representation,
e.g. diffusion models, through a process of approximation computing possible
samples. Approximation can be understood as reconstruction and the large
datasets used to train models as sets of records in which we represent the
physical world with some data structure (photographs, audio recordings,
manuscripts). During the process of reconstruction, e.g., image frames develop
each timestep towards a textual input description. While moving forward in
time, frame sets are shaped according to learned bias and their production, we
argue here, can be considered as going back in time; not by inspiration on the
backward diffusion process but acknowledging culture is specifically marked in
the records. Futures of generative modelling, namely in film and audiovisual
arts, can benefit by dealing with diffusion systems as a process to compute the
future by inevitably being tied to the past, if acknowledging the records as to
capture fields of view at a specific time, and to correlate with our own finite
memory ideals. Models generating new data distributions can target video
production as signal processors and by developing sequences through timelines
we ourselves also go back to decade-old algorithmic and multi-track
methodologies revealing the actual predictive failure of contemporary
approaches to synthesis in moving image, both as relevant to composition and
not explanatory.

<p class="mathjax">We present an investigation regarding the challenges faced by student teams
across four consecutive iterations of a team-focused, project-based course in
software engineering. The studied period includes the switch to fully online
activities in the spring of 2020, and covers the return to face-to-face
teaching two years later. We cover the feedback provided by over 1,500
students, collected in a free-text form on the basis of a survey. A qualitative
research method was utilized to discern and examine the challenges and
perceived benefits of a course that was conducted entirely online. We show that
technical challenges remain a constant in project-based courses, with time
management being the most affected by the move to online. Students reported
that the effective use of collaborative tools eased team organization and
communication while online. We conclude by providing a number of action points
regarding the integration of online activities in face-to-face course unfolding
related to project management, communication tools, the importance of teamwork,
and of active mentor participation.

<p class="mathjax">Shadow libraries, also known as ''pirate libraries'', are online collections
of copyrighted publications that have been made available for free without the
permission of the copyright holders. They have gradually become key players of
scientific knowledge dissemination, despite their illegality in most countries
of the world. Many publishers and scientist-editors decry such libraries for
their copyright infringement and loss of publication usage information, while
some scholars and institutions support them, sometimes in a roundabout way, for
their role in reducing inequalities of access to knowledge, particularly in
low-income countries. Although there is a wealth of literature on shadow
libraries, none of this have focused on its potential role in knowledge
dissemination, through the open access movement. Here we analyze how shadow
libraries can affect researchers' citation practices, highlighting some
counter-intuitive findings about their impact on the Open Access Citation
Advantage (OACA). Based on a large randomized sample, this study first shows
that OA publications, including those in fully OA journals, receive more
citations than their subscription-based counterparts do. However, the OACA has
slightly decreased over the seven last years. The introduction of a distinction
between those accessible or not via the Scihub platform among
subscription-based suggest that the generalization of its use cancels the
positive effect of OA publishing. The results show that publications in fully
OA journals are victims of the success of Sci-hub. Thus, paradoxically,
although Sci-hub may seem to facilitate access to scientific knowledge, it
negatively affects the OA movement as a whole, by reducing the comparative
advantage of OA publications in terms of visibility for researchers. The
democratization of the use of Sci-hub may therefore lead to a vicious cycle,
hindering efforts to develop full OA strategies without proposing a credible
and sustainable alternative model for the dissemination of scientific
knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Innovation is crucial for sustainable success in today's fiercely competitive
global manufacturing landscape. Bangladesh's manufacturing sector must embrace
transformative technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) to thrive in this
environment. This article addresses the vital task of identifying and
evaluating barriers to IoT adoption in Bangladesh's manufacturing industry.
Through synthesizing expert insights and carefully reviewing contemporary
literature, we explore the intricate landscape of IoT adoption challenges. Our
methodology combines the Delphi and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process,
systematically analyzing and prioritizing these challenges. This approach
harnesses expert knowledge and uses fuzzy logic to handle uncertainties. Our
findings highlight key obstacles, with "Lack of top management commitment to
new technology" (B10), "High initial implementation costs" (B9), and "Risks in
adopting a new business model" (B7) standing out as significant challenges that
demand immediate attention. These insights extend beyond academia, offering
practical guidance to industry leaders. With the knowledge gained from this
study, managers can develop tailored strategies, set informed priorities, and
embark on a transformative journey toward leveraging IoT's potential in
Bangladesh's industrial sector. This article provides a comprehensive
understanding of IoT adoption challenges and equips industry leaders to
navigate them effectively. This strategic navigation, in turn, enhances the
competitiveness and sustainability of Bangladesh's manufacturing sector in the
IoT era.

<p class="mathjax">Since its beginnings in the 1940s, automated reasoning by computers has
become a tool of ever growing importance in scientific research. So far, the
rules underlying automated reasoning have mainly been formulated by humans, in
the form of program source code. Rules derived from large amounts of data, via
machine learning techniques, are a complementary approach currently under
intense development. The question of why we should trust these systems, and the
results obtained with their help, has been discussed by philosophers of science
but has so far received little attention by practitioners. The present work
focuses on independent reviewing, an important source of trust in science, and
identifies the characteristics of automated reasoning systems that affect their
reviewability. It also discusses possible steps towards increasing
reviewability and trustworthiness via a combination of technical and social
measures.

reading, writing, and arithmetic (3R). To reach the level where computational
thinking skills, especially digital problem solving have their own schemata,
there is a long way to go. In the present paper, a novel approach is detailed
to support subject integration and building digital schemata, on the well-known
Beaufort scale. The conversion of a traditional, paper-based problem and a data
retrieval process are presented within the frame of a Grade 8 action research
study. It is found that both students content knowledge and their digital
skills developed more efficiently than in traditional course book and
decontextualized digital environments. Furthermore, the method presented here
can be adapted to any paper-based problems whose solutions would be more
effective in a digital environment and which offer various forms for building

<p class="mathjax">Innovation in Information and Communication Technology has become one of the
key economic drivers of our technology dependent world. In popular notion, the
tech industry or how ICT is often known has become synonymous to all
technologies that drive modernity. Digital technologies have become so
pervasive that it is hard to imagine new technology developments that are not
totally or partially influenced by ICT innovations. Furthermore, the pace of
innovation in ICT sector over the last few decades has been unprecedented in
human history. In this paper we argue that, not only ICT had a tremendous
impact on the way we communicate and produce but this innovation paradigm has
crucially shaped collective expectations and imagination about what technology
more broadly can actually deliver. These expectations have often crystalised
into a widespread acceptance, among general public and policy makers, of
technosolutionism. This is a belief that technology not restricted to ICT alone
can solve all problems humanity is facing from poverty and inequality to
ecosystem loss and climate change. In this paper we show the many impacts of
relentless ICT innovation. The spectacular advances in this sector, coupled
with corporate power that benefits from them have facilitated the uptake by
governments and industries of an uncritical narrative of techno-optimist that
neglects the complexity of the wicked problems that affect the present and
future of humanity.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including large
language models like ChatGPT, offer promise and peril for scholarly peer
review. On the one hand, AI can enhance efficiency by addressing issues like
long publication delays. On the other hand, it brings ethical and social
concerns that could compromise the integrity of the peer review process and
outcomes. However, human peer review systems are also fraught with related
problems, such as biases, abuses, and a lack of transparency, which already
diminish credibility. While there is increasing attention to the use of AI in
peer review, discussions revolve mainly around plagiarism and authorship in
academic journal publishing, ignoring the broader epistemic, social, cultural,
and societal epistemic in which peer review is positioned. The legitimacy of
AI-driven peer review hinges on the alignment with the scientific ethos,
encompassing moral and epistemic norms that define appropriate conduct in the
scholarly community. In this regard, there is a "norm-counternorm continuum,"
where the acceptability of AI in peer review is shaped by institutional logics,
ethical practices, and internal regulatory mechanisms. The discussion here
emphasizes the need to critically assess the legitimacy of AI-driven peer
review, addressing the benefits and downsides relative to the broader
epistemic, social, ethical, and regulatory factors that sculpt its
implementation and impact.

<p class="mathjax">The use of Digital Twins in the industry has become a growing trend in recent
years, allowing to improve the lifecycle of any process by taking advantage of
the relationship between the physical and the virtual world. Existing
literature formulates several challenges for building Digital Twins, as well as
some proposals for overcoming them. However, in the vast majority of the cases,
the architectures and technologies presented are strongly bounded to the domain
where the Digital Twins are applied. This article proposes the FIWARE
Ecosystem, combining its catalog of components and its Smart Data Models, as a
solution for the development of any Digital Twin. We also provide a use case to
showcase how to use FIWARE for building Digital Twins through a complete
example of a Parking Digital Twin. We conclude that the FIWARE Ecosystem
constitutes a real reference option for developing DTs in any domain.

<p class="mathjax">Open access to scientific publications has progressively become a key issue
for European policy makers, resulting in concrete measures by the different
country members to promote its development. The aim of paper is, after
providing a quick overview of OA policies in Europe, to carry out a comparative
study of OA practices within European countries, using data from the Web of
Science (WoS) database. This analysis is based on two indicators: the OA share
that illustrates the evolution over time, and the normalized OA indicator
(NOAI) that allows spatial comparisons, taking into account disciplinary
structures of countries. Results show a general trend towards the development
of OA over time as expected, but with large disparities between countries,
depending on how early they begin taking measures in favor of OA. While it is
possible to stress the importance of policy and its influence on open access at
country level, this does not appear to be the case at the regional level. There
is not much variability between regions, within the same country, in terms of
open access indicators.

<p class="mathjax">Attention-Aware Social Choice tackles the fundamental conflict faced by some
agent communities between their desire to include all members in the decision
making processes and the limited time and attention that are at the disposal of
the community members. Here, we investigate a combination of two techniques for
attention-aware social choice, namely Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Sampling. Essentially, we propose a system in which each governance proposal to
change the status quo is first sent to a trained NLP model that estimates the
probability that the proposal would pass if all community members directly vote
on it; then, based on such an estimation, a population sample of a certain size
is being selected and the proposal is decided upon by taking the sample
majority. We develop several concrete algorithms following the scheme described
above and evaluate them using various data, including such from several
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

<p class="mathjax">Objective: To evaluate the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT to assist in diagnosing neuro-ophthalmic diseases based on detailed
case descriptions. Methods: We selected 22 different case reports of
neuro-ophthalmic diseases from a publicly available online database. These
cases included a wide range of chronic and acute diseases that are commonly
seen by neuro-ophthalmic sub-specialists. We inserted the text from each case
as a new prompt into both ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and asked for the
most probable diagnosis. We then presented the exact information to two
neuro-ophthalmologists and recorded their diagnoses followed by comparison to
responses from both versions of ChatGPT. Results: ChatGPT v3.5, ChatGPT Plus
v4.0, and the two neuro-ophthalmologists were correct in 13 (59%), 18 (82%), 19
(86%), and 19 (86%) out of 22 cases, respectively. The agreement between the
various diagnostic sources were as follows: ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0,
13 (59%); ChatGPT v3.5 and the first neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT
v3.5 and the second neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the
first neuro-ophthalmologist, 17 (77%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the second
neuro-ophthalmologist, 16 (73%); and first and second neuro-ophthalmologists 17
(17%). Conclusions: The accuracy of ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 in
diagnosing patients with neuro-ophthalmic diseases was 59% and 82%,
respectively. With further development, ChatGPT Plus v4.0 may have potential to
be used in clinical care settings to assist clinicians in providing quick,
accurate diagnoses of patients in neuro-ophthalmology. The applicability of
using LLMs like ChatGPT in clinical settings that lack access to subspeciality
trained neuro-ophthalmologists deserves further research.

<p class="mathjax">Programming courses in computing science are important because they are often
the first introduction to computer programming for many students. Many
university students are overwhelmed with the information they must learn for an
introductory course. The current teacher-lecturer model of learning commonly
employed in university lecture halls often results in a lack of motivation and
participation in learning. Personalized gamification is a pedagogical approach
that combines gamification and personalized learning to motivate and engage
students while addressing individual differences in learning. This approach
integrates gamification and personalized learning strategies to inspire and
involve students while addressing their unique learning needs and differences.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted by including 81 studies that
were analyzed based on their research design, intervention, outcome measures,
and quality assessment. The findings suggest that personalized gamification can
enhance student cognition in programming courses by improving motivation,
engagement, and learning outcomes. However, the effectiveness of personalized
gamification varies depending on various factors, such as the type of
gamification elements used, the degree of personalization, and the
characteristics of the learners. This paper provides insights into designing
and implementing effective personalized gamification interventions in
programming courses. The findings could inform educational practitioners and
researchers in programming education about the potential benefits of
personalized gamification and its implications for educational practice.

<p class="mathjax">Breached data refers to the unauthorized access, theft, or exposure of
confidential or sensitive information. Breaches typically occur when malicious
actors or unauthorized users breach secure systems or networks, resulting in
compromised personally identifiable information (PII), protected or personal
health information (PHI), payment card industry (PCI) information, or other
sensitive data. Data breaches are often the result of malicious activities such
as hacking, phishing, insider threats, malware, or physical theft. The misuse
of breached data can lead to identity theft, fraud, spamming, or blackmailing.
Organizations that experience data breaches may face legal and financial
consequences, reputational damage, and harm to their customers or users.
Breached records are commonly sold on the dark web or made available on various
public forums. To counteract these malicious activities, it is possible to
collect breached databases and mitigate potential harm. These databases can be
quite large, reaching sizes of up to 150 GB or more. Typically, breached data
is stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Value) format due to its simplicity and
lightweight nature, which reduces storage requirements. Analyzing and
traversing large breached databases necessitates substantial computational
power. However, this research explores techniques to optimize database
traversal speed without the need to rent expensive cloud machines or virtual
private servers (VPS). This optimization will enable individual security
researchers to analyze and process large databases on their personal computer
systems while significantly reducing costs.

<p class="mathjax">Real-time conversational deliberation is a critical groupwise method for
reaching decisions, solving problems, evaluating priorities, generating ideas,
and producing insights. Unfortunately, real-time conversations are difficult to
scale, losing effectiveness as groups grow above 5 to 7 members. Conversational
Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is a new technology modeled on the dynamics of
biological swarms. It aims to enable networked groups of any size to hold
productive real-time deliberations that converge on unified solutions. CSI
leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a unique and powerful
way, allowing real-time dialog among small local groups while simultaneously
enabling efficient content propagation across much larger populations. In this
way, CSI combines the benefits of small-scale deliberative reasoning and
large-scale collective intelligence. In this study, we compare deliberative
groups of 48 people using standard online chat to the same sized groups using a
prototype chat-based CSI system called Thinkscape. Results show that
participants using CSI contributed 51% more content (p&lt;0.001) than those using
standard chat, and the deliberations using CSI showed 37% less difference in
contribution quantity between the most active vs least active members,
indicating more balanced dialog. And finally, a large majority of participants
preferred deliberating using the CSI system over standard chat (p&lt;0.05) and
re-ported feeling more impactful when doing so (p&lt;0.01). These results suggest
that Conversational Swarm Intelligence is a promising technology for enabling
large-scale deliberation.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the
development of chatbots with sophisticated conversational capabilities.
However, LLMs exhibit frequent inaccurate responses to queries, hindering
applications in educational settings. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of integrating a knowledge base (KB) with LLM intelligent tutors
to increase response reliability. To achieve this, we design a scaleable KB
that affords educational supervisors seamless integration of lesson curricula,
which is automatically processed by the intelligent tutoring system. We then
detail an evaluation, where student participants were presented with questions
about the artificial intelligence curriculum to respond to. GPT-4 intelligent
tutors with varying hierarchies of KB access and human domain experts then
assessed these responses. Lastly, students cross-examined the intelligent
tutors' responses to the domain experts' and ranked their various pedagogical
abilities. Results suggest that, although these intelligent tutors still
demonstrate a lower accuracy compared to domain experts, the accuracy of the
intelligent tutors increases when access to a KB is granted. We also observe
that the intelligent tutors with KB access exhibit better pedagogical abilities
to speak like a teacher and understand students than those of domain experts,
while their ability to help students remains lagging behind domain experts.

<p class="mathjax">Today's AI systems for medical decision support often succeed on benchmark
datasets in research papers but fail in real-world deployment. This work
focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic
infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the
clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that
can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis
of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical
experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their
electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system
needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical
decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data),
instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab
based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future
projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and
propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be
collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six
clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a
promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis
diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.

<p class="mathjax">To measure bias, we encourage teams to consider using AUC Gap: the absolute
difference between the highest and lowest test AUC for subgroups (e.g., gender,
race, SES, prior knowledge). It is agnostic to the AI/ML algorithm used and it
captures the disparity in model performance for any number of subgroups, which
enables non-binary fairness assessments such as for intersectional identity
groups. The LEVI teams use a wide range of AI/ML models in pursuit of a common
goal of doubling math achievement in low-income middle schools. Ensuring that
the models, which are trained on datasets collected in many different contexts,
do not introduce or amplify biases is important for achieving the LEVI goal. We
offer here a versatile and easy-to-compute measure of model bias for all LEVI
teams in order to create a common benchmark and an analytical basis for sharing
what strategies have worked for different teams.

<p class="mathjax">This work systematically investigates the oxidation of extra virgin olive oil
(EVOO) under accelerated storage conditions with UV absorption and total
fluorescence spectroscopy. With the large amount of data collected, it proposes
a method to monitor the oil's quality based on machine learning applied to
highly-aggregated data. EVOO is a high-quality vegetable oil that has earned
worldwide reputation for its numerous health benefits and excellent taste.
Despite its outstanding quality, EVOO degrades over time owing to oxidation,
which can affect both its health qualities and flavour. Therefore, it is highly
relevant to quantify the effects of oxidation on EVOO and develop methods to
assess it that can be easily implemented under field conditions, rather than in
specialized laboratories. The following study demonstrates that fluorescence
spectroscopy has the capability to monitor the effect of oxidation and assess
the quality of EVOO, even when the data are highly aggregated. It shows that
complex laboratory equipment is not necessary to exploit fluorescence
spectroscopy using the proposed method and that cost-effective solutions, which
can be used in-field by non-scientists, could provide an easily-accessible
assessment of the quality of EVOO.

<p class="mathjax">Traditionally, training neural networks to perform semantic segmentation
required expensive human-made annotations. But more recently, advances in the
field of unsupervised learning have made significant progress on this issue and
towards closing the gap to supervised algorithms. To achieve this, semantic
knowledge is distilled by learning to correlate randomly sampled features from
images across an entire dataset. In this work, we build upon these advances by
incorporating information about the structure of the scene into the training
process through the use of depth information. We achieve this by (1) learning
depth-feature correlation by spatially correlate the feature maps with the
depth maps to induce knowledge about the structure of the scene and (2)
implementing farthest-point sampling to more effectively select relevant
features by utilizing 3D sampling techniques on depth information of the scene.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical contributions
through extensive experimentation and present significant improvements in
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional optimization methods rely on the use of single-precision floating
point arithmetic, which can be costly in terms of memory size and computing
power. However, mixed precision optimization techniques leverage the use of
both single and half-precision floating point arithmetic to reduce memory
requirements while maintaining model accuracy. We provide here an algorithm to
further reduce memory usage during the training of a model by getting rid of
the floating point copy of the parameters, virtually keeping only
half-precision numbers. We also explore the benefits of getting rid of the
gradient's value by executing the optimizer step during the back-propagation.
In practice, we achieve up to 25% lower peak memory use and 15% faster training
while maintaining the same level of accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the great success of language model (LM)-based pre-training,
recent studies in visual document understanding have explored LM-based
pre-training methods for modeling text within document images. Among them,
pre-training that reads all text from an image has shown promise, but often
exhibits instability and even fails when applied to broader domains, such as
those involving both visual documents and scene text images. This is a
substantial limitation for real-world scenarios, where the processing of text
image inputs in diverse domains is essential. In this paper, we investigate
effective pre-training tasks in the broader domains and also propose a novel
pre-training method called SCOB that leverages character-wise supervised
contrastive learning with online text rendering to effectively pre-train
document and scene text domains by bridging the domain gap. Moreover, SCOB
enables weakly supervised learning, significantly reducing annotation costs.
Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SCOB generally improves vanilla
pre-training methods and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings suggest that SCOB can be served generally and effectively
for read-type pre-training methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/naver-ai/scob.

<p class="mathjax">We report on an effort that led to POLAR3D, a set of digital assets that
enhance the POLAR dataset of stereo images generated by NASA to mimic lunar
lighting conditions. Our contributions are twofold. First, we have annotated
each photo in the POLAR dataset, providing approximately 23 000 labels for
rocks and their shadows. Second, we digitized several lunar terrain scenarios
available in the POLAR dataset. Specifically, by utilizing both the lunar
photos and the POLAR's LiDAR point clouds, we constructed detailed obj files
for all identifiable assets. POLAR3D is the set of digital assets comprising of
rock/shadow labels and obj files associated with the digital twins of lunar
terrain scenarios. This new dataset can be used for training perception
algorithms for lunar exploration and synthesizing photorealistic images beyond
the original POLAR collection. Likewise, the obj assets can be integrated into
simulation environments to facilitate realistic rover operations in a digital
twin of a POLAR scenario. POLAR3D is publicly available to aid perception
algorithm development, camera simulation efforts, and lunar simulation
exercises.POLAR3D is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces an approach for synthesizing feasible safety indices to
derive safe control laws under state-dependent control spaces. The problem,
referred to as Safety Index Synthesis (SIS), is challenging because it requires
the existence of feasible control input in all states and leads to an infinite
number of constraints. The proposed method leverages Positivstellensatz to
formulate SIS as a nonlinear programming (NP) problem. We formally prove that
the NP solutions yield safe control laws with two imperative guarantees:
forward invariance within user-defined safe regions and finite-time convergence
to those regions. A numerical study validates the effectiveness of our
approach.

the inference of the network. In this research, we study applying compression
using low rank decomposition on network layers. Our research demonstrates that
to acquire a speed up, the compression methodology should be aware of the
underlying hardware as analysis should be done to choose which layers to
compress. The advantage of our approach is demonstrated via a case study of
compressing ResNet50 and training on full ImageNet-ILSVRC2012. We tested on two
different hardware systems Nvidia V100 and Huawei Ascend910. With hardware
targeted compression, results on Ascend910 showed 5.36% training speedup and
15.79% inference speed on Ascend310 with only 1% drop in accuracy compared to

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new approach to generating strongly constrained
texts. We consider standardized sentence generation for the typical application
of vision screening. To solve this problem, we formalize it as a discrete
combinatorial optimization problem and utilize multivalued decision diagrams
(MDD), a well-known data structure to deal with constraints. In our context,
one key strength of MDD is to compute an exhaustive set of solutions without
performing any search. Once the sentences are obtained, we apply a language
model (GPT-2) to keep the best ones. We detail this for English and also for
French where the agreement and conjugation rules are known to be more complex.
Finally, with the help of GPT-2, we get hundreds of bona-fide candidate
sentences. When compared with the few dozen sentences usually available in the
well-known vision screening test (MNREAD), this brings a major breakthrough in
the field of standardized sentence generation. Also, as it can be easily
adapted for other languages, it has the potential to make the MNREAD test even
more valuable and usable. More generally, this paper highlights MDD as a
convincing alternative for constrained text generation, especially when the
constraints are hard to satisfy, but also for many other prospects.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge faced by small and medium-sized business entities is securely
managing software updates and changes. Specifically, with rapidly evolving
cybersecurity threats, changes/updates/patches to software systems are
necessary to stay ahead of emerging threats and are often mandated by
regulators or statutory authorities to counter these. However, security
patches/updates require stress testing before they can be released in the
production system. Stress testing in production environments is risky and poses
security threats. Large businesses usually have a non-production environment
where such changes can be made and tested before being released into
production. Smaller businesses do not have such facilities. In this work, we
show how "digital twins", especially for a mix of IT and IoT environments, can
be created on the cloud. These digital twins act as a non-production
environment where changes can be applied, and the system can be securely tested
before patch release. Additionally, the non-production digital twin can be used
to collect system data and run stress tests on the environment, both manually
and automatically. In this paper, we show how using a small sample of real
data/interactions, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can be used
to generate testing scenarios to check for points of failure.

<p class="mathjax">Applying link prediction (LP) methods over knowledge graphs (KG) for tasks
such as causal event prediction presents an exciting opportunity. However,
typical LP models are ill-suited for this task as they are incapable of
performing inductive link prediction for new, unseen event entities and they
require retraining as knowledge is added or changed in the underlying KG. We
introduce a case-based reasoning model, EvCBR, to predict properties about new
consequent events based on similar cause-effect events present in the KG. EvCBR
uses statistical measures to identify similar events and performs path-based
predictions, requiring no training step. To generalize our methods beyond the
domain of event prediction, we frame our task as a 2-hop LP task, where the
first hop is a causal relation connecting a cause event to a new effect event

The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using a novel dataset of

outperforms baselines including translational-distance-based, GNN-based, and

<p class="mathjax">Self-attention-based vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a highly
competitive architecture in computer vision. Unlike convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), ViTs are capable of global information sharing. With the
development of various structures of ViTs, ViTs are increasingly advantageous
for many vision tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention
renders ViTs computationally intensive, and their lack of inductive biases of
locality and translation equivariance demands larger model sizes compared to
CNNs to effectively learn visual features. In this paper, we propose a
light-weight and efficient vision transformer model called DualToken-ViT that
leverages the advantages of CNNs and ViTs. DualToken-ViT effectively fuses the
token with local information obtained by convolution-based structure and the
token with global information obtained by self-attention-based structure to
achieve an efficient attention structure. In addition, we use position-aware
global tokens throughout all stages to enrich the global information, which
further strengthening the effect of DualToken-ViT. Position-aware global tokens
also contain the position information of the image, which makes our model
better for vision tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on image
classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks to demonstrate
the effectiveness of DualToken-ViT. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, our models of
different scales achieve accuracies of 75.4% and 79.4% with only 0.5G and 1.0G
FLOPs, respectively, and our model with 1.0G FLOPs outperforms LightViT-T using
global tokens by 0.7%.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero shot
performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating the ability to reason
and apply commonsense. A relevant application is to use them for creating high
quality synthetic datasets for downstream tasks. In this work, we probe whether
GPT-4 can be used to augment existing extractive reading comprehension
datasets. Automating data annotation processes has the potential to save large
amounts of time, money and effort that goes into manually labelling datasets.
In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 as a replacement for human
annotators for low resource reading comprehension tasks, by comparing
performance after fine tuning, and the cost associated with annotation. This
work serves to be the first analysis of LLMs as synthetic data augmenters for
QA systems, highlighting the unique opportunities and challenges. Additionally,
we release augmented versions of low resource datasets, that will allow the
research community to create further benchmarks for evaluation of generated
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup is a student competition that takes
place each year at the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing. The
2022 IEEE VIP Cup asked undergraduate students to develop a system capable of
distinguishing pristine images from generated ones. The interest in this topic
stems from the incredible advances in the AI-based generation of visual data,
with tools that allows the synthesis of highly realistic images and videos.
While this opens up a large number of new opportunities, it also undermines the
trustworthiness of media content and fosters the spread of disinformation on
the internet. Recently there was strong concern about the generation of
extremely realistic images by means of editing software that includes the
recent technology on diffusion models. In this context, there is a need to
develop robust and automatic tools for synthetic image detection.

<p class="mathjax">In recent times, there is an increased interest in the identification and
re-identification of people at long distances, such as from rooftop cameras,
UAV cameras, street cams, and others. Such recognition needs to go beyond face
and use whole-body markers such as gait. However, datasets to train and test
such recognition algorithms are not widely prevalent, and fewer are labeled.
This paper introduces DIOR -- a framework for data collection, semi-automated
annotation, and also provides a dataset with 14 subjects and 1.649 million RGB
frames with 3D/2D skeleton gait labels, including 200 thousands frames from a
long range camera. Our approach leverages advanced 3D computer vision
techniques to attain pixel-level accuracy in indoor settings with motion
capture systems. Additionally, for outdoor long-range settings, we remove the
dependency on motion capture systems and adopt a low-cost, hybrid 3D computer
vision and learning pipeline with only 4 low-cost RGB cameras, successfully
achieving precise skeleton labeling on far-away subjects, even when their
height is limited to a mere 20-25 pixels within an RGB frame. On publication,
we will make our pipeline open for others to use.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Software start-ups are young companies aiming to build and market
software-intensive products fast with little resources. Aiming to accelerate
time-to-market, start-ups often opt for ad-hoc engineering practices, make
shortcuts in product engineering, and accumulate technical debt. Objective: In
this paper we explore to what extent precedents, dimensions and outcomes
associated with technical debt are prevalent in start-ups. Method: We apply a
case survey method to identify aspects of technical debt and contextual
information characterizing the engineering context in start-ups. Results: By
analyzing responses from 86 start-up cases we found that start-ups accumulate
most technical debt in the testing dimension, despite attempts to automate
testing. Furthermore, we found that start-up team size and experience is a
leading precedent for accumulating technical debt: larger teams face more
challenges in keeping the debt under control. Conclusions: This study
highlights the necessity to monitor levels of technical debt and to
preemptively introduce practices to keep the debt under control. Adding more
people to an already difficult to maintain product could amplify other
precedents, such as resource shortages, communication issues and negatively
affect decisions pertaining to the use of good engineering practices.

<p class="mathjax">Denial Constraint (DC) is a well-established formalism that captures a wide
range of integrity constraints commonly encountered, including candidate keys,
functional dependencies, and ordering constraints, among others. Given their
significance, there has been considerable research interest in achieving fast
verification and discovery of exact DCs within the database community. Despite
the significant advancements in the field, prior work exhibits notable
limitations when confronted with large-scale datasets. The current
state-of-the-art exact DC verification algorithm demonstrates a quadratic
(worst-case) time complexity relative to the dataset's number of rows. In the
context of DC discovery, existing methodologies rely on a two-step algorithm
that commences with an expensive data structure-building phase, often requiring
hours to complete even for datasets containing only a few million rows.
Consequently, users are left without any insights into the DCs that hold on
their dataset until this lengthy building phase concludes. In this paper, we
introduce Rapidash, a comprehensive framework for DC verification and
discovery. Our work makes a dual contribution. First, we establish a connection
between orthogonal range search and DC verification. We introduce a novel exact
DC verification algorithm that demonstrates near-linear time complexity,
representing a theoretical improvement over prior work. Second, we propose an
anytime DC discovery algorithm that leverages our novel verification algorithm
to gradually provide DCs to users, eliminating the need for the time-intensive
building phase observed in prior work. To validate the effectiveness of our
algorithms, we conduct extensive evaluations on four large-scale production
datasets. Our results reveal that our DC verification algorithm achieves up to
40 times faster performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Digital MemComputing machines (DMMs), which employ nonlinear dynamical
systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and
scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of
combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has
focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This
inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical)
issues that would be absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous
time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested,
their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy
to integrate with traditional electronics. In this study, we propose a novel
hardware design for DMMs that leverages only conventional electronic
components. Our findings suggest that this design offers a marked improvement
in speed compared to existing realizations of these machines, without requiring
special materials or novel device concepts. Moreover, the absence of numerical
noise promises enhanced stability over extended periods of the machines'
operation, paving the way for addressing even more complex problems.

there are limitations to some selection and navigation techniques that have not
yet been completely overcome. Focusing specifically on enhancing ray-casting,
we present the advanced technique of folding rays which allows for the
selection of occluded targets without any unnecessary physical navigation
around a virtual environment. By improving upon current approaches, our
technique allows for the selection of these targets without any manipulation of
the virtual environment itself using rays that can bend at user-determined

<p class="mathjax">Generative Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize healthcare
delivery by transforming traditional patient care into a more personalized,
efficient, and proactive process. Chatbots, serving as interactive
conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation
in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis,
personalized lifestyle recommendations, and mental health support, the
objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while
mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical
nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and
comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing
evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs)
demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and
their significance in promoting patients' well-being. Moreover, these metrics
neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics,
personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The
purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation
metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive
conversational models in healthcare. Subsequently, we present an comprehensive
set of evaluation metrics designed to thoroughly assess the performance of
healthcare chatbots from an end-user perspective. These metrics encompass an
evaluation of language processing abilities, impact on real-world clinical
tasks, and effectiveness in user-interactive conversations. Finally, we engage
in a discussion concerning the challenges associated with defining and
implementing these metrics, with particular emphasis on confounding factors
such as the target audience, evaluation methods, and prompt techniques involved
in the evaluation process.

<p class="mathjax">A core part of maintenance planning is a monitoring system that provides a
good prognosis on health and degradation, often expressed as remaining useful
life (RUL). Most of the current data-driven approaches for RUL prediction focus
on single-point prediction. These point prediction approaches do not include
the probabilistic nature of the failure. The few probabilistic approaches to
date either include the aleatoric uncertainty (which originates from the
system), or the epistemic uncertainty (which originates from the model
parameters), or both simultaneously as a total uncertainty. Here, we propose
ensemble neural networks for probabilistic RUL predictions which considers both
uncertainties and decouples these two uncertainties. These decoupled
uncertainties are vital in knowing and interpreting the confidence of the
predictions. This method is tested on NASA's turbofan jet engine CMAPSS
data-set. Our results show how these uncertainties can be modeled and how to
disentangle the contribution of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
Additionally, our approach is evaluated on different metrics and compared
against the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Modern agile software projects are subject to constant change, making it
essential to re-asses overall delay risk throughout the project life cycle.
Existing effort estimation models are static and not able to incorporate
changes occurring during project execution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
model for continuously predicting overall delay using delay patterns and
Bayesian modeling. The model incorporates the context of the project phase and
learns from changes in team performance over time. We apply the approach to
real-world data from 4,040 epics and 270 teams at ING. An empirical evaluation
of our approach and comparison to the state-of-the-art demonstrate significant
improvements in predictive accuracy. The dynamic model consistently outperforms
static approaches and the state-of-the-art, even during early project phases.

<p class="mathjax">Maintaining factual consistency is a critical issue in abstractive text
summarisation, however, it cannot be assessed by traditional automatic metrics
used for evaluating text summarisation, such as ROUGE scoring. Recent efforts
have been devoted to developing improved metrics for measuring factual
consistency using pre-trained language models, but these metrics have
restrictive token limits, and are therefore not suitable for evaluating long
document text summarisation. Moreover, there is limited research evaluating
whether existing automatic evaluation metrics are fit for purpose when applied
to long document data sets. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of automatic
metrics at assessing factual consistency in long document text summarisation
and propose a new evaluation framework LongDocFACTScore. This framework allows
metrics to be extended to any length document. This framework outperforms
existing state-of-the-art metrics in its ability to correlate with human
measures of factuality when used to evaluate long document summarisation data
sets. Furthermore, we show LongDocFACTScore has performance comparable to
state-of-the-art metrics when evaluated against human measures of factual
consistency on short document data sets. We make our code and annotated data
publicly available: https://github.com/jbshp/LongDocFACTScore.

<p class="mathjax">Human perception of the empirical world involves recognizing the diverse
appearances, or 'modalities', of underlying objects. Despite the longstanding
consideration of this perspective in philosophy and cognitive science, the
study of multimodality remains relatively under-explored within the field of
machine learning. Nevertheless, current studies of multimodal machine learning
are limited to empirical practices, lacking theoretical foundations beyond
heuristic arguments. An intriguing finding from the practice of multimodal
learning is that a model trained on multiple modalities can outperform a
finely-tuned unimodal model, even on unimodal tasks. This paper provides a
theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon, by studying generalization
properties of multimodal learning algorithms. We demonstrate that multimodal
learning allows for a superior generalization bound compared to unimodal
learning, up to a factor of $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ represents the sample
size. Such advantage occurs when both connection and heterogeneity exist
between the modalities.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we prove a Logarithmic Conjugation Theorem on
finitely-connected tori. The theorem states that a harmonic function can be
written as the real part of a function whose derivative is analytic and a
finite sum of terms involving the logarithm of the modulus of a modified
Weierstrass sigma function. We implement the method using arbitrary precision
and use the result to find approximate solutions to the Laplace problem and
Steklov eigenvalue problem. Using a posteriori estimation, we show that the
solution of the Laplace problem on a torus with a few circular holes has error
less than $10^{-100}$ using a few hundred degrees of freedom and the Steklov
eigenvalues have similar error.

<p class="mathjax">In the domain of scientific imaging, interpreting visual data often demands
an intricate combination of human expertise and deep comprehension of the
subject materials. This study presents a novel methodology to linguistically
emulate and subsequently evaluate human-like interactions with Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM) images, specifically of glass materials. Leveraging a
multimodal deep learning framework, our approach distills insights from both
textual and visual data harvested from peer-reviewed articles, further
augmented by the capabilities of GPT-4 for refined data synthesis and
evaluation. Despite inherent challenges--such as nuanced interpretations and
the limited availability of specialized datasets--our model (GlassLLaVA) excels
in crafting accurate interpretations, identifying key features, and detecting
defects in previously unseen SEM images. Moreover, we introduce versatile
evaluation metrics, suitable for an array of scientific imaging applications,
which allows for benchmarking against research-grounded answers. Benefiting
from the robustness of contemporary Large Language Models, our model adeptly
aligns with insights from research papers. This advancement not only
underscores considerable progress in bridging the gap between human and machine
interpretation in scientific imaging, but also hints at expansive avenues for
future research and broader application.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently been considered a promising
solution for the inevitable crisis of scarce communication resources. This
trend stimulates us to explore the potential of applying SemCom to vehicular
networks, which normally consume a tremendous amount of resources to achieve
stringent requirements on high reliability and low latency. Unfortunately, the
unique background knowledge matching mechanism in SemCom makes it challenging
to realize efficient vehicle-to-vehicle service provisioning for multiple users
at the same time. To this end, this paper identifies and jointly addresses two
fundamental problems of knowledge base construction (KBC) and vehicle service
pairing (VSP) inherently existing in SemCom-enabled vehicular networks.
Concretely, we first derive the knowledge matching based queuing latency
specific for semantic data packets, and then formulate a latency-minimization
problem subject to several KBC and VSP related reliability constraints.
Afterward, a SemCom-empowered Service Supplying Solution (S$^{\text{4}}$) is
proposed along with the theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of S$^{\text{4}}$ in terms of
average queuing latency, semantic data packet throughput, and user knowledge
preference satisfaction compared with two different benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Including information from additional spectral bands (e.g., near-infrared)
can improve deep learning model performance for many vision-oriented tasks.
There are many possible ways to incorporate this additional information into a
deep learning model, but the optimal fusion strategy has not yet been
determined and can vary between applications. At one extreme, known as "early
fusion," additional bands are stacked as extra channels to obtain an input
image with more than three channels. At the other extreme, known as "late
fusion," RGB and non-RGB bands are passed through separate branches of a deep
learning model and merged immediately before a final classification or
segmentation layer. In this work, we characterize the performance of a suite of
multispectral deep learning models with different fusion approaches, quantify
their relative reliance on different input bands and evaluate their robustness
to naturalistic image corruptions affecting one or more input channels.

<p class="mathjax">Session types employ a linear type system that ensures that communication
channels cannot be implicitly copied or discarded. As a result, many
mechanizations of these systems require modeling channel contexts and carefully
ensuring that they treat channels linearly. We demonstrate a technique that
localizes linearity conditions as additional predicates embedded within type
judgments, which allows us to use structural typing contexts instead of linear
ones. This technique is especially relevant when leveraging (weak) higher-order
abstract syntax to handle channel mobility and the intricate binding structures
that arise in session-typed systems. Following this approach, we mechanize a
session-typed system based on classical linear logic and its type preservation
proof in the proof assistant Beluga, which uses the logical framework LF as its
encoding language. We also prove adequacy for our encoding. This shows the
tractability and effectiveness of our approach in modelling substructural
systems such as session-typed languages.

<p class="mathjax">Discovering potential failures of an autonomous system is important prior to
deployment. Falsification-based methods are often used to assess the safety of
such systems, but the cost of running many accurate simulation can be high. The
validation can be accelerated by identifying critical failure scenarios for the
system under test and by reducing the simulation runtime. We propose a Bayesian
approach that integrates meta-learning strategies with a multi-armed bandit
framework. Our method involves learning distributions over scenario parameters
that are prone to triggering failures in the system under test, as well as a
distribution over fidelity settings that enable fast and accurate simulations.
In the spirit of meta-learning, we also assess whether the learned fidelity
settings distribution facilitates faster learning of the scenario parameter
distributions for new scenarios. We showcase our methodology using a
cutting-edge 3D driving simulator, incorporating 16 fidelity settings for an
autonomous vehicle stack that includes camera and lidar sensors. We evaluate
various scenarios based on an autonomous vehicle pre-crash typology. As a
result, our approach achieves a significant speedup, up to 18 times faster
compared to traditional methods that solely rely on a high-fidelity simulator.

<p class="mathjax">Reward functions encode desired behavior in multi-agent Markov decision
processes, but onlookers may learn reward functions by observing agents, which
can reveal sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper we introduce and
compare two methods for privatizing reward functions in policy synthesis for
multi-agent Markov decision processes. Reward functions are privatized using
differential privacy, a statistical framework for protecting sensitive data.
Both methods we develop rely on the Gaussian mechanism, which is a method of
randomization we use to perturb (i) each agent's individual reward function or
(ii) the joint reward function shared by all agents. We prove that both of
these methods are differentially private and compare the abilities of each to
provide accurate reward values for policy synthesis. We then develop an
algorithm for the numerical computation of the performance loss due to privacy
on a case-by-case basis. We also exactly compute the computational complexity
of this algorithm in terms of system parameters and show that it is inherently
tractable. Numerical simulations are performed on a gridworld example and in
waypoint guidance of an autonomous vehicle, and both examples show that privacy
induces only negligible performance losses in practice.

hurdles are that the target person may be in a crowd, obstructed by others, or
facing away from the agent. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel
person re-identification module composed of three parts: a 360-degree visual
registration, a neural-based person re-identification using human faces and
torsos, and a motion tracker that records and predicts the target person's
future position. Our human-following system also addresses other challenges,
including identifying fast-moving targets with low latency, searching for
targets that move out of the camera's sight, collision avoidance, and
adaptively choosing different following mechanisms based on the distance
between the target person and the mobile agent. Extensive experiments show that
our proposed person re-identification module significantly enhances the
human-following feature compared to other baseline variants.

<p class="mathjax">Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (It-LLMs) have been exhibiting
outstanding abilities to reason around cognitive states, intentions, and
reactions of all people involved, letting humans guide and comprehend
day-to-day social interactions effectively. In fact, several multiple-choice
questions (MCQ) benchmarks have been proposed to construct solid assessments of
the models' abilities. However, earlier works are demonstrating the presence of
inherent "order bias" in It-LLMs, posing challenges to the appropriate
evaluation. In this paper, we investigate It-LLMs' resilience abilities towards
a series of probing tests using four MCQ benchmarks. Introducing adversarial
examples, we show a significant performance gap, mainly when varying the order
of the choices, which reveals a selection bias and brings into discussion
reasoning abilities. Following a correlation between first positions and model
choices due to positional bias, we hypothesized the presence of structural
heuristics in the decision-making process of the It-LLMs, strengthened by
including significant examples in few-shot scenarios. Finally, by using the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique, we elicit the model to reason and mitigate
the bias by obtaining more robust models.

<p class="mathjax">With more complex AI systems used by non-AI experts to complete daily tasks,
there is an increasing effort to develop methods that produce explanations of
AI decision making understandable by non-AI experts. Towards this effort,
leveraging higher-level concepts and producing concept-based explanations have
become a popular method. Most concept-based explanations have been developed
for classification techniques, and we posit that the few existing methods for
sequential decision making are limited in scope. In this work, we first
contribute a desiderata for defining "concepts" in sequential decision making
settings. Additionally, inspired by the Protege Effect which states explaining
knowledge often reinforces one's self-learning, we explore the utility of
concept-based explanations providing a dual benefit to the RL agent by
improving agent learning rate, and to the end-user by improving end-user
understanding of agent decision making. To this end, we contribute a unified
framework, State2Explanation (S2E), that involves learning a joint embedding
model between state-action pairs and concept-based explanations, and leveraging
such learned model to both (1) inform reward shaping during an agent's
training, and (2) provide explanations to end-users at deployment for improved
task performance. Our experimental validations, in Connect 4 and Lunar Lander,
demonstrate the success of S2E in providing a dual-benefit, successfully
informing reward shaping and improving agent learning rate, as well as
significantly improving end user task performance at deployment time.

<p class="mathjax">Valuable insights, such as frequently visited environments in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic, can oftentimes only be gained by analyzing sensitive data
spread across edge-devices like smartphones. To facilitate such an analysis, we
present a toolchain for a distributed, privacy-preserving aggregation of local
data by taking the limited resources of edge-devices into account. The
distributed aggregation is based on secure summation and simultaneously
satisfies the notion of differential privacy. In this way, other parties can
neither learn the sensitive data of single clients nor a single client's
influence on the final result. We perform an evaluation of the power

<p class="mathjax">Energy consumption is a fundamental concern in mobile application
development, bearing substantial significance for both developers and
end-users. Moreover, it is a critical determinant in the consumer's
decision-making process when considering a smartphone purchase. From the
sustainability perspective, it becomes imperative to explore approaches aimed
at mitigating the energy consumption of mobile devices, given the significant
global consequences arising from the extensive utilisation of billions of
smartphones, which imparts a profound environmental impact. Despite the
existence of various energy-efficient programming practices within the Android
platform, the dominant mobile ecosystem, there remains a need for documented
machine learning-based energy prediction algorithms tailored explicitly for
mobile app development. Hence, the main objective of this research is to
propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic
approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app
development. The metaheuristic approach here plays a crucial role in not only
identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding parameters but
also determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. To
the best of our knowledge, prior studies have yet to employ any metaheuristic
algorithm to address all these hyperparameters simultaneously. Moreover, due to
limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be
missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In
addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13
metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and
resistance to missing values. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed approach yields significant outcomes for energy consumption
prediction.

<p class="mathjax">In the present study, we investigate and compare reasoning in large language
models (LLM) and humans using a selection of cognitive psychology tools
traditionally dedicated to the study of (bounded) rationality. To do so, we
presented to human participants and an array of pretrained LLMs new variants of
classical cognitive experiments, and cross-compared their performances. Our
results showed that most of the included models presented reasoning errors akin
to those frequently ascribed to error-prone, heuristic-based human reasoning.
Notwithstanding this superficial similarity, an in-depth comparison between
humans and LLMs indicated important differences with human-like reasoning, with
models limitations disappearing almost entirely in more recent LLMs releases.
Moreover, we show that while it is possible to devise strategies to induce
better performance, humans and machines are not equally-responsive to the same
prompting schemes. We conclude by discussing the epistemological implications
and challenges of comparing human and machine behavior for both artificial
intelligence and cognitive psychology.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and efficiently tune
high-dimensional vectors of controller parameters. The proposed method first
learns a mapping from the high-dimensional controller parameter space to a
lower dimensional space using a machine learning-based algorithm. This mapping
is then utilized in an actor-critic framework using Bayesian optimization (BO).
The proposed approach is applicable to complex systems (such as quadruped
robots). In addition, the proposed approach also enables efficient
generalization to different control tasks while also reducing the number of
evaluations required while tuning the controller parameters. We evaluate our
method on a legged locomotion application. We show the efficacy of the
algorithm in tuning the high-dimensional controller parameters and also
reducing the number of evaluations required for the tuning. Moreover, it is
shown that the method is successful in generalizing to new tasks and is also
transferable to other robot dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Recent experiments have shown that, often, when training a neural network
with gradient descent (GD) with a step size $\eta$, the operator norm of the
Hessian of the loss grows until it approximately reaches $2/\eta$, after which
it fluctuates around this value.
<br />The quantity $2/\eta$ has been called the "edge of stability" based on
consideration of a local quadratic approximation of the loss. We perform a
similar calculation to arrive at an "edge of stability" for Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM), a variant of GD which has been shown to improve its
generalization. Unlike the case for GD, the resulting SAM-edge depends on the
norm of the gradient. Using three deep learning training tasks, we see
empirically that SAM operates on the edge of stability identified by this
analysis.

<p class="mathjax">We study the effect of tokenization on gender bias in machine translation, an
aspect that has been largely overlooked in previous works. Specifically, we
focus on the interactions between the frequency of gendered profession names in
training data, their representation in the subword tokenizer's vocabulary, and
gender bias. We observe that female and non-stereotypical gender inflections of
profession names (e.g., Spanish "doctora" for "female doctor") tend to be split
into multiple subword tokens. Our results indicate that the imbalance of gender
forms in the model's training corpus is a major factor contributing to gender
bias and has a greater impact than subword splitting. We show that analyzing
subword splits provides good estimates of gender-form imbalance in the training
data and can be used even when the corpus is not publicly available. We also
demonstrate that fine-tuning just the token embedding layer can decrease the
gap in gender prediction accuracy between female and male forms without
impairing the translation quality.

importantly to take into account the uncertainty already present in the labels,
\emph{i.e.} the uncertainty of the oracles. Two strategies are proposed,
sampling by Klir uncertainty, which addresses the exploration-exploitation

reducible uncertainty to the evidential framework, both using the theory of

<p class="mathjax">Software engineering activities such as package migration, fixing errors
reports from static analysis or testing, and adding type annotations or other
specifications to a codebase, involve pervasively editing the entire repository
of code. We formulate these activities as repository-level coding tasks.
<br />Recent tools like GitHub Copilot, which are powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), have succeeded in offering high-quality solutions to localized coding
problems. Repository-level coding tasks are more involved and cannot be solved
directly using LLMs, since code within a repository is inter-dependent and the
entire repository may be too large to fit into the prompt. We frame
repository-level coding as a planning problem and present a task-agnostic
framework, called CodePlan to solve it. CodePlan synthesizes a multi-step chain
of edits (plan), where each step results in a call to an LLM on a code location
with context derived from the entire repository, previous code changes and
task-specific instructions. CodePlan is based on a novel combination of an
incremental dependency analysis, a change may-impact analysis and an adaptive
planning algorithm.
<br />We evaluate the effectiveness of CodePlan on two repository-level tasks:
package migration (C#) and temporal code edits (Python). Each task is evaluated
on multiple code repositories, each of which requires inter-dependent changes
to many files (between 2-97 files). Coding tasks of this level of complexity
have not been automated using LLMs before. Our results show that CodePlan has
better match with the ground truth compared to baselines. CodePlan is able to
get 5/6 repositories to pass the validity checks (e.g., to build without errors
and make correct code edits) whereas the baselines (without planning but with
the same type of contextual information as CodePlan) cannot get any of the
repositories to pass them.

<p class="mathjax">Previous work on user-level differential privacy (DP) [Ghazi et al. NeurIPS
2021, Bun et al. STOC 2023] obtained generic algorithms that work for various
learning tasks. However, their focus was on the example-rich regime, where the
users have so many examples that each user could themselves solve the problem.
In this work we consider the example-scarce regime, where each user has only a
few examples, and obtain the following results:
<br />1. For approximate-DP, we give a generic transformation of any item-level DP
algorithm to a user-level DP algorithm. Roughly speaking, the latter gives a
(multiplicative) savings of $O_{\varepsilon,\delta}(\sqrt{m})$ in terms of the
number of users required for achieving the same utility, where $m$ is the
number of examples per user. This algorithm, while recovering most known bounds
for specific problems, also gives new bounds, e.g., for PAC learning.
<br />2. For pure-DP, we present a simple technique for adapting the exponential
mechanism [McSherry, Talwar FOCS 2007] to the user-level setting. This gives
new bounds for a variety of tasks, such as private PAC learning, hypothesis
selection, and distribution learning. For some of these problems, we show that
our bounds are near-optimal.

<p class="mathjax">Many mathematical models have been leveraged to design embeddings for
representing Knowledge Graph (KG) entities and relations for link prediction
and many downstream tasks. These mathematically-inspired models are not only
highly scalable for inference in large KGs, but also have many explainable
advantages in modeling different relation patterns that can be validated
through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a
comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In
particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1)
distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the
connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend
that might help researchers invent novel and more effective models. Next, we
delve into CompoundE and CompoundE3D, which draw inspiration from 2D and 3D
affine operations, respectively. They encompass a broad spectrum of techniques
including distance-based and semantic-based methods. We will also discuss an
emerging approach for KG completion which leverages pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and textual descriptions of entities and relations and offer insights
into the integration of KGE embedding methods with PLMs for KG completion.

<p class="mathjax">A wireless network of full-duplex nodes/users, using anti-eavesdropping
channel estimation (ANECE) based on collaborative pilots, can yield a positive
secure degree-of-freedom (SDoF) regardless of the number of antennas an
eavesdropper may have. This paper presents novel results on SDoF of ANECE by
analyzing secret-key capacity (SKC) of each pair of nodes in a network of
multiple collaborative nodes per channel coherence period. Each transmission
session of ANECE has two phases: phase 1 is used for pilots, and phase 2 is
used for random symbols. This results in two parts of SDoF of ANECE. Both lower
and upper bounds on the SDoF of ANECE for any number of users are shown, and
the conditions for the two bounds to meet are given. This leads to important
discoveries, including: a) The phase-1 SDoF is the same for both multi-user
ANECE and pair-wise ANECE while the former may require only a fraction of the
number of time slots needed by the latter; b) For a three-user network, the
phase-2 SDoF of all-user ANECE is generally larger than that of pair-wise
ANECE; c) For a two-user network, a modified ANECE deploying square-shaped
nonsingular pilot matrices yields a higher total SDoF than the original ANECE.
The multi-user ANECE and the modified two-user ANECE shown in this paper appear
to be the best full-duplex schemes known today in terms of SDoF subject to each
node using a given number of antennas for both transmitting and receiving.

<p class="mathjax">In surveillance, accurately recognizing license plates is hindered by their
often low quality and small dimensions, compromising recognition precision.
Despite advancements in AI-based image super-resolution, methods like
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
still fall short in enhancing license plate images. This study leverages the
cutting-edge diffusion model, which has consistently outperformed other deep
learning techniques in image restoration. By training this model using a
curated dataset of Saudi license plates, both in low and high resolutions, we
discovered the diffusion model's superior efficacy. The method achieves a
12.55\% and 37.32% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) over SwinIR
and ESRGAN, respectively. Moreover, our method surpasses these techniques in
terms of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), registering a 4.89% and 17.66%
improvement over SwinIR and ESRGAN, respectively. Furthermore, 92% of human
evaluators preferred our images over those from other algorithms. In essence,
this research presents a pioneering solution for license plate
super-resolution, with tangible potential for surveillance systems.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation of autonomous vehicle systems requires that simulated traffic
participants exhibit diverse and realistic behaviors. The use of prerecorded
real-world traffic scenarios in simulation ensures realism but the rarity of
safety critical events makes large scale collection of driving scenarios
expensive. In this paper, we present DJINN - a diffusion based method of
generating traffic scenarios. Our approach jointly diffuses the trajectories of
all agents, conditioned on a flexible set of state observations from the past,
present, or future. On popular trajectory forecasting datasets, we report state
of the art performance on joint trajectory metrics. In addition, we demonstrate
how DJINN flexibly enables direct test-time sampling from a variety of valuable
conditional distributions including goal-based sampling, behavior-class
sampling, and scenario editing.

<p class="mathjax">Existing conformal prediction algorithms estimate prediction intervals at
target confidence levels to characterize the performance of a regression model
on new test samples. However, considering an autonomous system consisting of
multiple modules, prediction intervals constructed for individual modules fall
short of accommodating uncertainty propagation over different modules and thus
cannot provide reliable predictions on system behavior. We address this
limitation and present novel solutions based on conformal prediction to provide
prediction intervals calibrated for a predictive system consisting of cascaded
modules (e.g., an upstream feature extraction module and a downstream
regression module). Our key idea is to leverage module-level validation data to
characterize the system-level error distribution without direct access to
end-to-end validation data. We provide theoretical justification and empirical
experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed solutions. In
comparison to prediction intervals calibrated for individual modules, our
solutions generate improved intervals with more accurate performance guarantees
for system predictions, which are demonstrated on both synthetic systems and
real-world systems performing overlap prediction for indoor navigation using
the Matterport3D dataset.

arguments and have a set of transitions for backtracking out of an evaluated
argument. We study a new abstract machine which avoids backtracking by
splitting the run of the machine in smaller jobs, one for argument, and that
jumps directly to the next job once one is finished.
<br />Usually, machines are also deterministic and implement deterministic
strategies. Here we weaken this aspect and consider a light form of
non-determinism, namely the diamond property, for both the machine and the
strategy. For the machine, this introduces a modular management of jobs,
parametric in a scheduling policy. We then show how to obtain various
strategies, among which leftmost-outermost evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) utilizes a set of speaker
profiles alongside an input audio signal to perform speaker diarization. While
its superiority over conventional methods has been demonstrated, the method can
suffer from errors in speaker profiles, as those profiles are typically
obtained by running a traditional clustering-based diarization method over the
input signal. This paper proposes an extension to TS-VAD, called
Profile-Error-Tolerant TS-VAD (PET-TSVAD), which is robust to such speaker
profile errors. This is achieved by employing transformer-based TS-VAD that can
handle a variable number of speakers and further introducing a set of
additional pseudo-speaker profiles to handle speakers undetected during the
first pass diarization. During training, we use speaker profiles estimated by
multiple different clustering algorithms to reduce the mismatch between the
training and testing conditions regarding speaker profiles. Experimental
results show that PET-TSVAD consistently outperforms the existing TS-VAD method
on both the VoxConverse and DIHARD-I datasets.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on achieving optimal multi-user channel access in
distributed networks using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The
network includes wireless channels with direct links between users and RIS
links connecting users to the RIS. To maximize average system throughput, an
optimal channel access strategy is proposed, considering the trade-off between
exploiting spatial diversity gain with RIS assistance and the overhead of
channel probing. The paper proposes an optimal distributed Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) strategy with opportunistic
RIS assistance, based on statistics theory of optimal sequential observation
planned decision. Each source-destination pair makes decisions regarding the
use of direct links and/or probing source-RIS-destination links. Channel access
occurs in a distributed manner after successful channel contention. The
optimality of the strategy is rigorously derived using multiple-level pure
thresholds. A distributed algorithm, which achieves significantly lower online
complexity at $O(1)$, is developed to implement the proposed strategy.
Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the
superior performance compared to existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Throughout long history, natural species have learned to survive by evolving
their physical structures adaptive to the environment changes. In contrast,
current reinforcement learning (RL) studies mainly focus on training an agent
with a fixed morphology (e.g., skeletal structure and joint attributes) in a
fixed environment, which can hardly generalize to changing environments or new
tasks. In this paper, we optimize an RL agent and its morphology through
``morphology-environment co-evolution (MECE)'', in which the morphology keeps
being updated to adapt to the changing environment, while the environment is
modified progressively to bring new challenges and stimulate the improvement of
the morphology. This leads to a curriculum to train generalizable RL, whose
morphology and policy are optimized for different environments. Instead of
hand-crafting the curriculum, we train two policies to automatically change the
morphology and the environment. To this end, (1) we develop two novel and
effective rewards for the two policies, which are solely based on the learning
dynamics of the RL agent; (2) we design a scheduler to automatically determine
when to change the environment and the morphology. In experiments on two
classes of tasks, the morphology and RL policies trained via MECE exhibit
significantly better generalization performance in unseen test environments
than SOTA morphology optimization methods. Our ablation studies on the two MECE
policies further show that the co-evolution between the morphology and
environment is the key to the success.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization studies the problem of training a model with samples
from several domains (or distributions) and then testing the model with samples
from a new, unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
domain generalization that leverages recent advances in large vision-language
models, specifically a CLIP teacher model, to train a smaller model that
generalizes to unseen domains. The key technical contribution is a new type of
regularization that requires the student's learned image representations to be
close to the teacher's learned text representations obtained from encoding the
corresponding text descriptions of images. We introduce two designs of the loss
function, absolute and relative distance, which provide specific guidance on
how the training process of the student model should be regularized. We
evaluate our proposed method, dubbed RISE (Regularized Invariance with Semantic
Embeddings), on various benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms several
state-of-the-art domain generalization methods. To our knowledge, our work is
the first to leverage knowledge distillation using a large vision-language
model for domain generalization. By incorporating text-based information, RISE
improves the generalization capability of machine learning models.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a risk-aware crash mitigation system (RCMS), to augment any
existing motion planner (MP), that enables an autonomous vehicle to perform
evasive maneuvers in high-risk situations and minimize the severity of
collision if a crash is inevitable. In order to facilitate a smooth transition
between RCMS and MP, we develop a novel activation mechanism that combines
instantaneous as well as predictive collision risk evaluation strategies in a
unified hysteresis-band approach. For trajectory planning, we deploy a modular
receding horizon optimization-based approach that minimizes a smooth
situational risk profile, while adhering to the physical road limits as well as
vehicular actuator limits. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in a
simulation environment.

<p class="mathjax">With recent advancements in the field of communications and the Internet of
Things, vehicles are becoming more aware of their environment and are evolving
towards full autonomy. Vehicular communication opens up the possibility for
vehicle-to-infrastructure interaction, where vehicles could share information
with components such as cameras, traffic lights, and signage that support a
countrys road system. As a result, vehicles are becoming more than just a means
of transportation; they are collecting, processing, and transmitting massive
amounts of data used to make driving safer and more convenient. With 5G
cellular networks and beyond, there is going to be more data bandwidth
available on our roads, but it may be heterogeneous because of limitations like
line of sight, infrastructure, and heterogeneous traffic on the road. This
paper addresses the problem of route planning for autonomous vehicles in urban
areas accounting for both driving time and data transfer needs. We propose a
novel reinforcement learning solution that prioritizes high bandwidth roads to
meet a vehicles data transfer requirement, while also minimizing driving time.
We compare this approach to traffic-unaware and bandwidth-unaware baselines to
show how much better it performs under heterogeneous traffic. This solution
could be used as a starting point to understand what good policies look like,
which could potentially yield faster, more efficient heuristics in the future.

<p class="mathjax">In human-robot collaboration, there has been a trade-off relationship between
the speed of collaborative robots and the safety of human workers. In our
previous paper, we introduced a time-optimal path tracking algorithm designed
to maximize speed while ensuring safety for human workers. This algorithm runs
in real-time and provides the safe and fastest control input for every cycle
with respect to ISO standards. However, true optimality has not been achieved
due to inaccurate distance computation resulting from conservative model
simplification. To attain true optimality, we require a method that can compute
distances 1. at many robot configurations to examine along a trajectory 2. in
real-time for online robot control 3. as precisely as possible for optimal
control. In this paper, we propose a batched, fast and precise distance
checking method based on precomputed link-local SDFs. Our method can check
distances for 500 waypoints along a trajectory within less than 1 millisecond
using a GPU at runtime, making it suited for time-critical robotic control.
Additionally, a neural approximation has been proposed to accelerate
preprocessing by a factor of 2. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our
method can navigate a 6-DoF robot earlier than a geometric-primitives-based
distance checker in a dynamic and collaborative environment.

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) have received increasing interest as a
major methodology for explaining neural network classifiers. Usually, CEs for
an input-output pair are defined as data points with minimum distance to the
input that are classified with a different label than the output. To tackle the
established problem that CEs are easily invalidated when model parameters are
updated (e.g. retrained), studies have proposed ways to certify the robustness
of CEs under model parameter changes bounded by a norm ball. However, existing
methods targeting this form of robustness are not sound or complete, and they
may generate implausible CEs, i.e., outliers wrt the training dataset. In fact,
no existing method simultaneously optimises for proximity and plausibility
while preserving robustness guarantees. In this work, we propose Provably
RObust and PLAusible Counterfactual Explanations (PROPLACE), a method
leveraging on robust optimisation techniques to address the aforementioned
limitations in the literature. We formulate an iterative algorithm to compute
provably robust CEs and prove its convergence, soundness and completeness.
Through a comparative experiment involving six baselines, five of which target
robustness, we show that PROPLACE achieves state-of-the-art performances
against metrics on three evaluation aspects.

for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, are based on measuring the n-gram
overlap between the generated and reference text. These simple metrics may be
insufficient for more complex tasks, such as question generation (QG), which
requires generating questions that are answerable by the reference answers.
Developing a more sophisticated automatic evaluation metric, thus, remains as
an urgent problem in QG research. This work proposes a Prompting-based Metric
on ANswerability (PMAN), a novel automatic evaluation metric to assess whether
the generated questions are answerable by the reference answers for the QG
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that its evaluation results are
reliable and align with human evaluations. We further apply our metric to
evaluate the performance of QG models, which shows our metric complements
conventional metrics. Our implementation of a ChatGPT-based QG model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generating answerable questions.

<p class="mathjax">While deep learning enables real robots to perform complex tasks had been
difficult to implement in the past, the challenge is the enormous amount of
trial-and-error and motion teaching in a real environment. The manipulation of
moving objects, due to their dynamic properties, requires learning a wide range
of factors such as the object's position, movement speed, and grasping timing.
We propose a data augmentation method for enabling a robot to grasp moving
objects with different speeds and grasping timings at low cost. Specifically,
the robot is taught to grasp an object moving at low speed using teleoperation,
and multiple data with different speeds and grasping timings are generated by
down-sampling and padding the robot sensor data in the time-series direction.
By learning multiple sensor data in a time series, the robot can generate
motions while adjusting the grasping timing for unlearned movement speeds and
sudden speed changes. We have shown using a real robot that this data
augmentation method facilitates learning the relationship between object
position and velocity and enables the robot to perform robust grasping motions
for unlearned positions and objects with dynamically changing positions and
velocities.

<p class="mathjax">Text simplification is a common task where the text is adapted to make it
easier to understand. Similarly, text elaboration can make a passage more
sophisticated, offering a method to control the complexity of reading
comprehension tests. However, text simplification and elaboration tasks are
limited to only relatively alter the readability of texts. It is useful to
directly modify the readability of any text to an absolute target readability
level to cater to a diverse audience. Ideally, the readability of
readability-controlled generated text should be independent of the source text.
Therefore, we propose a novel readability-controlled text modification task.
The task requires the generation of 8 versions at various target readability
levels for each input text. We introduce novel readability-controlled text
modification metrics. The baselines for this task use ChatGPT and Llama-2, with
an extension approach introducing a two-step process (generating paraphrases by
passing through the language model twice). The zero-shot approaches are able to
push the readability of the paraphrases in the desired direction but the final
readability remains correlated with the original text's readability. We also
find greater drops in semantic and lexical similarity between the source and
target texts with greater shifts in the readability.

<p class="mathjax">Ducted fan lift systems (DFLSs) powered by two-stroke aviation piston engines
present a challenging control problem due to their complex multivariable
dynamics. Current controllers for these systems typically rely on
proportional-integral algorithms combined with data tables, which rely on
accurate models and are not adaptive to handle time-varying dynamics or system
uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel adaptive model predictive control
(AMPC) strategy with an associated linear parameter varying (LPV) model for
controlling the engine-driven DFLS. This LPV model is derived from a global
network model, which is trained off-line with data obtained from a general mean
value engine model for two-stroke aviation engines. Different network models,
including multi-layer perceptron, Elman, and radial basis function (RBF), are
evaluated and compared in this study. The results demonstrate that the RBF
model exhibits higher prediction accuracy and robustness in the DFLS
application. Based on the trained RBF model, the proposed AMPC approach
constructs an associated network that directly outputs the LPV model parameters
as an adaptive, robust, and efficient prediction model. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations of a vertical
take-off thrust preparation process for the DFLS. The simulation results
indicate that the proposed AMPC method can effectively control the DFLS thrust
with a relative error below 3.5%.

<p class="mathjax">To alleviate the expensive human labeling, semi-supervised semantic
segmentation employs a few labeled images and an abundant of unlabeled images
to predict the pixel-level label map with the same size. Previous methods often
adopt co-training using two convolutional networks with the same architecture
but different initialization, which fails to capture the sufficiently diverse
features. This motivates us to use tri-training and develop the triple-view
encoder to utilize the encoders with different architectures to derive diverse
features, and exploit the knowledge distillation skill to learn the
complementary semantics among these encoders. Moreover, existing methods simply
concatenate the features from both encoder and decoder, resulting in redundant
features that require large memory cost. This inspires us to devise a
dual-frequency decoder that selects those important features by projecting the
features from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, where the
dual-frequency channel attention mechanism is introduced to model the feature
importance. Therefore, we propose a Triple-view Knowledge Distillation
framework, termed TriKD, for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, including
the triple-view encoder and the dual-frequency decoder. Extensive experiments
were conducted on two benchmarks, \ie, Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, whose
results verify the superiority of the proposed method with a good tradeoff
between precision and inference speed.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is indispensable for learning models
in the wild, where testing distribution typically unknown and different from
the training. Recent methods derived from causality have shown great potential
in achieving OOD generalization. However, existing methods mainly focus on the
invariance property of causes, while largely overlooking the property of
\textit{sufficiency} and \textit{necessity} conditions. Namely, a necessary but
insufficient cause (feature) is invariant to distribution shift, yet it may not
have required accuracy. By contrast, a sufficient yet unnecessary cause
(feature) tends to fit specific data well but may have a risk of adapting to a
new domain. To capture the information of sufficient and necessary causes, we
employ a classical concept, the probability of sufficiency and necessary causes
(PNS), which indicates the probability of whether one is the necessary and
sufficient cause. To associate PNS with OOD generalization, we propose PNS risk
and formulate an algorithm to learn representation with a high PNS value. We
theoretically analyze and prove the generalizability of the PNS risk.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The details of the implementation can be
found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ymy4323460/CaSN.

<p class="mathjax">Automated industries lead to high quality production, lower manufacturing
cost and better utilization of human resources. Robotic manipulator arms have
major role in the automation process. However, for complex manipulation tasks,
hard coding efficient and safe trajectories is challenging and time consuming.
Machine learning methods have the potential to learn such controllers based on
expert demonstrations. Despite promising advances, better approaches must be
developed to improve safety, reliability, and efficiency of ML methods in both
training and deployment phases. This survey aims to review cutting edge
technologies and recent trends on ML methods applied to real-world manipulation
tasks. After reviewing the related background on ML, the rest of the paper is
devoted to ML applications in different domains such as industry, healthcare,
agriculture, space, military, and search and rescue. The paper is closed with
important research directions for future works.

<p class="mathjax">In an efficient and flexible human-robot collaborative work environment, a
robot team member must be able to recognize both explicit requests and implied
actions from human users. Identifying "what to do" in such cases requires an
agent to have the ability to construct associations between objects, their
actions, and the effect of actions on the environment. In this regard, semantic
memory is being introduced to understand the explicit cues and their
relationships with available objects and required skills to make "tea" and
"sandwich". We have extended our previous hierarchical robot control
architecture to add the capability to execute the most appropriate task based
on both feedback from the user and the environmental context. To validate this
system, two types of skills were implemented in the hierarchical task tree: 1)
Tea making skills and 2) Sandwich making skills. During the conversation
between the robot and the human, the robot was able to determine the hidden
context using ontology and began to act accordingly. For instance, if the
person says "I am thirsty" or "It is cold outside" the robot will start to
perform the tea-making skill. In contrast, if the person says, "I am hungry" or
"I need something to eat", the robot will make the sandwich. A humanoid robot
Baxter was used for this experiment. We tested three scenarios with objects at
different positions on the table for each skill. We observed that in all cases,
the robot used only objects that were relevant to the skill.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique to
extend the wireless signal coverage of access point (AP) and improve the
communication performance cost-effectively. In order to reduce the path-loss of
the cascaded user-IRS-AP channels, the IRS-integrated AP architecture has been
proposed to deploy the IRSs and the antenna array of the AP within the same
antenna radome. To reduce the pilot overhead for estimating all IRS-involved
channels, in this paper, we propose a novel codebook-based IRS reflection
design for the IRS-integrated AP to enhance the coverage performance in a given
area. In particular, the codebook consisting of a small number of codewords is
designed offline by employing an efficient sector division strategy based on
the azimuth angle. To ensure the performance of each sector, we optimize its
corresponding codeword for IRS reflection pattern to maximize the
sector-min-average-effective-channel-power (SMAECP) by applying the alternating
optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. With the designed
codebook, the AP performs the IRS reflection training by sequentially applying
all codewords and selects the one achieving the best communication performance
for data transmission. Numerical results show that our proposed codebook design
can enhance the average channel power of the whole coverage area, as compared
to the system without IRS. Moreover, our proposed codebook-based IRS reflection
design is shown to achieve significant performance gain over other benchmark
schemes in both single-user and multi-user transmissions.

<p class="mathjax">Online local-life service platforms provide services like nearby daily
essentials and food delivery for hundreds of millions of users. Different from
other types of recommender systems, local-life service recommendation has the
following characteristics: (1) spatiotemporal periodicity, which means a user's
preferences for items vary from different locations at different times. (2)
spatiotemporal collaborative signal, which indicates similar users have similar
preferences at specific locations and times. However, most existing methods
either focus on merely the spatiotemporal contexts in sequences, or model the
user-item interactions without spatiotemporal contexts in graphs. To address
this issue, we design a new method named SPCS in this paper. Specifically, we
propose a novel spatiotemporal graph transformer (SGT) layer, which explicitly
encodes relative spatiotemporal contexts, and aggregates the information from
multi-hop neighbors to unify spatiotemporal periodicity and collaborative
signal. With extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets, this
paper validates the state-of-the-art performance of SPCS.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous mobile robots need to perceive the environments with their onboard
sensors (e.g., LiDARs and RGB cameras) and then make appropriate navigation
decisions. In order to navigate human-inhabited public spaces, such a
navigation task becomes more than only obstacle avoidance, but also requires
considering surrounding humans and their intentions to somewhat change the
navigation behavior in response to the underlying social norms, i.e., being
socially compliant. Machine learning methods are shown to be effective in
capturing those complex and subtle social interactions in a data-driven manner,
without explicitly hand-crafting simplified models or cost functions.
Considering multiple available sensor modalities and the efficiency of learning
methods, this paper presents a comprehensive study on learning social robot
navigation with multimodal perception using a large-scale real-world dataset.
The study investigates social robot navigation decision making on both the
global and local planning levels and contrasts unimodal and multimodal learning
against a set of classical navigation approaches in different social scenarios,
while also analyzing the training and generalizability performance from the
learning perspective. We also conduct a human study on how learning with
multimodal perception affects the perceived social compliance. The results show
that multimodal learning has a clear advantage over unimodal learning in both
dataset and human studies. We open-source our code for the community's future
use to study multimodal perception for learning social robot navigation.

<p class="mathjax">The development of large language models (LLMs) capable of following
instructions and engaging in conversational interactions sparked increased
interest in their utilization across various support tools. We investigate the
utility of modern LLMs in assisting professional writers via an empirical user
study (n=30). The design of our collaborative writing interface is grounded in
the cognitive process model of writing that views writing as a goal-oriented
thinking process encompassing non-linear cognitive activities: planning,
translating, and reviewing. Participants are asked to submit a post-completion
survey to provide feedback on the potential and pitfalls of LLMs as writing
collaborators. Upon analyzing the writer-LLM interactions, we find that while
writers seek LLM's help across all three types of cognitive activities, they
find LLMs more helpful in translation and reviewing. Our findings from
analyzing both the interactions and the survey responses highlight future
research directions in creative writing assistance using LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Existing research has shown the potential of classifying Alzheimers Disease
(AD) from eye-tracking (ET) data with classifiers that rely on task-specific
engineered features. In this paper, we investigate whether we can improve on
existing results by using a Deep-Learning classifier trained end-to-end on raw
ET data. This classifier (VTNet) uses a GRU and a CNN in parallel to leverage
both visual (V) and temporal (T) representations of ET data and was previously
used to detect user confusion while processing visual displays. A main
challenge in applying VTNet to our target AD classification task is that the
available ET data sequences are much longer than those used in the previous
confusion detection task, pushing the limits of what is manageable by
LSTM-based models. We discuss how we address this challenge and show that VTNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in AD classification, providing
encouraging evidence on the generality of this model to make predictions from
ET data.

common way to refine the structure of a deep learning model.However, little is
known about how models empirically evolve over time which has design
implications for designing caching policies, refining the search algorithm for
particular applications, and other important use cases.In this work, we
algorithmically analyze and quantitatively characterize the patterns of model
evolution for a set of models from the Candle project and the Nasbench-201

the regularized evolution algorithm. We describe how evolutionary patterns

<p class="mathjax">Sparsifying the Transformer has garnered considerable interest, as training
the Transformer is very computationally demanding. Prior efforts to sparsify
the Transformer have either used a fixed pattern or data-driven approach to
reduce the number of operations involving the computation of multi-head
attention, which is the main bottleneck of the Transformer. However, existing
methods suffer from inevitable problems, such as the potential loss of
essential sequence features due to the uniform fixed pattern applied across all
layers, and an increase in the model size resulting from the use of additional
parameters to learn sparsity patterns in attention operations. In this paper,
we propose a novel sparsification scheme for the Transformer that integrates
convolution filters and the flood filling method to efficiently capture the
layer-wise sparse pattern in attention operations. Our sparsification approach
reduces the computational complexity and memory footprint of the Transformer
during training. Efficient implementations of the layer-wise sparsified
attention algorithm on GPUs are developed, demonstrating a new SPION that
achieves up to 3.08X speedup over existing state-of-the-art sparse Transformer
models, with better evaluation quality.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven insights are essential for modern agriculture. This research
paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to improve how we
educate and reach out to people in the field of horticulture. The framework
relies on data from the Horticulture Online Help Desk (HOHD), which is like a
big collection of questions from people who love gardening and are part of the
Extension Master Gardener Program (EMGP). This framework has two main parts.
First, it uses special computer programs (machine learning models) to sort
questions into categories. This helps us quickly send each question to the
right expert, so we can answer it faster. Second, it looks at when questions
are asked and uses that information to guess how many questions we might get in
the future and what they will be about. This helps us plan on topics that will
be really important. It's like knowing what questions will be popular in the
coming months. We also take into account where the questions come from by
looking at the Zip Code. This helps us make research that fits the challenges
faced by gardeners in different places. In this paper, we demonstrate the
potential of machine learning techniques to predict trends in horticulture by
analyzing textual queries from homeowners. We show that NLP, classification,
and time series analysis can be used to identify patterns in homeowners'
queries and predict future trends in horticulture. Our results suggest that
machine learning could be used to predict trends in other agricultural sectors
as well. If large-scale agriculture industries curate and maintain a comparable
repository of textual data, the potential for trend prediction and strategic
agricultural planning could be revolutionized. This convergence of technology
and agriculture offers a promising pathway for the future of sustainable
farming and data-informed agricultural practices

<p class="mathjax">You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based object detectors have shown remarkable
accuracy for automated brain tumor detection. In this paper, we develop a novel
BGFG-YOLO architecture by incorporating Bi-level Routing Attention (BRA),
Generalized feature pyramid networks (GFPN), Forth detecting head, and
Generalized-IoU (GIoU) bounding box regression loss into YOLOv8. BGFG-YOLO
contains an attention mechanism to focus more on important features, and
feature pyramid networks to enrich feature representation by merging high-level
semantic features with spatial details. Furthermore, we investigate the effect
of different attention mechanisms and feature fusions, detection head
architectures on brain tumor detection accuracy. Experimental results show that
BGFG-YOLO gives a 3.4% absolute increase of mAP50 compared to YOLOv8x, and
achieves state-of-the-art on the brain tumor detection dataset Br35H. The code
is available at https://github.com/mkang315/BGFG-YOLO.

<p class="mathjax">In post-disaster scenarios, efficient search and rescue operations involve
collaborative efforts between robots and humans. Existing planning approaches
focus on specific aspects but overlook crucial elements like information
gathering, task assignment, and planning. Furthermore, previous methods
considering robot capabilities and victim requirements suffer from time
complexity due to repetitive planning steps. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a comprehensive framework__the Multi-Stage Multi-Robot Task
Assignment. This framework integrates scouting, task assignment, and
path-planning stages, optimizing task allocation based on robot capabilities,
victim requirements, and past robot performance. Our iterative approach ensures
objective fulfillment within problem constraints. Evaluation across four maps,
comparing with a state-of-the-art baseline, demonstrates our algorithm's
superiority with a remarkable 97 percent performance increase. Our code is
open-sourced to enable result replication.

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms, including Twitter (now X), have policies in place to
maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to
which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest
and concern. We present the first large-scale audit of advertising on Twitter
focusing on compliance with the platform's advertising policies, particularly
those related to political and adult content. We investigate the compliance of
advertisements on Twitter with the platform's stated policies and the impact of
recent acquisition on the advertising activity of the platform. By analyzing
34K advertisements from ~6M tweets, collected over six months, we find evidence
of widespread noncompliance with Twitter's political and adult content
advertising policies suggesting a lack of effective ad content moderation. We
also find that Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter had a noticeable impact on
the advertising landscape, with most existing advertisers either completely
stopping their advertising activity or reducing it. Major brands decreased
their advertising on Twitter, suggesting a negative immediate effect on the
platform's advertising revenue. Our findings underscore the importance of
external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online
advertising.

<p class="mathjax">The trend towards transitioning from monolithic applications to microservices
has been widely embraced in modern distributed systems and applications. This
shift has resulted in the creation of lightweight, fine-grained, and
self-contained microservices. Multiple microservices can be linked together via
calls and inter-dependencies to form complex functions. One of the challenges
in managing microservices is provisioning the optimal amount of resources for
microservices in the chain to ensure application performance while improving
resource usage efficiency. This paper presents \textit{ChainsFormer}, a
framework that analyzes microservice inter-dependencies to identify critical
chains and nodes, and provision resources based on reinforcement learning. To
analyze chains, ChainsFormer utilizes light-weight machine learning techniques
to address the dynamic nature of microservice chains and workloads. For
resource provisioning, a reinforcement learning approach is used that combines
vertical and horizontal scaling to determine the amount of allocated resources
and the number of replicates. We evaluate the effectiveness of
\textit{ChainsFormer} using realistic applications and traces on a real testbed
based on Kubernetes. Our experimental results demonstrate that
\textit{ChainsFormer} can reduce response time by up to 26% and improve
processed requests per second by 8\% compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

<p class="mathjax">As Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used in solving various tasks in
real-world applications, it is crucial to ensure that ML algorithms are robust
to any potential worst-case noises, adversarial attacks, and highly unusual
situations when they are designed. Studying ML robustness will significantly
help in the design of ML algorithms. In this paper, we investigate ML
robustness using adversarial training in centralized and decentralized
environments, where ML training and testing are conducted in one or multiple
computers. In the centralized environment, we achieve a test accuracy of 65.41%
and 83.0% when classifying adversarial examples generated by Fast Gradient Sign
Method and DeepFool, respectively. Comparing to existing studies, these results
demonstrate an improvement of 18.41% for FGSM and 47% for DeepFool. In the
decentralized environment, we study Federated learning (FL) robustness by using
adversarial training with independent and identically distributed (IID) and
non-IID data, respectively, where CIFAR-10 is used in this research. In the IID
data case, our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve such a
robust accuracy that it is comparable to the one obtained in the centralized
environment. Moreover, in the non-IID data case, the natural accuracy drops
from 66.23% to 57.82%, and the robust accuracy decreases by 25% and 23.4% in
C&amp;W and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks, compared to the IID data
case, respectively. We further propose an IID data-sharing approach, which
allows for increasing the natural accuracy to 85.04% and the robust accuracy
from 57% to 72% in C&amp;W attacks and from 59% to 67% in PGD attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate 3D shape abstraction from a single 2D image is a long-standing
problem in computer vision and graphics. By leveraging a set of primitives to
represent the target shape, recent methods have achieved promising results.
However, these methods either use a relatively large number of primitives or
lack geometric flexibility due to the limited expressibility of the primitives.
In this paper, we propose a novel bi-channel Transformer architecture,
integrated with parameterized deformable models, termed DeFormer, to
simultaneously estimate the global and local deformations of primitives. In
this way, DeFormer can abstract complex object shapes while using a small
number of primitives which offer a broader geometry coverage and finer details.
Then, we introduce a force-driven dynamic fitting and a cycle-consistent
re-projection loss to optimize the primitive parameters. Extensive experiments
on ShapeNet across various settings show that DeFormer achieves better
reconstruction accuracy over the state-of-the-art, and visualizes with
consistent semantic correspondences for improved interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of evolving smart cities and autonomous transportation
systems, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
are growing in significance. Vehicles are becoming more than just a means of
transportation; they are collecting, processing, and transmitting massive
amounts of data to make driving safer and more convenient. However, this
advancement ushers in complex issues concerning the centralized structure of
traditional vehicular networks and the privacy and security concerns around
vehicular data. This paper offers a novel, game-theoretic network architecture
to address these challenges. Our approach decentralizes data collection through
distributed servers across the network, aggregating vehicular data into
spatio-temporal maps via secure multi-party computation (SMPC). This strategy
effectively reduces the chances of adversaries reconstructing a vehicle's
complete path, increasing privacy. We also introduce an economic model grounded
in game theory that incentivizes vehicle owners to participate in the network,
balancing the owners' privacy concerns with the monetary benefits of data
sharing. This model aims to maximize the data consumer's utility from the
gathered sensor data by determining the most suitable payment to participating
vehicles, the frequency in which these vehicles share their data, and the total
number of servers in the network. We explore the interdependencies among these
parameters and present our findings accordingly. To define meaningful utility
and loss functions for our study, we utilize a real dataset of vehicular
movement traces.

dilemma of balancing its indispensable utility with the escalating concerns
over user privacy. This study investigates the trade-offs between GPS utility
and privacy among drivers, using a mixed-method approach that includes a survey
of 151 participants and 10 follow-up interviews. We examine usage patterns,
feature preferences, and comfort levels with location tracking and destination
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that users tend to overlook potential
privacy risks in favor of the utility the technology provides. We also find
that users do not mind sharing inaccurate or obfuscated location data as long
as their frequently visited locations aren't identified, and their full driving
routes can't be recreated. Based on our findings, we explore design
opportunities for enhancing privacy and utility, including adaptive interfaces,
personalized profiles, and technological innovations like blockchain.

<p class="mathjax">Surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) biosignals
have been extensively investigated for myoelectric control of prosthetic
devices, neurorobotics, and more recently human-computer interfaces because of
their capability for hand gesture recognition/prediction in a wearable and
non-invasive manner. High intraday (same-day) performance has been reported.
However, the interday performance (separating training and testing days) is
substantially degraded due to the poor generalizability of conventional
approaches over time, hindering the application of such techniques in real-life
practices. There are limited recent studies on the feasibility of multi-day
hand gesture recognition. The existing studies face a major challenge: the need
for long sEMG epochs makes the corresponding neural interfaces impractical due
to the induced delay in myoelectric control. This paper proposes a compact
ViT-based network for multi-day dynamic hand gesture prediction. We tackle the
main challenge as the proposed model only relies on very short HD-sEMG signal
windows (i.e., 50 ms, accounting for only one-sixth of the convention for
real-time myoelectric implementation), boosting agility and responsiveness. Our
proposed model can predict 11 dynamic gestures for 20 subjects with an average
accuracy of over 71% on the testing day, 3-25 days after training. Moreover,
when calibrated on just a small portion of data from the testing day, the
proposed model can achieve over 92% accuracy by retraining less than 10% of the
parameters for computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Recent transportation research suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) have
the potential to improve traffic flow efficiency as they are able to maintain
smaller car-following distances. Nevertheless, being a unique class of ground
robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception
module, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of
collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger
headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over traffic
capacity in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper
proposes an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous
reciprocity between traffic safety and efficiency that arises from robotic
uncertainty in AVs. Car-following scenarios are extensively examined, with
uncertain headway as the key parameter for bridging the single-lane capacity
and the collision probability. A Markov chain is then introduced to describe
the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting expected
collision-inclusive capacity is adopted as the ultimate performance measure for
fully autonomous traffic. With the help of this analytical model, it is
possible to support the settings of critical parameters in AV operations and
incorporate optimization techniques to assist traffic management strategies for
autonomous traffic.

<p class="mathjax">Datacenter capacity is growing exponentially to satisfy the increasing demand
for emerging computationally-intensive applications, such as deep learning.
This trend has led to concerns over datacenters' increasing energy consumption
and carbon footprint. The basic prerequisite for optimizing a datacenter's
energy- and carbon-efficiency is accurately monitoring and attributing energy
consumption to specific users and applications. Since datacenter servers tend
to be multi-tenant, i.e., they host many applications, server- and rack-level
power monitoring alone does not provide insight into their resident
applications' energy usage and carbon emissions. At the same time, current
application-level energy monitoring and attribution techniques are intrusive:
they require privileged access to servers and require coordinated support in
hardware and software, which is not always possible in cloud. To address the
problem, we design WattScope, a system for non-intrusively estimating the power
consumption of individual applications using external measurements of a
server's aggregate power usage without requiring direct access to the server's
operating system or applications. Our key insight is that, based on an analysis
of production traces, the power characteristics of datacenter workloads, e.g.,
low variability, low magnitude, and high periodicity, are highly amenable to
disaggregation of a server's total power consumption into application-specific
values. WattScope adapts and extends a machine learning-based technique for
disaggregating building power and applies it to server- and rack-level power
meter measurements in data centers. We evaluate WattScope's accuracy on a
production workload and show that it yields high accuracy, e.g., often &lt;10%
normalized mean absolute error, and is thus a potentially useful tool for
datacenters in externally monitoring application-level power usage.

<p class="mathjax">After Twitter's ownership change and policy shifts, many users reconsidered
their go-to social media outlets and platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and
Threads became attractive alternatives in the battle for users. Based on the
data from over 16,000 users who migrated to these platforms within the first
eight weeks after the launch of Threads, our study examines: (1) distinguishing
attributes of Twitter users who migrated, compared to non-migrants; (2)
temporal migration patterns and associated challenges for sustainable migration
faced by each platform; and (3) how these new platforms are perceived in
relation to Twitter. Our research proceeds in three stages. First, we examine
migration from a broad perspective, not just one-to-one migration. Second, we
leverage behavioral analysis to pinpoint the distinct migration pattern of each
platform. Last, we employ a large language model (LLM) to discern stances
towards each platform and correlate them with the platform usage. This in-depth
analysis illuminates migration patterns amid competition across social media

instruction-tuned LMs have led to a rise in autonomous AI agents. As the
accessibility of LMs grows, it is imperative that an understanding of their
capabilities, intended usage, and development cycle also improves. Model cards
are a popular practice for documenting detailed information about an ML model.
To automate model card generation, we introduce a dataset of 500
question-answer pairs for 25 ML models that cover crucial aspects of the model,
such as its training configurations, datasets, biases, architecture details,
and training resources. We employ annotators to extract the answers from the
original paper. Further, we explore the capabilities of LMs in generating model
cards by answering questions. Our initial experiments with ChatGPT-3.5, LLaMa,
and Galactica showcase a significant gap in the understanding of research
papers by these aforementioned LMs as well as generating factual textual
responses. We posit that our dataset can be used to train models to automate
the generation of model cards from paper text and reduce human effort in the
model card curation process. The complete dataset is available on

study we introduced a methodology and demonstrated how changes in software can
impact the RUL of software. However, in practical software development,
real-time performance is also influenced by various environmental attributes,

core count and others. This research extends the analysis to assess how changes
in environmental attributes, such as operating system and clock speed, affect
RUL estimation in software. Findings are rigorously validated using real

supports the credibility of the results. The controlled test bed environment
replicates and validates faults from real applications, ensuring a standardized

<p class="mathjax">Performative prediction is a recently proposed framework where predictions
guide decision-making and hence influence future data distributions. Such
performative phenomena are ubiquitous in various areas, such as transportation,
finance, public policy, and recommendation systems. To date, work on
performative prediction has only focused on unconstrained scenarios, neglecting
the fact that many real-world learning problems are subject to constraints.
This paper bridges this gap by studying performative prediction under
inequality constraints. Unlike most existing work that provides only
performative stable points, we aim to find the optimal solutions. Anticipating
performative gradients is a challenging task, due to the agnostic performative
effect on data distributions. To address this issue, we first develop a robust
primal-dual framework that requires only approximate gradients up to a certain
accuracy, yet delivers the same order of performance as the stochastic
primal-dual algorithm without performativity. Based on this framework, we then
propose an adaptive primal-dual algorithm for location families. Our analysis
demonstrates that the proposed adaptive primal-dual algorithm attains
$\ca{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violations, using only $\sqrt{T} + 2T$
samples, where $T$ is the time horizon. To our best knowledge, this is the
first study and analysis on the optimality of the performative prediction
problem under inequality constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our algorithm and theoretical results through numerical simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Neural language models often fail to generate diverse and informative texts,
limiting their applicability in real-world problems. While previous approaches
have proposed to address these issues by identifying and penalizing undesirable
behaviors (e.g., repetition, overuse of frequent words) from language models,
we propose an alternative approach based on an observation: models primarily
learn attributes within examples that are likely to cause degeneration
problems. Based on this observation, we propose a new approach to prevent
degeneration problems by training two models. Specifically, we first train a
model that is designed to amplify undesirable patterns. We then enhance the
diversity of the second model by focusing on patterns that the first model
fails to learn. Extensive experiments on two tasks, namely language modeling
and dialogue generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of predictive methodologies has catalyzed the emergence of
data-driven decision support across various domains. However, developing models
capable of effectively handling input time series data presents an enduring
challenge. This study presents novel preference learning approaches to multiple
criteria sorting problems in the presence of temporal criteria. We first
formulate a convex quadratic programming model characterized by fixed time
discount factors, operating within a regularization framework. Additionally, we
propose an ensemble learning algorithm designed to consolidate the outputs of
multiple, potentially weaker, optimizers, a process executed efficiently
through parallel computation. To enhance scalability and accommodate learnable
time discount factors, we introduce a novel monotonic Recurrent Neural Network
(mRNN). It is designed to capture the evolving dynamics of preferences over
time while upholding critical properties inherent to MCS problems, including
criteria monotonicity, preference independence, and the natural ordering of
classes. The proposed mRNN can describe the preference dynamics by depicting
marginal value functions and personalized time discount factors along with
time, effectively amalgamating the interpretability of traditional MCS methods
with the predictive potential offered by deep preference learning models.
Comprehensive assessments of the proposed models are conducted, encompassing
synthetic data scenarios and a real-case study centered on classifying valuable
users within a mobile gaming app based on their historical in-app behavioral
sequences. Empirical findings underscore the notable performance improvements
achieved by the proposed models when compared to a spectrum of baseline
methods, spanning machine learning, deep learning, and conventional multiple
criteria sorting approaches.

algorithms using a small space budget to solve the frequency estimation, heavy
hitters, frequent items, and top-k approximation in the bounded deletion model.
We define the family of SpaceSaving$\pm$ algorithms and explain why the
original SpaceSaving$\pm$ algorithm only works when insertions and deletions
are not interleaved. Next, we introduce the new DoubleSpaceSaving$\pm$ and the
IntegratedSpaceSaving$\pm$ and prove their correctness. They show similar
characteristics and both extend the popular space-efficient SpaceSaving
algorithm. However, these two algorithms represent different trade-offs, in
which DoubleSpaceSaving$\pm$ distributes the operations to two independent
summaries while Integrated-SpaceSaving$\pm$ fully synchronizes deletions with
insertions. Since data streams are often skewed, we present an improved
analysis of these two algorithms and show that errors do not depend on the hot
items and are only dependent on the cold and warm items. We also demonstrate
how to achieve the relative error guarantee under mild assumptions. Moreover,
we establish that the important mergeability property exists on these two
algorithms which is desirable in distributed settings.

<p class="mathjax">Secure container runtimes serve as the foundational layer for creating and
running containers, which is the bedrock of emerging computing paradigms like
microservices and serverless computing. Although existing secure container
runtimes indeed enhance security via running containers over a guest kernel and
a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM or Hypervisor), they incur performance penalties
in critical areas such as networking, container startup, and I/O system calls.
<br />In our practice of operating microservices and serverless computing, we build
a high-performance secure container runtime named Quark. Unlike existing
solutions that rely on traditional VM technologies by importing Linux for the
guest kernel and QEMU for the VMM, we take a different approach to building
Quark from the ground up, paving the way for extreme customization to unlock
high performance. Our development centers on co-designing a custom guest kernel
and a VMM for secure containers. To this end, we build a lightweight guest OS
kernel named QKernel and a specialized VMM named QVisor. The QKernel-QVisor
codesign allows us to deliver three key advancements: high-performance
RDMA-based container networking, fast container startup mode, and efficient
mechanisms for executing I/O syscalls. In our practice with real-world apps
like Redis, Quark cuts down P95 latency by 79.3% and increases throughput by
2.43x compared to Kata. Moreover, Quark container startup achieves 96.5% lower
latency than the cold-start mode while saving 81.3% memory cost to the
keep-warm mode. Quark is open-source with an industry-standard codebase in
Rust.

a key role but its current assignment process is time-consuming. We introduce
DRG-LLaMA, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on clinical notes for
improved DRG prediction. Using Meta's LLaMA as the base model, we optimized it
with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 236,192 MIMIC-IV discharge summaries. With
an input token length of 512, DRG-LLaMA-7B achieved a macro-averaged F1 score
of 0.327, a top-1 prediction accuracy of 52.0% and a macro-averaged Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.986. Impressively, DRG-LLaMA-7B surpassed previously
reported leading models on this task, demonstrating a relative improvement in
macro-averaged F1 score of 40.3% compared to ClinicalBERT and 35.7% compared to
CAML. When DRG-LLaMA is applied to predict base DRGs and complication or
comorbidity (CC) / major complication or comorbidity (MCC), the top-1
prediction accuracy reached 67.8% for base DRGs and 67.5% for CC/MCC status.
DRG-LLaMA performance exhibits improvements in correlation with larger model
parameters and longer input context lengths. Furthermore, usage of LoRA enables
training even on smaller GPUs with 48 GB of VRAM, highlighting the viability of
adapting LLMs for DRGs prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Contract review is an essential step in construction projects to prevent
potential losses. However, the current methods for reviewing construction
contracts lack effectiveness and reliability, leading to time-consuming and
error-prone processes. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
revolutionizing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle with

presents a novel approach that leverages LLMs with construction contract

tuning-free approach incorporates construction contract domain knowledge to
enhance language models for identifying construction contract risks. The use of
a natural language when building the domain knowledge base facilitates
practical implementation. We evaluated our method on real construction

<p class="mathjax">One of the problems in quantitative finance that has received the most
attention is the portfolio optimization problem. Regarding its solving, this
problem has been approached using different techniques, with those related to
quantum computing being especially prolific in recent years. In this study, we
present a system called Quantum Computing-based System for Portfolio
Optimization with Future Asset Values and Automatic Universe Reduction
(Q4FuturePOP), which deals with the Portfolio Optimization Problem considering
the following innovations: i) the developed tool is modeled for working with
future prediction of assets, instead of historical values; and ii) Q4FuturePOP
includes an automatic universe reduction module, which is conceived to
intelligently reduce the complexity of the problem. We also introduce a brief
discussion about the preliminary performance of the different modules that
compose the prototypical version of Q4FuturePOP.

<p class="mathjax">How to accurately learn task-relevant state representations from
high-dimensional observations with visual distractions is a realistic and
challenging problem in visual reinforcement learning. Recently, unsupervised
representation learning methods based on bisimulation metrics, contrast,
prediction, and reconstruction have shown the ability for task-relevant
information extraction. However, due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms for
the extraction of task information in the prediction, contrast, and
reconstruction-related approaches and the limitations of bisimulation-related
methods in domains with sparse rewards, it is still difficult for these methods
to be effectively extended to environments with distractions. To alleviate
these problems, in the paper, the action sequences, which contain
task-intensive signals, are incorporated into representation learning.
Specifically, we propose a Sequential Action--induced invariant Representation
(SAR) method, in which the encoder is optimized by an auxiliary learner to only
preserve the components that follow the control signals of sequential actions,
so the agent can be induced to learn the robust representation against
distractions. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control suite
tasks with distractions while achieving the best performance over strong
baselines. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at disregarding
task-irrelevant information by deploying SAR to real-world CARLA-based
autonomous driving with natural distractions. Finally, we provide the analysis
results of generalization drawn from the generalization decay and t-SNE
visualization. Code and demo videos are available at

<p class="mathjax">Surface defect inspection is an important task in industrial inspection. Deep
learning-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in this domain.
Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from misjudgment when encountering
challenges such as low-contrast defects and complex backgrounds. To overcome
these issues, we present a decision fusion network (DFNet) that incorporates
the semantic decision with the feature decision to strengthen the decision
ability of the network. In particular, we introduce a decision fusion module
(DFM) that extracts a semantic vector from the semantic decision branch and a
feature vector for the feature decision branch and fuses them to make the final
classification decision. In addition, we propose a perception fine-tuning
module (PFM) that fine-tunes the foreground and background during the
segmentation stage. PFM generates the semantic and feature outputs that are
sent to the classification decision stage. Furthermore, we present an
inner-outer separation weight matrix to address the impact of label edge
uncertainty during segmentation supervision. Our experimental results on the
publicly available datasets including KolektorSDD2 (96.1% AP) and
Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets (94.6% mAP) demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Following the great success of various deep learning methods in image and
object classification, the biomedical image processing society is also
overwhelmed with their applications to various automatic diagnosis cases.
Unfortunately, most of the deep learning-based classification attempts in the
literature solely focus on the aim of extreme accuracy scores, without
considering interpretability, or patient-wise separation of training and test
data. For example, most lung nodule classification papers using deep learning
randomly shuffle data and split it into training, validation, and test sets,
causing certain images from the CT scan of a person to be in the training set,
while other images of the exact same person to be in the validation or testing
image sets. This can result in reporting misleading accuracy rates and the
learning of irrelevant features, ultimately reducing the real-life usability of
these models. When the deep neural networks trained on the traditional, unfair
data shuffling method are challenged with new patient images, it is observed
that the trained models perform poorly. In contrast, deep neural networks
trained with strict patient-level separation maintain their accuracy rates even
when new patient images are tested. Heat-map visualizations of the activations
of the deep neural networks trained with strict patient-level separation
indicate a higher degree of focus on the relevant nodules. We argue that the
research question posed in the title has a positive answer only if the deep
neural networks are trained with images of patients that are strictly isolated
from the validation and testing patient sets.

<p class="mathjax">In open multi-agent environments, the agents may encounter unexpected
teammates. Classical multi-agent learning approaches train agents that can only
coordinate with seen teammates. Recent studies attempted to generate diverse
teammates to enhance the generalizable coordination ability, but were
restricted by pre-defined teammates. In this work, our aim is to train agents
with strong coordination ability by generating teammates that fully cover the
teammate policy space, so that agents can coordinate with any teammates. Since
the teammate policy space is too huge to be enumerated, we find only dissimilar
teammates that are incompatible with controllable agents, which highly reduces
the number of teammates that need to be trained with. However, it is hard to
determine the number of such incompatible teammates beforehand. We therefore
introduce a continual multi-agent learning process, in which the agent learns
to coordinate with different teammates until no more incompatible teammates can
be found. The above idea is implemented in the proposed Macop (Multi-agent
compatible policy learning) algorithm. We conduct experiments in 8 scenarios
from 4 environments that have distinct coordination patterns. Experiments show
that Macop generates training teammates with much lower compatibility than
previous methods. As a result, in all scenarios Macop achieves the best overall
coordination ability while never significantly worse than the baselines,
showing strong generalization ability.

<p class="mathjax">Surface defect inspection is of great importance for industrial manufacture
and production. Though defect inspection methods based on deep learning have
made significant progress, there are still some challenges for these methods,
such as indistinguishable weak defects and defect-like interference in the
background. To address these issues, we propose a transformer network with
multi-stage CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) feature injection for surface
defect segmentation, which is a UNet-like structure named CINFormer. CINFormer
presents a simple yet effective feature integration mechanism that injects the
multi-level CNN features of the input image into different stages of the
transformer network in the encoder. This can maintain the merit of CNN
capturing detailed features and that of transformer depressing noises in the
background, which facilitates accurate defect detection. In addition, CINFormer
presents a Top-K self-attention module to focus on tokens with more important
information about the defects, so as to further reduce the impact of the
redundant background. Extensive experiments conducted on the surface defect
datasets DAGM 2007, Magnetic tile, and NEU show that the proposed CINFormer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in defect detection.

<p class="mathjax">Trading through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has become crucial in today's
blockchain ecosystem, enabling users to swap tokens efficiently and
automatically. However, the capacity of miners to strategically order
transactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks,
sandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for
their own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes
recently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of
transactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price.
Utilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct
sandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.
<br />However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free
profits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal
strategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility
of miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results
unveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally
strategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of
trading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter
represents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.
<br />Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon:
Miner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without
trading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm,
all users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent
or surpass profits compared to their expectations. This outcome provides
further support for the study and design of sequencing rules in decentralized
exchanges.

<p class="mathjax">Surface defect inspection is a very challenging task in which surface defects
usually show weak appearances or exist under complex backgrounds. Most
high-accuracy defect detection methods require expensive computation and
storage overhead, making them less practical in some resource-constrained
defect detection applications. Although some lightweight methods have achieved
real-time inference speed with fewer parameters, they show poor detection
accuracy in complex defect scenarios. To this end, we develop a Global Context
Aggregation Network (GCANet) for lightweight saliency detection of surface
defects on the encoder-decoder structure. First, we introduce a novel
transformer encoder on the top layer of the lightweight backbone, which
captures global context information through a novel Depth-wise Self-Attention
(DSA) module. The proposed DSA performs element-wise similarity in channel
dimension while maintaining linear complexity. In addition, we introduce a
novel Channel Reference Attention (CRA) module before each decoder block to
strengthen the representation of multi-level features in the bottom-up path.
The proposed CRA exploits the channel correlation between features at different
layers to adaptively enhance feature representation. The experimental results
on three public defect datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves
a better trade-off between accuracy and running efficiency compared with other
17 state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, GCANet achieves competitive accuracy
(91.79% $F_{\beta}^{w}$, 93.55% $S_\alpha$, and 97.35% $E_\phi$) on
SD-saliency-900 while running 272fps on a single gpu.

<p class="mathjax">The use of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) through a hash-table has
demonstrated impressive effectiveness and efficiency in characterizing
intricate signals. However, current state-of-the-art methods exhibit
insufficient regularization, often yielding unreliable and noisy results during
interpolations. We find that this issue stems from broken gradient flow between
input coordinates and indexed hash-keys, where the chain rule attempts to model
discrete hash-keys, rather than the continuous coordinates. To tackle this
concern, we introduce RHINO, in which a continuous analytical function is
incorporated to facilitate regularization by connecting the input coordinate
and the network additionally without modifying the architecture of current
hash-based INRs. This connection ensures a seamless backpropagation of
gradients from the network's output back to the input coordinates, thereby
enhancing regularization. Our experimental results not only showcase the
broadened regularization capability across different hash-based INRs like DINER
and Instant NGP, but also across a variety of tasks such as image fitting,
representation of signed distance functions, and optimization of 5D static / 6D
dynamic neural radiance fields. Notably, RHINO outperforms current
state-of-the-art techniques in both quality and speed, affirming its
superiority.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based recommender systems (RSs) have garnered
considerable attention due to their ability to learn optimal recommendation
policies and maximize long-term user rewards. However, deploying RL models
directly in online environments and generating authentic data through A/B tests
can pose challenges and require substantial resources. Simulators offer an
alternative approach by providing training and evaluation environments for RS
models, reducing reliance on real-world data. Existing simulators have shown
promising results but also have limitations such as simplified user feedback,
lacking consistency with real-world data, the challenge of simulator
evaluation, and difficulties in migration and expansion across RSs. To address
these challenges, we propose KuaiSim, a comprehensive user environment that
provides user feedback with multi-behavior and cross-session responses. The
resulting simulator can support three levels of recommendation problems: the
request level list-wise recommendation task, the whole-session level sequential
recommendation task, and the cross-session level retention optimization task.
For each task, KuaiSim also provides evaluation protocols and baseline
recommendation algorithms that further serve as benchmarks for future research.
We also restructure existing competitive simulators on the KuaiRand Dataset and
compare them against KuaiSim to future assess their performance and behavioral
differences. Furthermore, to showcase KuaiSim's flexibility in accommodating
different datasets, we demonstrate its versatility and robustness when
deploying it on the ML-1m dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have highlighted the
potential of sentence embeddings in measuring semantic similarity. Yet, its
application in analyzing real-world dyadic interactions and predicting the
affect of conversational participants remains largely uncharted. To bridge this
gap, the present study utilizes verbal conversations within 50 married couples
talking about conflicts and pleasant activities. Transformer-based model
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 was employed to obtain the embeddings of the utterances from
each speaker. The overall similarity of the conversation was then quantified by
the average cosine similarity between the embeddings of adjacent utterances.
Results showed that semantic similarity had a positive association with wives'
affect during conflict (but not pleasant) conversations. Moreover, this
association was not observed with husbands' affect regardless of conversation
types. Two validation checks further provided support for the validity of the
similarity measure and showed that the observed patterns were not mere
artifacts of data. The present study underscores the potency of sentence
embeddings in understanding the association between interpersonal dynamics and
individual affect, paving the way for innovative applications in affective and
relationship sciences.

<p class="mathjax">The Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism are primary mechanisms in
differential privacy, widely applicable to many scenarios involving numerical
data. However, due to the infinite-range random variables they generate, the
Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms may return values that are semantically
impossible, such as negative numbers. To address this issue, we have designed
the truncated Laplace mechanism and Gaussian mechanism. For a given truncation
interval [a, b], the truncated Gaussian mechanism ensures the same Renyi
Differential Privacy (RDP) as the untruncated mechanism, regardless of the
values chosen for the truncation interval [a, b]. Similarly, the truncated
Laplace mechanism, for specified interval [a, b], maintains the same RDP as the
untruncated mechanism. We provide the RDP expressions for each of them. We
believe that our study can further enhance the utility of differential privacy
in specific applications.

<p class="mathjax">Natural revision seems so natural: it changes beliefs as little as possible
to incorporate new information. Yet, some counterexamples show it wrong. It is
so conservative that it never fully believes. It only believes in the current
conditions. This is right in some cases and wrong in others. Which is which?
The answer requires extending natural revision from simple formulae expressing
universal truths (something holds) to conditionals expressing conditional truth
(something holds in certain conditions). The extension is based on the basic
principles natural revision follows, identified as minimal change, indifference
and naivety: change beliefs as little as possible; equate the likeliness of
scenarios by default; believe all until contradicted. The extension says that
natural revision restricts changes to the current conditions. A comparison with
an unrestricting revision shows what exactly the current conditions are. It is
not what currently considered true if it contradicts the new information. It
includes something more and more unlikely until the new information is at least
possible.

<p class="mathjax">AI-synthesized text and images have gained significant attention,
particularly due to the widespread dissemination of multi-modal manipulations
on the internet, which has resulted in numerous negative impacts on society.
Existing methods for multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding primarily
focus on fusing vision-language features to make predictions, while overlooking
the importance of modality-specific features, leading to sub-optimal results.
In this paper, we construct a simple and novel transformer-based framework for
multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding tasks. Our framework
simultaneously explores modality-specific features while preserving the
capability for multi-modal alignment. To achieve this, we introduce
visual/language pre-trained encoders and dual-branch cross-attention (DCA) to
extract and fuse modality-unique features. Furthermore, we design decoupled
fine-grained classifiers (DFC) to enhance modality-specific feature mining and
mitigate modality competition. Moreover, we propose an implicit manipulation
query (IMQ) that adaptively aggregates global contextual cues within each
modality using learnable queries, thereby improving the discovery of forged
details. Extensive experiments on the $\rm DGM^4$ dataset demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) models offer a powerful nonparametric approach
for Bayesian inference, but exact inference is typically intractable,
motivating the use of various approximations. However, existing approaches,
such as mean-field Gaussian assumptions, limit the expressiveness and efficacy
of DGP models, while stochastic approximation can be computationally expensive.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce Neural Operator Variational Inference
(NOVI) for Deep Gaussian Processes. NOVI uses a neural generator to obtain a
sampler and minimizes the Regularized Stein Discrepancy in L2 space between the
generated distribution and true posterior. We solve the minimax problem using
Monte Carlo estimation and subsampling stochastic optimization techniques. We
demonstrate that the bias introduced by our method can be controlled by
multiplying the Fisher divergence with a constant, which leads to robust error
control and ensures the stability and precision of the algorithm. Our
experiments on datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands demonstrate
the effectiveness and the faster convergence rate of the proposed method. We
achieve a classification accuracy of 93.56 on the CIFAR10 dataset,
outperforming SOTA Gaussian process methods. Furthermore, our method guarantees
theoretically controlled prediction error for DGP models and demonstrates
remarkable performance on various datasets. We are optimistic that NOVI has the
potential to enhance the performance of deep Bayesian nonparametric models and
could have significant implications for various practical applications

<p class="mathjax">Online updating of time series forecasting models aims to address the concept
drifting problem by efficiently updating forecasting models based on streaming
data. Many algorithms are designed for online time series forecasting, with
some exploiting cross-variable dependency while others assume independence
among variables. Given every data assumption has its own pros and cons in
online time series modeling, we propose \textbf{On}line \textbf{e}nsembling
\textbf{Net}work (OneNet). It dynamically updates and combines two models, with
one focusing on modeling the dependency across the time dimension and the other
on cross-variate dependency. Our method incorporates a reinforcement
learning-based approach into the traditional online convex programming
framework, allowing for the linear combination of the two models with
dynamically adjusted weights. OneNet addresses the main shortcoming of
classical online learning methods that tend to be slow in adapting to the
concept drift. Empirical results show that OneNet reduces online forecasting
error by more than $\mathbf{50\%}$ compared to the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
method. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/yfzhang114/OneNet}.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional cluster designs were originally server-centric, and have evolved
recently to support hardware acceleration and storage disaggregation. In
applications that leverage acceleration, the server CPU performs the role of
orchestrating computation and data movement and data-intensive applications
stress the memory bandwidth. Applications that leverage disaggregation can be
adversely affected by the increased PCIe and network bandwidth resulting from
disaggregation. In this paper, we advocate for a specialized cluster design for
important data intensive applications, such as analytics, query processing and
ML training. This design, Lovelock, replaces each server in a cluster with one
or more headless smart NICs. Because smart NICs are significantly cheaper than
servers on bandwidth, the resulting cluster can run these applications without
adversely impacting performance, while obtaining cost and energy savings.

<p class="mathjax">We present results from a preregistered and crowdsourced user study where we
asked members of the general population to determine whether two samples
represented using different forms of data visualizations are drawn from the
same or different populations. Such a task reduces to assessing whether the
overlap between the two visualized samples is large enough to suggest similar
or different origins. When using idealized normal curves fitted on the samples,
it is essentially a graphical formulation of the classic Student's t-test.
However, we speculate that using more sophisticated visual representations,
such as bar histograms, Wilkinson dot plots, strip plots, or Tukey boxplots
will both allow people to be more accurate at this task as well as better
understand its meaning. In other words, the purpose of our study is to explore
which visualization best scaffolds novices in making graphical inferences about
data. However, our results indicate that the more abstracted idealized bell

suitable for many marine applications and the ocean scientific community,
encompassing several domains such as augmented reality, mapping, motion
estimation, visual surveillance, and simultaneous localization and mapping.
However, designing and constructing such a high-quality 360$^{\circ}$ real-time
streaming camera system for underwater applications is a challenging problem
due to the technical complexity in several aspects including sensor resolution,
wide field of view, power supply, optical design, system calibration, and
overheating management. This paper presents a novel and comprehensive system
that addresses the complexities associated with the design, construction, and
implementation of a fully functional 360$^{\circ}$ real-time streaming camera
system specifically tailored for underwater environments. Our proposed system,
UWA360CAM, can stream video in real time, operate in 24/7, and capture
360$^{\circ}$ underwater panorama images. Notably, our work is the pioneering
effort in providing a detailed and replicable account of this system. The
experiments provide a comprehensive analysis of our proposed system.

<p class="mathjax">Answering numerical questions over hybrid contents from the given tables and
text(TextTableQA) is a challenging task. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have gained significant attention in the NLP community. With the emergence of
large language models, In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting have
become two particularly popular research topics in this field. In this paper,
we introduce a new prompting strategy called Hybrid prompt strategy and
Retrieval of Thought for TextTableQA. Through In-Context Learning, we prompt
the model to develop the ability of retrieval thinking when dealing with hybrid
data. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the fully-supervised
SOTA on the MultiHiertt dataset in the few-shot setting.

<p class="mathjax">Designing and deriving effective model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL)
algorithms with a performance improvement guarantee is challenging, mainly
attributed to the high coupling between model learning and policy optimization.
Many prior methods that rely on return discrepancy to guide model learning
ignore the impacts of model shift, which can lead to performance deterioration
due to excessive model updates. Other methods use performance difference bound
to explicitly consider model shift. However, these methods rely on a fixed
threshold to constrain model shift, resulting in a heavy dependence on the
threshold and a lack of adaptability during the training process. In this
paper, we theoretically derive an optimization objective that can unify model
shift and model bias and then formulate a fine-tuning process. This process
adaptively adjusts the model updates to get a performance improvement guarantee
while avoiding model overfitting. Based on these, we develop a straightforward
algorithm USB-PO (Unified model Shift and model Bias Policy Optimization).
Empirical results show that USB-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on
several challenging benchmark tasks.

<p class="mathjax">It is challenging to build a multi-singer high-fidelity singing voice
synthesis system with cross-lingual ability by only using monolingual singers
in the training stage. In this paper, we propose CrossSinger, which is a
cross-lingual singing voice synthesizer based on Xiaoicesing2. Specifically, we
utilize International Phonetic Alphabet to unify the representation for all
languages of the training data. Moreover, we leverage conditional layer
normalization to incorporate the language information into the model for better
pronunciation when singers meet unseen languages. Additionally, gradient
reversal layer (GRL) is utilized to remove singer biases included in lyrics
since all singers are monolingual, which indicates singer's identity is
implicitly associated with the text. The experiment is conducted on a
combination of three singing voice datasets containing Japanese Kiritan
dataset, English NUS-48E dataset, and one internal Chinese dataset. The result
shows CrossSinger can synthesize high-fidelity songs for various singers with
cross-lingual ability, including code-switch cases.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the sparse modern Hopfield model as a sparse extension of the
modern Hopfield model. Like its dense counterpart, the sparse modern Hopfield
model equips a memory-retrieval dynamics whose one-step approximation
corresponds to the sparse attention mechanism. Theoretically, our key
contribution is a principled derivation of a closed-form sparse Hopfield energy
using the convex conjugate of the sparse entropic regularizer. Building upon
this, we derive the sparse memory retrieval dynamics from the sparse energy
function and show its one-step approximation is equivalent to the
sparse-structured attention. Importantly, we provide a sparsity-dependent
memory retrieval error bound which is provably tighter than its dense analog.
The conditions for the benefits of sparsity to arise are therefore identified
and discussed. In addition, we show that the sparse modern Hopfield model
maintains the robust theoretical properties of its dense counterpart, including
rapid fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity. Empirically, we
use both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the sparse
Hopfield model outperforms its dense counterpart in many situations.

<p class="mathjax">Neural language models have exhibited outstanding performance in a range of
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding the extent
to which these models internalize syntactic knowledge, so that various datasets
have recently been constructed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language
models across languages. In this paper, we introduce JCoLA (Japanese Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability), which consists of 10,020 sentences annotated with
binary acceptability judgments. Specifically, those sentences are manually
extracted from linguistics textbooks, handbooks and journal articles, and split
into in-domain data (86 %; relatively simple acceptability judgments extracted
from textbooks and handbooks) and out-of-domain data (14 %; theoretically
significant acceptability judgments extracted from journal articles), the
latter of which is categorized by 12 linguistic phenomena. We then evaluate the
syntactic knowledge of 9 different types of Japanese language models on JCoLA.
The results demonstrated that several models could surpass human performance
for the in-domain data, while no models were able to exceed human performance
for the out-of-domain data. Error analyses by linguistic phenomena further
revealed that although neural language models are adept at handling local
syntactic dependencies like argument structure, their performance wanes when
confronted with long-distance syntactic dependencies like verbal agreement and
NPI licensing.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding trajectory diversity is a fundamental aspect of addressing
practical traffic tasks. However, capturing the diversity of trajectories
presents challenges, particularly with traditional machine learning and
recurrent neural networks due to the requirement of large-scale parameters. The
emerging Transformer technology, renowned for its parallel computation
capabilities enabling the utilization of models with hundreds of millions of
parameters, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply the
Transformer architecture to traffic tasks, aiming to learn the diversity of
trajectories within vehicle populations. We analyze the Transformer's attention
mechanism and its adaptability to the goals of traffic tasks, and subsequently,
design specific pre-training tasks. To achieve this, we create a data structure
tailored to the attention mechanism and introduce a set of noises that
correspond to spatio-temporal demands, which are incorporated into the
structured data during the pre-training process. The designed pre-training
model demonstrates excellent performance in capturing the spatial distribution
of the vehicle population, with no instances of vehicle overlap and an RMSE of
0.6059 when compared to the ground truth values. In the context of time series
prediction, approximately 95% of the predicted trajectories' speeds closely
align with the true speeds, within a deviation of 7.5144m/s. Furthermore, in
the stability test, the model exhibits robustness by continuously predicting a
time series ten times longer than the input sequence, delivering smooth
trajectories and showcasing diverse driving behaviors. The pre-trained model
also provides a good basis for downstream fine-tuning tasks. The number of
parameters of our model is over 50 million.

<p class="mathjax">Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a new air transportation system for passengers
and cargo in urban environments, enabled by new technologies and integrated
into multimodal transportation systems. The vision of UAM comprises the mass
use in urban and suburban environments, complementing existing transportation
systems and contributing to the decarbonization of the transport sector.
Initial attempts to create a market for urban air transportation in the last
century failed due to lack of profitability and community acceptance.
Technological advances in numerous fields over the past few decades have led to
a renewed interest in urban air transportation. UAM is expected to benefit
users and to also have a positive impact on the economy by creating new markets
and employment opportunities for manufacturing and operation of UAM vehicles
and the construction of related ground infrastructure. However, there are also
concerns about noise, safety and security, privacy and environmental impacts.
Therefore, the UAM system needs to be designed carefully to become safe,
affordable, accessible, environmentally friendly, economically viable and thus
sustainable. This paper provides an overview of selected key research topics
related to UAM and how the German Aerospace Center (DLR) contributed to this
research in the project "HorizonUAM - Urban Air Mobility Research at the German
Aerospace Center (DLR)". Selected research results that support the realization
of the UAM vision are briefly presented.

<p class="mathjax">Statisticians are not only one of the earliest professional adopters of data
visualization, but also some of its most prolific users. Understanding how
these professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process
may shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results
from an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years
average in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in
their daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical
processes; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent
statistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential
statistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and
finally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed
interview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving
thematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit.
The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make
extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just
when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to
be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous
thinking. The latter suggests that a multi-faceted visual display of
inferential statistics that includes a visual indicator of analytically
important effect sizes may help to balance the attributed epistemic power of
traditional statistical testing with an awareness of the uncertainty of
sensemaking.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate calibration is crucial for using multiple cameras to triangulate the
position of objects precisely. However, it is also a time-consuming process
that needs to be repeated for every displacement of the cameras. The standard
approach is to use a printed pattern with known geometry to estimate the
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. The same idea can be applied
to event-based cameras, though it requires extra work. By using frame
reconstruction from events, a printed pattern can be detected. A blinking
pattern can also be displayed on a screen. Then, the pattern can be directly
detected from the events. Such calibration methods can provide accurate
intrinsic calibration for both frame- and event-based cameras. However, using
2D patterns has several limitations for multi-camera extrinsic calibration,
with cameras possessing highly different points of view and a wide baseline.
The 2D pattern can only be detected from one direction and needs to be of
significant size to compensate for its distance to the camera. This makes the
extrinsic calibration time-consuming and cumbersome. To overcome these
limitations, we propose eWand, a new method that uses blinking LEDs inside
opaque spheres instead of a printed or displayed pattern. Our method provides a
faster, easier-to-use extrinsic calibration approach that maintains high
accuracy for both event- and frame-based cameras.

<p class="mathjax">Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications are widely
recognized as a promising candidate for the next-generation air interface. With
holographic MIMO surface, the number of the spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs)
considerably increases and also significantly varies as the user moves. To
fully employ the large and varying number of spatial DoFs, the number of
equipped RF chains has to be larger than or equal to the largest number of
spatial DoFs. However, this causes much waste as radio frequency (RF) chains
(especially the transmit RF chains) are costly and power-hungry. To avoid the
heavy burden, this paper investigates green holographic MIMO communications
with a few transmit RF chains under an electromagnetic-based communication
model. We not only look at the fundamental capacity limits but also propose an
effective transmission, namely non-uniform holographic pattern modulation
(NUHPM), to achieve the capacity limit in the high signal-to-noise (SNR)
regime. The analytical result sheds light on the green evaluation of MIMO
communications, which can be realized by increasing the size of the antenna
aperture without increasing the number of transmit RF chains. Numerical results
are provided to verify our analysis and to show the great performance gain by
employing the additional spatial DoFs as modulation resources.

<p class="mathjax">Mixup is an effective data augmentation method that generates new augmented
samples by aggregating linear combinations of different original samples.
However, if there are noises or aberrant features in the original samples,
Mixup may propagate them to the augmented samples, leading to over-sensitivity
of the model to these outliers . To solve this problem, this paper proposes a
new Mixup method called AMPLIFY. This method uses the Attention mechanism of
Transformer itself to reduce the influence of noises and aberrant values in the
original samples on the prediction results, without increasing additional
trainable parameters, and the computational cost is very low, thereby avoiding
the problem of high resource consumption in common Mixup methods such as
Sentence Mixup . The experimental results show that, under a smaller
computational resource cost, AMPLIFY outperforms other Mixup methods in text
classification tasks on 7 benchmark datasets, providing new ideas and new ways
to further improve the performance of pre-trained models based on the Attention
mechanism, such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT. Our code can be obtained at

<p class="mathjax">Enriching the robot representation of the operational environment is a
challenging task that aims at bridging the gap between low-level sensor
readings and high-level semantic understanding. Having a rich representation
often requires computationally demanding architectures and pure point cloud
based detection systems that struggle when dealing with everyday objects that
have to be handled by the robot. To overcome these issues, we propose a
graph-based representation that addresses this gap by providing a semantic
representation of robot environments from multiple sources. In fact, to acquire
information from the environment, the framework combines classical computer
vision tools with modern computer vision cloud services, ensuring computational
feasibility on onboard hardware. By incorporating an ontology hierarchy with
over 800 object classes, the framework achieves cross-domain adaptability,
eliminating the need for environment-specific tools. The proposed approach
allows us to handle also small objects and integrate them into the semantic
representation of the environment. The approach is implemented in the Robot
Operating System (ROS) using the RViz visualizer for environment
representation. This work is a first step towards the development of a
general-purpose framework, to facilitate intuitive interaction and navigation
across different domains.

<p class="mathjax">Temporal graphs offer more accurate modeling of many real-world scenarios
than static graphs. However, neighbor aggregation, a critical building block of
graph networks, for temporal graphs, is currently straightforwardly extended
from that of static graphs. It can be computationally expensive when involving
all historical neighbors during such aggregation. In practice, typically only a
subset of the most recent neighbors are involved. However, such subsampling
leads to incomplete and biased neighbor information. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework for temporal neighbor aggregation that
uses the recurrent neural network with node-wise hidden states to integrate
information from all historical neighbors for each node to acquire the complete
neighbor information. We demonstrate the superior theoretical expressiveness of
the proposed framework as well as its state-of-the-art performance in
real-world applications. Notably, it achieves a significant +9.6% improvement
on averaged precision in a real-world Ecommerce dataset over existing methods
on 2-layer models.

<p class="mathjax">Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning is challenging due to the coupling
effect of both distribution shift issue common in offline setting and the high
dimension issue common in multi-agent setting, making the action
out-of-distribution (OOD) and value overestimation phenomenon excessively
severe. Tomitigate this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent offline RL
algorithm, named CounterFactual Conservative Q-Learning (CFCQL) to conduct
conservative value estimation. Rather than regarding all the agents as a high
dimensional single one and directly applying single agent methods to it, CFCQL
calculates conservative regularization for each agent separately in a
counterfactual way and then linearly combines them to realize an overall
conservative value estimation. We prove that it still enjoys the
underestimation property and the performance guarantee as those single agent
conservative methods do, but the induced regularization and safe policy
improvement bound are independent of the agent number, which is therefore
theoretically superior to the direct treatment referred to above, especially
when the agent number is large. We further conduct experiments on four
environments including both discrete and continuous action settings on both
existing and our man-made datasets, demonstrating that CFCQL outperforms
existing methods on most datasets and even with a remarkable margin on some of
them.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic similarity between natural language texts is typically measured
either by looking at the overlap between subsequences (e.g., BLEU) or by using
embeddings (e.g., BERTScore, S-BERT). Within this paper, we argue that when we
are only interested in measuring the semantic similarity, it is better to
directly predict the similarity using a fine-tuned model for such a task. Using
a fine-tuned model for the STS-B from the GLUE benchmark, we define the
STSScore approach and show that the resulting similarity is better aligned with
our expectations on a robust semantic similarity measure than other approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing methods for unsupervised industrial anomaly detection train a
separate model for each object category. This kind of approach can easily
capture the category-specific feature distributions, but results in high
storage cost and low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified
mixed-attention auto encoder (MAAE) to implement multi-class anomaly detection
with a single model. To alleviate the performance degradation due to the
diverse distribution patterns of different categories, we employ spatial
attentions and channel attentions to effectively capture the global category
information and model the feature distributions of multiple classes.
Furthermore, to simulate the realistic noises on features and preserve the
surface semantics of objects from different categories which are essential for
detecting the subtle anomalies, we propose an adaptive noise generator and a
multi-scale fusion module for the pre-trained features. MAAE delivers
remarkable performances on the benchmark dataset compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Decision trees are known to be intrinsically interpretable as they can be
inspected and interpreted by humans. Furthermore, recent hardware advances have
rekindled an interest for optimal decision tree algorithms, that produce more
accurate trees than the usual greedy approaches. However, these optimal
algorithms return a single tree optimizing a hand defined
interpretability-performance trade-off, obtained by specifying a maximum number
of decision nodes, giving no further insights about the quality of this
trade-off. In this paper, we propose a new Markov Decision Problem (MDP)
formulation for finding optimal decision trees. The main interest of this
formulation is that we can compute the optimal decision trees for several
interpretability-performance trade-offs by solving a single dynamic program,
letting the user choose a posteriori the tree that best suits their needs.
Empirically, we show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art
algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime while returning a whole set of
trees on the interpretability-performance Pareto front.

<p class="mathjax">Noisy multi-label learning has garnered increasing attention due to the
challenges posed by collecting large-scale accurate labels, making noisy labels
a more practical alternative. Motivated by noisy multi-class learning, the
introduction of transition matrices can help model multi-label noise and enable
the development of statistically consistent algorithms for noisy multi-label
learning. However, estimating multi-label noise transition matrices remains a
challenging task, as most existing estimators in noisy multi-class learning
rely on anchor points and accurate fitting of noisy class posteriors, which is
hard to satisfy in noisy multi-label learning. In this paper, we address this
problem by first investigating the identifiability of class-dependent
transition matrices in noisy multi-label learning. Building upon the
identifiability results, we propose a novel estimator that leverages label
correlations without the need for anchor points or precise fitting of noisy
class posteriors. Specifically, we first estimate the occurrence probability of
two noisy labels to capture noisy label correlations. Subsequently, we employ
sample selection techniques to extract information implying clean label
correlations, which are then used to estimate the occurrence probability of one
noisy label when a certain clean label appears. By exploiting the mismatches in
label correlations implied by these occurrence probabilities, we demonstrate
that the transition matrix becomes identifiable and can be acquired by solving
a bilinear decomposition problem. Theoretically, we establish an estimation
error bound for our multi-label transition matrix estimator and derive a
generalization error bound for our statistically consistent algorithm.
Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our estimator in estimating
multi-label noise transition matrices, leading to excellent classification
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to jointly generate space occupancies
and semantic labels for complex 3D scenes. Most existing SSC models focus on
volumetric representations, which are memory-inefficient for large outdoor

introduce PointSSC, the first cooperative vehicle-infrastructure point cloud

leveraging Segment Anything to efficiently assign semantics. To benchmark
progress, we propose a LiDAR-based model with a Spatial-Aware Transformer for

<p class="mathjax">The need for high throughput and censorship resistance in blockchain
technology has led to research on DAG-based consensus. The Sui blockchain
protocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower
latency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when
candidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by
Carousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike
Carousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in
mind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly
provided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might
commit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our
implementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless
setting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase
when suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults).

<p class="mathjax">Cuttlefish addresses several limitations of existing consensus-less and
consensus-minimized decentralized ledgers, including restricted programmability
and the risk of deadlocked assets. The key insight of Cuttlefish is that
consensus in blockchains is necessary due to contention, rather than multiple
owners of an asset as suggested by prior work. Previous proposals proactively
use consensus to prevent contention from blocking assets, taking a pessimistic
approach. In contrast, Cuttlefish introduces collective objects and multi-owner
transactions that can offer most of the functionality of classic blockchains
when objects transacted on are not under contention. Additionally, in case of
contention, Cuttlefish proposes a novel `Unlock' protocol that significantly
reduces the latency of unblocking contented objects. By leveraging these
features, Cuttlefish implements consensus-less protocols for a broader range of
transactions, including asset swaps and multi-signature transactions, which
were previously believed to require consensus.

<p class="mathjax">Solving real-world complex tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) without
high-fidelity simulation environments or large amounts of offline data can be
quite challenging. Online RL agents trained in imperfect simulation
environments can suffer from severe sim-to-real issues. Offline RL approaches
although bypass the need for simulators, often pose demanding requirements on
the size and quality of the offline datasets. The recently emerged hybrid
offline-and-online RL provides an attractive framework that enables joint use
of limited offline data and imperfect simulator for transferable policy
learning. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, called H2O+, which offers
great flexibility to bridge various choices of offline and online learning
methods, while also accounting for dynamics gaps between the real and
simulation environment. Through extensive simulation and real-world robotics
experiments, we demonstrate superior performance and flexibility over advanced
cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a Transformer-based image compression system that allows
for a variable image quality objective according to the user's preference.
Optimizing a learned codec for different quality objectives leads to
reconstructed images with varying visual characteristics. Our method provides
the user with the flexibility to choose a trade-off between two image quality
objectives using a single, shared model. Motivated by the success of
prompt-tuning techniques, we introduce prompt tokens to condition our
Transformer-based autoencoder. These prompt tokens are generated adaptively
based on the user's preference and input image through learning a prompt
generation network. Extensive experiments on commonly used quality metrics
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting the encoding and/or
decoding processes to a variable quality objective. While offering the
additional flexibility, our proposed method performs comparably to the
single-objective methods in terms of rate-distortion performance.

<p class="mathjax">In the very last years, cybersecurity attacks have increased at an
unprecedented pace, becoming ever more sophisticated and costly. Their impact
has involved both private/public companies and critical infrastructures. At the
same time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the security perimeters of many
organizations expanded, causing an increase of the attack surface exploitable
by threat actors through malware and phishing attacks. Given these factors, it
is of primary importance to monitor the security perimeter and the events
occurring in the monitored network, according to a tested security strategy of
detection and response. In this paper, we present a protocol tunneling detector
prototype which inspects, in near real time, a company's network traffic using
machine learning techniques. Indeed, tunneling attacks allow malicious actors
to maximize the time in which their activity remains undetected. The detector
monitors unencrypted network flows and extracts features to detect possible
occurring attacks and anomalies, by combining machine learning and deep
learning. The proposed module can be embedded in any network security
monitoring platform able to provide network flow information along with its
metadata. The detection capabilities of the implemented prototype have been
tested both on benign and malicious datasets. Results show 97.1% overall
accuracy and an F1-score equals to 95.6%.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of a feedforward controller is primarily determined by the
extent to which it can capture the relevant dynamics of a system. The aim of
this paper is to develop an input-output linear parameter-varying (LPV)
feedforward parameterization and a corresponding data-driven estimation method
in which the dependency of the coefficients on the scheduling signal are
learned by a neural network. The use of a neural network enables the
parameterization to compensate a wide class of constant relative degree LPV
systems. Efficient optimization of the neural-network-based controller is
achieved through a Levenberg-Marquardt approach with analytic gradients and a
pseudolinear approach generalizing Sanathanan-Koerner to the LPV case. The
performance of the developed feedforward learning method is validated in a
simulation study of an LPV system showing excellent performance.

<p class="mathjax">Graph-based collaborative filtering has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
delivering personalized recommendations. Despite their demonstrated
effectiveness, these methods often neglect the underlying intents of users,
which constitute a pivotal facet of comprehensive user interests. Consequently,
a series of approaches have arisen to tackle this limitation by introducing
independent intent representations. However, these approaches fail to capture
the intricate relationships between intents of different users and the
compatibility between user intents and item properties.
<br />To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel method, named uniformly
co-clustered intent modeling. Specifically, we devise a uniformly contrastive
intent modeling module to bring together the embeddings of users with similar
intents and items with similar properties. This module aims to model the
nuanced relations between intents of different users and properties of
different items, especially those unreachable to each other on the user-item
graph. To model the compatibility between user intents and item properties, we
design the user-item co-clustering module, maximizing the mutual information of
co-clusters of users and items. This approach is substantiated through
theoretical validation, establishing its efficacy in modeling compatibility to
enhance the mutual information between user and item representations.
Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have had a huge impact on society due to their
impressive capabilities and vast knowledge of the world. Various applications
and tools have been created that allow users to interact with these models in a
black-box scenario. However, one limitation of this scenario is that users
cannot modify the internal knowledge of the model, and the only way to add or
modify internal knowledge is by explicitly mentioning it to the model during
the current interaction. This learning process is called in-context training,
and it refers to training that is confined to the user's current session or
context. In-context learning has significant applications, but also has
limitations that are seldom studied. In this paper, we present a study that
shows how the model can suffer from interference between information that
continually flows in the context, causing it to forget previously learned
knowledge, which can reduce the model's performance. Along with showing the
problem, we propose an evaluation benchmark based on the bAbI dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The prevalence of coordinated information campaigns in social media platforms
has significant negative consequences across various domains, including social,
political, and economic processes. This paper proposes a multifaceted framework
for detecting and analysing coordinated message promotion on social media. By
simultaneously considering features related to content, time, and network
dimensions, our framework can capture the diverse nature of coordinated
activity and identify anomalous user accounts who likely engaged in suspicious
behaviour. Unlike existing solutions that rely on specific constraints, our
approach is more flexible as it employs specialised components to extract the
significant structures within a network and to detect the most unusual
interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using two
Twitter datasets, the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), and long-term
discussions on Data Science topics. The results demonstrate our framework's
ability to isolate unusual activity from expected normal behaviour and provide
valuable insights for further qualitative investigation.

is considered the most potent Large Language Model from Openai. In this paper,
we examine GPT3.5 and GPT4 as coding assistants. More specifically, we have
constructed appropriate tests to check whether the two systems can a) answer
typical questions that can arise during the code development, b) produce
reliable code, and c) contribute to code debugging. The test results are
impressive. The performance of GPT4 is outstanding and signals an increase in

<p class="mathjax">We develop a general and practical framework to address the problem of the
optimal design of dynamic fee mechanisms for multiple blockchain resources. Our
framework allows to compute policies that optimally trade-off between adjusting
resource prices to handle persistent demand shifts versus being robust to local
noise in the observed block demand. In the general case with more than one
resource, our optimal policies correctly handle cross-effects (complementarity
and substitutability) in resource demands. We also show how these cross-effects
can be used to inform resource design, i.e. combining resources into bundles
that have low demand-side cross-effects can yield simpler and more efficient
price-update rules. Our framework is also practical, we demonstrate how it can
be used to refine or inform the design of heuristic fee update rules such as
EIP-1559 or EIP-4844 with two case studies. We then estimate a uni-dimensional
version of our model using real market data from the Ethereum blockchain and
empirically compare the performance of our optimal policies to EIP-1559.

<p class="mathjax">Domain Adaptation (DA) is always challenged by the spurious correlation
between domain-invariant features (e.g., class identity) and domain-specific
features (e.g., environment) that does not generalize to the target domain.
Unfortunately, even enriched with additional unsupervised target domains,
existing Unsupervised DA (UDA) methods still suffer from it. This is because
the source domain supervision only considers the target domain samples as
auxiliary data (e.g., by pseudo-labeling), yet the inherent distribution in the
target domain -- where the valuable de-correlation clues hide -- is
disregarded. We propose to make the U in UDA matter by giving equal status to
the two domains. Specifically, we learn an invariant classifier whose
prediction is simultaneously consistent with the labels in the source domain
and clusters in the target domain, hence the spurious correlation inconsistent
in the target domain is removed. We dub our approach "Invariant CONsistency
learning" (ICON). Extensive experiments show that ICON achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the classic UDA benchmarks: Office-Home and
VisDA-2017, and outperforms all the conventional methods on the challenging
WILDS 2.0 benchmark. Codes are in https://github.com/yue-zhongqi/ICON.

<p class="mathjax">The operational environments in which a mobile robot executes its missions
often exhibit non-flat terrain characteristics, encompassing outdoor and indoor
settings featuring ramps and slopes. In such scenarios, the conventional
methodologies employed for localization encounter novel challenges and
limitations. This study delineates a localization framework incorporating
ground elevation and inclination considerations, deviating from traditional 2D
localization paradigms that may falter in such contexts. In our proposed
approach, the map encompasses elevation and spatial occupancy information,
employing Gridmaps and Octomaps. At the same time, the perception model is
designed to accommodate the robot's inclined orientation and the potential
presence of ground as an obstacle, besides usual structural and dynamic
obstacles. We have developed and rigorously validated our approach within Nav2,
and esteemed open-source framework renowned for robot navigation. Our findings
demonstrate that our methodology represents a viable and effective alternative
for mobile robots operating in challenging outdoor environments or intrincate
terrains.

<p class="mathjax">Renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to decarbonize
hard-to-electrify sectors that rely on liquid or gaseous fuels, such as
long-haul shipping. The EU's Delegated Act on RFNBOs defines renewable hydrogen
by considering rules on additionality as well as temporal and geographical
correlation of the electricity used. For a Danish case study, we examine the
impact on the capacity expansion problem of an energy hub producing renewable
hydrogen, e-methanol, and e-ammonia using a mixed-integer linear problem
formulation. We analyze the investments in production capacity, storage assets,
and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) volume under different fuel price
assumptions for 2030. We find that e-methanol (combined with limited storage to
secure hydrogen supply to the synthesizer) provides the best business case with
a PPA volume based on the maximum allowed electrolyzer size.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) has become a popular tool in the industrial sector as
it helps to improve operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. However,
deploying and managing ML models in production environments can be complex.
This is where Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) comes in. MLOps aims to
streamline this deployment and management process. One of the remaining MLOps
challenges is the need for explanations. These explanations are essential for
understanding how ML models reason, which is key to trust and acceptance.
Better identification of errors and improved model accuracy are only two
resulting advantages. An often neglected fact is that deployed models are
bypassed in practice when accuracy and especially explainability do not meet
user expectations. We developed a novel MLOps software architecture to address
the challenge of integrating explanations and feedback capabilities into the ML
development and deployment processes. In the project EXPLAIN, our architecture
is implemented in a series of industrial use cases. The proposed MLOps software
architecture has several advantages. It provides an efficient way to manage ML
models in production environments. Further, it allows for integrating
explanations into the development and deployment processes.

<p class="mathjax">While image data starts to enjoy the simple-but-effective self-supervised
learning scheme built upon masking and self-reconstruction objective thanks to
the introduction of tokenization procedure and vision transformer backbone,
convolutional neural networks as another important and widely-adopted
architecture for image data, though having contrastive-learning techniques to
drive the self-supervised learning, still face the difficulty of leveraging
such straightforward and general masking operation to benefit their learning
process significantly. In this work, we aim to alleviate the burden of
including masking operation into the contrastive-learning framework for
convolutional neural networks as an extra augmentation method. In addition to
the additive but unwanted edges (between masked and unmasked regions) as well
as other adverse effects caused by the masking operations for ConvNets, which
have been discussed by prior works, we particularly identify the potential
problem where for one view in a contrastive sample-pair the randomly-sampled
masking regions could be overly concentrated on important/salient objects thus
resulting in misleading contrastiveness to the other view. To this end, we
propose to explicitly take the saliency constraint into consideration in which
the masked regions are more evenly distributed among the foreground and
background for realizing the masking-based augmentation. Moreover, we introduce
hard negative samples by masking larger regions of salient patches in an input
image. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets, contrastive
learning mechanisms, and downstream tasks well verify the efficacy as well as
the superior performance of our proposed method with respect to several
state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Video analysis is a major computer vision task that has received a lot of
attention in recent years. The current state-of-the-art performance for video
analysis is achieved with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have high
computational costs and need large amounts of labeled data for training.
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have significantly lower computational costs
(thousands of times) than regular non-spiking networks when implemented on
neuromorphic hardware. They have been used for video analysis with methods like
3D Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (3D CSNNs). However, these networks
have a significantly larger number of parameters compared with spiking 2D CSNN.
This, not only increases the computational costs, but also makes these networks
more difficult to implement with neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we use
CSNNs trained in an unsupervised manner with the Spike Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) rule, and we introduce, for the first time, Spiking Separated
Spatial and Temporal Convolutions (S3TCs) for the sake of reducing the number
of parameters required for video analysis. This unsupervised learning has the
advantage of not needing large amounts of labeled data for training.
Factorizing a single spatio-temporal spiking convolution into a spatial and a
temporal spiking convolution decreases the number of parameters of the network.
We test our network with the KTH, Weizmann, and IXMAS datasets, and we show
that S3TCs successfully extract spatio-temporal information from videos, while
increasing the output spiking activity, and outperforming spiking 3D
convolutions.

<p class="mathjax">Coordinated multi-platform information operations are implemented in a
variety of contexts on social media, including state-run disinformation
campaigns, marketing strategies, and social activism. Characterized by the
promotion of messages via multi-platform coordination, in which multiple user
accounts, within a short time, post content advancing a shared informational
agenda on multiple platforms, they contribute to an already confusing and
manipulated information ecosystem. To make things worse, reliable datasets that
contain ground truth information about such operations are virtually
nonexistent. This paper presents a multi-modal approach that identifies the
social media messages potentially engaged in a coordinated information campaign
across multiple platforms. Our approach incorporates textual content, temporal
information and the underlying network of user and messages posted to identify
groups of messages with unusual coordination patterns across multiple social
media platforms. We apply our approach to content posted on four platforms
related to the Syrian Civil Defence organization known as the White Helmets:
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. Results show that our approach
identifies social media posts that link to news YouTube channels with similar
factuality score, which is often an indication of coordinated operations.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent success in data-driven fault diagnosis of rotating
machines, there are still remaining challenges in this field. Among the issues
to be addressed, is the lack of information about variety of faults the system
may encounter in the field. In this paper, we assume a partial knowledge of the
system faults and use the corresponding data to train a convolutional neural
network. A combination of t-SNE method and clustering techniques is then
employed to detect novel faults. Upon detection, the network is augmented using
the new data. Finally, a test setup is used to validate this two-stage

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs), acting as a powerful reasoner and generator,
exhibit extraordinary performance across various natural language tasks, such
as question answering (QA). Among these tasks, Multi-Hop Question Answering
(MHQA) stands as a widely discussed category, necessitating seamless
integration between LLMs and the retrieval of external knowledge. Existing
methods employ LLM to generate reasoning paths and plans, and utilize IR to
iteratively retrieve related knowledge, but these approaches have inherent
flaws. On one hand, Information Retriever (IR) is hindered by the low quality
of generated queries by LLM. On the other hand, LLM is easily misguided by the
irrelevant knowledge by IR. These inaccuracies, accumulated by the iterative
interaction between IR and LLM, lead to a disaster in effectiveness at the end.
To overcome above barriers, in this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for MHQA
called Furthest-Reasoning-with-Plan-Assessment (FuRePA), including an improved
framework (Furthest Reasoning) and an attached module (Plan Assessor). 1)
Furthest reasoning operates by masking previous reasoning path and generated
queries for LLM, encouraging LLM generating chain of thought from scratch in
each iteration. This approach enables LLM to break the shackle built by
previous misleading thoughts and queries (if any). 2) The Plan Assessor is a
trained evaluator that selects an appropriate plan from a group of candidate
plans proposed by LLM. Our methods are evaluated on three highly recognized
public multi-hop question answering datasets and outperform state-of-the-art on
most metrics (achieving a 10%-12% in answer accuracy).

aims to amplify the voices of underrepresented women in the computer vision
community, fostering increased visibility in both academia and industry. We
believe that such events play a vital role in addressing gender imbalances
within the field. The annual WiCV@CVPR workshop offers a) opportunity for
collaboration between researchers from minority groups, b) mentorship for
female junior researchers, c) financial support to presenters to alleviate
finanacial burdens and d) a diverse array of role models who can inspire
younger researchers at the outset of their careers. In this paper, we present a

<p class="mathjax">The $2$-adic complexity has been well-analyzed in the periodic case. However,
we are not aware of any theoretical results on the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of
any promising candidate for a pseudorandom sequence of finite length $N$ or
results on a part of the period of length $N$ of a periodic sequence,
respectively. Here we introduce the first method for this aperiodic case. More
precisely, we study the relation between $N$th maximum-order complexity and
$N$th $2$-adic complexity of binary sequences and prove a lower bound on the
$N$th $2$-adic complexity in terms of the $N$th maximum-order complexity. Then
any known lower bound on the $N$th maximum-order complexity implies a lower
bound on the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of the same order of magnitude. In the
periodic case, one can prove a slightly better result. The latter bound is
sharp which is illustrated by the maximum-order complexity of $\ell$-sequences.
The idea of the proof helps us to characterize the maximum-order complexity of
periodic sequences in terms of the unique rational number defined by the
sequence. We also show that a periodic sequence of maximal maximum-order
complexity must be also of maximal $2$-adic complexity.

<p class="mathjax">The burgeoning generative artificial intelligence technology offers novel
insights into the development of semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks.
These frameworks hold the potential to address the challenges associated with
the black-box nature inherent in existing end-to-end training manner for the
existing SemCom framework, as well as deterioration of the user experience
caused by the inevitable error floor in deep learning-based semantic
communication. In this paper, we focus on the widespread remote monitoring
scenario, and propose a semantic change driven generative SemCom framework.
Therein, the semantic encoder and semantic decoder can be optimized
independently. Specifically, we develop a modular semantic encoder with value
of information based semantic sampling function. In addition, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic mode-assisted semantic decoder
that relies on received semantic information from the source, namely, the
semantic map, and the local static scene information to remotely regenerate
scenes. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
encoder and decoder as well as the considerable potential in reducing energy
consumption through simulation. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">NB-Fi is a new low-power wide-area network technology, which has become
widely used for smart cities, smart grids, the Industrial Internet of Things,
and telemetry applications. Although many countries use NB-Fi, almost no papers
study NB-Fi, and its peak performance is unknown. This article aims to fill
this gap by analyzing this technology and studying the problem of rate
assignment in NB-Fi networks. For that, this article develops a mathematical
model used to find the packet loss ratio, packet error rate, and the average
delay for various rate assignment approaches. The performance evaluation
results are used to develop the guidelines for NB-Fi configuration to optimize

<p class="mathjax">Open-set object recognition aims to identify if an object is from a class
that has been encountered during training or not. To perform open-set object
recognition accurately, a key challenge is how to reduce the reliance on
spurious-discriminative features. In this paper, motivated by that different
large models pre-trained through different paradigms can possess very rich
while distinct implicit knowledge, we propose a novel framework named Large
Model Collaboration (LMC) to tackle the above challenge via collaborating
different off-the-shelf large models in a training-free manner. Moreover, we
also incorporate the proposed framework with several novel designs to
effectively extract implicit knowledge from large models. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework. Code is available

<p class="mathjax">Heavy Good Vehicles (HGVs) are the second largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions in transportation, after cars and taxis. However, HGVs are
inefficiently utilised, with more than one-third of their weight capacity not
being used during travel. We, thus, in this paper address collaborative
logistics, an effective pathway to enhance HGVs' utilisation and reduce carbon
emissions. We investigate a multi-agent system approach to facilitate
collaborative logistics, particularly carrier collaboration. We propose a
simple yet effective multi-agent collaborative logistics (MACL) framework,
representing key stakeholders as intelligent agents. Furthermore, we utilise
the MACL framework in conjunction with a proposed system architecture to create
an integrated collaborative logistics testbed. This testbed, consisting of a
physical system and its digital replica, is a tailored cyber-physical system or
digital twin for collaborative logistics. Through a demonstration, we show the
utility of the testbed for studying collaborative logistics.

<p class="mathjax">As an attractive enabling technology for next-generation wireless
communications, network slicing supports diverse customized services in the
global space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) with diverse resource
constraints. In this paper, we dynamically consider three typical classes of
radio access network (RAN) slices, namely high-throughput slices, low-delay
slices and wide-coverage slices, under the same underlying physical SAGIN. The
throughput, the service delay and the coverage area of these three classes of
RAN slices are jointly optimized in a non-scalar form by considering the
distinct channel features and service advantages of the terrestrial, aerial and
satellite components of SAGINs. A joint central and distributed multi-agent
deep deterministic policy gradient (CDMADDPG) algorithm is proposed for solving
the above problem to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. The algorithm first
determines the optimal virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (vUAV) positions and the
inter-slice sub-channel and power sharing by relying on a centralized unit.
Then it optimizes the intra-slice sub-channel and power allocation, and the
virtual base station (vBS)/vUAV/virtual low earth orbit (vLEO) satellite
deployment in support of three classes of slices by three separate distributed
units. Simulation results verify that the proposed method approaches the
Pareto-optimal exploitation of multiple RAN slices, and outperforms the
benchmarkers.

<p class="mathjax">Robot multimodal locomotion encompasses the ability to transition between
walking and flying, representing a significant challenge in robotics. This work
presents an approach that enables automatic smooth transitions between legged
and aerial locomotion. Leveraging the concept of Adversarial Motion Priors, our
method allows the robot to imitate motion datasets and accomplish the desired
task without the need for complex reward functions. The robot learns walking
patterns from human-like gaits and aerial locomotion patterns from motions
obtained using trajectory optimization. Through this process, the robot adapts
the locomotion scheme based on environmental feedback using reinforcement
learning, with the spontaneous emergence of mode-switching behavior. The
results highlight the potential for achieving multimodal locomotion in aerial
humanoid robotics through automatic control of walking and flying modes, paving
the way for applications in diverse domains such as search and rescue,
surveillance, and exploration missions. This research contributes to advancing
the capabilities of aerial humanoid robots in terms of versatile locomotion in
various environments.

<p class="mathjax">Eyebrows play a critical role in facial expression and appearance. Although
the 3D digitization of faces is well explored, less attention has been drawn to
3D eyebrow modeling. In this work, we propose EMS, the first learning-based
framework for single-view 3D eyebrow reconstruction. Following the methods of
scalp hair reconstruction, we also represent the eyebrow as a set of fiber
curves and convert the reconstruction to fibers growing problem. Three modules
are then carefully designed: RootFinder firstly localizes the fiber root
positions which indicates where to grow; OriPredictor predicts an orientation
field in the 3D space to guide the growing of fibers; FiberEnder is designed to
determine when to stop the growth of each fiber. Our OriPredictor is directly
borrowing the method used in hair reconstruction. Considering the differences
between hair and eyebrows, both RootFinder and FiberEnder are newly proposed.
Specifically, to cope with the challenge that the root location is severely
occluded, we formulate root localization as a density map estimation task.
Given the predicted density map, a density-based clustering method is further
used for finding the roots. For each fiber, the growth starts from the root
point and moves step by step until the ending, where each step is defined as an
oriented line with a constant length according to the predicted orientation
field. To determine when to end, a pixel-aligned RNN architecture is designed
to form a binary classifier, which outputs stop or not for each growing step.
To support the training of all proposed networks, we build the first 3D
synthetic eyebrow dataset that contains 400 high-quality eyebrow models
manually created by artists. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed EMS pipeline on a variety of different eyebrow
styles and lengths, ranging from short and sparse to long bushy eyebrows.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of the neural field, reconstructing the 3D model of a
target object from multi-view inputs has recently attracted increasing
attention from the community. Existing methods normally learn a neural field
for the whole scene, while it is still under-explored how to reconstruct a
certain object indicated by users on-the-fly. Considering the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has shown effectiveness in segmenting any 2D images, in this paper,
we propose Neural Object Cloning (NOC), a novel high-quality 3D object
reconstruction method, which leverages the benefits of both neural field and
SAM from two aspects. Firstly, to separate the target object from the scene, we
propose a novel strategy to lift the multi-view 2D segmentation masks of SAM
into a unified 3D variation field. The 3D variation field is then projected
into 2D space and generates the new prompts for SAM. This process is iterative
until convergence to separate the target object from the scene. Then, apart
from 2D masks, we further lift the 2D features of the SAM encoder into a 3D SAM
field in order to improve the reconstruction quality of the target object. NOC
lifts the 2D masks and features of SAM into the 3D neural field for
high-quality target object reconstruction. We conduct detailed experiments on
several benchmark datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our method. The
code will be released.

labeled dataset is required. Finding such data with the necessary
characteristics is a challenging task, especially for languages less popular
than English. Moreover, producing such data requires significant effort and
often money. Therefore, a strategy to mitigate this problem is the use of data
augmentation techniques. In this work, we propose a framework that approaches
data augmentation based on deepfake audio. To validate the produced framework,
experiments were conducted using existing deepfake and transcription models. A
voice cloner and a dataset produced by Indians (in English) were selected,

<p class="mathjax">Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has attracted a lot of attention as a
general and powerful multiple access scheme. In the uplink, instead of encoding
the whole message into one stream, a user can split its message into two parts
and encode them into two streams before transmitting a superposition of these
two streams. The base station (BS) uses successive interference cancellation
(SIC) to decode the streams and reconstruct the original messages. Focusing on
the packet transmission reliability, we investigate the features of RSMA in the
context of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), a well-established mechanism
for enhancing reliability. This work proposes a HARQ scheme for uplink RSMA
with different retransmission times for a two-user scenario and introduces a
power allocation strategy for the two split streams. The results show that
compared with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and frequency division
multiple access (FDMA), RSMA outperforms them in terms of error probability and
power consumption. The results show that RSMA with HARQ has the potential to
improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless communication systems.

<p class="mathjax">Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on our planet, and are
depended on by hundreds of millions of people. Unfortunately, most coral reefs
are existentially threatened by global climate change and local anthropogenic
pressures. To better understand the dynamics underlying deterioration of reefs,
monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution is key. However,
conventional monitoring methods for quantifying coral cover and species
abundance are limited in scale due to the extensive manual labor required.
Although computer vision tools have been employed to aid in this process, in
particular SfM photogrammetry for 3D mapping and deep neural networks for image
segmentation, analysis of the data products creates a bottleneck, effectively
limiting their scalability. This paper presents a new paradigm for mapping
underwater environments from ego-motion video, unifying 3D mapping systems that
use machine learning to adapt to challenging conditions under water, combined
with a modern approach for semantic segmentation of images. The method is
exemplified on coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea,
demonstrating high-precision 3D semantic mapping at unprecedented scale with
significantly reduced required labor costs: a 100 m video transect acquired
within 5 minutes of diving with a cheap consumer-grade camera can be fully
automatically analyzed within 5 minutes. Our approach significantly scales up
coral reef monitoring by taking a leap towards fully automatic analysis of
video transects. The method democratizes coral reef transects by reducing the
labor, equipment, logistics, and computing cost. This can help to inform
conservation policies more efficiently. The underlying computational method of
learning-based Structure-from-Motion has broad implications for fast low-cost
mapping of underwater environments other than coral reefs.

<p class="mathjax">We address the challenge of enhancing navigation autonomy for planetary space
rovers using reinforcement learning (RL). The ambition of future space missions
necessitates advanced autonomous navigation capabilities for rovers to meet
mission objectives. RL's potential in robotic autonomy is evident, but its
reliance on simulations poses a challenge. Transferring policies to real-world
scenarios often encounters the "reality gap", disrupting the transition from
virtual to physical environments. The reality gap is exacerbated in the context
of mapless navigation on Mars and Moon-like terrains, where unpredictable
terrains and environmental factors play a significant role. Effective
navigation requires a method attuned to these complexities and real-world data
noise. We introduce a novel two-stage RL approach using offline noisy data. Our
approach employs a teacher-student policy learning paradigm, inspired by the
"learning by cheating" method. The teacher policy is trained in simulation.
Subsequently, the student policy is trained on noisy data, aiming to mimic the
teacher's behaviors while being more robust to real-world uncertainties. Our
policies are transferred to a custom-designed rover for real-world testing.
Comparative analyses between the teacher and student policies reveal that our
approach offers improved behavioral performance, heightened noise resilience,
and more effective sim-to-real transfer.

<p class="mathjax">As a common approach to learning English, reading comprehension primarily
entails reading articles and answering related questions. However, the
complexity of designing effective exercises results in students encountering
standardized questions, making it challenging to align with individualized
learners' reading comprehension ability. By leveraging the advanced
capabilities offered by large language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, this
paper presents a novel personalized support system for reading comprehension,
referred to as ChatPRCS, based on the Zone of Proximal Development theory.
ChatPRCS employs methods including reading comprehension proficiency
prediction, question generation, and automatic evaluation, among others, to
enhance reading comprehension instruction. First, we develop a new algorithm
that can predict learners' reading comprehension abilities using their
historical data as the foundation for generating questions at an appropriate
level of difficulty. Second, a series of new ChatGPT prompt patterns is
proposed to address two key aspects of reading comprehension objectives:
question generation, and automated evaluation. These patterns further improve
the quality of generated questions. Finally, by integrating personalized
ability and reading comprehension prompt patterns, ChatPRCS is systematically
validated through experiments. Empirical results demonstrate that it provides
learners with high-quality reading comprehension questions that are broadly
aligned with expert-crafted questions at a statistical level.

<p class="mathjax">This work aims to provide an overview on the open-source multilanguage tool
called StyloMetrix. It offers stylometric text representations that cover
various aspects of grammar, syntax and lexicon. StyloMetrix covers four
languages: Polish as the primary language, English, Ukrainian and Russian. The
normalized output of each feature can become a fruitful course for machine
learning models and a valuable addition to the embeddings layer for any deep
learning algorithm. We strive to provide a concise, but exhaustive overview on
the application of the StyloMetrix vectors as well as explain the sets of the
developed linguistic features. The experiments have shown promising results in
supervised content classification with simple algorithms as Random Forest
Classifier, Voting Classifier, Logistic Regression and others. The deep
learning assessments have unveiled the usefulness of the StyloMetrix vectors at
enhancing an embedding layer extracted from Transformer architectures. The
StyloMetrix has proven itself to be a formidable source for the machine

<p class="mathjax">Large language models are becoming increasingly practical for translating
code across programming languages, a process known as $transpiling$. Even
though automated transpilation significantly boosts developer productivity, a
key concern is whether the generated code is correct. Existing work initially
used manually crafted test suites to test the translations of a small corpus of
programs; these test suites were later automated. In contrast, we devise the
first approach for automated, functional, property-based testing of code
translation models. Our general, user-provided specifications about the
transpiled code capture a range of properties, from purely syntactic to purely
semantic ones. As shown by our experiments, this approach is very effective in
detecting property violations in popular code translation models, and
therefore, in evaluating model quality with respect to given properties. We
also go a step further and explore the usage scenario where a user simply aims
to obtain a correct translation of some code with respect to certain properties
without necessarily being concerned about the overall quality of the model. To
this purpose, we develop the first property-guided search procedure for code
translation models, where a model is repeatedly queried with slightly different
parameters to produce alternative and potentially more correct translations.
Our results show that this search procedure helps to obtain significantly
better code translations.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot learning has made impressive strides in addressing the crucial
challenges of recognizing unknown samples from novel classes in target query
sets and managing visual shifts between domains. However, existing techniques
fall short when it comes to identifying target outliers under domain shifts by
learning to reject pseudo-outliers from the source domain, resulting in an
incomplete solution to both problems. To address these challenges
comprehensively, we propose a novel approach called Domain Adaptive Few-Shot
Open Set Recognition (DA-FSOS) and introduce a meta-learning-based architecture
named DAFOSNET. During training, our model learns a shared and discriminative
embedding space while creating a pseudo open-space decision boundary, given a
fully-supervised source domain and a label-disjoint few-shot target domain. To
enhance data density, we use a pair of conditional adversarial networks with
tunable noise variances to augment both domains closed and pseudo-open spaces.
Furthermore, we propose a domain-specific batch-normalized class prototypes
alignment strategy to align both domains globally while ensuring
class-discriminativeness through novel metric objectives. Our training approach
ensures that DAFOS-NET can generalize well to new scenarios in the target
domain. We present three benchmarks for DA-FSOS based on the Office-Home,
mini-ImageNet/CUB, and DomainNet datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of
DAFOS-NET through extensive experimentation

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning is an effective approach for training game-playing agents
and, consequently, for efficient game production. However, generalization - the
ability to perform well in related but unseen scenarios - is an essential
requirement that remains an unsolved challenge for game AI. Generalization is
difficult for imitation learning agents because it requires the algorithm to
take meaningful actions outside of the training distribution. In this paper we
propose a solution to this challenge. Inspired by the success of data
augmentation in supervised learning, we augment the training data so the
distribution of states and actions in the dataset better represents the real
state-action distribution. This study evaluates methods for combining and
applying data augmentations to observations, to improve generalization of
imitation learning agents. It also provides a performance benchmark of these
augmentations across several 3D environments. These results demonstrate that
data augmentation is a promising framework for improving generalization in
imitation learning agents.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate segmentation is essential for echocardiography-based assessment of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the variability among sonographers and
the inherent challenges of ultrasound images hinder precise segmentation. By
leveraging the joint representation of image and text modalities,
Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) can incorporate rich contextual
information, potentially aiding in accurate and explainable segmentation.
However, the lack of readily available data in echocardiography hampers the
training of VLSMs. In this study, we explore using synthetic datasets from
Semantic Diffusion Models (SDMs) to enhance VLSMs for echocardiography
segmentation. We evaluate results for two popular VLSMs (CLIPSeg and CRIS)
using seven different kinds of language prompts derived from several
attributes, automatically extracted from echocardiography images, segmentation
masks, and their metadata. Our results show improved metrics and faster
convergence when pretraining VLSMs on SDM-generated synthetic images before
finetuning on real images. The code, configs, and prompts are available at

<p class="mathjax">The rising usage of AI and ML-based processing across application domains has
exacerbated the need for low-cost ML implementation, specifically for
resource-constrained embedded systems. To this end, approximate computing, an
approach that explores the power, performance, area (PPA), and behavioral
accuracy (BEHAV) trade-offs, has emerged as a possible solution for
implementing embedded machine learning. Due to the predominance of MAC
operations in ML, designing platform-specific approximate arithmetic operators
forms one of the major research problems in approximate computing. Recently
there has been a rising usage of AI/ML-based design space exploration
techniques for implementing approximate operators. However, most of these
approaches are limited to using ML-based surrogate functions for predicting the
PPA and BEHAV impact of a set of related design decisions. While this approach
leverages the regression capabilities of ML methods, it does not exploit the
more advanced approaches in ML. To this end, we propose AxOCS, a methodology
for designing approximate arithmetic operators through ML-based supersampling.
Specifically, we present a method to leverage the correlation of PPA and BEHAV
metrics across operators of varying bit-widths for generating larger bit-width
operators. The proposed approach involves traversing the relatively smaller
design space of smaller bit-width operators and employing its associated
Design-PPA-BEHAV relationship to generate initial solutions for
metaheuristics-based optimization for larger operators. The experimental
evaluation of AxOCS for FPGA-optimized approximate operators shows that the
proposed approach significantly improves the quality-resulting hypervolume for
multi-objective optimization-of 8x8 signed approximate multipliers.

<p class="mathjax">Crowd simulation is important for video-games design, since it enables to
populate virtual worlds with autonomous avatars that navigate in a human-like
manner. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in simulating virtual
crowds, but the design of the reward function is critical to achieving
effective and efficient results. In this work, we explore the design of reward
functions for reinforcement learning-based crowd simulation. We provide
theoretical insights on the validity of certain reward functions according to
their analytical properties, and evaluate them empirically using a range of
scenarios, using the energy efficiency as the metric. Our experiments show that
directly minimizing the energy usage is a viable strategy as long as it is
paired with an appropriately scaled guiding potential, and enable us to study
the impact of the different reward components on the behavior of the simulated
crowd. Our findings can inform the development of new crowd simulation
techniques, and contribute to the wider study of human-like navigation.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular depth estimation is a crucial task to measure distance relative to
a camera, which is important for applications, such as robot navigation and
self-driving. Traditional frame-based methods suffer from performance drops due
to the limited dynamic range and motion blur. Therefore, recent works leverage
novel event cameras to complement or guide the frame modality via frame-event
feature fusion. However, event streams exhibit spatial sparsity, leaving some
areas unperceived, especially in regions with marginal light changes.
Therefore, direct fusion methods, e.g., RAMNet, often ignore the contribution
of the most confident regions of each modality. This leads to structural
ambiguity in the modality fusion process, thus degrading the depth estimation
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Reliability-oriented
Fusion Network (SRFNet), that can estimate depth with fine-grained structure at
both daytime and nighttime. Our method consists of two key technical
components. Firstly, we propose an attention-based interactive fusion (AIF)
module that applies spatial priors of events and frames as the initial masks
and learns the consensus regions to guide the inter-modal feature fusion. The
fused feature are then fed back to enhance the frame and event feature
learning. Meanwhile, it utilizes an output head to generate a fused mask, which
is iteratively updated for learning consensual spatial priors. Secondly, we
propose the Reliability-oriented Depth Refinement (RDR) module to estimate
dense depth with the fine-grained structure based on the fused features and
masks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the synthetic and
real-world datasets, which shows that, even without pretraining, our method
outperforms the prior methods, e.g., RAMNet, especially in night scenes. Our

<p class="mathjax">The traditional machine learning models to solve optimal power flow (OPF) are
mostly trained for a given power network and lack generalizability to today's
power networks with varying topologies and growing plug-and-play distributed
energy resources (DERs). In this paper, we propose DeepOPF-U, which uses one
unified deep neural network (DNN) to solve alternating-current (AC) OPF
problems in different power networks, including a set of power networks that is
successively expanding. Specifically, we design elastic input and output layers
for the vectors of given loads and OPF solutions with varying lengths in
different networks. The proposed method, using a single unified DNN, can deal
with different and growing numbers of buses, lines, loads, and DERs.
Simulations of IEEE 57/118/300-bus test systems and a network growing from 73
to 118 buses verify the improved performance of DeepOPF-U compared to existing
DNN-based solution methods.

<p class="mathjax">Pruning is a compression method which aims to improve the efficiency of
neural networks by reducing their number of parameters while maintaining a good
performance, thus enhancing the performance-to-cost ratio in nontrivial ways.
Of particular interest are structured pruning techniques, in which whole
portions of parameters are removed altogether, resulting in easier to leverage
shrunk architectures. Since its growth in popularity in the recent years,
pruning gave birth to countless papers and contributions, resulting first in
critical inconsistencies in the way results are compared, and then to a
collective effort to establish standardized benchmarks. However, said
benchmarks are based on training practices that date from several years ago and
do not align with current practices. In this work, we verify how results in the
recent literature of pruning hold up against networks that underwent both
state-of-the-art training methods and trivial model scaling. We find that the
latter clearly and utterly outperform all the literature we compared to,
proving that updating standard pruning benchmarks and re-evaluating classical
methods in their light is an absolute necessity. We thus introduce a new
challenging baseline to compare structured pruning to: ThinResNet.

<p class="mathjax">The robotic handling of compliant and deformable food raw materials,
characterized by high biological variation, complex geometrical 3D shapes, and
mechanical structures and texture, is currently in huge demand in the ocean
space, agricultural, and food industries. Many tasks in these industries are
performed manually by human operators who, due to the laborious and tedious
nature of their tasks, exhibit high variability in execution, with variable
outcomes. The introduction of robotic automation for most complex processing
tasks has been challenging due to current robot learning policies. A more
consistent learning policy involving skilled operators is desired. In this
paper, we address the problem of robot learning when presented with
inconsistent demonstrations. To this end, we propose a robust learning policy
based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD) for robotic grasping of food
compliant objects. The approach uses a merging of RGB-D images and tactile data
in order to estimate the necessary pose of the gripper, gripper finger
configuration and forces exerted on the object in order to achieve effective
robot handling. During LfD training, the gripper pose, finger configurations
and tactile values for the fingers, as well as RGB-D images are saved. We
present an LfD learning policy that automatically removes inconsistent
demonstrations, and estimates the teacher's intended policy. The performance of
our approach is validated and demonstrated for fragile and compliant food
objects with complex 3D shapes. The proposed approach has a vast range of
potential applications in the aforementioned industry sectors.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of safety-critical control of autonomous
robots, considering the ubiquitous uncertainties arising from unmodeled
dynamics and noisy sensors. To take into account these uncertainties,
probabilistic state estimators are often deployed to obtain a belief over
possible states. Namely, Particle Filters (PFs) can handle arbitrary
non-Gaussian distributions in the robot's state. In this work, we define the
belief state and belief dynamics for continuous-discrete PFs and construct safe
sets in the underlying belief space. We design a controller that provably keeps
the robot's belief state within this safe set. As a result, we ensure that the
risk of the unknown robot's state violating a safety specification, such as
avoiding a dangerous area, is bounded. We provide an open-source implementation
as a ROS2 package and evaluate the solution in simulations and hardware
experiments involving high-dimensional belief spaces.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many
applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the
user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces
the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems.
Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models
often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user
problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to
alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training
strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address
these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential
Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented
dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models
directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the
generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based
pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence
generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise
prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we
develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and
origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation
models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As
far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to
the recommendation.

<p class="mathjax">Advanced control strategies for delivering heat to users in a district
heating network have the potential to improve performance and reduce wasted
energy. To enable the design of such controllers, this paper proposes an
automated plant modeling framework that captures the relevant system dynamics,
while being adaptable to any network configuration. Starting from the network
topology and system parameters, the developed algorithm generates a state-space
model of the system, relying on a graph-based technique to facilitate the
combination of component models into a full network model. The accuracy of the
approach is validated against experimental data collected from a
laboratory-scale district heating network. The verification shows an average
normalized root mean square error of 0.39 in the mass flow rates delivered to
the buildings, and 0.15 in the network return temperature. Furthermore, the
ability of the proposed modeling technique to rapidly generate models
characterizing different network configurations is demonstrated through its
application to topology optimization. The optimal design, obtained via a branch
and bound algorithm, reduces network heat losses by 15% as compared to the
conventional length-minimized topology.

<p class="mathjax">Emerging from the monolithic pairwise attention mechanism in conventional
Transformer models, there is a growing interest in leveraging sparse
interactions that align more closely with biological principles. Approaches
including the Set Transformer and the Perceiver employ cross-attention
consolidated with a latent space that forms an attention bottleneck with
limited capacity. Building upon recent neuroscience studies of Global Workspace
Theory and associative memory, we propose the Associative Transformer (AiT).
AiT induces low-rank explicit memory that serves as both priors to guide
bottleneck attention in the shared workspace and attractors within associative
memory of a Hopfield network. Through joint end-to-end training, these priors
naturally develop module specialization, each contributing a distinct inductive
bias to form attention bottlenecks. A bottleneck can foster competition among
inputs for writing information into the memory. We show that AiT is a sparse
representation learner, learning distinct priors through the bottlenecks that
are complexity-invariant to input quantities and dimensions. AiT demonstrates
its superiority over methods such as the Set Transformer, Vision Transformer,
and Coordination in various vision tasks.

trained on large-scale corpora. However, generic NMT systems have demonstrated
poor performance on out-of-domain translation. To mitigate this issue, several
domain adaptation methods have recently been proposed which often lead to
better translation quality than genetic NMT systems. While there has been some
continuous progress in NMT for English and other European languages, domain
adaption in Arabic has received little attention in the literature. The current
study, therefore, aims to explore the effectiveness of domain-specific
adaptation for Arabic MT (AMT), in yet unexplored domain, financial news
articles. To this end, we developed carefully a parallel corpus for
Arabic-English (AR- EN) translation in the financial domain for benchmarking
different domain adaptation methods. We then fine-tuned several pre-trained NMT
and Large Language models including ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo on our dataset. The
results showed that the fine-tuning is successful using just a few well-aligned
in-domain AR-EN segments. The quality of ChatGPT translation was superior than
other models based on automatic and human evaluations. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work on fine-tuning ChatGPT towards financial
domain transfer learning. To contribute to research in domain translation, we

<p class="mathjax">Memory interference may heavily inflate task execution times in Heterogeneous
Systems-on-Chips (HeSoCs). Knowing worst-case interference is consequently
fundamental for supporting the correct execution of time-sensitive
applications. In most of the literature, worst-case interference is assumed to
be generated by, and therefore is estimated through read-intensive synthetic
workloads with no caching. Yet these workloads do not always generate
worst-case interference. This is the consequence of the general results
reported in this work. By testing on multiple architectures, we determined that
the highest interference generation traffic pattern is actually hardware
dependant, and that making assumptions could lead to a severe underestimation
of the worst-case (in our case, of more than 9x).

tuning (SDT) strategy, which serves as a bridge, allowing us to leverage
existing labeled HSI datasets even RGB datasets to enhance the performance on
new HSI datasets with limited samples. The proposed SDT inherits the idea of
prompt tuning, aiming to reuse pre-trained models with minimal modifications
for adaptation to new tasks. But unlike prompt tuning, SDT is custom-designed
to accommodate the characteristics of HSIs. The proposed SDT utilizes a
parallel architecture, an asynchronous cold-hot gradient update strategy, and
unidirectional interaction. It aims to fully harness the potent representation
learning capabilities derived from training on heterologous, even cross-modal
datasets. In addition, we also introduce a novel Triplet-structured transformer
(Tri-Former), where spectral attention and spatial attention modules are merged
in parallel to construct the token mixing component for reducing computation
cost and a 3D convolution-based channel mixer module is integrated to enhance
stability and keep structure information. Comparison experiments conducted on
three representative HSI datasets captured by different sensors demonstrate the
proposed Tri-Former achieves better performance compared to several
state-of-the-art methods. Homologous, heterologous and cross-modal tuning
experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed SDT.

<p class="mathjax">Existing video captioning approaches typically require to first sample video
frames from a decoded video and then conduct a subsequent process (e.g.,
feature extraction and/or captioning model learning). In this pipeline, manual
frame sampling may ignore key information in videos and thus degrade
performance. Additionally, redundant information in the sampled frames may
result in low efficiency in the inference of video captioning. Addressing this,
we study video captioning from a different perspective in compressed domain,
which brings multi-fold advantages over the existing pipeline: 1) Compared to
raw images from the decoded video, the compressed video, consisting of
I-frames, motion vectors and residuals, is highly distinguishable, which allows
us to leverage the entire video for learning without manual sampling through a
specialized model design; 2) The captioning model is more efficient in
inference as smaller and less redundant information is processed. We propose a
simple yet effective end-to-end transformer in the compressed domain for video
captioning that enables learning from the compressed video for captioning. We
show that even with a simple design, our method can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on different benchmarks while running almost 2x faster than
existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/acherstyx/CoCap.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textual
similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model
(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models
face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on
the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly
collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine
domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various
tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.
The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models
that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability
of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle
optimization in STS.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last two decades, the field of geometric curve evolutions has
attracted significant attention from scientific computing. One of the most
popular numerical methods for solving geometric flows is the so-called BGN
scheme, which was proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and Nurnberg (J. Comput. Phys.,
222 (2007), pp. 441{467), due to its favorable properties (e.g., its
computational efficiency and the good mesh property). However, the BGN scheme
is limited to first-order accuracy in time, and how to develop a higher-order
numerical scheme is challenging. In this paper, we propose a fully discrete,
temporal second-order parametric finite element method, which incorporates a
mesh regularization technique when necessary, for solving geometric flows of
curves. The scheme is constructed based on the BGN formulation and a
semi-implicit Crank-Nicolson leap-frog time stepping discretization as well as
a linear finite element approximation in space. More importantly, we point out
that the shape metrics, such as manifold distance and Hausdorff distance,
instead of function norms, should be employed to measure numerical errors.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BGN-based scheme
is second-order accurate in time in terms of shape metrics. Moreover, by
employing the classical BGN scheme as a mesh regularization technique when
necessary, our proposed second-order scheme exhibits good properties with
respect to the mesh distribution.

designed to detect small lesions in medical images. Precise localization of
small lesions presents challenges due to their appearance and the diverse
contextual backgrounds in which they are found. To address this, our approach
introduces a new type of pixel-based anchor that dynamically moves towards the
targeted lesion for detection. We refer to this new architecture as GravityNet,
and the novel anchors as gravity points since they appear to be "attracted" by
the lesions. We conducted experiments on two well-established medical problems
involving small lesions to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach:
microcalcifications detection in digital mammograms and microaneurysms
detection in digital fundus images. Our method demonstrates promising results
in effectively detecting small lesions in these medical imaging tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Affect recognition, encompassing emotions, moods, and feelings, plays a
pivotal role in human communication. In the realm of conversational artificial
intelligence (AI), the ability to discern and respond to human affective cues
is a critical factor for creating engaging and empathetic interactions. This
study delves into the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to recognise
human affect in conversations, with a focus on both open-domain chit-chat
dialogues and task-oriented dialogues. Leveraging three diverse datasets,
namely IEMOCAP, EmoWOZ, and DAIC-WOZ, covering a spectrum of dialogues from
casual conversations to clinical interviews, we evaluated and compared LLMs'
performance in affect recognition. Our investigation explores the zero-shot and
few-shot capabilities of LLMs through in-context learning (ICL) as well as
their model capacities through task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, this
study takes into account the potential impact of automatic speech recognition
(ASR) errors on LLM predictions. With this work, we aim to shed light on the
extent to which LLMs can replicate human-like affect recognition capabilities
in conversations.

digital jobs, such as digital influencers, fitness models, and adult models who
share content on subscription-based social media platforms. Across two
experiments involving 1,002 participants, we combined theories from both social
psychology and information systems to investigate perceptions of digital jobs
compared to matched established jobs, and predictors of attitudes toward
digital jobs (e.g., symbolic threat, contact, perceived usefulness). We found
that individuals in digital professions were perceived as less favorably and as
less hard-working than those in matched established jobs. Digital jobs were
also regarded as more threatening to societal values and less useful. The
relation between job type and attitudes toward these jobs was partially
mediated by contact with people working in these jobs, perceived usefulness,
perception of hard-working, and symbolic threat. These effects were consistent
across openness to new experiences, attitudes toward digitalization, political
orientation, and age. Among the nine jobs examined, lecturers were perceived as
the most favorable, while adult models were viewed least favorably. Overall,
our findings demonstrate that integrating theories from social psychology and
information systems can enhance our understanding of how attitudes are formed.

<p class="mathjax">Event Relation Extraction (ERE) aims to extract multiple kinds of relations
among events in texts. However, existing methods singly categorize event
relations as different classes, which are inadequately capturing the intrinsic
semantics of these relations. To comprehensively understand their intrinsic
semantics, in this paper, we obtain prototype representations for each type of
event relation and propose a Prototype-Enhanced Matching (ProtoEM) framework
for the joint extraction of multiple kinds of event relations. Specifically,
ProtoEM extracts event relations in a two-step manner, i.e., prototype
representing and prototype matching. In the first step, to capture the
connotations of different event relations, ProtoEM utilizes examples to
represent the prototypes corresponding to these relations. Subsequently, to
capture the interdependence among event relations, it constructs a dependency
graph for the prototypes corresponding to these relations and utilized a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based module for modeling. In the second step, it obtains
the representations of new event pairs and calculates their similarity with
those prototypes obtained in the first step to evaluate which types of event
relations they belong to. Experimental results on the MAVEN-ERE dataset
demonstrate that the proposed ProtoEM framework can effectively represent the
prototypes of event relations and further obtain a significant improvement over
baseline models.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed optimisation of a
separable convex cost function over a graph, where every edge and node in the
graph could carry both linear equality and/or inequality constraints. We show
how to modify the primal-dual method of multipliers (PDMM), originally designed
for linear equality constraints, such that it can handle inequality constraints
as well. In contrast to most existing algorithms for optimisation with
inequality constraints, the proposed algorithm does not need any slack
variables. Using convex analysis, monotone operator theory and fixed-point
theory, we show how to derive the update equations of the modified PDMM
algorithm by applying Peaceman-Rachford splitting to the monotonic inclusion
related to the extended dual problem. To incorporate the inequality
constraints, we impose a non-negativity constraint on the associated dual
variables. This additional constraint results in the introduction of a
reflection operator to model the data exchange in the network, instead of a
permutation operator as derived for equality constraint PDMM. Convergence for
both synchronous and stochastic update schemes of PDMM are provided. The latter
includes asynchronous update schemes and update schemes with transmission
losses.

<p class="mathjax">We propose OptCtrlPoints, a data-driven framework designed to identify the
optimal sparse set of control points for reproducing target shapes using
biharmonic 3D shape deformation. Control-point-based 3D deformation methods are
widely utilized for interactive shape editing, and their usability is enhanced
when the control points are sparse yet strategically distributed across the
shape. With this objective in mind, we introduce a data-driven approach that
can determine the most suitable set of control points, assuming that we have a
given set of possible shape variations. The challenges associated with this
task primarily stem from the computationally demanding nature of the problem.
Two main factors contribute to this complexity: solving a large linear system
for the biharmonic weight computation and addressing the combinatorial problem
of finding the optimal subset of mesh vertices. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a reformulation of the biharmonic computation that reduces the
matrix size, making it dependent on the number of control points rather than
the number of vertices. Additionally, we present an efficient search algorithm
that significantly reduces the time complexity while still delivering a nearly
optimal solution. Experiments on SMPL, SMAL, and DeformingThings4D datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Our control points achieve better
template-to-target fit than FPS, random search, and neural-network-based
prediction. We also highlight the significant reduction in computation time
from days to approximately 3 minutes.

<p class="mathjax">5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is a promising technology to satisfy the
increasing demands of intelligent transportation systems. Emerging V2X
applications with a high level of automation impose very strict requirements on
latency (less than 10 ms) and reliability (higher than 99.99%). For sporadic
traffic, such demands can be satisfied with a distributed channel access method
called Mode 2. This letter proposes an analytical model of Mode 2 that
estimates the packet loss rate and the network capacity taking into account the
peculiarities of Mode 2 and -- in contrast to the existing models -- provides
the accuracy required in the emerging V2X scenarios. The model can be used to
find the optimal transmission parameters that maximize the network capacity
and/or to select the required bandwidth.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, increasingly more data are available as knowledge graphs (KGs).
While this data model supports advanced reasoning and querying, they remain
difficult to mine due to their size and complexity. Graph mining approaches can
be used to extract patterns from KGs. However this presents two main issues.
First, graph mining approaches tend to extract too many patterns for a human
analyst to interpret (pattern explosion). Second, real-life KGs tend to differ
from the graphs usually treated in graph mining: they are multigraphs, their
vertex degrees tend to follow a power-law, and the way in which they model
knowledge can produce spurious patterns. Recently, a graph mining approach
named GraphMDL+ has been proposed to tackle the problem of pattern explosion,
using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. However, GraphMDL+, like
other graph mining approaches, is not suited for KGs without adaptations. In
this paper we propose KG-MDL, a graph pattern mining approach based on the MDL
principle that, given a KG, generates a human-sized and descriptive set of
graph patterns, and so in a parameter-less and anytime way. We report on
experiments on medium-sized KGs showing that our approach generates sets of
patterns that are both small enough to be interpreted by humans and descriptive
of the KG. We show that the extracted patterns highlight relevant
characteristics of the data: both of the schema used to create the data, and of
the concrete facts it contains. We also discuss the issues related to mining
graph patterns on knowledge graphs, as opposed to other types of graph data.

<p class="mathjax">We show that there is a language in $\mathsf{S}_2\mathsf{E}/_1$ (symmetric
exponential time with one bit of advice) with circuit complexity at least
$2^n/n$. In particular, the above also implies the same near-maximum circuit
lower bounds for the classes $\Sigma_2\mathsf{E}$,
$(\Sigma_2\mathsf{E}\cap\Pi_2\mathsf{E})/_1$, and
$\mathsf{ZPE}^{\mathsf{NP}}/_1$. Previously, only "half-exponential" circuit
lower bounds for these complexity classes were known, and the smallest
complexity class known to require exponential circuit complexity was
$\Delta_3\mathsf{E} = \mathsf{E}^{\Sigma_2\mathsf{P}}$ (Miltersen,
Vinodchandran, and Watanabe COCOON'99).
<br />Our circuit lower bounds are corollaries of an unconditional zero-error
pseudodeterministic algorithm with an $\mathsf{NP}$ oracle and one bit of
advice ($\mathsf{FZPP}^{\mathsf{NP}}/_1$) that solves the range avoidance
problem infinitely often. This algorithm also implies unconditional
infinitely-often pseudodeterministic $\mathsf{FZPP}^{\mathsf{NP}}/_1$
constructions for Ramsey graphs, rigid matrices, two-source extractors, linear
codes, and $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{poly}}$-random strings with nearly optimal
parameters.
<br />Our proofs relativize. The two main technical ingredients are (1) Korten's
$\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{NP}}$ reduction from the range avoidance problem to
constructing hard truth tables (FOCS'21), which was in turn inspired by a
result of Je\v{r}\'abek on provability in Bounded Arithmetic (Ann. Pure Appl.
Log. 2004); and (2) the recent iterative win-win paradigm of Chen, Lu,
Oliveira, Ren, and Santhanam (FOCS'23).

<p class="mathjax">Saliency maps have become one of the most widely used interpretability
techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to their simplicity and
the quality of the insights they provide. However, there are still some doubts
about whether these insights are a trustworthy representation of what CNNs use
to come up with their predictions. This paper explores how rescuing the sign of
the gradients from the saliency map can lead to a deeper understanding of
multi-class classification problems. Using both pretrained and trained from
scratch CNNs we unveil that considering the sign and the effect not only of the
correct class, but also the influence of the other classes, allows to better
identify the pixels of the image that the network is really focusing on.
Furthermore, how occluding or altering those pixels is expected to affect the
outcome also becomes clearer.

<p class="mathjax">FPGA acceleration is becoming increasingly important to meet the performance
demands of modern computing, particularly in big data or machine learning
applications. As such, significant effort is being put into the optimization of
the hardware accelerators. However, integrating accelerators into modern FPGA
platforms, with key features such as high bandwidth memory (HBM), requires
manual effort from a platform expert for every new application. We propose the
Olympus multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR) dialect and Olympus-opt,
a series of analysis and transformation passes on this dialect, for
representing and optimizing platform aware system level FPGA architectures. By
leveraging MLIR, our automation will be extensible and reusable both between
many sources of input and many platform-specific back-ends.

<p class="mathjax">Microarchitectural timing side channels have been thoroughly investigated as
a security threat in hardware designs featuring shared buffers (e.g., caches)
and/or parallelism between attacker and victim task execution. Contradicting
common intuitions, recent activities demonstrate, however, that this threat is
real also in microcontroller SoCs without such features. In this paper, we
describe SoC-wide timing side channels previously neglected by security
analysis and present a new formal method to close this gap. In a case study
with the RISC-V Pulpissimo SoC platform, our method found a vulnerability to a
so far unknown attack variant that allows an attacker to obtain information
about a victim's memory access behavior. After implementing a conservative fix,
we were able to verify that the SoC is now secure w.r.t. timing side channels.

<p class="mathjax">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the brain and in silico excel at solving
tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for
solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons
(single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological
neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale).
However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving
memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve
$N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory
requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights
and $\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with
increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different
mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential
learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple
$N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and are
able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic
forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold
multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer
timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the
multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to
ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks
beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves
training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting
timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more
complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.

deep networks. Our library implements mainstream approximate Bayesian inference
algorithms: variational inference, MC-dropout, stochastic-gradient MCMC, and
Laplace approximation. The main differences from other existing Bayesian neural
network libraries are as follows: 1) Our library can deal with very large-scale
deep networks including Vision Transformers (ViTs). 2) We need virtually zero
code modifications for users (e.g., the backbone network definition codes do
not neet to be modified at all). 3) Our library also allows the pre-trained
model weights to serve as a prior mean, which is very useful for performing
Bayesian inference with the large-scale foundation models like ViTs that are
hard to optimise from scratch with the downstream data alone. Our code is
publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/SamsungLabs/BayesDLL}\footnote{A

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised training methods for transformers have demonstrated
remarkable performance across various domains. Previous transformer-based
models, such as masked autoencoders (MAE), typically utilize a single
normalization layer for both the [CLS] symbol and the tokens. We propose in
this paper a simple modification that employs separate normalization layers for
the tokens and the [CLS] symbol to better capture their distinct
characteristics and enhance downstream task performance. Our method aims to
alleviate the potential negative effects of using the same normalization
statistics for both token types, which may not be optimally aligned with their
individual roles. We empirically show that by utilizing a separate
normalization layer, the [CLS] embeddings can better encode the global
contextual information and are distributed more uniformly in its anisotropic
space. When replacing the conventional normalization layer with the two
separate layers, we observe an average 2.7% performance improvement over the
image, natural language, and graph domains.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the generation
of open-ended high-quality texts, that are non-trivial to distinguish from
human-written texts. We refer to such LLM-generated texts as \emph{deepfake
texts}. There are currently over 11K text generation models in the huggingface
model repo. As such, users with malicious intent can easily use these
open-sourced LLMs to generate harmful texts and misinformation at scale. To
mitigate this problem, a computational method to determine if a given text is a
deepfake text or not is desired--i.e., Turing Test (TT). In particular, in this
work, we investigate the more general version of the problem, known as
\emph{Authorship Attribution (AA)}, in a multi-class setting--i.e., not only
determining if a given text is a deepfake text or not but also being able to
pinpoint which LLM is the author. We propose \textbf{TopRoBERTa} to improve
existing AA solutions by capturing more linguistic patterns in deepfake texts
by including a Topological Data Analysis (TDA) layer in the RoBERTa model. We
show the benefits of having a TDA layer when dealing with noisy, imbalanced,
and heterogeneous datasets, by extracting TDA features from the reshaped
$pooled\_output$ of RoBERTa as input. We use RoBERTa to capture contextual
representations (i.e., semantic and syntactic linguistic features), while using
TDA to capture the shape and structure of data (i.e., linguistic structures).
Finally, \textbf{TopRoBERTa}, outperforms the vanilla RoBERTa in 2/3 datasets,
achieving up to 7\% increase in Macro F1 score.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have become a standard in
robotic control. However, a significant drawback of large-scale ANNs is their
increased power consumption. This becomes a critical concern when designing
autonomous aerial vehicles, given the stringent constraints on power and
weight. Especially in the case of blimps, known for their extended endurance,
power-efficient control methods are essential. Spiking neural networks (SNN)
can provide a solution, facilitating energy-efficient and asynchronous
event-driven processing. In this paper, we have evolved SNNs for accurate
altitude control of a non-neutrally buoyant indoor blimp, relying solely on
onboard sensing and processing power. The blimp's altitude tracking performance
significantly improved compared to prior research, showing reduced oscillations
and a minimal steady-state error. The parameters of the SNNs were optimized via
an evolutionary algorithm, using a Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID)
controller as the target signal. We developed two complementary SNN controllers
while examining various hidden layer structures. The first controller responds
swiftly to control errors, mitigating overshooting and oscillations, while the
second minimizes steady-state errors due to non-neutral buoyancy-induced drift.
Despite the blimp's drivetrain limitations, our SNN controllers ensured stable
altitude control, employing only 160 spiking neurons.

<p class="mathjax">As software projects progress, quality of code assumes paramount importance
as it affects reliability, maintainability and security of software. For this
reason, static analysis tools are used in developer workflows to flag code
quality issues. However, developers need to spend extra efforts to revise their
code to improve code quality based on the tool findings. In this work, we
investigate the use of (instruction-following) large language models (LLMs) to
assist developers in revising code to resolve code quality issues. We present a
tool, CORE (short for COde REvisions), architected using a pair of LLMs
organized as a duo comprised of a proposer and a ranker. Providers of static
analysis tools recommend ways to mitigate the tool warnings and developers
follow them to revise their code. The \emph{proposer LLM} of CORE takes the
same set of recommendations and applies them to generate candidate code
revisions. The candidates which pass the static quality checks are retained.
However, the LLM may introduce subtle, unintended functionality changes which
may go un-detected by the static analysis. The \emph{ranker LLM} evaluates the
changes made by the proposer using a rubric that closely follows the acceptance
criteria that a developer would enforce. CORE uses the scores assigned by the
ranker LLM to rank the candidate revisions before presenting them to the
developer. CORE could revise 59.2% Python files (across 52 quality checks) so
that they pass scrutiny by both a tool and a human reviewer. The ranker LLM is
able to reduce false positives by 25.8% in these cases. CORE produced revisions
that passed the static analysis tool in 76.8% Java files (across 10 quality
checks) comparable to 78.3% of a specialized program repair tool, with
significantly much less engineering efforts.

the model to analyze each dialogue utterance before task execution, thereby
improving performance across various dialogue-centric tasks. Experimental

<p class="mathjax">Assurance cases can be used to argue for the safety of products in safety
engineering. In safety-critical areas, the construction of assurance cases is
indispensable. Trustworthiness Derivation Trees (TDTs) enhance assurance cases
by incorporating formal methods, rendering it possible for automatic reasoning
about assurance cases. We present Trustworthiness Derivation Tree Analyzer
(Trusta), a desktop application designed to automatically construct and verify
TDTs. The tool has a built-in Prolog interpreter in its backend, and is
supported by the constraint solvers Z3 and MONA. Therefore, it can solve
constraints about logical formulas involving arithmetic, sets, Horn clauses
etc. Trusta also utilizes large language models to make the creation and
evaluation of assurance cases more convenient. It allows for interactive human
examination and modification. We evaluated top language models like
ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and PaLM 2 for generating assurance cases. Our tests
showed a 50%-80% similarity between machine-generated and human-created cases.
In addition, Trusta can extract formal constraints from text in natural
languages, facilitating an easier interpretation and validation process. This
extraction is subject to human review and correction, blending the best of
automated efficiency with human insight. To our knowledge, this marks the first
integration of large language models in automatic creating and reasoning about
assurance cases, bringing a novel approach to a traditional challenge. Through
several industrial case studies, Trusta has proven to quickly find some subtle
issues that are typically missed in manual inspection, demonstrating its
practical value in enhancing the assurance case development process.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly supervised object localization and semantic segmentation aim to
localize objects using only image-level labels. Recently, a new paradigm has
emerged by generating a foreground prediction map (FPM) to achieve pixel-level
localization. While existing FPM-based methods use cross-entropy to evaluate
the foreground prediction map and to guide the learning of the generator, this
paper presents two astonishing experimental observations on the object
localization learning process: For a trained network, as the foreground mask
expands, 1) the cross-entropy converges to zero when the foreground mask covers
only part of the object region. 2) The activation value continuously increases
until the foreground mask expands to the object boundary. Therefore, to achieve
a more effective localization performance, we argue for the usage of activation
value to learn more object regions. In this paper, we propose a Background
Activation Suppression (BAS) method. Specifically, an Activation Map Constraint
(AMC) module is designed to facilitate the learning of generator by suppressing
the background activation value. Meanwhile, by using foreground region guidance
and area constraint, BAS can learn the whole region of the object. In the
inference phase, we consider the prediction maps of different categories
together to obtain the final localization results. Extensive experiments show
that BAS achieves significant and consistent improvement over the baseline
methods on the CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC datasets. In addition, our method also
achieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance
on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. Code and models are available
at https://github.com/wpy1999/BAS-Extension.

<p class="mathjax">A novel private communication framework is proposed where privacy is induced
by transmitting over channel instances of linear inverse problems that are
identifiable to the legitimate receiver, but unidentifiable to an eavesdropper.
The gap in identifiability is created in the framework by leveraging secret
knowledge between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Specifically,
the case where the legitimate receiver harnesses a secret block structure to
decode a transmitted block-sparse message from underdetermined linear
measurements in conditions where classical compressed sensing would provably
fail is examined. The applicability of the proposed scheme to practical
multiple access wireless communication systems is discussed. The protocol's
privacy is studied under a single transmission, and under multiple
transmissions without refreshing the secret block structure. It is shown that,
under a specific scaling of the channel dimensions and transmission parameters,
the eavesdropper can attempt to overhear the block structure from the
fourth-order moments of the channel output. Computation of a statistical lower
bound, suggests that the proposed fourth-order moment secret block estimation
strategy is near optimal. The performance of a spectral clustering algorithm is
studied to that end, defining scaling laws on the lifespan of the secret key
before the communication is compromised. Finally, numerical experiments
corroborating the theoretical findings are conducted.

<p class="mathjax">Augmented B-trees (aB-trees) are a broad class of data structures. The
seminal work "succincter" by Patrascu showed that any aB-tree can be stored
using only two bits of redundancy, while supporting queries to the tree in time
proportional to its depth. It has been a versatile building block for
constructing succinct data structures, including rank/select data structures,
dictionaries, locally decodable arithmetic coding, storing balanced
parenthesis, etc.
<br />In this paper, we show how to "dynamize" an aB-tree. Our main result is the
design of dynamic aB-trees (daB-trees) with branching factor two using only
three bits of redundancy (with the help of lookup tables that are of negligible
size in applications), while supporting updates and queries in time polynomial
in its depth. As an application, we present a dynamic rank/select data
structure for $n$-bit arrays, also known as a dynamic fully indexable
dictionary (FID). It supports updates and queries in $O(\log n/\log\log n)$
time, and when the array has $m$ ones, the data structure occupies \[
<br />\log\binom{n}{m} + O(n/2^{\log^{0.199}n}) \] bits. Note that the update and
query times are optimal even without space constraints due to a lower bound by
Fredman and Saks. Prior to our work, no dynamic FID with near-optimal update
and query times and redundancy $o(n/\log n)$ was known. We further show that a
dynamic sequence supporting insertions, deletions and rank/select queries can
be maintained in (optimal) $O(\log n/\log\log n)$ time and with $O(n \cdot
\text{poly}\log\log n/\log^2 n)$ bits of redundancy.

<p class="mathjax">Even though Google Research Football (GRF) was initially benchmarked and
studied as a single-agent environment in its original paper, recent years have
witnessed an increasing focus on its multi-agent nature by researchers
utilizing it as a testbed for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).
However, the absence of standardized environment settings and unified
evaluation metrics for multi-agent scenarios hampers the consistent
understanding of various studies. Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and
11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to
their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper
extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment
settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different
scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by
discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and
introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and
asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained
policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper
investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation. The overall
expectation of this work is to advance the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning on Google Research Football environment, with the ultimate goal of
benefiting real-world sports beyond virtual games.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative perception, which greatly enhances the sensing capability of
connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by incorporating data from external
resources, also brings forth potential security risks. CAVs' driving decisions
rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out
by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system. However,
security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To
understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing
various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers
crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results,
leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a
high success rate of over 86\% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are
realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present
a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly
reveal malicious fabrication. It detects 91.5% of attacks with a false positive
rate of 3% in simulated scenarios and significantly mitigates attack impacts in
real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Nested Event Extraction (NEE) aims to extract complex event structures where
an event contains other events as its arguments recursively. Nested events
involve a kind of Pivot Elements (PEs) that simultaneously act as arguments of
outer events and as triggers of inner events, and thus connect them into nested
structures. This special characteristic of PEs brings challenges to existing
NEE methods, as they cannot well cope with the dual identities of PEs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new model, called PerNee, which extracts
nested events mainly based on recognizing PEs. Specifically, PerNee first
recognizes the triggers of both inner and outer events and further recognizes
the PEs via classifying the relation type between trigger pairs. In order to
obtain better representations of triggers and arguments to further improve NEE
performance, it incorporates the information of both event types and argument
roles into PerNee through prompt learning. Since existing NEE datasets (e.g.,
Genia11) are limited to specific domains and contain a narrow range of event
types with nested structures, we systematically categorize nested events in
generic domain and construct a new NEE dataset, namely ACE2005-Nest.
Experimental results demonstrate that PerNee consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ACE2005-Nest, Genia11 and Genia13.

<p class="mathjax">Passwords remain the most widely used form of user authentication, despite
advancements in other methods. However, their limitations, such as
susceptibility to attacks, especially weak passwords defined by human users,
are well-documented. The existence of weak human-defined passwords has led to
repeated password leaks from websites, many of which are of large scale. While
such password leaks are unfortunate security incidents, they provide security
researchers and practitioners with good opportunities to learn valuable
insights from such leaked passwords, in order to identify ways to improve
password policies and other security controls on passwords. Researchers have
proposed different data visualisation techniques to help analyse leaked
passwords. However, many approaches rely solely on frequency analysis, with
limited exploration of distance-based graphs. This paper reports PassViz, a
novel method that combines the edit distance with the t-SNE (t-distributed
stochastic neighbour embedding) dimensionality reduction algorithm for
visualising and analysing leaked passwords in a 2-D space. We implemented
PassViz as an easy-to-use command-line tool for visualising large-scale
password databases, and also as a graphical user interface (GUI) to support
interactive visual analytics of small password databases. Using the
"000webhost" leaked database as an example, we show how PassViz can be used to
visually analyse different aspects of leaked passwords and to facilitate the
discovery of previously unknown password patterns. Overall, our approach
empowers researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights and improve
password security through effective data visualisation and analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Open-set object detection aims at detecting arbitrary categories beyond those
seen during training. Most recent advancements have adopted the open-vocabulary
paradigm, utilizing vision-language backbones to represent categories with
language. In this paper, we introduce DE-ViT, an open-set object detector that
employs vision-only DINOv2 backbones and learns new categories through example
images instead of language. To improve general detection ability, we transform
multi-classification tasks into binary classification tasks while bypassing
per-class inference, and propose a novel region propagation technique for
localization. We evaluate DE-ViT on open-vocabulary, few-shot, and one-shot
object detection benchmark with COCO and LVIS. For COCO, DE-ViT outperforms the
open-vocabulary SoTA by 6.9 AP50 and achieves 50 AP50 in novel classes. DE-ViT
surpasses the few-shot SoTA by 15 mAP on 10-shot and 7.2 mAP on 30-shot and
one-shot SoTA by 2.8 AP50. For LVIS, DE-ViT outperforms the open-vocabulary
SoTA by 2.2 mask AP and reaches 34.3 mask APr. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent successes of vanilla Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on many
tasks, their foundation on pairwise interaction networks inherently limits
their capacity to discern latent higher-order interactions in complex systems.
To bridge this capability gap, we propose a novel approach exploiting the rich
mathematical theory of simplicial complexes (SCs) - a robust tool for modeling
higher-order interactions. Current SC-based GNNs are burdened by high
complexity and rigidity, and quantifying higher-order interaction strengths
remains challenging. Innovatively, we present a higher-order Flower-Petals (FP)
model, incorporating FP Laplacians into SCs. Further, we introduce a
Higher-order Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) grounded in FP Laplacians,
capable of discerning intrinsic features across varying topological scales. By
employing learnable graph filters, a parameter group within each FP Laplacian
domain, we can identify diverse patterns where the filters' weights serve as a
quantifiable measure of higher-order interaction strengths. The theoretical
underpinnings of HiGCN's advanced expressiveness are rigorously demonstrated.
Additionally, our empirical investigations reveal that the proposed model
accomplishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a range of graph tasks and
provides a scalable and flexible solution to explore higher-order interactions
in graphs.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of research, the detection/recognition of text within
images/videos captured by cameras constitutes a highly challenging problem for
researchers. Despite certain advancements achieving high accuracy, current
methods still require substantial improvements to be applicable in practical
scenarios. Diverging from text detection in images/videos, this paper addresses
the issue of text detection within license plates by amalgamating multiple
frames of distinct perspectives. For each viewpoint, the proposed method
extracts descriptive features characterizing the text components of the license
plate, specifically corner points and area. Concretely, we present three
viewpoints: view-1, view-2, and view-3, to identify the nearest neighboring
components facilitating the restoration of text components from the same
license plate line based on estimations of similarity levels and distance
metrics. Subsequently, we employ the CnOCR method for text recognition within
license plates. Experimental results on the self-collected dataset
(PTITPlates), comprising pairs of images in various scenarios, and the publicly
available Stanford Cars Dataset, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method over existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have received extensive concern to
improve the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, a
subarray-based scheme is investigated in terms of its effects on ergodic
spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in RIS-assisted systems. In
this scheme, the adjacent elements divided into a subarray are controlled by
one signal and share the same reflection coefficient. An upper bound of ergodic
SE is derived and an optimal phase shift design is proposed for the
subarray-based RIS. Based on the upper bound and optimal design, we obtain the
maximum of the upper bound. In particular, we analytically evaluate the effect
of the subarray-based RIS on EE since it reduces SE and power consumption
simultaneously. Numerical results verify the tightness of the upper bound,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal phase shift design for the
subarray-based RIS, and reveal the effects of the subarray-based scheme on SE
and EE.

<p class="mathjax">Literacy, or the ability to read and write, is a crucial indicator of success
in life and greater society. It is estimated that 85% of people in juvenile
delinquent systems cannot adequately read or write, that more than half of
those with substance abuse issues have complications in reading or writing and
that two-thirds of those who do not complete high school lack proper literacy
skills. Furthermore, young children who do not possess reading skills matching
grade level by the fourth grade are approximately 80% likely to not catch up at
all. Many may believe that in a developed country such as the United States,
literacy fails to be an issue; however, this is a dangerous misunderstanding.
Globally an estimated 1.19 trillion dollars are lost every year due to issues
in literacy; in the USA, the loss is an estimated 300 billion. To put it in
more shocking terms, one in five American adults still fail to comprehend basic
sentences. Making matters worse, the only tools available now to correct a lack
of reading and writing ability are found in expensive tutoring or other
programs that oftentimes fail to be able to reach the required audience. In
this paper, our team puts forward a new way of teaching English spelling and
word recognitions to grade school students in the United States: Wordification.
Wordification is a web application designed to teach English literacy using
principles of linguistics applied to the orthographic and phonological
properties of words in a manner not fully utilized previously in any
computer-based teaching application.

security, reliability, and comprehensibility of OpenAirInterface5G (OAI5G), an
open-source software framework for the exploration, development, and testing of
5G wireless communication systems. Firstly, we employ AFL++, a powerful fuzzing
tool, to fuzzy-test OAI5G with respect to its configuration files rigorously.
This extensive testing process helps identify errors, defects, and security
vulnerabilities that may evade conventional testing methods. Secondly, we
harness the capabilities of Large Language Models such as Google Bard to
automatically decipher and document the meanings of parameters within the OAI5G
codebase that are used in fuzzing. This automated parameter interpretation
streamlines subsequent analyses and facilitates more informed decision-making.
Together, these two techniques contribute to fortifying the OAI5G system,
making it more robust, secure, and understandable for developers and analysts
alike.

<p class="mathjax">In machine translation, a common problem is that the translation of certain
words even if translated can cause incomprehension of the target language
audience due to different cultural backgrounds. A solution to solve this
problem is to add explanations for these words. In a first step, we therefore
need to identify these words or phrases. In this work we explore techniques to
extract example explanations from a parallel corpus. However, the sparsity of
sentences containing words that need to be explained makes building the
training dataset extremely difficult. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic
technique to extract these explanations from a large parallel corpus.
Experiments on English-&gt;German language pair show that our method is able to
extract sentence so that more than 10% of the sentences contain explanation,
while only 1.9% of the original sentences contain explanations. In addition,
experiments on English-&gt;French and English-&gt;Chinese language pairs also show
similar conclusions. This is therefore an essential first automatic step to
create a explanation dataset. Furthermore we show that the technique is robust
for all three language pairs.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing the prevalence of domain shift as a common challenge in machine
learning, various domain generalization (DG) techniques have been developed to
enhance the performance of machine learning systems when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, data
distributions can gradually change across a sequence of sequential domains.
While current methodologies primarily focus on improving model effectiveness
within these new domains, they often overlook fairness issues throughout the
learning process. In response, we introduce an innovative framework called
Counterfactual Fairness-Aware Domain Generalization with Sequential Autoencoder
(CDSAE). This approach effectively separates environmental information and
sensitive attributes from the embedded representation of classification
features. This concurrent separation not only greatly improves model
generalization across diverse and unfamiliar domains but also effectively
addresses challenges related to unfair classification. Our strategy is rooted
in the principles of causal inference to tackle these dual issues. To examine
the intricate relationship between semantic information, sensitive attributes,
and environmental cues, we systematically categorize exogenous uncertainty
factors into four latent variables: 1) semantic information influenced by
sensitive attributes, 2) semantic information unaffected by sensitive
attributes, 3) environmental cues influenced by sensitive attributes, and 4)
environmental cues unaffected by sensitive attributes. By incorporating
fairness regularization, we exclusively employ semantic information for
classification purposes. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world
datasets substantiates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
improved accuracy levels while ensuring the preservation of fairness in the
evolving landscape of continuous domains.

While the widely-used Computer-Aided Design (CAD) method requires a
time-consuming and labor-intensive modeling process, sketch-based 3D modeling
offers a potential solution as a natural form of computer-human interaction.
However, the sparsity and ambiguity of sketches make it challenging to generate
high-fidelity content reflecting creators' ideas. Precise drawing from multiple
views or strategic step-by-step drawings is often required to tackle the
challenge but is not friendly to novice users. In this work, we introduce a

efficient inference in real-time and a structural-aware adversarial training
approach with a Stroke Enhancement Module (SEM) to capture the structural

multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among
diverse LLM agents to foster diverse thoughts and discussion for improved
consensus. ReConcile enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by holding
multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve
their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. In each
round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt'
that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent
in the previous round, (b) their uncertainties, and (c) demonstrations of
answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. This
discussion prompt enables each agent to revise their responses in light of
insights from other agents. Once a consensus is reached and the discussion
ends, ReConcile determines the final answer by leveraging the confidence of
each agent in a weighted voting scheme. We implement ReConcile with ChatGPT,
Bard, and Claude2 as the three agents. Our experimental results on various
benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of the agents (both individually and as a team), surpassing prior
single-agent and multi-agent baselines by 7.7% and also outperforming GPT-4 on
some of these datasets. We also experiment with GPT-4 itself as one of the
agents in ReConcile and demonstrate that its initial performance also improves
by absolute 10.0% through discussion and feedback from other agents. Finally,
we also analyze the accuracy after every round and observe that ReConcile
achieves better and faster consensus between agents, compared to a multi-agent
debate baseline. Our code is available at: https://github.com/dinobby/ReConcile

<p class="mathjax">The advent of autonomous driving and electrification is enabling the
deployment of Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (E-AMoD) systems, whereby
electric autonomous vehicles provide on-demand mobility. Crucially, the design
of the individual vehicles and the fleet, and the operation of the system are
strongly coupled. Hence, to maximize the system-level performance, they must be
optimized in a joint fashion. To this end, this paper presents a framework to
jointly optimize the fleet design in terms of battery capacity and number of
vehicles, and the operational strategies of the E-AMoD system, with the aim of
maximizing the operator's total profit. Specifically, we first formulate this
joint optimization problem using directed acyclic graphs as a mixed integer
linear program, which can be solved using commercial solvers with optimality
guarantees. Second, to solve large instances of the problem, we propose a
solution algorithm that solves for randomly sampled sub-problems, providing a
more conservative solution of the full problem, and devise a heuristic approach
to tackle larger individual sub-problem instances. Finally, we showcase our
framework on a real-world case study in Manhattan, where we demonstrate the
interdependence between the number of vehicles, their battery size, and
operational and fixed costs. Our results indicate that to maximize a mobility
operator's profit, a fleet of small and light vehicles with battery capacity of
20 kWh only can strike the best trade-off in terms of battery degradation,
fixed costs and operational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse training is one of the promising techniques to reduce the
computational cost of DNNs while retaining high accuracy. In particular, N:M
fine-grained structured sparsity, where only N out of consecutive M elements
can be nonzero, has attracted attention due to its hardware-friendly pattern
and capability of achieving a high sparse ratio. However, the potential to
accelerate N:M sparse DNN training has not been fully exploited, and there is a
lack of efficient hardware supporting N:M sparse training. To tackle these
challenges, this paper presents a computation-efficient training scheme for N:M
sparse DNNs using algorithm, architecture, and dataflow co-design. At the
algorithm level, a bidirectional weight pruning method, dubbed BDWP, is
proposed to leverage the N:M sparsity of weights during both forward and
backward passes of DNN training, which can significantly reduce the
computational cost while maintaining model accuracy. At the architecture level,
a sparse accelerator for DNN training, namely SAT, is developed to neatly
support both the regular dense operations and the computation-efficient N:M
sparse operations. At the dataflow level, multiple optimization methods ranging
from interleave mapping, pre-generation of N:M sparse weights, and offline
scheduling, are proposed to boost the computational efficiency of SAT. Finally,
the effectiveness of our training scheme is evaluated on a Xilinx VCU1525 FPGA
card using various DNN models and datasets. Experimental results show the SAT
accelerator with the BDWP sparse training method under 2:8 sparse ratio
achieves an average speedup of 1.75x over that with the dense training,
accompanied by a negligible accuracy loss of 0.56% on average. Furthermore, our
proposed training scheme significantly improves the training throughput by
2.97~25.22x and the energy efficiency by 1.36~3.58x over prior FPGA-based
accelerators.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Gradient Leakage (DGL) is a highly effective attack that recovers
private training images from gradient vectors. This attack casts significant
privacy challenges on distributed learning from clients with sensitive data,
where clients are required to share gradients. Defending against such attacks
requires but lacks an understanding of when and how privacy leakage happens,
mostly because of the black-box nature of deep networks. In this paper, we
propose a novel Inversion Influence Function (I$^2$F) that establishes a
closed-form connection between the recovered images and the private gradients
by implicitly solving the DGL problem. Compared to directly solving DGL, I$^2$F
is scalable for analyzing deep networks, requiring only oracle access to
gradients and Jacobian-vector products. We empirically demonstrate that I$^2$F
effectively approximated the DGL generally on different model architectures,
datasets, attack implementations, and noise-based defenses. With this novel
tool, we provide insights into effective gradient perturbation directions, the
unfairness of privacy protection, and privacy-preferred model initialization.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate load forecasting remains a formidable challenge in numerous sectors,
given the intricate dynamics of dynamic power systems, which often defy
conventional statistical models. As a response, time-series methodologies like
ARIMA and sophisticated deep learning techniques such as Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have demonstrated
their mettle by achieving enhanced predictive performance. In our
investigation, we delve into the efficacy of the relatively recent Gated
Recurrent Network (GRU) model within the context of load forecasting. GRU
models are garnering attention due to their inherent capacity to adeptly
capture and model temporal dependencies within data streams. Our methodology
entails harnessing the power of Differential Evolution, a versatile
optimization technique renowned for its prowess in delivering scalable, robust,
and globally optimal solutions, especially in scenarios involving
non-differentiable, multi-objective, or constrained optimization challenges.
Through rigorous analysis, we undertake a comparative assessment of the
proposed Gated Recurrent Network model, collaboratively fused with various
metaheuristic algorithms, evaluating their performance by leveraging
established numerical benchmarks such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our empirical investigations are conducted
using power load data originating from the Ontario province, Canada. Our
research findings cast a spotlight on the remarkable potential of
metaheuristic-augmented Gated Recurrent Network models in substantially
augmenting load forecasting precision, offering tailored, optimal
hyperparameter configurations uniquely suited to each model's performance
characteristics.

<p class="mathjax">Precise crop yield prediction is essential for improving agricultural
practices and ensuring crop resilience in varying climates. Integrating weather
data across the growing season, especially for different crop varieties, is
crucial for understanding their adaptability in the face of climate change. In
the MLCAS2021 Crop Yield Prediction Challenge, we utilized a dataset comprising
93,028 training records to forecast yields for 10,337 test records, covering
159 locations across 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces over 13 years
(2003-2015). This dataset included details on 5,838 distinct genotypes and
daily weather data for a 214-day growing season, enabling comprehensive
analysis. As one of the winning teams, we developed two novel convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures: the CNN-DNN model, combining CNN and
fully-connected networks, and the CNN-LSTM-DNN model, with an added LSTM layer
for weather variables. Leveraging the Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), we
determined optimal model weights, resulting in superior performance compared to
baseline models. The GEM model achieved lower RMSE (5.55% to 39.88%), reduced
MAE (5.34% to 43.76%), and higher correlation coefficients (1.1% to 10.79%)
when evaluated on test data. We applied the CNN-DNN model to identify
top-performing genotypes for various locations and weather conditions, aiding
genotype selection based on weather variables. Our data-driven approach is
valuable for scenarios with limited testing years. Additionally, a feature
importance analysis using RMSE change highlighted the significance of location,
MG, year, and genotype, along with the importance of weather variables MDNI and
AP.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have gained
significant attention as reduced order models (ROMs) to computationally
expensive structural analysis methods, such as finite element analysis (FEA).
Graph neural network (GNN) is a particular type of neural network which
processes data that can be represented as graphs. This allows for efficient
representation of complex geometries that can change during conceptual design
of a structure or a product. In this study, we propose a novel graph embedding
technique for efficient representation of 3D stiffened panels by considering
separate plate domains as vertices. This approach is considered using Graph
Sampling and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) to predict stress distributions in
stiffened panels with varying geometries. A comparison between a
finite-element-vertex graph representation is conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. A comprehensive parametric study is
performed to examine the effect of structural geometry on the prediction
performance. Our results demonstrate the immense potential of graph neural
networks with the proposed graph embedding method as robust reduced-order
models for 3D structures.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, a recently proposed high-cycle fatigue cohesive zone model,
which covers crack initiation and propagation with limited input parameters, is
embedded in a robust and efficient numerical framework for simulating
progressive failure in composite laminates under fatigue loading. The fatigue
cohesive zone model is enhanced with an implicit time integration scheme of the
fatigue damage variable which allows for larger cycle increments and more
efficient analyses. The method is combined with an adaptive strategy for
determining the cycle increment based on global convergence rates. Moreover, a
consistent material tangent stiffness matrix has been derived by fully
linearizing the underlying mixed-mode quasi-static model and the fatigue damage
update. The enhanced fatigue cohesive zone model is used to describe matrix
cracking and delamination in laminates. In order to allow for matrix cracks to
initiate at arbitrary locations and to avoid complex and costly mesh
generation, the phantom node version of the eXtended finite element method
(XFEM) is employed. For the insertion of new crack segments, an XFEM fatigue
crack insertion criterion is presented, which is consistent with the fatigue
cohesive zone formulation. It is shown with numerical examples that the
improved fatigue damage update enhances the accuracy, efficiency and robustness
of the numerical simulations significantly. The numerical framework is applied
to the simulation of progressive fatigue failure in an open-hole
[$\pm$45]-laminate. It is demonstrated that the numerical model is capable of
accurately and efficiently simulating the complete failure process from
distributed damage to localized failure.

<p class="mathjax">Modern Space Launch Vehicles (SLVs), being slender in shape and due to the
use of lightweight materials, are generally flexible in nature. This structural
flexibility, when coupled with sensor and actuator dynamics, can adversely
affect the control of SLV, which may lead to vehicle instability and, in the
worst-case scenario, to structural failure. This work focuses on modelling and
simulation of rigid and flexible dynamics of an SLV and its interactions with
the control system. SpaceX's Falcon 9 has been selected for this study. The
flexible modes are calculated using modal analysis in Ansys. High-fidelity
nonlinear simulation is developed which incorporates the flexible modes and
their interactions with rigid degrees of freedom. Moreover, linearized models
are developed for flexible body dynamics, over the complete trajectory until
the first stage's separation. Using classical control methods, attitude
controllers, that keep the SLV on its desired trajectory, are developed, and
multiple filters are designed to suppress the interactions of flexible
dynamics. The designed controllers along with filters are implemented in the
nonlinear simulation. Furthermore, to demonstrate the robustness of designed
controllers, Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out and results are presented.

<p class="mathjax">Many physical systems are inherently time-varying in nature. When these
systems are linearized around a trajectory, generally, the resulting system is
Linear Time-Varying (LTV). LTV systems describe an important class of linear
systems and can be thought of as a natural extension of LTI systems. However,
it is well known that, unlike LTI systems, the eigenvalues of an LTV system do
not determine its stability. In this paper, the stability conditions for a
class of LTV systems are derived. This class is composed of piecewise LTV
systems, i.e. LTV systems that are piecewise linear in time. Sufficient
conditions of stability are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) by using the Lyapunov stability criterion. The feasibility of LMIs
guarantees the stability of a given piecewise LTV system. Furthermore,
uncertain piecewise LTV systems with scalar parametric uncertainty are also
considered. Sufficient conditions for robust stability of this case are also
presented, which come out to be quasi-LMIs, which can be optimized using a
bisection algorithm to find the bounds of uncertainty for which the system is
stable. The proposed method is applied to the problem of pitch angle control of
a space launch vehicle, and the results are presented.

<p class="mathjax">PyPose is an open-source library for robot learning. It combines a
learning-based approach with physics-based optimization, which enables seamless
end-to-end robot learning. It has been used in many tasks due to its
meticulously designed application programming interface (API) and efficient
implementation. From its initial launch in early 2022, PyPose has experienced
significant enhancements, incorporating a wide variety of new features into its
platform. To satisfy the growing demand for understanding and utilizing the
library and reduce the learning curve of new users, we present the fundamental
design principle of the imperative programming interface, and showcase the
flexible usage of diverse functionalities and modules using an extremely simple
Dubins car example. We also demonstrate that the PyPose can be easily used to

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning from human demonstrations is a powerful framework to teach
robots new skills. However, the performance of the learned policies is
bottlenecked by the quality, scale, and variety of the demonstration data. In
this paper, we aim to lower the barrier to collecting large and high-quality
human demonstration data by proposing GELLO, a general framework for building
low-cost and intuitive teleoperation systems for robotic manipulation. Given a
target robot arm, we build a GELLO controller that has the same kinematic
structure as the target arm, leveraging 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf
motors. GELLO is easy to build and intuitive to use. Through an extensive user
study, we show that GELLO enables more reliable and efficient demonstration
collection compared to commonly used teleoperation devices in the imitation
learning literature such as VR controllers and 3D spacemouses. We further
demonstrate the capabilities of GELLO for performing complex bi-manual and
contact-rich manipulation tasks. To make GELLO accessible to everyone, we have
designed and built GELLO systems for 3 commonly used robotic arms: Franka, UR5,
and xArm. All software and hardware are open-sourced and can be found on our
website: https://wuphilipp.github.io/gello/.

<p class="mathjax">Hand-crafted image quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, are commonly used
to evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these
metrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one
generally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall
dissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack.
However, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions,
which, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this
paper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics
to human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5
datasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4
existing attack methods to reconstruct images from many different
classification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human
annotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal
that the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human
evaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often
contradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in
the community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based
measure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original
and reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using
an original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as
a positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on
human annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on
the semantic level. We show that SemSim has a significantly higher correlation
with human judgment compared with existing metrics. Moreover, this strong
correlation generalizes to unseen datasets, models and attack methods.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have revolutionized the field of image-based
view synthesis. However, NeRF uses straight rays and fails to deal with
complicated light path changes caused by refraction and reflection. This
prevents NeRF from successfully synthesizing transparent or specular objects,
which are ubiquitous in real-world robotics and A/VR applications. In this
paper, we introduce the refractive-reflective field. Taking the object
silhouette as input, we first utilize marching tetrahedra with a progressive
encoding to reconstruct the geometry of non-Lambertian objects and then model
refraction and reflection effects of the object in a unified framework using
Fresnel terms. Meanwhile, to achieve efficient and effective anti-aliasing, we
propose a virtual cone supersampling technique. We benchmark our method on
different shapes, backgrounds and Fresnel terms on both real-world and
synthetic datasets. We also qualitatively and quantitatively benchmark the
rendering results of various editing applications, including material editing,
object replacement/insertion, and environment illumination estimation. Codes
and data are publicly available at https://github.com/dawning77/NeRRF.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-training on Internet data has proven to be a key ingredient for broad
generalization in many modern ML systems. What would it take to enable such
capabilities in robotic reinforcement learning (RL)? Offline RL methods, which
learn from datasets of robot experience, offer one way to leverage prior data
into the robotic learning pipeline. However, these methods have a "type
mismatch" with video data (such as Ego4D), the largest prior datasets available
for robotics, since video offers observation-only experience without the action
or reward annotations needed for RL methods. In this paper, we develop a system
for leveraging large-scale human video datasets in robotic offline RL, based
entirely on learning value functions via temporal-difference learning. We show
that value learning on video datasets learns representations that are more
conducive to downstream robotic offline RL than other approaches for learning
from video data. Our system, called V-PTR, combines the benefits of
pre-training on video data with robotic offline RL approaches that train on
diverse robot data, resulting in value functions and policies for manipulation
tasks that perform better, act robustly, and generalize broadly. On several
manipulation tasks on a real WidowX robot, our framework produces policies that
greatly improve over prior methods. Our video and additional details can be
found at https://dibyaghosh.com/vptr/

<p class="mathjax">We present MosaicFusion, a simple yet effective diffusion-based data
augmentation approach for large vocabulary instance segmentation. Our method is
training-free and does not rely on any label supervision. Two key designs
enable us to employ an off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model as a useful
dataset generator for object instances and mask annotations. First, we divide
an image canvas into several regions and perform a single round of diffusion
process to generate multiple instances simultaneously, conditioning on
different text prompts. Second, we obtain corresponding instance masks by
aggregating cross-attention maps associated with object prompts across layers
and diffusion time steps, followed by simple thresholding and edge-aware
refinement processing. Without bells and whistles, our MosaicFusion can produce
a significant amount of synthetic labeled data for both rare and novel
categories. Experimental results on the challenging LVIS long-tailed and
open-vocabulary benchmarks demonstrate that MosaicFusion can significantly
improve the performance of existing instance segmentation models, especially
for rare and novel categories. Code will be released at
https://github.com/Jiahao000/MosaicFusion.

<p class="mathjax">Learning for robot navigation presents a critical and challenging task. The
scarcity and costliness of real-world datasets necessitate efficient learning
approaches. In this letter, we exploit Euclidean symmetry in planning for 2D
navigation, which originates from Euclidean transformations between reference
frames and enables parameter sharing. To address the challenges of unstructured
environments, we formulate the navigation problem as planning on a geometric
graph and develop an equivariant message passing network to perform value
iteration. Furthermore, to handle multi-camera input, we propose a learnable
equivariant layer to lift features to a desired space. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across five diverse tasks encompassing structured and unstructured
environments, along with maps of known and unknown, given point goals or
semantic goals. Our experiments confirm the substantial benefits on training
efficiency, stability, and generalization.

<p class="mathjax">Generative machine learning models can use data generated by scientific
modeling to create large quantities of novel material structures. Here, we
assess how one state-of-the-art generative model, the physics-guided crystal
generation model (PGCGM), can be used as part of the inverse design process. We
show that the default PGCGM's input space is not smooth with respect to
parameter variation, making material optimization difficult and limited. We
also demonstrate that most generated structures are predicted to be
thermodynamically unstable by a separate property-prediction model, partially
due to out-of-domain data challenges. Our findings suggest how generative
models might be improved to enable better inverse design.

<p class="mathjax">Plastic sorting is a very essential step in waste management, especially due
to the presence of multilayer plastics. These monomaterial and multimaterial
plastics are widely employed to enhance the functional properties of packaging,
combining beneficial properties in thickness, mechanical strength, and heat
tolerance. However, materials containing multiple polymer species need to be
pretreated before they can be recycled as monomaterials and therefore should
not end up in monomaterial streams. Industry 4.0 has significantly improved
materials sorting of plastic packaging in speed and accuracy compared to manual
sorting, specifically through Near Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIRHSI) that
provides an automated, fast, and accurate material characterization, without
sample preparation. Identification of multimaterials with HSI however requires
novel dedicated approaches for chemical pattern recognition. Non negative
Matrix Factorization, NMF, is widely used for the chemical resolution of
hyperspectral images. Chemically relevant model constraints may make it
specifically valuable to identify multilayer plastics through HSI.
Specifically, Multi Block Non Negative Matrix Factorization (MBNMF) with
correspondence among different chemical species constraint may be used to
evaluate the presence or absence of particular polymer species. To translate
the MBNMF model into an evidence based sorting decision, we extended the model
with an F test to distinguish between monomaterial and multimaterial objects.
The benefits of our new approach, MBNMF, were illustrated by the identification
of several plastic waste objects.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a pioneering approach for token pricing in token
economies for risk mitigation and economic stability. The paper proposes a
framework for simulating interactions between economic participants that leads
to the distribution of wealth within the economy. Using this framework, we
define a mechanism for identifying prices that achieve optimal token
distribution according to some metric and stability of economic dynamics. The
motivation to study tokenomics theory is the increasing use of tokenization,
specifically in financial infrastructures, where designing token economies is
in the forefront. Tokenomics theory establishes a quantitative framework for
token allocation amongst economic participants and implements the algorithmic
regulatory controls mechanism that reacts to changes in economic conditions,
much like a command economy. In our framework, we introduce a concept of
tokenomic taxonomy where agents in the economy are categorized into agent types
and interactions between them. This novel approach is motivated by having a
generalized model of the macroeconomy with controls being implemented through
interactions and policies. Having the defined controls allows us to measure and
readjust the wealth dynamics in the economy.

<p class="mathjax">Is more information always better? Or are there some situations in which more
information can make us worse off? Good (1966) argues that expected utility
maximizers should always accept more information if the information is
cost-free and relevant. But Good's argument presupposes that you are certain
you will update by conditionalization. If we relax this assumption and allow
agents to be uncertain about updating, these agents can be rationally required
to reject free and relevant information. Since there are good reasons to be
uncertain about updating, rationality can require you to prefer ignorance.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of data in recent years has led to the advancement and
utilization of various statistical and deep learning techniques, thus
expediting research and development activities. However, not all industries
have benefited equally from the surge in data availability, partly due to legal
restrictions on data usage and privacy regulations, such as in medicine. To
address this issue, various statistical disclosure and privacy-preserving
methods have been proposed, including the use of synthetic data generation.
Synthetic data are generated based on some existing data, with the aim of
replicating them as closely as possible and acting as a proxy for real
sensitive data. This paper presents a systematic review of methods for
generating and evaluating synthetic longitudinal patient data, a prevalent data
type in medicine. The review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines and covers
literature from five databases until the end of 2022. The paper describes 17
methods, ranging from traditional simulation techniques to modern deep learning
methods. The collected information includes, but is not limited to, method
type, source code availability, and approaches used to assess resemblance,
utility, and privacy. Furthermore, the paper discusses practical guidelines and
key considerations for developing synthetic longitudinal data generation
methods.

<p class="mathjax">We study policy evaluation of offline contextual bandits subject to
unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value using
convex programming. The generality of our estimator enables various extensions
such as sensitivity analysis with f-divergence, model selection with cross
validation and information criterion, and robust policy learning with the sharp
lower bound. Furthermore, our estimation method can be reformulated as an
empirical risk minimization problem thanks to the strong duality, which enables
us to provide strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed estimator using
techniques of the M-estimation.

<p class="mathjax">The ICASSP 2023 Acoustic Echo Cancellation Challenge is intended to stimulate
research in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), which is an important area of
speech enhancement and is still a top issue in audio communication. This is the
fourth AEC challenge and it is enhanced by adding a second track for
personalized acoustic echo cancellation, reducing the algorithmic + buffering
latency to 20ms, as well as including a full-band version of AECMOS. We open
source two large datasets to train AEC models under both single talk and double
talk scenarios. These datasets consist of recordings from more than 10,000 real
audio devices and human speakers in real environments, as well as a synthetic
dataset. We open source an online subjective test framework and provide an
objective metric for researchers to quickly test their results. The winners of
this challenge were selected based on the average mean opinion score (MOS)
achieved across all scenarios and the word accuracy (WAcc) rate.

<p class="mathjax">Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a significant public health challenge
due to its high prevalence and potential for long-term health effects. Despite
Computed Tomography (CT) being the standard diagnostic tool for mTBI, it often
yields normal results in mTBI patients despite symptomatic evidence. This fact
underscores the complexity of accurate diagnosis. In this study, we introduce
an interpretable 3D Multi-Modal Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN)
for mTBI diagnostic model enhanced with Occlusion Sensitivity Maps (OSM). Our
MRCNN model exhibits promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, demonstrating an
average accuracy of 82.4%, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 81.6%, as
validated by a five-fold cross-validation process. Notably, in comparison to
the CT-based Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the MRCNN
shows an improvement of 4.4% in specificity and 9.0% in accuracy. We show that
the OSM offers superior data-driven insights into CT images compared to the
Grad-CAM approach. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed
multi-modal model in enhancing the diagnostic precision of mTBI.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a universal sound separation (USS) method capable of
handling untrained sampling frequencies (SFs). The USS aims at separating
arbitrary sources of different types and can be the key technique to realize a
source separator that can be universally used as a preprocessor for any
downstream tasks. To realize a universal source separator, there are two
essential properties: universalities with respect to source types and recording
conditions. The former property has been studied in the USS literature, which
has greatly increased the number of source types that can be handled by a
single neural network. However, the latter property (e.g., SF) has received
less attention despite its necessity. Since the SF varies widely depending on
the downstream tasks, the universal source separator must handle a wide variety
of SFs. In this paper, to encompass the two properties, we propose an
SF-independent (SFI) extension of a computationally efficient USS network,
SuDoRM-RF. The proposed network uses our previously proposed SFI convolutional
layers, which can handle various SFs by generating convolutional kernels in
accordance with an input SF. Experiments show that signal resampling can
degrade the USS performance and the proposed method works more consistently
than signal-resampling-based methods for various SFs.

<p class="mathjax">For a two-dimensional convex body, the Kovner-Besicovitch measure of symmetry
is defined as the volume ratio of the largest centrally symmetric body
contained inside the body to the original body. A classical result states that
the Kovner-Besicovitch measure is at least $2/3$ for every convex body and
equals $2/3$ for triangles. Lassak showed that an alternative measure of
symmetry, i.e., symmetry about a line (axiality) has a value of at least $2/3$
for every convex body. However, the smallest known value of the axiality of a
convex body is around $0.81584$, achieved by a convex quadrilateral. We show
that every plane convex body has axiality at least $\frac{2}{41}(10 + 3
\sqrt{2}) \approx 0.69476$, thereby establishing a separation with the central
symmetry measure. Moreover, we find a family of convex quadrilaterals with
axiality approaching $\frac{1}{3}(\sqrt{2}+1) \approx 0.80474$. We also
establish improved bounds for a ``folding" measure of axial symmetry for plane
convex bodies. Finally, we establish improved bounds for a generalization of
axiality to high-dimensional convex bodies.

<p class="mathjax">Federated or multi-site studies have distinct advantages over single-site
studies, including increased generalizability, the ability to study
underrepresented populations, and the opportunity to study rare exposures and
outcomes. However, these studies are challenging due to the need to preserve
the privacy of each individual's data and the heterogeneity in their covariate
distributions. We propose a novel federated approach to derive valid causal
inferences for a target population using multi-site data. We adjust for
covariate shift and covariate mismatch between sites by developing
multiply-robust and privacy-preserving nuisance function estimation. Our
methodology incorporates transfer learning to estimate ensemble weights to
combine information from source sites. We show that these learned weights are
efficient and optimal under different scenarios. We showcase the finite sample
advantages of our approach in terms of efficiency and robustness compared to
existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy-preserving computational geometry is the research area on the
intersection of the domains of secure multi-party computation (SMC) and
computational geometry. As an important field, the privacy-preserving geometric
intersection (PGI) problem is when each of the multiple parties has a private
geometric graph and seeks to determine whether their graphs intersect or not
without revealing their private information. In this study, through
representing Alice's (Bob's) private geometric graph G_A (G_B) as the set of
numbered grids S_A (S_B), an efficient privacy-preserving quantum two-party
geometric intersection (PQGI) protocol is proposed. In the protocol, the oracle
operation O_A (O_B) is firstly utilized to encode the private elements of
S_A=(a_0, a_1, ..., a_(M-1)) (S_B=(b_0, b_1, ..., b_(N-1))) into the quantum
states, and then the oracle operation O_f is applied to obtain a new quantum
state which includes the XOR results between each element of S_A and S_B.
Finally, the quantum counting is introduced to get the amount (t) of the states
|a_i+b_j&gt; equaling to |0&gt;, and the intersection result can be obtained by
judging t&gt;0 or not. Compared with classical PGI protocols, our proposed
protocol not only has higher security, but also holds lower communication
complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Dual-path is a popular architecture for speech separation models (e.g.
Sepformer) which splits long sequences into overlapping chunks for its intra-
and inter-blocks that separately model intra-chunk local features and
inter-chunk global relationships. However, it has been found that inter-blocks,
which comprise half a dual-path model's parameters, contribute minimally to
performance. Thus, we propose the Single-Path Global Modulation (SPGM) block to
replace inter-blocks. SPGM is named after its structure consisting of a
parameter-free global pooling module followed by a modulation module comprising
only 2% of the model's total parameters. The SPGM block allows all transformer
layers in the model to be dedicated to local feature modelling, making the
overall model single-path. SPGM achieves 22.1 dB SI-SDRi on WSJ0-2Mix and 20.4
dB SI-SDRi on Libri2Mix, exceeding the performance of Sepformer by 0.5 dB and
0.3 dB respectively and matches the performance of recent SOTA models with up
to 8 times fewer parameters.

<p class="mathjax">During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed
tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid
spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on
computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel
processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in
the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional
features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the
objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the
differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to
focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack
specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes:
COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation
principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks
(ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly
available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was
utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing
classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50),
attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%,
98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our
model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in
diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance
surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on
the same dataset.

<p class="mathjax">This paper details our speaker diarization system designed for multi-domain,
multi-microphone casual conversations. The proposed diarization pipeline uses
weighted prediction error (WPE)-based dereverberation as a front end, then
applies end-to-end neural diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC) to each
channel separately. It integrates the diarization result obtained from each
channel using diarization output voting error reduction plus overlap
(DOVER-LAP). To harness the knowledge from the target domain and results
integrated across all channels, we apply self-supervised adaptation for each
session by retraining the EEND-VC with pseudo-labels derived from DOVER-LAP.
The proposed system was incorporated into NTT's submission for the distant
automatic speech recognition task in the CHiME-7 challenge. Our system achieved
65 % and 62 % relative improvements on development and eval sets compared to
the organizer-provided VC-based baseline diarization system, securing third
place in diarization performance.

<p class="mathjax">The bin packing is a well-known NP-Hard problem in the domain of artificial
intelligence, posing significant challenges in finding efficient solutions.
Conversely, recent advancements in quantum technologies have shown promising
potential for achieving substantial computational speedup, particularly in
certain problem classes, such as combinatorial optimization. In this study, we
introduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
formulation designed specifically for bin packing and suitable for quantum
computation. QAL-BP utilizes the augmented Lagrangian method to incorporate the
bin packing constraints into the objective function while also facilitating an
analytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust, penalty
multipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model
that eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent
Lagrangian coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO
formulations for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed
approach, we conduct experiments on a set of bin-packing instances using a real
Quantum Annealing device. Additionally, we compare the results with those
obtained from two different classical solvers, namely simulated annealing and
Gurobi. The experimental findings not only confirm the correctness of the
proposed formulation but also demonstrate the potential of quantum computation
in effectively solving the bin-packing problem, particularly as more reliable
quantum technology becomes available.

<p class="mathjax">Our aim is to estimate the largest community (a.k.a., mode) in a population
composed of multiple disjoint communities. This estimation is performed in a
fixed confidence setting via sequential sampling of individuals with
replacement. We consider two sampling models: (i) an identityless model,
wherein only the community of each sampled individual is revealed, and (ii) an
identity-based model, wherein the learner is able to discern whether or not
each sampled individual has been sampled before, in addition to the community
of that individual. The former model corresponds to the classical problem of
identifying the mode of a discrete distribution, whereas the latter seeks to
capture the utility of identity information in mode estimation. For each of
these models, we establish information theoretic lower bounds on the expected
number of samples needed to meet the prescribed confidence level, and propose
sound algorithms with a sample complexity that is provably asymptotically
optimal. Our analysis highlights that identity information can indeed be
utilized to improve the efficiency of community mode estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Recent progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been coupled with a
substantial increase in the model sizes, which may now contain billions of
parameters, leading to slow inferences even with adapted hardware. In this
context, several ASR models exist in various sizes, with different inference
costs leading to different performance levels. Based on the observation that
smaller models perform optimally on large parts of testing corpora, we propose
to train a decision module, that would allow, given an audio sample, to use the
smallest sufficient model leading to a good transcription. We apply our
approach to two Whisper models with different sizes. By keeping the decision
process computationally efficient, we build a decision module that allows
substantial computational savings with reduced performance drops.

<p class="mathjax">Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a pivotal role in enhancing
human-computer interaction by enabling a deeper understanding of emotional
states across a wide range of applications, contributing to more empathetic and
effective communication. This study proposes an innovative approach that
integrates self-supervised feature extraction with supervised classification
for emotion recognition from small audio segments. In the preprocessing step,
to eliminate the need of crafting audio features, we employed a self-supervised
feature extractor, based on the Wav2Vec model, to capture acoustic features
from audio data. Then, the output featuremaps of the preprocessing step are fed
to a custom designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to perform
emotion classification. Utilizing the ShEMO dataset as our testing ground, the
proposed method surpasses two baseline methods, i.e. support vector machine
classifier and transfer learning of a pretrained CNN. comparing the propose
method to the state-of-the-art methods in SER task indicates the superiority of
the proposed method. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of deep
unsupervised feature learning in elevating the landscape of SER, offering
enhanced emotional comprehension in the realm of human-computer interactions.

<p class="mathjax">Two quantum key agreement protocols using Bell states and Bell measurement
were recently proposed by Shukla et al.(Quantum Inf. Process. 13(11),
2391-2405, 2014). However, Zhu et al. pointed out that there are some security
flaws and proposed an improved version (Quantum Inf. Process. 14(11),
4245-4254, 2015). In this study, we will show Zhu et al.'s improvement still
exists some security problems, and its efficiency is not high enough. For
solving these problems, we utilize four Pauli operations {I, Z, X, Y } to
encode two bits instead of the original two operations {I,X} to encode one bit,
and then propose an efficient and secure arbitrary N-party quantum key
agreement protocol. In the protocol, the channel checking with decoy single
photons is introduced to avoid the eavesdropper's flip attack, and a
post-measurement mechanism is used to prevent against the collusion attack. The
security analysis shows the present protocol can guarantee the correctness,
security, privacy and fairness of quantum key agreement.

<p class="mathjax">We establish a collection of closed-loop guarantees and propose a scalable,
Newton-type optimization algorithm for distributionally robust model predictive
control (DRMPC) applied to linear systems, zero-mean disturbances, convex
constraints, and quadratic costs. Via standard assumptions for the terminal
cost and constraint, we establish distribtionally robust long-term and
stage-wise performance guarantees for the closed-loop system. We further
demonstrate that a common choice of the terminal cost, i.e., as the solution to
the discrete-algebraic Riccati equation, renders the origin input-to-state
stable for the closed-loop system. This choice of the terminal cost also
ensures that the exact long-term performance of the closed-loop system is
independent of the choice of ambiguity set the for DRMPC formulation. Thus, we
establish conditions under which DRMPC does not provide a long-term performance
benefit relative to stochastic MPC (SMPC). To solve the proposed DRMPC
optimization problem, we propose a Newton-type algorithm that empirically
achieves superlinear convergence by solving a quadratic program at each
iteration and guarantees the feasibility of each iterate. We demonstrate the
implications of the closed-loop guarantees and the scalability of the proposed
algorithm via two examples.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has improved the performance
on downstream phoneme recognition versus supervised models. Training SSRL
models requires a large amount of pre-training data and this poses a challenge
for low resource languages. A common approach is transferring knowledge from
other languages. Instead, we propose to use audio augmentation to pre-train
SSRL models in a low resource condition and evaluate phoneme recognition as
downstream task. We performed a systematic comparison of augmentation
techniques, namely: pitch variation, noise addition, accented target-language
speech and other language speech. We found combined augmentations (noise/pitch)
was the best augmentation strategy outperforming accent and language knowledge
transfer. We compared the performance with various quantities and types of
pre-training data. We examined the scaling factor of augmented data to achieve
equivalent performance to models pre-trained with target domain speech. Our
findings suggest that for resource constrained languages, in-domain synthetic
augmentation can outperform knowledge transfer from accented or other language
speech.

large pre-trained weakly supervised models, namely Whisper, to create embedding
features. The first part of this study investigates the correlation between the

with subjective quality and intelligibility scores. The second part evaluates
the effectiveness of Whisper in deploying a more robust speech assessment

that Whisper's embedding features correlate more strongly with subjective

to more accurate prediction performance achieved by MOSA-Net+. Moreover,
combining the embedding features from Whisper and SSL models only leads to
marginal improvement. As compared to MOSA-Net and other SSL-based speech

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces an improved duration informed attention neural network
(DurIAN-E) for expressive and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
Inherited from the original DurIAN model, an auto-regressive model structure in
which the alignments between the input linguistic information and the output
acoustic features are inferred from a duration model is adopted. Meanwhile the
proposed DurIAN-E utilizes multiple stacked SwishRNN-based Transformer blocks
as linguistic encoders. Style-Adaptive Instance Normalization (SAIN) layers are
exploited into frame-level encoders to improve the modeling ability of
expressiveness. A denoiser incorporating both denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) for mel-spectrograms and SAIN modules is conducted to further
improve the synthetic speech quality and expressiveness. Experimental results
prove that the proposed expressive TTS model in this paper can achieve better
performance than the state-of-the-art approaches in both subjective mean

<p class="mathjax">Background: View planning for the acquisition of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) imaging remains a demanding task in clinical practice. Purpose: Existing
approaches to its automation relied either on an additional volumetric image
not typically acquired in clinic routine, or on laborious manual annotations of
cardiac structural landmarks. This work presents a clinic-compatible,
annotation-free system for automatic CMR view planning. Methods: The system
mines the spatial relationship, more specifically, locates the intersecting
lines, between the target planes and source views, and trains deep networks to
regress heatmaps defined by distances from the intersecting lines. The
intersection lines are the prescription lines prescribed by the technologists
at the time of image acquisition using cardiac landmarks, and retrospectively
identified from the spatial relationship. As the spatial relationship is
self-contained in properly stored data, the need for additional manual
annotation is eliminated. In addition, the interplay of multiple target planes
predicted in a source view is utilized in a stacked hourglass architecture to
gradually improve the regression. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is
proposed to aggregate information from the predicted heatmaps for all the
source views of a target plane, for a globally optimal prescription, mimicking
the similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Results: The
experiments include 181 CMR exams. Our system yields the mean angular
difference and point-to-plane distance of 5.68 degrees and 3.12 mm,
respectively. It not only achieves superior accuracy to existing approaches
including conventional atlas-based and newer deep-learning-based in prescribing
the four standard CMR planes but also demonstrates prescription of the first
cardiac-anatomy-oriented plane(s) from the body-oriented scout.

<p class="mathjax">Proximal causal learning is a promising framework for identifying the causal
effect under the existence of unmeasured confounders. Within this framework,
the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in
estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the
current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the
treatment can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary
obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the
original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and
introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To
address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well
handle continuous treatments. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its
oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further,
we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then
provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error.
We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and
real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">The representations of neural networks are often compared to those of
biological systems by performing regression between the neural network
responses and those measured from biological systems. Many different
state-of-the-art deep neural networks yield similar neural predictions, but it
remains unclear how to differentiate among models that perform equally well at
predicting neural responses. To gain insight into this, we use a recent
theoretical framework that relates the generalization error from regression to
the spectral bias of the model activations and the alignment of the neural
responses onto the learnable subspace of the model. We extend this theory to
the case of regression between model activations and neural responses, and
define geometrical properties describing the error embedding geometry. We test
a large number of deep neural networks that predict visual cortical activity
and show that there are multiple types of geometries that result in low neural
prediction error as measured via regression. The work demonstrates that
carefully decomposing representational metrics can provide interpretability of
how models are capturing neural activity and points the way towards improved
models of neural activity.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the focus
of survival analysis has shifted from examining clinical indicators to
incorporating genomic profiles with pathological images. However, existing
methods either directly adopt a straightforward fusion of pathological features
and genomic profiles for survival prediction, or take genomic profiles as
guidance to integrate the features of pathological images. The former would
overlook intrinsic cross-modal correlations. The latter would discard
pathological information irrelevant to gene expression. To address these
issues, we present a Cross-Modal Translation and Alignment (CMTA) framework to
explore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential
complementary information. Specifically, we construct two parallel
encoder-decoder structures for multi-modal data to integrate intra-modal
information and generate cross-modal representation. Taking the generated
cross-modal representation to enhance and recalibrate intra-modal
representation can significantly improve its discrimination for comprehensive
survival analysis. To explore the intrinsic crossmodal correlations, we further
design a cross-modal attention module as the information bridge between
different modalities to perform cross-modal interactions and transfer
complementary information. Our extensive experiments on five public TCGA
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Problems based on the structure of graphs -- for example finding cliques,
independent sets, or colourings -- are of fundamental importance in classical
complexity. It is well motivated to consider similar problems about quantum
graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs. Defining
well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs faces several technical
challenges, and consequently the connections between quantum graphs and
complexity have been underexplored.
<br />In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs.
Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and
quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels
induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph.
We also use this approach to reimagine the clique and independent set problems
for classical graphs, by taking the inputs to be circuits of deterministic or
noisy channels which implicitly determine confusability graphs. We show that,
by varying the collection of channels in the language, these give rise to
complete problems for the classes $\textsf{NP}$, $\textsf{MA}$, $\textsf{QMA}$,
and $\textsf{QMA}(2)$. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem
whose natural quantisation is $\textsf{QMA}(2)$, rather than $\textsf{QMA}$,
which is commonly assumed.
<br />To prove the results in the quantum case, we make use of methods inspired by
self-testing. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we include a new
proof of the reduction of $\textsf{QMA}(k)$ to $\textsf{QMA}(2)$ via cliques
for quantum graphs. We also study the complexity of a version of the
independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence
that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical
case where the clique and independent set problems are equivalent.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been developed and applied to
drug-protein binding prediction to identify the key chemical structures in a
drug that have active interactions with the target proteins. However, the key
structures identified by the current explainable GNN models are typically
chemically invalid. Furthermore, a threshold needs to be manually selected to
pinpoint the key structures from the rest. To overcome the limitations of the
current explainable GNN models, we propose our SLGNN, which stands for using
Sparse Learning to Graph Neural Networks. Our SLGNN relies on using a
chemical-substructure-based graph (where nodes are chemical substructures) to
represent a drug molecule. Furthermore, SLGNN incorporates generalized fussed
lasso with message-passing algorithms to identify connected subgraphs that are
critical for the drug-protein binding prediction. Due to the use of the
chemical-substructure-based graph, it is guaranteed that any subgraphs in a
drug identified by our SLGNN are chemically valid structures. These structures
can be further interpreted as the key chemical structures for the drug to bind
to the target protein. We demonstrate the explanatory power of our SLGNN by
first showing all the key structures identified by our SLGNN are chemically
valid. In addition, we illustrate that the key structures identified by our
SLGNN have more predictive power than the key structures identified by the
competing methods. At last, we use known drug-protein binding data to show the
key structures identified by our SLGNN contain most of the binding sites.

<p class="mathjax">Keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of identifying a set of predefined
words in audio streams. With the advances seen recently with deep neural
networks, it has become a popular technology to activate and control small
devices, such as voice assistants. Relying on such models for edge devices,
however, can be challenging due to hardware constraints. Moreover, as
adversarial attacks have increased against voice-based technologies, developing
solutions robust to such attacks has become crucial. In this work, we propose
VIC-KD, a robust distillation recipe for model compression and adversarial
robustness. Using self-supervised speech representations, we show that imposing
geometric priors to the latent representations of both Teacher and Student
models leads to more robust target models. Experiments on the Google Speech
Commands datasets show that the proposed methodology improves upon current
state-of-the-art robust distillation methods, such as ARD and RSLAD, by 12% and
8% in robust accuracy, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Brittle solids are often toughened by adding a second-phase material. This
practice often results in composites with material heterogeneities on the meso
scale: large compared to the scale of the process zone but small compared to
that of the application. The specific configuration (both geometrical and
mechanical) of this mesoscale heterogeneity is generally recognized as
important in determining crack propagation and, subsequently, the (effective)
toughness of the composite. Here, we systematically investigate how dynamic
crack propagation is affected by mesoscale heterogeneities taking the form of
an array of inclusions. Using a variational phase-field approach, we compute
the apparent crack speed and fracture energy dissipation rate to compare crack
propagation under Mode-I loading across different configurations of these
inclusions. If fixing the volume fraction of inclusions, matching the inclusion
size to the K-dominance zone size gives rise to the best toughening outcome.
Conversely, if varying the volume fraction of inclusions, a lower volume
fraction configuration can lead to a better toughening outcome if and only if
the inclusion size approaches from above the size of the K-dominance zone.
Since the size of the K-dominance zone can be estimated \textit{a priori} given
an understanding of the application scenario and material availability, we can,
in principle, exploit this estimation to design a material's mesoscale
heterogeneity that optimally balances the tradeoff between strength and
toughness. This paves the way for realizing functional (meta-)materials against
crack propagation in extreme environments.

the texture of the image. Consistency in reconstruction kernels is important as
the underlying CT texture can impact measurements during quantitative image
analysis. Harmonization (i.e., kernel conversion) minimizes differences in
measurements due to inconsistent reconstruction kernels. Existing methods
investigate harmonization of CT scans in single or multiple manufacturers.
However, these methods require paired scans of hard and soft reconstruction
kernels that are spatially and anatomically aligned. Additionally, a large
number of models need to be trained across different kernel pairs within
manufacturers. In this study, we adopt an unpaired image translation approach
to investigate harmonization between and across reconstruction kernels from
different manufacturers by constructing a multipath cycle generative
adversarial network (GAN). We use hard and soft reconstruction kernels from the
Siemens and GE vendors from the National Lung Screening Trial dataset. We use
50 scans from each reconstruction kernel and train a multipath cycle GAN. To
evaluate the effect of harmonization on the reconstruction kernels, we
harmonize 50 scans each from Siemens hard kernel, GE soft kernel and GE hard
kernel to a reference Siemens soft kernel (B30f) and evaluate percent
emphysema. We fit a linear model by considering the age, smoking status, sex
and vendor and perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the emphysema scores.
Our approach minimizes differences in emphysema measurement and highlights the
impact of age, sex, smoking status and vendor on emphysema quantification.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate two popular end-to-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models, namely Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
and RNN-Transducer (RNN-T), for offline recognition of voice search queries,
with up to 2B model parameters. The encoders of our models use the neural
architecture of Google's universal speech model (USM), with additional funnel
pooling layers to significantly reduce the frame rate and speed up training and
inference. We perform extensive studies on vocabulary size, time reduction
strategy, and its generalization performance on long-form test sets. Despite
the speculation that, as the model size increases, CTC can be as good as RNN-T
which builds label dependency into the prediction, we observe that a 900M RNN-T
clearly outperforms a 1.8B CTC and is more tolerant to severe time reduction,
although the WER gap can be largely removed by LM shallow fusion.

<p class="mathjax">The detailed images produced by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provide
life-critical information for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.
To provide standardized acquisition, interpretation and usage of the complex
MRI images, the PI-RADS v2 guideline was proposed. An automated segmentation
following the guideline facilitates consistent and precise lesion detection,
staging and treatment. The guideline recommends a division of the prostate into
four zones, PZ (peripheral zone), TZ (transition zone), DPU (distal prostatic
urethra) and AFS (anterior fibromuscular stroma). Not every zone shares a
boundary with the others and is present in every slice. Further, the
representations captured by a single model might not suffice for all zones.
This motivated us to design a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN),
where each branch captures the representations of the connected zones
separately. Further, the representations from different branches act
complementary to each other at the second stage of training, where they are
fine-tuned through an unsupervised loss. The loss penalises the difference in
predictions from the two branches for the same class. We also incorporate
multi-task learning in our framework to further improve the segmentation
accuracy. The proposed approach improves the segmentation accuracy of the
baseline (mean absolute symmetric distance) by 7.56%, 11.00%, 58.43% and 19.67%
for PZ, TZ, DPU and AFS zones respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Active matter systems, from self-propelled colloids to motile bacteria, are
characterized by the conversion of free energy into useful work at the
microscopic scale. These systems generically involve physics beyond the reach
of equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a persistent challenge has been to
understand the nature of their nonequilibrium states. The entropy production
rate and the magnitude of the steady-state probability current provide
quantitative ways to do so by measuring the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry
and the strength of nonequilibrium transport of measure. Yet, their efficient
computation has remained elusive, as they depend on the system's unknown and
high-dimensional probability density. Here, building upon recent advances in
generative modeling, we develop a deep learning framework that estimates the
score of this density. We show that the score, together with the microscopic
equations of motion, gives direct access to the entropy production rate, the
probability current, and their decomposition into local contributions from
individual particles, spatial regions, and degrees of freedom. To represent the
score, we introduce a novel, spatially-local transformer-based network
architecture that learns high-order interactions between particles while
respecting their underlying permutation symmetry. We demonstrate the broad
utility and scalability of the method by applying it to several
high-dimensional systems of interacting active particles undergoing
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We show that a single instance of our
network trained on a system of 4096 particles at one packing fraction can
generalize to other regions of the phase diagram, including systems with as
many as 32768 particles. We use this observation to quantify the spatial
structure of the departure from equilibrium in MIPS as a function of the number
of particles and the packing fraction.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the Wasserstein metric on the Gaussian mixture models (GMMs),
which is defined as the pullback of the full Wasserstein metric on the space of
smooth probability distributions with finite second moment. It derives a class
of Wasserstein metrics on probability simplices over one-dimensional bounded
homogeneous lattices via a scaling limit of the Wasserstein metric on GMMs.
Specifically, for a sequence of GMMs whose variances tend to zero, we prove
that the limit of the Wasserstein metric exists after certain renormalization.
Generalizations of this metric in general GMMs are established, including
inhomogeneous lattice models whose lattice gaps are not the same, extended GMMs
whose mean parameters of Gaussian components can also change, and the
second-order metric containing high-order information of the scaling limit. We
further study the Wasserstein gradient flows on GMMs for three typical
functionals: potential, internal, and interaction energies. Numerical examples
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GMM models for approximating
Wasserstein gradient flows.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning has emerged as a viable distributed solution to train
machine learning models without the actual need to share data with the central
aggregator. However, standard neural network-based federated learning models
have been shown to be susceptible to data leakage from the gradients shared
with the server. In this work, we introduce federated learning with variational
quantum circuit model built using expressive encoding maps coupled with
overparameterized ans\"atze. We show that expressive maps lead to inherent
privacy against gradient inversion attacks, while overparameterization ensures
model trainability. Our privacy framework centers on the complexity of solving
the system of high-degree multivariate Chebyshev polynomials generated by the
gradients of quantum circuit. We present compelling arguments highlighting the
inherent difficulty in solving these equations, both in exact and approximate
scenarios. Additionally, we delve into machine learning-based attack strategies
and establish a direct connection between overparameterization in the original
federated learning model and underparameterization in the attack model.
Furthermore, we provide numerical scaling arguments showcasing that
underparameterization of the expressive map in the attack model leads to the
loss landscape being swamped with exponentially many spurious local minima
points, thus making it extremely hard to realize a successful attack. This
provides a strong claim, for the first time, that the nature of quantum machine
learning models inherently helps prevent data leakage in federated learning.

<p class="mathjax">Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare by providing
non-invasive visualisation of internal structures and abnormalities, enabling
early disease detection, accurate diagnosis, and treatment planning. This study
aims to explore the application of deep learning models, particularly focusing
on the UNet architecture and its variants, in medical image segmentation. We
seek to evaluate the performance of these models across various challenging
medical image segmentation tasks, addressing issues such as image
normalization, resizing, architecture choices, loss function design, and
hyperparameter tuning. The findings reveal that the standard UNet, when
extended with a deep network layer, is a proficient medical image segmentation
model, while the Res-UNet and Attention Res-UNet architectures demonstrate
smoother convergence and superior performance, particularly when handling fine
image details. The study also addresses the challenge of high class imbalance
through careful preprocessing and loss function definitions. We anticipate that
the results of this study will provide useful insights for researchers seeking
to apply these models to new medical imaging problems and offer guidance and
best practices for their implementation.

<p class="mathjax">Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

<p class="mathjax">Conformers have recently been proposed as a promising modelling approach for
automatic speech recognition (ASR), outperforming recurrent neural
network-based approaches and transformers. Nevertheless, in general, the
performance of these end-to-end models, especially attention-based models, is
particularly degraded in the case of long utterances. To address this
limitation, we propose adding a fully-differentiable memory-augmented neural
network between the encoder and decoder of a conformer. This external memory
can enrich the generalization for longer utterances since it allows the system
to store and retrieve more information recurrently. Notably, we explore the
neural Turing machine (NTM) that results in our proposed Conformer-NTM model
architecture for ASR. Experimental results using Librispeech train-clean-100
and train-960 sets show that the proposed system outperforms the baseline
conformer without memory for long utterances.
