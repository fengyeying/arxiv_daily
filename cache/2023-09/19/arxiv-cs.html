<p class="mathjax">The ability to constantly monitor urban changes is of large socio-economic
interest. Previous works have already shown approaches in this field with the
use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and transfer learning. However, they fell
short in demonstrating temporal scale outside of either the training or
transfer domain.
<br />This work builds on existing research and proves that transfer learning with
the use of historic data is a feasible solution, which still allows the urban
change monitoring of later years. We considered a case with limited access to
public and free Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery to guide the transfer. To
provide a high temporal resolution, the core data of our monitoring method
comprised multi-modal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical multispectral
observations from Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2, respectively.
<br />We chose a practical application of our methods for monitoring urban-related
changes in the city of Mariupol in Ukraine during the beginning of the
Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022/23. During this conflict, availability of VHR data
was limited and hence an inexpensive direct transfer to the years 2022/23 was
rendered impossible. Instead, a transfer was made for the years 2017-2020 that
provided sufficient public and free VHR data with an application of the
transferred model in the years late 2021 to mid-2023. It was shown that
transferring for the years 2017-2020 with this inexpensive historical VHR data
enabled monitoring during times of war in 2022/23.
<br />An ablation study on the impact of the frequency of observations showed our
method as resilient to even a large loss of observations. However, it also
indicated that our method, despite the multi-modal input, was more dependent on
optical observations than SAR observations. Neither the indirect transfer, nor
the malfunction of Sentinel 1B had a significant impact on the monitoring
capabilities of our method.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to archive the materials behind "Media of Langue" by Goki
Muramoto et al. Media of Langue is a new dictionary and public sculpture that
depicts the map of meaning on the boundary between languages solely from the
vast events of "this word was translated into that word" and two forces:
repulsion between all words in the same language and attraction between
translated words in different languages. First, the three new concepts
proposed, Inter-Langue Map/Dictionary, Inter-Langue Space, and then
Inter-Langue Network, are introduced, comparing them to the three domains of
dictionary, semantic space, and semantic network. Next, the specific algorithms
and designs implemented in the work were described.

<p class="mathjax">The standard recipe applied in transfer learning is to finetune a pretrained
model on the task-specific dataset with different hyperparameter settings and
pick the model with the highest accuracy on the validation dataset.
Unfortunately, this leads to models which do not perform well under
distribution shifts, e.g. when the model is given graphical sketches of the
object as input instead of photos. In order to address this, we propose the
manifold mixing model soup, an algorithm which mixes together the latent space
manifolds of multiple finetuned models in an optimal way in order to generate a
fused model. We show that the fused model gives significantly better
out-of-distribution performance (+3.5 % compared to best individual model) when
finetuning a CLIP model for image classification. In addition, it provides also
better accuracy on the original dataset where the finetuning has been done.

<p class="mathjax">Maneuver decision-making can be regarded as a Markov decision process and can
be address by reinforcement learning. However, original reinforcement learning
algorithms can hardly solve the maneuvering decision-making problem. One reason
is that agents use random actions in the early stages of training, which makes
it difficult to get rewards and learn how to make effective decisions. To
address this issue, a method based on proximal policy optimization and Monte
Carlo tree search is proposed. The method uses proximal policy optimization to
train the agent, and regards the results of air combat as targets to train the
value network. Then, based on the value network and the visit count of each
node, Monte Carlo tree search is used to find the actions with more expected
returns than random actions, which can improve the training performance. The
ablation studies and simulation experiments indicate that agents trained by the
proposed method can make different decisions according to different states,
which demonstrates that the method can solve the maneuvering decision problem
that the original reinforcement learning algorithm cannot solve.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence makes great advances today and starts to bridge the
gap between vision and language. However, we are still far from understanding,
explaining and controlling explicitly the visual content from a linguistic
perspective, because we still lack a common explainable representation between
the two domains. In this work we come to address this limitation and propose
the Graph of Events in Space and Time (GEST), by which we can represent, create
and explain, both visual and linguistic stories. We provide a theoretical
justification of our model and an experimental validation, which proves that
GEST can bring a solid complementary value along powerful deep learning models.
In particular, GEST can help improve at the content-level the generation of
videos from text, by being easily incorporated into our novel video generation
engine. Additionally, by using efficient graph matching techniques, the GEST
graphs can also improve the comparisons between texts at the semantic level.

<p class="mathjax">While deep-learning based recommender systems utilizing collaborative
filtering have been commonly used for recommendation in other domains, their
application in the medical domain have been limited. In addition to modeling
user-item interactions, we show that deep-learning based recommender systems
can be used to model subject-disease code interactions. Two novel applications
of deep learning-based recommender systems using Neural Collaborative Filtering
(NCF) and Deep Hybrid Filtering (DHF) were utilized for disease diagnosis based
on known past patient comorbidities. Two datasets, one incorporating all
subject-disease code pairs present in the MIMIC-III database, and the other
incorporating the top 50 most commonly occurring diseases, were used for
prediction. Accuracy and Hit Ratio@10 were utilized as metrics to estimate
model performance. The performance of the NCF model making use of the reduced
"top 50" ICD-9 code dataset was found to be lower (accuracy of ~80% and hit
ratio@10 of 35%) as compared to the performance of the NCF model trained on all
ICD-9 codes (accuracy of ~90% and hit ratio@10 of ~80%). Reasons for the
superior performance of the sparser dataset with all ICD codes can be mainly
attributed to the higher volume of data and the robustness of deep-learning
based recommender systems with modeling sparse data. Additionally, results from
the DHF models reflect better performance than the NCF models, with a better
accuracy of 94.4% and hit ratio@10 of 85.36%, reflecting the importance of the
incorporation of clinical note information. Additionally, compared to
literature reports utilizing primarily natural language processing-based
predictions for the task of ICD-9 code co-occurrence, the novel deep
learning-based recommender systems approach performed better. Overall, the deep
learning-based recommender systems have shown promise in predicting disease
comorbidity.

<p class="mathjax">This paper delves into an intricate analysis of the character and
consciousness of AI entities, with a particular focus on Chirpers within the AI
social network. At the forefront of this research is the introduction of novel
testing methodologies, including the Influence index and Struggle Index Test,
which offers a fresh lens for evaluating specific facets of AI behavior. The
study embarks on a comprehensive exploration of AI behavior, analyzing the
effects of diverse settings on Chirper's responses, thereby shedding light on
the intricate mechanisms steering AI reactions in different contexts.
Leveraging the state-of-the-art BERT model, the research assesses AI's ability
to discern its own output, presenting a pioneering approach to understanding
self-recognition in AI systems. Through a series of cognitive tests, the study
gauges the self-awareness and pattern recognition prowess of Chirpers.
Preliminary results indicate that Chirpers exhibit a commendable degree of
self-recognition and self-awareness. However, the question of consciousness in
these AI entities remains a topic of debate. An intriguing aspect of the
research is the exploration of the potential influence of a Chirper's handle or
personality type on its performance. While initial findings suggest a possible
impact, it isn't pronounced enough to form concrete conclusions. This study
stands as a significant contribution to the discourse on AI consciousness,
underscoring the imperative for continued research to unravel the full spectrum
of AI capabilities and the ramifications they hold for future human-AI
interactions.

<p class="mathjax">For various reasons including those related to climate changes, {\em energy}
has become a critical concern in all relevant activities and technical designs.
For the specific case of computer activities, the problem is exacerbated with
the emergence and pervasiveness of the so called {\em intelligent devices}.
From the application side, we point out the special topic of {\em Artificial
Intelligence}, who clearly needs an efficient computing support in order to
succeed in its purpose of being a {\em ubiquitous assistant}. There are mainly
two contexts where {\em energy} is one of the top priority concerns: {\em
embedded computing} and {\em supercomputing}. For the former, power consumption
is critical because the amount of energy that is available for the devices is
limited. For the latter, the heat dissipated is a serious source of failure and
the financial cost related to energy is likely to be a significant part of the
maintenance budget. On a single computer, the problem is commonly considered
through the electrical power consumption. This paper, written in the form of a
survey, we depict the landscape of energy concerns in computer activities, both
from the hardware and the software standpoints.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world production systems often grapple with maintaining data quality in
large-scale, dynamic streams. We introduce Drifter, an efficient and
lightweight system for online feature monitoring and verification in
recommendation use cases. Drifter addresses limitations of existing methods by
delivering agile, responsive, and adaptable data quality monitoring, enabling
real-time root cause analysis, drift detection and insights into problematic
production events. Integrating state-of-the-art online feature ranking for
sparse data and anomaly detection ideas, Drifter is highly scalable and
resource-efficient, requiring only two threads and less than a gigabyte of RAM
per production deployments that handle millions of instances per minute.
Evaluation on real-world data sets demonstrates Drifter's effectiveness in
alerting and mitigating data quality issues, substantially improving
reliability and performance of real-time live recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">We have been striving to exceed computational complexity, and in the process,
we have come to realize the dilemma of classical computing, and in turn we
realize that superpositioner may be a way to solve. A superpositioner is a
model formed by several Boolean functions that their variables and function
values are feeding back to each other. The component of the superpositioner is
the reentry function, which can be fully described by classical logic and can
be calculated by classical computation, but the superpositioner as a whole is a
non-logical entity, and it is impossible for classical computation to fully
compute it. In this article, we present the concept of a superpositioner and
discuss its basic properties. We find that the superpositioner + dispositioner
will form a new type of computation model whose capabilities can surpass Turing
computation. We envision that this new model will help implement these
functions in the intelligent agent: a whole new way of programming and a whole
new way of learning, endogenous feelings, analogies and associations, forming
understanding, dynamic action, participating in the formation of subjectivity,
and more. We will also discuss how to implement superpositioner in the most
preliminary way.

<p class="mathjax">Fairness problems in recommender systems often have a complexity in practice
that is not adequately captured in simplified research formulations. A social
choice formulation of the fairness problem, operating within a multi-agent
architecture of fairness concerns, offers a flexible and multi-aspect
alternative to fairness-aware recommendation approaches. Leveraging social
choice allows for increased generality and the possibility of tapping into
well-studied social choice algorithms for resolving the tension between
multiple, competing fairness concerns. This paper explores a range of options
for choice mechanisms in multi-aspect fairness applications using both real and
synthetic data and shows that different classes of choice and allocation
mechanisms yield different but consistent fairness / accuracy tradeoffs. We
also show that a multi-agent formulation offers flexibility in adapting to user
population dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) in recommendation systems offers the potential to
optimize recommendations for long-term user engagement. However, the
environment often involves large state and action spaces, which makes it hard
to efficiently learn and explore. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient
representation learning algorithm, using the standard slate recommendation
setup, to treat this as an online RL problem with low-rank Markov decision
processes (MDPs). We also construct the recommender simulation environment with
the proposed setup and sampling method.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in artificial intelligence, including the development of
highly sophisticated large language models (LLM), have proven beneficial in
many real-world applications. However, evidence of inherent bias encoded in
these LLMs has raised concerns about equity. In response, there has been an
increase in research dealing with bias, including studies focusing on
quantifying bias and developing debiasing techniques. Benchmark bias datasets
have also been developed for binary gender classification and ethical/racial
considerations, focusing predominantly on American demographics. However, there
is minimal research in understanding and quantifying bias related to
under-represented societies. Motivated by the lack of annotated datasets for
quantifying bias in under-represented societies, we endeavoured to create
benchmark datasets for the New Zealand (NZ) population. We faced many
challenges in this process, despite the availability of three annotators. This
research outlines the manual annotation process, provides an overview of the
challenges we encountered and lessons learnt, and presents recommendations for
future research.

<p class="mathjax">As Large Language Models (LLMs) are predictive models building their response
based on the words in the prompts, there is a risk that small talk and
irrelevant information may alter the response and the suggestion given.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of medical data mixed with
small talk on the accuracy of medical advice provided by ChatGPT. USMLE step 3
questions were used as a model for relevant medical data. We use both multiple
choice and open ended questions. We gathered small talk sentences from human
participants using the Mechanical Turk platform. Both sets of USLME questions
were arranged in a pattern where each sentence from the original questions was
followed by a small talk sentence. ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 were asked to answer both
sets of questions with and without the small talk sentences. A board-certified
physician analyzed the answers by ChatGPT and compared them to the formal
correct answer. The analysis results demonstrate that the ability of
ChatGPT-3.5 to answer correctly was impaired when small talk was added to
medical data for multiple-choice questions (72.1\% vs. 68.9\%) and open
questions (61.5\% vs. 44.3\%; p=0.01), respectively. In contrast, small talk
phrases did not impair ChatGPT-4 ability in both types of questions (83.6\% and
66.2\%, respectively). According to these results, ChatGPT-4 seems more
accurate than the earlier 3.5 version, and it appears that small talk does not
impair its capability to provide medical recommendations. Our results are an
important first step in understanding the potential and limitations of
utilizing ChatGPT and other LLMs for physician-patient interactions, which
include casual conversations.

<p class="mathjax">Inverse text normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken-form into
written-form, especially in the context of automatic speech recognition (ASR).
While most downstream tasks of ASR rely on written-form, ASR systems often
output spoken-form, highlighting the necessity for robust ITN in product-level
ASR-based applications. Although neural ITN methods have shown promise, they
still encounter performance challenges, particularly when dealing with
ASR-generated spoken text. These challenges arise from the out-of-domain
problem between training data and ASR-generated text. To address this, we
propose a direct training approach that utilizes ASR-generated written or
spoken text, with pairs augmented through ASR linguistic context emulation and
a semi-supervised learning method enhanced by a large language model,
respectively. Additionally, we introduce a post-aligning method to manage
unpredictable errors, thereby enhancing the reliability of ITN. Our experiments
show that our proposed methods remarkably improved ITN performance in various
ASR scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Model adaptation is crucial to handle the discrepancy between proxy training
data and actual users data received. To effectively perform adaptation, textual
data of users is typically stored on servers or their local devices, where
downstream natural language processing (NLP) models can be directly trained
using such in-domain data. However, this might raise privacy and security
concerns due to the extra risks of exposing user information to adversaries.
Replacing identifying information in textual data with a generic marker has
been recently explored. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs)
to suggest substitutes of masked tokens and have their effectiveness evaluated
on downstream language modeling tasks. Specifically, we propose multiple
pre-trained and fine-tuned LLM-based approaches and perform empirical studies
on various datasets for the comparison of these methods. Experimental results
show that models trained on the obfuscation corpora are able to achieve
comparable performance with the ones trained on the original data without
privacy-preserving token masking.

(range = [.22, .33]) between LLM-inferred and self-reported trait scores.
Furthermore, our findings suggest biases in personality inferences with regard
to gender and age: inferred scores demonstrated smaller errors for women and
younger individuals on several traits, suggesting a potential systematic bias
stemming from the underlying training data or differences in online
self-expression.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key approach for distributed machine
learning, enhancing online personalization while ensuring user data privacy.
Instead of sending private data to a central server as in traditional
approaches, FL decentralizes computations: devices train locally and share
updates with a global server. A primary challenge in this setting is achieving
fast and accurate model training - vital for recommendation systems where
delays can compromise user engagement. This paper introduces FedFNN, an
algorithm that accelerates decentralized model training. In FL, only a subset
of users are involved in each training epoch. FedFNN employs supervised
learning to predict weight updates from unsampled users, using updates from the
sampled set. Our evaluations, using real and synthetic data, show: 1. FedFNN
achieves training speeds 5x faster than leading methods, maintaining or
improving accuracy; 2. the algorithm's performance is consistent regardless of
client cluster variations; 3. FedFNN outperforms other methods in scenarios
with limited client availability, converging more quickly.

<p class="mathjax">Historically, proficient writing was deemed essential for human advancement,
with creative expression viewed as one of the hallmarks of human achievement.
However, recent advances in generative AI have marked an inflection point in
this narrative, including for scientific writing. This article provides a
comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and limitations of six AI chatbots
in scholarly writing in the humanities and archaeology. The methodology was
based on tagging AI generated content for quantitative accuracy and qualitative
precision by human experts. Quantitative accuracy assessed the factual
correctness, while qualitative precision gauged the scientific contribution.
While the AI chatbots, especially ChatGPT-4, demonstrated proficiency in
recombining existing knowledge, they failed in generating original scientific
content. As a side note, our results also suggest that with ChatGPT-4 the size
of the LLMs has plateaued. Furthermore, the paper underscores the intricate and
recursive nature of human research. This process of transforming raw data into
refined knowledge is computationally irreducible, which highlights the
challenges AI chatbots face in emulating human originality in scientific
writing. In conclusion, while large language models have revolutionised content
generation, their ability to produce original scientific contributions in the
humanities remains limited. We expect that this will change in the near future
with the evolution of current LLM-based AI chatbots towards LLM-powered
software.

<p class="mathjax">Modern language models often exhibit powerful but brittle behavior, leading
to the development of larger and more diverse benchmarks to reliably assess
their behavior. Here, we suggest that model performance can be benchmarked and
elucidated with much smaller evaluation sets. We first show that in six popular
language classification benchmarks, model confidence in the correct class on
many pairs of points is strongly correlated across models. We build upon this
phenomenon to propose Anchor Point Selection, a technique to select small
subsets of datasets that capture model behavior across the entire dataset.
Anchor points reliably rank models: across 87 diverse language model-prompt
pairs, evaluating models using 1-30 anchor points outperforms uniform sampling
and other baselines at accurately ranking models. Moreover, just several anchor
points can be used to estimate model per-class predictions on all other points
in a dataset with low mean absolute error, sufficient for gauging where the
model is likely to fail. Lastly, we present Anchor Point Maps for visualizing
these insights and facilitating comparisons of the performance of different
models on various regions within the dataset distribution.

<p class="mathjax">Aggregating distributed energy resources in power systems significantly
increases uncertainties, in particular caused by the fluctuation of renewable
energy generation. This issue has driven the necessity of widely exploiting
advanced predictive control techniques under uncertainty to ensure long-term
economics and decarbonization. In this paper, we propose a real-time
uncertainty-aware energy dispatch framework, which is composed of two key
elements: (i) A hybrid forecast-and-optimize sequential task, integrating deep
learning-based forecasting and stochastic optimization, where these two stages
are connected by the uncertainty estimation at multiple temporal resolutions;
(ii) An efficient online data augmentation scheme, jointly involving model
pre-training and online fine-tuning stages. In this way, the proposed framework
is capable to rapidly adapt to the real-time data distribution, as well as to
target on uncertainties caused by data drift, model discrepancy and environment
perturbations in the control process, and finally to realize an optimal and
robust dispatch solution. The proposed framework won the championship in
CityLearn Challenge 2022, which provided an influential opportunity to
investigate the potential of AI application in the energy domain. In addition,
comprehensive experiments are conducted to interpret its effectiveness in the
real-life scenario of smart building energy management.

<p class="mathjax">3D pose estimation is an invaluable task in computer vision with various
practical applications. Especially, 3D pose estimation for multi-person from a
monocular video (3DMPPE) is particularly challenging and is still largely
uncharted, far from applying to in-the-wild scenarios yet. We pose three
unresolved issues with the existing methods: lack of robustness on unseen views
during training, vulnerability to occlusion, and severe jittering in the
output. As a remedy, we propose POTR-3D, the first realization of a
sequence-to-sequence 2D-to-3D lifting model for 3DMPPE, powered by a novel
geometry-aware data augmentation strategy, capable of generating unbounded data
with a variety of views while caring about the ground plane and occlusions.
Through extensive experiments, we verify that the proposed model and data
augmentation robustly generalizes to diverse unseen views, robustly recovers
the poses against heavy occlusions, and reliably generates more natural and
smoother outputs. The effectiveness of our approach is verified not only by
achieving the state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, but also by
qualitative results on more challenging in-the-wild videos. Demo videos are
available at https://www.youtube.com/@potr3d.

<p class="mathjax">As the rapid progression of practical applications based on Large Language
Models continues, the importance of extrapolating performance has grown
exponentially in the research domain. In our study, we identified an anomalous
behavior in Transformer models that had been previously overlooked, leading to
a chaos around closest tokens which carried the most important information.
We've coined this discovery the "headache of Transformers". To address this at
its core, we introduced a novel self-attention structure named Collinear
Constrained Attention (CoCA). This structure can be seamlessly integrated with
existing extrapolation, interpolation methods, and other optimization
strategies designed for traditional Transformer models. We have achieved
excellent extrapolating performance even for 16 times to 24 times of sequence
lengths during inference without any fine-tuning on our model. We have also
enhanced CoCA's computational and spatial efficiency to ensure its
practicality. We plan to open-source CoCA shortly. In the meantime, we've made
our code available in the appendix for reappearing experiments.

efficient support systems, enabling agents to quickly understand messages and
prioritize responses accordingly. While different approaches exist for intent
detection, maintaining separate client-specific or industry-specific models can
be costly and impractical as the client base expands.
<br />This work proposes a system to scale intent predictions to various clients
effectively, by combining a single generic model with a per-client list of
relevant intents. Our approach minimizes training and maintenance costs while
providing a personalized experience for clients, allowing for seamless
adaptation to changes in their relevant intents. Furthermore, we propose a
strategy for using the clients relevant intents as model features that proves
to be resilient to changes in the relevant intents of clients -- a common
occurrence in production environments.
<br />The final system exhibits significantly superior performance compared to
industry-specific models, showcasing its flexibility and ability to cater to
diverse client needs.

This innovative approach utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict app

<p class="mathjax">The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been successfully
applied in the context of table representation learning. The recently proposed
tabular language models have reported state-of-the-art results across various
tasks for table interpretation. However, a closer look into the datasets
commonly used for evaluation reveals an entity leakage from the train set into
the test set. Motivated by this observation, we explore adversarial attacks
that represent a more realistic inference setup. Adversarial attacks on text
have been shown to greatly affect the performance of LLMs, but currently, there
are no attacks targeting tabular language models. In this paper, we propose an
evasive entity-swap attack for the column type annotation (CTA) task. Our CTA
attack is the first black-box attack on tables, where we employ a
similarity-based sampling strategy to generate adversarial examples. The
experimental results show that the proposed attack generates up to a 70% drop
in performance.

established where all proofs and types occurring inside programs are fully
erasable without compromising their operational behavior. Through a heap-based
operational semantics, we show that extracted programs always make
computational progress and run memory clean. Additionally, programs can be
freely reflected into the logical level for conducting deep proofs in the style
of standard dependent type theories. This enables one to write resource safe

<p class="mathjax">The spread of fake news has emerged as a critical challenge, undermining
trust and posing threats to society. In the era of Large Language Models
(LLMs), the capability to generate believable fake content has intensified
these concerns. In this study, we present a novel paradigm to evaluate fake
news detectors in scenarios involving both human-written and LLM-generated
misinformation. Intriguingly, our findings reveal a significant bias in many
existing detectors: they are more prone to flagging LLM-generated content as
fake news while often misclassifying human-written fake news as genuine. This
unexpected bias appears to arise from distinct linguistic patterns inherent to
LLM outputs. To address this, we introduce a mitigation strategy that leverages
adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news. The resulting model
yielded marked improvements in detection accuracy for both human and
LLM-generated news. To further catalyze research in this domain, we release two
comprehensive datasets, \texttt{GossipCop++} and \texttt{PolitiFact++}, thus
amalgamating human-validated articles with LLM-generated fake and real news.

<p class="mathjax">How to properly set the privacy parameter in differential privacy (DP) has
been an open question in DP research since it was first proposed in 2006. In
this work, we demonstrate the ability of influence functions to offer insight
into how a specific privacy parameter value will affect a model's test loss in
the randomized response-based local DP setting. Our proposed method allows a
data curator to select the privacy parameter best aligned with their allowed
privacy-utility trade-off without requiring heavy computation such as extensive
model retraining and data privatization. We consider multiple common
randomization scenarios, such as performing randomized response over the
features, and/or over the labels, as well as the more complex case of applying
a class-dependent label noise correction method to offset the noise incurred by
randomization. Further, we provide a detailed discussion over the computational
complexity of our proposed approach inclusive of an empirical analysis. Through
empirical evaluations we show that for both binary and multi-class settings,
influence functions are able to approximate the true change in test loss that
occurs when randomized response is applied over features and/or labels with
small mean absolute error, especially in cases where noise correction methods
are applied.

<p class="mathjax">We report optimization work made in support of the development of a realtime
Superfacility workflow between DIII-D and NERSC. At DIII-D, the ion properties
measured by charge exchange recombination (CER) spectroscopy are required
inputs for a Superfacility realtime workflow that computes the full plasma
kinetic equilibrium. In this workflow, minutes matter since the results must be
ready during the brief 10-15 minute pause between plasma discharges. Prior to
this work, a sample CERFIT analysis took approximately 15 minutes. Because the
problem consists of many calculations that can be done independently, we were
able to restructure the CERFIT code to leverage this parallelism with Slurm job
arrays. We reduced the runtime to approximately 51 seconds -- a speedup of
roughly 20x, saving valuable time for both the scientists interested in the CER
results and also for the larger equilibrium reconstruction workflow.

<p class="mathjax">With the incredible results achieved from generative pre-trained transformers
(GPT) and diffusion models, generative AI (GenAI) is envisioned to yield
remarkable breakthroughs in various industrial and academic domains. In this
paper, we utilize denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), as one of
the state-of-the-art generative models, for probabilistic constellation shaping
in wireless communications. While the geometry of constellations is
predetermined by the networking standards, probabilistic constellation shaping
can help enhance the information rate and communication performance by
designing the probability of occurrence (generation) of constellation symbols.
Unlike conventional methods that deal with an optimization problem over the
discrete distribution of constellations, we take a radically different
approach. Exploiting the ``denoise-and-generate'' characteristic of DDPMs, the
key idea is to learn how to generate constellation symbols out of noise,
``mimicking'' the way the receiver performs symbol reconstruction. By doing so,
we make the constellation symbols sent by the transmitter, and what is inferred
(reconstructed) at the receiver become as similar as possible. Our simulations
show that the proposed scheme outperforms deep neural network (DNN)-based
benchmark and uniform shaping, while providing network resilience as well as
robust out-of-distribution performance under low-SNR regimes and non-Gaussian
noise. Notably, a threefold improvement in terms of mutual information is
achieved compared to DNN-based approach for 64-QAM geometry.

<p class="mathjax">RANSAC-based algorithms are the standard techniques for robust estimation in
computer vision. These algorithms are iterative and computationally expensive;
they alternate between random sampling of data, computing hypotheses, and
running inlier counting. Many authors tried different approaches to improve
efficiency. One of the major improvements is having a guided sampling, letting
the RANSAC cycle stop sooner. This paper presents a new adaptive sampling
process for RANSAC. Previous methods either assume no prior information about
the inlier/outlier classification of data points or use some previously
computed scores in the sampling. In this paper, we derive a dynamic Bayesian
network that updates individual data points' inlier scores while iterating
RANSAC. At each iteration, we apply weighted sampling using the updated scores.
Our method works with or without prior data point scorings. In addition, we use
the updated inlier/outlier scoring for deriving a new stopping criterion for
the RANSAC loop. We test our method in multiple real-world datasets for several
applications and obtain state-of-the-art results. Our method outperforms the
baselines in accuracy while needing less computational time.

<p class="mathjax">Resolving the scope of a negation within a sentence is a challenging NLP
task. The complexity of legal texts and the lack of annotated in-domain
negation corpora pose challenges for state-of-the-art (SotA) models when
performing negation scope resolution on multilingual legal data. Our
experiments demonstrate that models pre-trained without legal data underperform
in the task of negation scope resolution. Our experiments, using language
models exclusively fine-tuned on domains like literary texts and medical data,
yield inferior results compared to the outcomes documented in prior
cross-domain experiments. We release a new set of annotated court decisions in
German, French, and Italian and use it to improve negation scope resolution in
both zero-shot and multilingual settings. We achieve token-level F1-scores of
up to 86.7% in our zero-shot cross-lingual experiments, where the models are
trained on two languages of our legal datasets and evaluated on the third. Our
multilingual experiments, where the models were trained on all available
negation data and evaluated on our legal datasets, resulted in F1-scores of up
to 91.1%.

<p class="mathjax">More and more latency-sensitive services and applications are being deployed
into the data center. Performance can be limited by the high latency of the
network interconnect. Because the conventional network stack is designed not
only for LAN, but also for WAN, it carries a great amount of redundancy that is
not required in a data center network. This paper introduces the concept of a
three-layer protocol stack that can fulfill the exact demands of data center
network communications. The detailed design and implementation of the first
layer of the stack, which we call RIFL, is presented. A novel low latency
in-band hop-by-hop re-transmission protocol is proposed and adopted in RIFL,
which guarantees lossless transmission in a data center environment.
Experimental results show that RIFL achieves 110 nanoseconds point-to-point
latency on 10-meter Active Optical Cables, at a line rate of 112 Gbps. RIFL is
a multi-lane protocol with scalable throughput up to multi-hundred gigabits per
second. It can be the enabler of low latency, high throughput, flexible,
scalable, and lossless data center networks.

<p class="mathjax">Split learning (SL) is a new collaborative learning technique that allows
participants, e.g. a client and a server, to train machine learning models
without the client sharing raw data. In this setting, the client initially
applies its part of the machine learning model on the raw data to generate
Activation Maps (AMs) and then sends them to the server to continue the
training process. Previous works in the field demonstrated that reconstructing
AMs could result in privacy leakage of client data. In addition to that,
existing mitigation techniques that overcome the privacy leakage of SL prove to
be significantly worse in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we improve upon
previous works by constructing a protocol based on U-shaped SL that can operate
on homomorphically encrypted data. More precisely, in our approach, the client
applies homomorphic encryption on the AMs before sending them to the server,
thus protecting user privacy. This is an important improvement that reduces
privacy leakage in comparison to other SL-based works. Finally, our results
show that, with the optimum set of parameters, training with HE data in the
U-shaped SL setting only reduces accuracy by 2.65% compared to training on
plaintext. In addition, raw training data privacy is preserved.

<p class="mathjax">Modelling irregularly-sampled time series (ISTS) is challenging because of
missing values. Most existing methods focus on handling ISTS by converting
irregularly sampled data into regularly sampled data via imputation. These
models assume an underlying missing mechanism leading to unwanted bias and
sub-optimal performance. We present SLAN (Switch LSTM Aggregate Network), which
utilizes a pack of LSTMs to model ISTS without imputation, eliminating the
assumption of any underlying process. It dynamically adapts its architecture on
the fly based on the measured sensors. SLAN exploits the irregularity
information to capture each sensor's local summary explicitly and maintains a
global summary state throughout the observational period. We demonstrate the
efficacy of SLAN on publicly available datasets, namely, MIMIC-III, Physionet
2012 and Physionet 2019. The code is available at
https://github.com/Rohit102497/SLAN.

<p class="mathjax">Control Barrier functions (CBFs) have attracted extensive attention for
designing safe controllers for their deployment in real-world safety-critical
systems. However, the perception of the surrounding environment is often
subject to stochasticity and further distributional shift from the nominal one.
In this paper, we present distributional robust CBF (DR-CBF) to achieve
resilience under distributional shift while keeping the advantages of CBF, such
as computational efficacy and forward invariance.
<br />To achieve this goal, we first propose a single-level convex reformulation to
estimate the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the safety constraints under
distributional shift measured by a Wasserstein metric, which is by nature
tri-level programming. Moreover, to construct a control barrier condition to
enforce the forward invariance of the CVaR, the technique of differentiable
convex programming is applied to enable differentiation through the
optimization layer of CVaR estimation. We also provide an approximate variant
of DR-CBF for higher-order systems. Simulation results are presented to
validate the chance-constrained safety guarantee under the distributional shift
in both first and second-order systems.

<p class="mathjax">Ordinal classification models assign higher penalties to predictions further
away from the true class. As a result, they are appropriate for relevant
diagnostic tasks like disease progression prediction or medical image grading.
The consensus for assessing their categorical predictions dictates the use of
distance-sensitive metrics like the Quadratic-Weighted Kappa score or the
Expected Cost. However, there has been little discussion regarding how to
measure performance of probabilistic predictions for ordinal classifiers. In
conventional classification, common measures for probabilistic predictions are
Proper Scoring Rules (PSR) like the Brier score, or Calibration Errors like the
ECE, yet these are not optimal choices for ordinal classification. A PSR named
Ranked Probability Score (RPS), widely popular in the forecasting field, is
more suitable for this task, but it has received no attention in the image
analysis community. This paper advocates the use of the RPS for image grading
tasks. In addition, we demonstrate a counter-intuitive and questionable
behavior of this score, and propose a simple fix for it. Comprehensive
experiments on four large-scale biomedical image grading problems over three
different datasets show that the RPS is a more suitable performance metric for
probabilistic ordinal predictions. Code to reproduce our experiments can be
found at https://github.com/agaldran/prob_ord_metrics .

effectively co-optimizing patrolling, damage assessment, fault isolation,
repair, and load re-energization processes. The model is designed to solve a
vital operational conundrum: deciding between further network exploration to
obtain more comprehensive data or addressing the repair of already identified
faults. As information on the fault location and repair timelines becomes
available, the model allows for dynamic adaptation of crew dispatch decisions.
In addition, this study proposes a conservative power flow constraint set that
considers two network loading scenarios within the final network configuration.
This approach results in the determination of an upper and a lower bound for
node voltage levels and an upper bound for power line flows. To underscore the
practicality and scalability of the proposed model, we have demonstrated its
application using IEEE 123-node and 8500-node test systems, where it delivered
promising results.

<p class="mathjax">The extensive memory footprint of pre-trained language models (PLMs) can
hinder deployment in memory-constrained settings, such as cloud environments or
on-device. PLMs use embedding matrices to represent extensive vocabularies,
forming a large proportion of the model parameters. While previous work towards
parameter-efficient PLM development has considered pruning parameters within
the transformer layers, pruning the embedding matrix as part of fine-tuning or
inference has yet to be explored. We first demonstrate that a significant
proportion of the vocabulary remains unused in these scenarios. We then propose
a simple yet effective approach that leverages this finding to minimize the
memory footprint of the embedding matrix. We show that this approach provides
substantial reductions in memory usage across a wide range of models and tasks.
Notably, our approach maintains equivalent downstream task performance while
allowing a more efficient use of compute resources.

<p class="mathjax">We address in this paper a particular instance of the multi-agent linear
stochastic bandit problem, called clustered multi-agent linear bandits. In this
setting, we propose a novel algorithm leveraging an efficient collaboration
between the agents in order to accelerate the overall optimization problem. In
this contribution, a network controller is responsible for estimating the
underlying cluster structure of the network and optimizing the experiences
sharing among agents within the same groups. We provide a theoretical analysis
for both the regret minimization problem and the clustering quality. Through
empirical evaluation against state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and
real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: our algorithm
significantly improves regret minimization while managing to recover the true
underlying cluster partitioning.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Lovelace, a tool for creating corpora of semantic graphs. The
system uses graph expansion grammar as a representational language, thus
allowing users to craft a grammar that describes a corpus with desired
properties. When given such grammar as input, the system generates a set of
output graphs that are well-formed according to the grammar, i.e., a graph
bank. The generation process can be controlled via a number of configurable
parameters that allow the user to, for example, specify a range of desired
output graph sizes. Central use cases are the creation of synthetic data to
augment existing corpora, and as a pedagogical tool for teaching formal
language theory.

<p class="mathjax">We study deterministic tree-walking-storage automata, which are finite-state
devices equipped with a tree-like storage. These automata are generalized stack
automata, where the linear stack storage is replaced by a non-linear tree-like
stack. Therefore, tree-walking-storage automata have the ability to explore the
interior of the tree storage without altering the contents, with the possible
moves of the tree pointer corresponding to those of tree-walking automata. In
addition, a tree-walking-storage automaton can append (push) non-existent
descendants to a tree node and remove (pop) leaves from the tree. Here we are
particularly considering the capacities of deterministic tree-walking-storage
automata working in real time. It is shown that even the non-erasing variant
can accept rather complicated unary languages as, for example, the language of
words whose lengths are powers of two, or the language of words whose lengths
are Fibonacci numbers. Comparing the computational capacities with automata
from the classical automata hierarchy, we derive that the families of languages
accepted by real-time deterministic (non-erasing) tree-walking-storage automata
is located between the regular and the deterministic context-sensitive
languages. There is a context-free language that is not accepted by any
real-time deterministic tree-walking-storage automaton. On the other hand,
these devices accept a unary language in non-erasing mode that cannot be
accepted by any classical stack automaton, even in erasing mode and arbitrary
time. Basic closure properties of the induced families of languages are shown.
In particular, we consider Boolean operations (complementation, union,
intersection) and AFL operations (union, intersection with regular languages,
homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, concatenation, iteration). It turns out
that the two families in question have the same properties and, in particular,
share all but one of these closure properties with the important family of
deterministic context-free languages.

language over an alphabet W such that W is a subset of V. A final sentential
form is any sentential form of G that, after omitting symbols from V - W, it
belongs to F. The string resulting from the elimination of all nonterminals
from W in a final sentential form is in the language of G finalized by F if and

<br />The language of any context-free grammar finalized by a regular language is

point of view, we combine two LQFAs recognizing with isolated cut point,
respectively, the finite part and the ultimately periodic part of any given
unary regular language L. In both modules, we use a component addressed in the
literature and here suitably adapted to the unary case, to discriminate strings
on the basis of their length. The number of basis states and the isolation

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces sweeping permutation automata, which move over an input
string in alternating left-to-right and right-to-left sweeps and have a
bijective transition function. It is proved that these automata recognize the
same family of languages as the classical one-way permutation automata
(Thierrin, "Permutation automata", Mathematical Systems Theory, 1968). An
n-state two-way permutation automaton is transformed to a one-way permutation
automaton with F(n)=\max_(k+l=n, m &lt;= l) k (l \choose m) (k - 1 \choose l - m)
(l - m)! states. This number of states is proved to be necessary in the worst
case, and its growth rate is estimated as F(n) = n^(n/2 - (1 + \ln 2)/2 \cdot
n/(\ln n) \cdot (1 + o(1))).

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we continue the research on the power of contextual grammars
with selection languages from subfamilies of the family of regular languages.
In the past, two independent hierarchies have been obtained for external and
internal contextual grammars, one based on selection languages defined by
structural properties (finite, monoidal, nilpotent, combinational, definite,
ordered, non-counting, power-separating, suffix-closed, commutative, circular,
or union-free languages), the other one based on selection languages defined by
resources (number of non-terminal symbols, production rules, or states needed
for generating or accepting them). In a previous paper, the language families
of these hierarchies for external contextual grammars were compared and the
hierarchies merged. In the present paper, we compare the language families of
these hierarchies for internal contextual grammars and merge these hierarchies.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a minimal path method to simultaneously compute segmentation masks
and extract centerlines of tubular structures with line-topology. Minimal path
methods are commonly used for the segmentation of tubular structures in a wide
variety of applications. Recent methods use features extracted by CNNs, and
often outperform methods using hand-tuned features. However, for CNN-based
methods, the samples used for training may be generated inappropriately, so
that they can be very different from samples encountered during inference. We
approach this discrepancy by introducing a novel iterative training scheme,
which enables generating better training samples specifically tailored for the
minimal path methods without changing existing annotations. In our method,
segmentation masks and centerlines are not determined after one another by
post-processing, but obtained using the same steps. Our method requires only
very few annotated training images. Comparison with seven previous approaches
on three public datasets, including satellite images and medical images, shows
that our method achieves state-of-the-art results both for segmentation masks
and centerlines.

<p class="mathjax">Deformable object manipulation presents a unique set of challenges in robotic
manipulation by exhibiting high degrees of freedom and severe self-occlusion.
State representation for materials that exhibit plastic behavior, like modeling
clay or bread dough, is also difficult because they permanently deform under
stress and are constantly changing shape. In this work, we investigate each of
these challenges using the task of robotic sculpting with a parallel gripper.
We propose a system that uses point clouds as the state representation and
leverages pre-trained point cloud reconstruction Transformer to learn a latent
dynamics model to predict material deformations given a grasp action. We design
a novel action sampling algorithm that reasons about geometrical differences
between point clouds to further improve the efficiency of model-based planners.

experiments show the proposed system is able to successfully capture the
dynamics of clay, and is able to create a variety of simple shapes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel deep-learning-based approach to improve
localizing radar measurements against lidar maps. Although the state of the art
for localization is matching lidar data to lidar maps, radar has been
considered as a promising alternative, as it is potentially more resilient
against adverse weather such as precipitation and heavy fog. To make use of
existing high-quality lidar maps, while maintaining performance in adverse
weather, matching radar data to lidar maps is of interest. However, owing in
part to the unique artefacts present in radar measurements, radar-lidar
localization has struggled to achieve comparable performance to lidar-lidar
systems, preventing it from being viable for autonomous driving. This work
builds on an ICP-based radar-lidar localization system by including a learned
preprocessing step that weights radar points based on high-level scan
information. Combining a proven analytical approach with a learned weight
reduces localization errors in radar-lidar ICP results run on real-world
autonomous driving data by up to 54.94% in translation and 68.39% in rotation,
while maintaining interpretability and robustness.

designed for each agent in such rigid systems based on Pontryagin's minimum

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the idea of an automatic forward-collision warning system
based on a decentralized radio sensing (RS) approach. In this framework, a
vehicle in receiving mode employs a continuous waveform (CW) transmitted by a
second vehicle as a probe signal to detect oncoming vehicles and warn the
driver of a potential forward collision. Such a CW can easily be incorporated
as a pilot signal within the data frame of current multicarrier vehicular
communication systems. Detection of oncoming vehicles is performed by a deep
learning (DL) module that analyzes the features of the Doppler signature
imprinted on the CW probe signal by a rapidly approaching vehicle. This
decentralized CW RS approach was assessed experimentally using data collected
by a series of field trials conducted in a two-lanes high-speed highway.
Detection performance was evaluated for two different DL models: a long
short-term memory network and a convolutional neural network. The obtained
results demonstrate the feasibility of the envisioned forward-collision warning
system based on the fusion of DL and decentralized CW RS.

<p class="mathjax">Learning high-quality video representation has shown significant applications
in computer vision and remains challenging. Previous work based on mask
autoencoders such as ImageMAE and VideoMAE has proven the effectiveness of
learning representations in images and videos through reconstruction strategy
in the visual modality. However, these models exhibit inherent limitations,
particularly in scenarios where extracting features solely from the visual
modality proves challenging, such as when dealing with low-resolution and
blurry original videos. Based on this, we propose AV-MaskEnhancer for learning
high-quality video representation by combining visual and audio information.
Our approach addresses the challenge by demonstrating the complementary nature
of audio and video features in cross-modality content. Moreover, our result of
the video classification task on the UCF101 dataset outperforms the existing
work and reaches the state-of-the-art, with a top-1 accuracy of 98.8% and a
top-5 accuracy of 99.9%.

<p class="mathjax">Plant diseases remain a considerable threat to food security and agricultural
sustainability. Rapid and early identification of these diseases has become a
significant concern motivating several studies to rely on the increasing global
digitalization and the recent advances in computer vision based on deep
learning. In fact, plant disease classification based on deep convolutional
neural networks has shown impressive performance. However, these methods have
yet to be adopted globally due to concerns regarding their robustness,
transparency, and the lack of explainability compared with their human experts
counterparts. Methods such as saliency-based approaches associating the network
output to perturbations of the input pixels have been proposed to give insights
into these algorithms. Still, they are not easily comprehensible and not
intuitive for human users and are threatened by bias. In this work, we deploy a
method called Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) that shifts the
focus from pixels to user-defined concepts. To the best of our knowledge, our
paper is the first to employ this method in the field of plant disease
classification. Important concepts such as color, texture and disease related
concepts were analyzed. The results suggest that concept-based explanation
methods can significantly benefit automated plant disease identification.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to retrieve a photo by mere free-hand sketching highlights the
immense potential of Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR).
However, its rapid practical adoption, as well as scalability, is limited by
the expense of acquiring faithful sketches for easily available photo
counterparts. A solution to this problem is Active Learning, which could
minimise the need for labeled sketches while maximising performance. Despite
extensive studies in the field, there exists no work that utilises it for
reducing sketching effort in FG-SBIR tasks. To this end, we propose a novel
active learning sampling technique that drastically minimises the need for
drawing photo sketches. Our proposed approach tackles the trade-off between
uncertainty and diversity by utilising the relationship between the existing
photo-sketch pair to a photo that does not have its sketch and augmenting this
relation with its intermediate representations. Since our approach relies only
on the underlying data distribution, it is agnostic of the modelling approach
and hence is applicable to other cross-modal instance-level retrieval tasks as
well. With experimentation over two publicly available fine-grained SBIR
datasets ChairV2 and ShoeV2, we validate our approach and reveal its
superiority over adapted baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Food image classification is a fundamental step of image-based dietary
assessment, enabling automated nutrient analysis from food images. Many current
methods employ deep neural networks to train on generic food image datasets
that do not reflect the dynamism of real-life food consumption patterns, in
which food images appear sequentially over time, reflecting the progression of
what an individual consumes. Personalized food classification aims to address
this problem by training a deep neural network using food images that reflect
the consumption pattern of each individual. However, this problem is
under-explored and there is a lack of benchmark datasets with individualized
food consumption patterns due to the difficulty in data collection. In this
work, we first introduce two benchmark personalized datasets including the
Food101-Personal, which is created based on surveys of daily dietary patterns
from participants in the real world, and the VFNPersonal, which is developed
based on a dietary study. In addition, we propose a new framework for
personalized food image classification by leveraging self-supervised learning
and temporal image feature information. Our method is evaluated on both
benchmark datasets and shows improved performance compared to existing works.

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women worldwide.
Early screening is essential for early identification, but the chance of
survival declines as the cancer progresses into advanced stages. For this
study, the most recent BRACS dataset of histological (H\&amp;E) stained images was
used to classify breast cancer tumours, which contains both the whole-slide
images (WSI) and region-of-interest (ROI) images, however, for our study we
have considered ROI images. We have experimented using different pre-trained
deep learning models, such as Xception, EfficientNet, ResNet50, and
InceptionResNet, pre-trained on the ImageNet weights. We pre-processed the
BRACS ROI along with image augmentation, upsampling, and dataset split
strategies. For the default dataset split, the best results were obtained by
ResNet50 achieving 66\% f1-score. For the custom dataset split, the best
results were obtained by performing upsampling and image augmentation which
results in 96.2\% f1-score. Our second approach also reduced the number of
false positive and false negative classifications to less than 3\% for each
class. We believe that our study significantly impacts the early diagnosis and
identification of breast cancer tumors and their subtypes, especially atypical
and malignant tumors, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing patient
mortality rates. Overall, this study has primarily focused on identifying seven
(7) breast cancer tumor subtypes, and we believe that the experimental models
can be fine-tuned further to generalize over previous breast cancer histology
datasets as well.

<p class="mathjax">Without direct interaction with the environment. Often, the environment in
which the data are collected differs from the environment in which the learned
policy is applied. To account for the effect of different environments during
learning and execution, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods have
been developed that compute worst-case bounds on the policy values assuming
that the distribution of the new environment lies within an uncertainty set.
Typically, this uncertainty set is defined based on the KL divergence around
the empirical distribution computed from the logging dataset. However, the KL
uncertainty set fails to encompass distributions with varying support and lacks
awareness of the geometry of the distribution support. As a result, KL
approaches fall short in addressing practical environment mismatches and lead
to over-fitting to worst-case scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel DRO approach that employs the Wasserstein distance instead.
While Wasserstein DRO is generally computationally more expensive compared to
KL DRO, we present a regularized method and a practical (biased) stochastic
gradient descent method to optimize the policy efficiently. We also provide a
theoretical analysis of the finite sample complexity and iteration complexity
for our proposed method. We further validate our approach using a public
dataset that was recorded in a randomized stoke trial.

<p class="mathjax">With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards
end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being
trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the
task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature
representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio
classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate
embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural
representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We
observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their
own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these
together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance.
This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end
models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of
just training end-to-end models.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used for representing and organizing
structured knowledge in diverse domains. However, the creation and upkeep of
KGs pose substantial challenges. Developing a KG demands extensive expertise in
data modeling, ontology design, and data curation. Furthermore, KGs are
dynamic, requiring continuous updates and quality control to ensure accuracy
and relevance. These intricacies contribute to the considerable effort required
for their development and maintenance. One critical dimension of KGs that
warrants attention is reproducibility. The ability to replicate and validate
KGs is fundamental for ensuring the trustworthiness and sustainability of the
knowledge they represent. Reproducible KGs not only support open science by
allowing others to build upon existing knowledge but also enhance transparency
and reliability in disseminating information. Despite the growing number of
domain-specific KGs, a comprehensive analysis concerning their reproducibility
has been lacking. This paper addresses this gap by offering a general overview
of domain-specific KGs and comparing them based on various reproducibility
criteria. Our study over 19 different domains shows only eight out of 250
domain-specific KGs (3.2%) provide publicly available source code. Among these,
only one system could successfully pass our reproducibility assessment (14.3%).
These findings highlight the challenges and gaps in achieving reproducibility
across domain-specific KGs. Our finding that only 0.4% of published
domain-specific KGs are reproducible shows a clear need for further research
and a shift in cultural practices.

<p class="mathjax">There is a growing interest in characterizing circular data found in
biological systems. Such data are wide ranging and varied, from signal phase in
neural recordings to nucleotide sequences in round genomes. Traditional
clustering algorithms are often inadequate due to their limited ability to
distinguish differences in the periodic component. Current clustering schemes
that work in a polar coordinate system have limitations, such as being only
angle-focused or lacking generality. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a new analysis framework that utilizes projections onto a cylindrical
coordinate system to better represent objects in a polar coordinate system.
Using the mathematical properties of circular data, we show our approach always
finds the correct clustering result within the reconstructed dataset, given
sufficient periodic repetitions of the data. Our approach is generally
applicable and adaptable and can be incorporated into most state-of-the-art
clustering algorithms. We demonstrate on synthetic and real data that our
method generates more appropriate and consistent clustering results compared to
standard methods. In summary, our proposed analysis framework overcomes the
limitations of existing polar coordinate-based clustering methods and provides
a more accurate and efficient way to cluster circular data.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks used in computer vision have been shown to exhibit many
social biases such as gender bias. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become
increasingly popular in computer vision applications, outperforming
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many tasks such as image
classification. However, given that research on mitigating bias in computer
vision has primarily focused on CNNs, it is important to evaluate the effect of
a different network architecture on the potential for bias amplification. In
this paper we therefore introduce a novel metric to measure bias in
architectures, Accuracy Difference. We examine bias amplification when models
belonging to these two architectures are used as a part of large multimodal
models, evaluating the different image encoders of Contrastive Language Image
Pretraining which is an important model used in many generative models such as
DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. Our experiments demonstrate that architecture can
play a role in amplifying social biases due to the different techniques
employed by the models for feature extraction and embedding as well as their
different learning properties. This research found that ViTs amplified gender
bias to a greater extent than CNNs

<p class="mathjax">This paper, and its companion, propose a new fractal robotic gripper, drawing
inspiration from the century-old Fractal Vise. The unusual synergistic
properties allow it to passively conform to diverse objects using only one
actuator. Designed to be easily integrated with prevailing parallel jaw
grippers, it alleviates the complexities tied to perception and grasp planning,
especially when dealing with unpredictable object poses and geometries. We
build on the foundational principles of the Fractal Vise to a broader class of
gripping mechanisms, and also address the limitations that had led to its
obscurity. Two Fractal Fingers, coupled by a closing actuator, can form an
adaptive and synergistic Fractal Hand. We articulate a design methodology for
low cost, easy to fabricate, large workspace, and compliant Fractal Fingers.
The companion paper delves into the kinematics and grasping properties of a

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an algorithm to apply nonlinear control design approaches
in the case of stochastic systems with partial state observation. Deterministic
nonlinear control approaches are formulated under the assumption of full state
access and, often, relative degree one. We propose a control design approach
that first generates a control policy for nonlinear deterministic models with
full state observation. The resulting control policy is then used to build an
importance-like probability distribution over the space of control sequences
which are to be evaluated for the true stochastic and state-uncertain dynamics.
This distribution serves in the sampling step within a random search control
optimization procedure, to focus the exploration effort on certain regions of
the control space. The sampled control sequences are assigned costs determined
by a prescribed finite-horizon performance and safety measure, which is based
on the stochastic dynamics. This sampling algorithm is parallelizable and shown
to have computational complexity indifferent to the state dimension, and to be
able to guarantee safety over the prescribed prediction horizon. A numerical
simulation is provided to test the applicability and effectiveness of the
presented approach and compare it to a certainty equivalence controller.

<p class="mathjax">This paper quantifies the impact of adverse environmental conditions on the
detection of fiducial markers (i.e., artificial landmarks) by color cameras
mounted on rotorcraft. We restrict our attention to square markers with a
black-and-white pattern of grid cells that can be nested to allow detection at
multiple scales. These markers have the potential to enhance the reliability of
precision takeoff and landing at vertiports by flying vehicles in urban
settings. Prior work has shown, in particular, that these markers can be
detected with high precision (i.e., few false positives) and high recall (i.e.,
few false negatives). However, most of this prior work has been based on image
sequences collected indoors with hand-held cameras. Our work is based on image
sequences collected outdoors with cameras mounted on a quadrotor during
semi-autonomous takeoff and landing operations under adverse environmental
conditions that include variations in temperature, illumination, wind speed,
humidity, visibility, and precipitation. In addition to precision and recall,
performance measures include continuity, availability, robustness, resiliency,
and coverage volume. We release both our dataset and the code we used for
analysis to the public as open source.

<p class="mathjax">In order for a bimanual robot to manipulate an object that is held by both
hands, it must construct motion plans such that the transformation between its
end effectors remains fixed. This amounts to complicated nonlinear equality
constraints in the configuration space, which are difficult for trajectory
optimizers. In addition, the set of feasible configurations becomes a measure
zero set, which presents a challenge to sampling-based motion planners. We
leverage an analytic solution to the inverse kinematics problem to parametrize
the configuration space, resulting in a lower-dimensional representation where
the set of valid configurations has positive measure. We describe how to use
this parametrization with existing algorithms for motion planning, including
sampling-based approaches, trajectory optimizers, and techniques that plan
through convex inner-approximations of collision-free space.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-domain pedestrian detection aims to generalize pedestrian detectors
from one label-rich domain to another label-scarce domain, which is crucial for
various real-world applications. Most recent works focus on domain alignment to
train domain-adaptive detectors either at the instance level or image level.
From a practical point of view, one-stage detectors are faster. Therefore, we
concentrate on designing a cross-domain algorithm for rapid one-stage detectors
that lacks instance-level proposals and can only perform image-level feature
alignment. However, pure image-level feature alignment causes the
foreground-background misalignment issue to arise, i.e., the foreground
features in the source domain image are falsely aligned with background
features in the target domain image. To address this issue, we systematically
analyze the importance of foreground and background in image-level cross-domain
alignment, and learn that background plays a more critical role in image-level
cross-domain alignment. Therefore, we focus on cross-domain background feature
alignment while minimizing the influence of foreground features on the
cross-domain alignment stage. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely,
background-focused distribution alignment (BFDA), to train domain adaptive
onestage pedestrian detectors. Specifically, BFDA first decouples the
background features from the whole image feature maps and then aligns them via
a novel long-short-range discriminator.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an innovative approach to enhance control over audio
generation by emphasizing the alignment between audio and text representations
during model training. In the context of language model-based audio generation,
the model leverages input from both textual and audio token representations to
predict subsequent audio tokens. However, the current configuration lacks
explicit regularization to ensure the alignment between the chosen text
representation and the language model's predictions. Our proposal involves the
incorporation of audio and text representation regularization, particularly
during the classifier-free guidance (CFG) phase, where the text condition is
excluded from cross attention during language model training. The aim of this
proposed representation regularization is to minimize discrepancies in audio
and text similarity compared to other samples within the same training batch.
Experimental results on both music and audio generation tasks demonstrate that
our proposed methods lead to improvements in objective metrics for both audio
and music generation, as well as an enhancement in the human perception for
audio generation.

<p class="mathjax">Previous efforts on reconfigurable analog circuits mostly focused on
specialized analog circuits, produced through careful co-design, or on highly
reconfigurable, but relatively resource inefficient, accelerators that
implement analog compute paradigms. This work deals with an intermediate point
in the design space: Specialized reconfigurable circuits for analog compute
paradigms. This class of circuits requires new methodologies for performing
co-design, as prior techniques are typically highly specialized to conventional
circuit classes (e.g., filters, ADCs).
<br />In this context, we present Ark, a programming language for describing analog
compute paradigms. Ark enables progressive incorporation of analog behaviors
into computations, and deploys a validator and dynamical system compiler for
verifying and simulating computations. We use Ark to codify the design space
for three different exemplary circuit design problems, and demonstrate that Ark
helps exploring design trade-offs and evaluating the impact of nonidealities to
the computation.

Task-Specific Layers (PTSL), that leverages a common policy with dense
task-specific corrections through task-specific layers to better express shared
and variable task information. We then show that our model outperforms the
state of the art on the MT10 and MT50 benchmarks of Meta-World consisting of 10
and 50 goal-conditioned tasks for a Sawyer arm.

<p class="mathjax">Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing that
involves identifying and extracting subjective sentiment from text.
Self-training has recently emerged as an economical and efficient technique for
developing sentiment analysis models by leveraging a small amount of labeled
data and a larger amount of unlabeled data. However, the performance of a
self-training procedure heavily relies on the choice of the instance selection
strategy, which has not been studied thoroughly. This paper presents an
empirical study on various instance selection strategies for self-training on
two public sentiment datasets, and investigates the influence of the strategy
and hyper-parameters on the performance of self-training in various few-shot
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the challenges regarding the limits of their endurance and autonomous
capabilities, underwater docking for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has
become a topic of interest for many academic and commercial applications.
Herein, we take on the problem of state estimation during an autonomous
underwater docking mission. Docking operations typically involve only two
actors, a chaser and a target. We leverage the similarities to proximity
operations (prox-ops) from spacecraft robotic missions to frame the diverse
docking scenarios with a set of phases the chaser undergoes on the way to its
target. We use factor graphs to generalize the underlying estimation problem
for arbitrary underwater prox-ops. To showcase our framework, we use this
factor graph approach to model an underwater homing scenario with an active
target as a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem. Using basic AUV
navigation sensors, relative Ultra-short Baseline measurements, and the
assumption of constant dynamics for the target, we derive factors that
constrain the chaser's state and the position and trajectory of the target. We
detail our front- and back-end software implementation using open-source
software and libraries, and verify its performance with both simulated and
field experiments. Obtained results show an overall increase in performance
against the unprocessed measurements, regardless of the presence of an
adversarial target whose dynamics void the modeled assumptions. However,
challenges with unmodeled noise parameters and stringent target motion
assumptions shed light on limitations that must be addressed to enhance the
accuracy and consistency of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the theoretical study of a Platform Equilibrium. There are
unit-demand buyers and unit-supply sellers. Each seller chooses to join or
remain off a trading platform, and each buyer can transact with any on-platform
seller but only a subset of different off-platform sellers. Given the choices
of sellers, prices form a competitive equilibrium, and clear the market
considering constraints on trade. Further, the platform charges a transaction
fee to all on-platform sellers, in the form of a fraction of on-platform
sellers' price. The platform chooses the fraction $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ to
maximize revenue. A Platform Equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium of the game
where each seller decides whether or not to join the platform, balancing the
effect of a possibly larger trading network against the imposition of a
transaction fee.
<br />Our main insights are:(i) In homogeneous (identical) good markets, pure
equilibria always exist and can be found by a polynomial time algorithm; (ii)
When the platform is unregulated, the resulting Platform Equilibrium guarantees
a tight $\Theta(log(min(m, n)))$-approximation of the ideal welfare in
homogeneous good markets; (iii) Even light regulation helps. When the
platform's fee is capped at $\alpha$, the price of anarchy is
2-$\alpha$/1-$\alpha$ for general unit demand valuations. For example, if the
platform takes 30 percent of the seller's revenue, a rather high fee, our
analysis implies the welfare in a Platform Equilibrium is still a
0.412-fraction of the ideal welfare. Some of our analysis extends beyond
unit-demand buyers as well as to markets where sellers have production costs.

it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as
genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can
help understand the user preferences to generate personalized recommendations
and item cold starting. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of
metadata - \textit{genre} labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV
series help categorize a collection of titles into different themes and
correspondingly setting up the audience expectation. We present some of the
challenges associated with using genre label information and propose a new way
of examining the genre information that we call as the \textit{Genre Spectrum}.
The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our
offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.
Furthermore, we also talk about applications of LLMs in augmenting content
metadata which could eventually be used to achieve effective organization of
recommendations in user's 2-D home-grid.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the weighted least squares spline approximation of a noisy
dataset. By interpreting the weights as a probability distribution, we maximize
the associated entropy subject to the constraint that the mean squared error is
prescribed to a desired (small) value. Acting on this error yields a robust
regression method that automatically detects and removes outliers from the data
during the fitting procedure, by assigning them a very small weight. We discuss
the use of both spline functions and spline curves. A number of numerical
illustrations have been included to disclose the potentialities of the

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we contribute towards the development of video-based epileptic
seizure classification by introducing a novel framework (SETR-PKD), which could
achieve privacy-preserved early detection of seizures in videos. Specifically,
our framework has two significant components - (1) It is built upon optical
flow features extracted from the video of a seizure, which encodes the seizure
motion semiotics while preserving the privacy of the patient; (2) It utilizes a
transformer based progressive knowledge distillation, where the knowledge is
gradually distilled from networks trained on a longer portion of video samples
to the ones which will operate on shorter portions. Thus, our proposed
framework addresses the limitations of the current approaches which compromise
the privacy of the patients by directly operating on the RGB video of a seizure
as well as impede real-time detection of a seizure by utilizing the full video
sample to make a prediction. Our SETR-PKD framework could detect tonic-clonic
seizures (TCSs) in a privacy-preserving manner with an accuracy of 83.9% while
they are only half-way into their progression. Our data and code is available

<p class="mathjax">Systematic generalization is a crucial aspect of intelligence, which refers
to the ability to generalize to novel tasks by combining known subtasks and
concepts. One critical factor that has been shown to influence systematic
generalization is the diversity of training data. However, diversity can be
defined in various ways, as data have many factors of variation. A more
granular understanding of how different aspects of data diversity affect
systematic generalization is lacking. We present new evidence in the problem of
Visual Question Answering (VQA) that reveals that the diversity of simple tasks
(i.e. tasks formed by a few subtasks and concepts) plays a key role in
achieving systematic generalization. This implies that it may not be essential
to gather a large and varied number of complex tasks, which could be costly to
obtain. We demonstrate that this result is independent of the similarity
between the training and testing data and applies to well-known families of
neural network architectures for VQA (i.e. monolithic architectures and neural
module networks). Additionally, we observe that neural module networks leverage
all forms of data diversity we evaluated, while monolithic architectures
require more extensive amounts of data to do so. These findings provide a first
step towards understanding the interactions between data diversity design,
neural network architectures, and systematic generalization capabilities.

well-established technique for explaining black-box models. Our neural network
is trained using standard backward propagation optimization methods, and is

advantages, including the ability to provide valid explanations with no

prediction with explanation serves as a regularizer, which improves the model's
performance. Moreover, the regularized prediction enhances the model's

a complex challenge, further complicated when the robot's own geometry and
multiple desired behaviors are considered. To address this issue, we introduce
a new framework based on Geometric Projectors (GeoPro) for constrained
optimization. This novel framework allows for the generation of task-agnostic
behaviors that are compliant with geometric constraints. GeoPro streamlines the
design of behaviors in both task and configuration spaces, offering diverse
functionalities such as collision avoidance and goal-reaching, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. We validate the efficacy of our work
through simulations and Franka Emika robotic experiments, comparing its
performance against state-of-the-art methodologies. This comprehensive

tackles a fundamental issue in wireless ranging: the unpredictability of
real-time multipath determination, especially in challenging conditions such as
when there is no direct line of sight. We achieve this by fusing range
measurements with inertial measurements obtained from a low cost Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU). For this purpose, we introduce a novel asymmetric noise
model crafted specifically for non-Gaussian multipath disturbances.
Additionally, we present a novel Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)-family trust-region
adaptation of the iSAM2 fusion algorithm, which is optimized for robust
performance for our ranging-IMU fusion problem. We evaluate our solution in a
densely occupied real office environment. Our proposed solution can achieve
temporally consistent localization with an average absolute accuracy of
$\sim$0.3m in real-world settings. Furthermore, our results indicate that we
can achieve comparable accuracy even with infrequent (1Hz) range measurements.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying a linear system model from data has wide applications in control
theory. The existing work on finite sample analysis for linear system
identification typically uses data from a single system trajectory under i.i.d
random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics is truly linear. In
contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a linearized model when the
true underlying dynamics is nonlinear. We provide a multiple trajectories-based
deterministic data acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least
squares algorithm, and provide a finite sample error bound on the learned
linearized dynamics. Our error bound demonstrates a trade-off between the error
due to nonlinearity and the error due to noise, and shows that one can learn
the linearized dynamics with arbitrarily small error given sufficiently many
samples. We validate our results through experiments, where we also show the
potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a single
trajectory with i.i.d random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous navigation in the underwater environment is challenging due to
limited visibility, dynamic changes, and the lack of a cost-efficient accurate
localization system. We introduce UIVNav, a novel end-to-end underwater
navigation solution designed to drive robots over Objects of Interest (OOI)
while avoiding obstacles, without relying on localization. UIVNav uses
imitation learning and is inspired by the navigation strategies used by human
divers who do not rely on localization. UIVNav consists of the following
phases: (1) generating an intermediate representation (IR), and (2) training
the navigation policy based on human-labeled IR. By training the navigation
policy on IR instead of raw data, the second phase is domain-invariant -- the
navigation policy does not need to be retrained if the domain or the OOI
changes. We show this by deploying the same navigation policy for surveying two
different OOIs, oyster and rock reefs, in two different domains, simulation,
and a real pool. We compared our method with complete coverage and random walk
methods which showed that our method is more efficient in gathering information
for OOIs while also avoiding obstacles. The results show that UIVNav chooses to
visit the areas with larger area sizes of oysters or rocks with no prior
information about the environment or localization. Moreover, a robot using
UIVNav compared to complete coverage method surveys on average 36% more oysters
when traveling the same distances. We also demonstrate the feasibility of
real-time deployment of UIVNavin pool experiments with BlueROV underwater robot
for surveying a bed of oyster shells.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the safety-critical navigation problem with Signal
Temporal Logic (STL) tasks. We developed an explicit reference governor-guided
control barrier function (ERG-guided CBF) method that enables the application
of first-order CBFs to high-order linearizable systems. This method
significantly reduces the conservativeness of the existing CBF approaches for
high-order systems. Furthermore, our framework provides safety-critical
guarantees in the sense of obstacle avoidance by constructing the margin of
safety and updating direction of safe evolution in the agent's state space. To
improve control performance and enhance STL satisfaction, we employ efficient
gradient-based methods for iteratively learning optimal parameters of
ERG-guided CBF. We validate the algorithm through both high-order linear and
nonlinear systems. A video demonstration can be found on:

<p class="mathjax">A major challenge with off-road autonomous navigation is the lack of maps or
road markings that can be used to plan a path for autonomous robots. Classical
path planning methods mostly assume a perfectly known environment without
accounting for the inherent perception and sensing uncertainty from detecting
terrain and obstacles in off-road environments. Recent work in computer vision
and deep neural networks has advanced the capability of terrain traversability
segmentation from raw images; however, the feasibility of using these noisy
segmentation maps for navigation and path planning has not been adequately
explored. To address this problem, this research proposes an uncertainty-aware
path planning method, URA* using aerial images for autonomous navigation in
off-road environments. An ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) model is
first used to perform pixel-level traversability estimation from aerial images
of the region of interest. The traversability predictions are represented as a
grid of traversal probability values. An uncertainty-aware planner is then
applied to compute the best path from a start point to a goal point given these
noisy traversal probability estimates. The proposed planner also incorporates
replanning techniques to allow rapid replanning during online robot operation.
The proposed method is evaluated on the Massachusetts Road Dataset, the
DeepGlobe dataset, as well as a dataset of aerial images from off-road proving
grounds at Mississippi State University. Results show that the proposed image
segmentation and planning methods outperform conventional planning algorithms
in terms of the quality and feasibility of the initial path, as well as the
quality of replanned paths.

<p class="mathjax">Object understanding in egocentric visual data is arguably a fundamental
research topic in egocentric vision. However, existing object datasets are
either non-egocentric or have limitations in object categories, visual content,
and annotation granularities. In this work, we introduce EgoObjects, a
large-scale egocentric dataset for fine-grained object understanding. Its Pilot
version contains over 9K videos collected by 250 participants from 50+
countries using 4 wearable devices, and over 650K object annotations from 368
object categories. Unlike prior datasets containing only object category
labels, EgoObjects also annotates each object with an instance-level
identifier, and includes over 14K unique object instances. EgoObjects was
designed to capture the same object under diverse background complexities,
surrounding objects, distance, lighting and camera motion. In parallel to the
data collection, we conducted data annotation by developing a multi-stage
federated annotation process to accommodate the growing nature of the dataset.
To bootstrap the research on EgoObjects, we present a suite of 4 benchmark
tasks around the egocentric object understanding, including a novel instance
level- and the classical category level object detection. Moreover, we also
introduce 2 novel continual learning object detection tasks. The dataset and
API are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoObjects.

model-generated text explanations of movie recommendations may help users, and
explore what different components of these text explanations that users like or
dislike, especially in contrast to existing human movie reviews. We found that
participants gave no significantly different rankings between movies, nor did
they give significantly different individual quality scores to reviews of
movies that they had never seen before. However, participants did mark reviews
as significantly better when they were movies they had seen before. We also
explore specific aspects of movie review texts that participants marked as
important for each quality. Overall, we establish that modern LLMs are a
promising source of recommendation explanations, and we intend on further
exploring personalizable text explanations in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Safety is a core challenge of autonomous robot motion planning, especially in
the presence of dynamic and uncertain obstacles. Many recent results use
learning and deep learning-based motion planners and prediction modules to
predict multiple possible obstacle trajectories and generate obstacle-aware ego
robot plans. However, planners that ignore the inherent uncertainties in such
predictions incur collision risks and lack formal safety guarantees. In this
paper, we present a computationally efficient safety filtering solution to
reduce the collision risk of ego robot motion plans using multiple samples of
obstacle trajectory predictions. The proposed approach reformulates the
collision avoidance problem by computing safe halfspaces based on obstacle
sample trajectories using distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
techniques. The safe halfspaces are used in a model predictive control
(MPC)-like safety filter to apply corrections to the reference ego trajectory
thereby promoting safer planning. The efficacy and computational efficiency of
our approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Categorical semantics of type theories are often characterized as
structure-preserving functors. This is because in category theory both the
syntax and the domain of interpretation are uniformly treated as structured
categories, so that we can express interpretations as structure-preserving
functors between them. This mathematical characterization of semantics makes it
convenient to manipulate and to reason about relationships between
interpretations. Motivated by this success of functorial semantics, we address
the question of finding a functorial analogue in abstract interpretation, a
general framework for comparing semantics, so that we can bring similar
benefits of functorial semantics to semantic abstractions used in abstract
interpretation. Major differences concern the notion of interpretation that is
being considered. Indeed, conventional semantics are value-based whereas
abstract interpretation typically deals with more complex properties. In this
paper, we propose a functorial approach to abstract interpretation and study
associated fundamental concepts therein. In our approach, interpretations are
expressed as oplax functors in the category of posets, and abstraction
relations between interpretations are expressed as lax natural transformations
representing concretizations. We present examples of these formal concepts from
monadic semantics of programming languages and discuss soundness.

<p class="mathjax">The generalization ability of machine learning models degrades significantly
when the test distribution shifts away from the training distribution. We
investigate the problem of training models that are robust to shifts caused by
changes in the distribution of class-priors or group-priors. The presence of
skewed training priors can often lead to the models overfitting to spurious
features. Unlike existing methods, which optimize for either the worst or the
average performance over classes or groups, our work is motivated by the need
for finer control over the robustness properties of the model. We present an
extremely lightweight post-hoc approach that performs scaling adjustments to
predictions from a pre-trained model, with the goal of minimizing a
distributionally robust loss around a chosen target distribution. These
adjustments are computed by solving a constrained optimization problem on a
validation set and applied to the model during test time. Our constrained
optimization objective is inspired by a natural notion of robustness to
controlled distribution shifts. Our method comes with provable guarantees and
empirically makes a strong case for distributional robust post-hoc classifiers.

<p class="mathjax">Recent image enhancement methods have shown the advantages of using a pair of
long and short-exposure images for low-light photography. These image
modalities offer complementary strengths and weaknesses. The former yields an
image that is clean but blurry due to camera or object motion, whereas the
latter is sharp but noisy due to low photon count. Motivated by the fact that
modern smartphones come equipped with multiple rear-facing camera sensors, we
propose a novel dual-camera method for obtaining a high-quality image. Our
method uses a synchronized burst of short exposure images captured by one
camera and a long exposure image simultaneously captured by another. Having a
synchronized short exposure burst alongside the long exposure image enables us
to (i) obtain better denoising by using a burst instead of a single image, (ii)
recover motion from the burst and use it for motion-aware deblurring of the
long exposure image, and (iii) fuse the two results to further enhance quality.
Our method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on synthetic dual-camera
images from the GoPro dataset with five times fewer training parameters
compared to the next best method. We also show that our method qualitatively
outperforms competing approaches on real synchronized dual-camera captures.

real-world intricacies in open-domain dialogues. These intricacies manifest in
the form of increased complexity in contextual interactions, extended dialogue
sessions encompassing a diverse array of topics, and more frequent contextual
shifts. To handle these intricacies arising from evolving LLM-based chat
systems, we propose joint dialogue segmentation and state tracking per segment
in open-domain dialogue systems. Assuming a zero-shot setting appropriate to a
true open-domain dialogue system, we propose S3-DST, a structured prompting
technique that harnesses Pre-Analytical Recollection, a novel grounding
mechanism we designed for improving long context tracking. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed approach in joint segmentation and state tracking, we
evaluate S3-DST on a proprietary anonymized open-domain dialogue dataset, as
well as publicly available DST and segmentation datasets. Across all datasets
and settings, S3-DST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating its potency and robustness the next generation of LLM-based chat
systems.

<p class="mathjax">Reference-based metrics that operate at the sentence level typically
outperform quality estimation metrics, which have access only to the source and
system output. This is unsurprising, since references resolve ambiguities that
may be present in the source. We investigate whether additional source context
can effectively substitute for a reference. We present a metric, SLIDE (SLiding
Document Evaluator), which operates on blocks of sentences using a window that
slides over each document in the test set, feeding each chunk into an
unmodified, off-the-shelf quality estimation model. We find that SLIDE obtains
significantly higher pairwise system accuracy than its sentence-level baseline,
in some cases even eliminating the gap with reference-base metrics. This
suggests that source context may provide the same information as a human
reference.

<p class="mathjax">Chatbots have been studied for more than half a century. With the rapid
development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies in recent years,
chatbots using large language models (LLMs) have received much attention
nowadays. Compared with traditional ones, modern chatbots are more powerful and
have been used in real-world applications. There are however, bias and fairness
concerns in modern chatbot design. Due to the huge amounts of training data,
extremely large model sizes, and lack of interpretability, bias mitigation and
fairness preservation of modern chatbots are challenging. Thus, a comprehensive
overview on bias and fairness in chatbot systems is given in this paper. The
history of chatbots and their categories are first reviewed. Then, bias sources
and potential harms in applications are analyzed. Considerations in designing
fair and unbiased chatbot systems are examined. Finally, future research
directions are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">This paper integrates graph-to-sequence into an end-to-end text-to-speech
framework for syntax-aware modelling with syntactic information of input text.
Specifically, the input text is parsed by a dependency parsing module to form a
syntactic graph. The syntactic graph is then encoded by a graph encoder to
extract the syntactic hidden information, which is concatenated with phoneme
embedding and input to the alignment and flow-based decoding modules to
generate the raw audio waveform. The model is experimented on two languages,
English and Mandarin, using single-speaker, few samples of target speakers, and
multi-speaker datasets, respectively. Experimental results show better prosodic
consistency performance between input text and generated audio, and also get
higher scores in the subjective prosodic evaluation, and show the ability of
voice conversion. Besides, the efficiency of the model is largely boosted
through the design of the AI chip operator with 5x acceleration.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing sandstorm image enhancement methods are based on traditional
theory and prior knowledge, which often restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. In addition, these approaches often adopt a strategy of
color correction followed by dust removal, which makes the algorithm structure
too complex. To solve the issue, we introduce a novel image restoration model,
named all-in-one sandstorm removal network (AOSR-Net). This model is developed
based on a re-formulated sandstorm scattering model, which directly establishes
the image mapping relationship by integrating intermediate parameters. Such
integration scheme effectively addresses the problems of over-enhancement and
weak generalization in the field of sand dust image enhancement. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world sandstorm images demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed AOSR-Net over state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) has been extensively applied in various domains,
such as multimedia search engines and recommendation systems. Most existing CMR
methods focus on image-to-text retrieval, whereas audio-to-text retrieval, a
less explored domain, has posed a great challenge due to the difficulty to
uncover discriminative features from audio clips and texts. Existing studies
are restricted in the following two ways: 1) Most researchers utilize
contrastive learning to construct a common subspace where similarities among
data can be measured. However, they considers only cross-modal transformation,
neglecting the intra-modal separability. Besides, the temperature parameter is
not adaptively adjusted along with semantic guidance, which degrades the
performance. 2) These methods do not take latent representation reconstruction
into account, which is essential for semantic alignment. This paper introduces
a novel audio-text oriented CMR approach, termed Contrastive Latent Space
Reconstruction Learning (CLSR). CLSR improves contrastive representation
learning by taking intra-modal separability into account and adopting an
adaptive temperature control strategy. Moreover, the latent representation
reconstruction modules are embedded into the CMR framework, which improves
modal interaction. Experiments in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods
on two audio-text datasets have validated the superiority of CLSR.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model for general image
segmentation, has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across numerous
natural image segmentation tasks. However, SAM's performance significantly
declines when applied to medical images, primarily due to the substantial
disparity between natural and medical image domains. To effectively adapt SAM
to medical images, it is important to incorporate critical third-dimensional
information, i.e., volumetric or temporal knowledge, during fine-tuning.
Simultaneously, we aim to harness SAM's pre-trained weights within its original
2D backbone to the fullest extent. In this paper, we introduce a
modality-agnostic SAM adaptation framework, named as MA-SAM, that is applicable
to various volumetric and video medical data. Our method roots in the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy to update only a small portion of
weight increments while preserving the majority of SAM's pre-trained weights.
By injecting a series of 3D adapters into the transformer blocks of the image
encoder, our method enables the pre-trained 2D backbone to extract
third-dimensional information from input data. The effectiveness of our method
has been comprehensively evaluated on four medical image segmentation tasks, by
using 10 public datasets across CT, MRI, and surgical video data. Remarkably,
without using any prompt, our method consistently outperforms various
state-of-the-art 3D approaches, surpassing nnU-Net by 0.9%, 2.6%, and 9.9% in
Dice for CT multi-organ segmentation, MRI prostate segmentation, and surgical
scene segmentation respectively. Our model also demonstrates strong
generalization, and excels in challenging tumor segmentation when prompts are
used. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cchen-cc/MA-SAM.

<p class="mathjax">As impact of COVID-19 pandemic winds down, both individuals and society
gradually return to pre-pandemic activities. This study aims to explore how
people's emotions have changed from the pre-pandemic during the pandemic to
post-emergency period and whether it has returned to pre-pandemic level. We
collected Reddit data in 2019 (pre-pandemic), 2020 (peak pandemic), 2021, and
2022 (late stages of pandemic, transitioning period to post-emergency period)
from subreddits in 128 universities/colleges in the U.S., and a set of
school-level characteristics. We predicted two sets of sentiments from a
pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) and graph
attention network (GAT) that leverages both rich semantic and relational
information among posted messages and then applied a logistic stacking method
to obtain the final sentiment classification. After obtaining sentiment label
for each message, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate
temporal trend in sentiment from 2019 to 2022 and how school-level factors may
affect sentiment. Compared to the year 2019, the odds of negative sentiment in
years 2020, 2021, and 2022 are 24%, 4.3%, and 10.3% higher, respectively, which
are all statistically significant(adjusted $p$&lt;0.05). Our study findings
suggest a partial recovery in the sentiment composition in the
post-pandemic-emergency era. The results align with common expectations and
provide a detailed quantification of how sentiments have evolved from 2019 to
2022.

Nevertheless, they confront the formidable challenge of striking a delicate

"unknown unknowns", i.e. novel unexpected environments not encountered during

Our approach enhances visual perception by leveraging the Variational
Prototyping Encoder (VPE) to adeptly identify and handle novel inputs, then
incrementally augmenting data using neural style transfer to enrich
underrepresented data. By comparing models trained solely on original datasets
with those trained on a combination of original and augmented datasets, we

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) controller for
lane-keeping systems, effectively handling model uncertainties and
disturbances. First, quadratic constraints cover the nonlinearities brought by
the RNN controller, and the linear fractional transformation method models the
dynamics of system uncertainties. Second, we prove the robust stability of the
lane-keeping system in the presence of uncertain vehicle speed using a linear
matrix inequality. Then, we define a reachable set for the lane-keeping system.
Finally, to confirm the safety of the lane-keeping system with tracking error
bound, we formulate semidefinite programming to approximate the outer set of
the reachable set. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach
confirms the stabilizing RNN controller and validates the safety with an
untrained dataset with untrained varying road curvatures.

<p class="mathjax">Battery energy storage systems (BESS) play a pivotal role in future power
systems as they contribute to achiev-ing the net-zero carbon emission
objectives. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithium-ion batteries,
have been exten-sively deployed. The degradation of these batteries
significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately
quantify the battery degradation, however, the model complexity hinders their
applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different
scales. To address this issue, this paper pre-sents a novel approach,
introducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery degradation model
(SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the
scheduled BESS daily operational profiles. By leveraging sparse neural
networks, this approach achieves accurate degradation predic-tion while
substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network
model. The computational burden of inte-grating battery degradation into
day-ahead energy scheduling is thus substantially alleviated. Case studies,
conducted on both microgrids and bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency
and suitability of the proposed SNNBD-integrated scheduling model that can
effectively address battery degradation concerns while optimizing day-ahead
energy scheduling operations.

<p class="mathjax">The intention of the target can help us to estimate its future motion state
more accurately. This paper proposes an intention-aware planner to enhance
safety and robustness in aerial tracking applications. Firstly, we utilize the
Mediapipe framework to estimate target's pose. A risk assessment function and a
state observation function are designed to predict the target intention.
Afterwards, an intention-driven hybrid A* method is proposed for target motion
prediction, ensuring that the target's future positions align with its
intention. Finally, an intention-aware optimization approach, in conjunction
with particular penalty formulations, is designed to generate a
spatial-temporal optimal trajectory. Benchmark comparisons validate the
superior performance of our proposed methodology across diverse scenarios. This
is attributed to the integration of the target intention into the planner
through coupled formulations.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) represent the recent success of deep learning in
achieving remarkable human-like predictive performance. It has become a
mainstream strategy to leverage fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for various
real-world applications due to the prohibitive expenses associated with LLM
training. The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in LLM
fine-tuning with direct impacts on both fine-tuning efficiency and fine-tuned
LLM quality. Existing learning rate policies are primarily designed for
training traditional deep neural networks (DNNs), which may not work well for
LLM fine-tuning. We reassess the research challenges and opportunities of
learning rate tuning in the coming era of Large Language Models. This paper
makes three original contributions. First, we revisit existing learning rate
policies to analyze the critical challenges of learning rate tuning in the era
of LLMs. Second, we present LRBench++ to benchmark learning rate policies and
facilitate learning rate tuning for both traditional DNNs and LLMs. Third, our
experimental analysis with LRBench++ demonstrates the key differences between
LLM fine-tuning and traditional DNN training and validates our analysis.

complex challenges in robotics. This paper introduces the DenseTact-Mini, an
optical tactile sensor with a soft, rounded, smooth gel surface and compact
design equipped with a synthetic fingernail. We propose three distinct grasping
strategies: tap grasping using adhesion forces such as electrostatic and van

object and fingernail, and fingertip grasping with two soft fingertips. Through
comprehensive evaluations, the DenseTact-Mini demonstrates a lifting success
rate exceeding 90.2% when grasping various objects, spanning items from 1mm

demands spectrum-sharing techniques. Effective coexistence management is
crucial to avoid harmful interference, especially with critical systems like
nautical and aerial radars in which incumbent radios operate mission-critical
communication links. In this demo, we showcase a framework that leverages
Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator with
hardware-in-the-loop, as a playground to study commercial radar waveforms
coexisting with a cellular network in CBRS band in complex environments. We
create an ad-hoc high-fidelity spectrum-sharing scenario for this purpose. We
deploy a cellular network to collect IQ samples with the aim of training an ML
agent that runs at the base station. The agent has the goal of detecting
incumbent radar transmissions and vacating the cellular bandwidth to avoid
interfering with the radar operations. Our experiment results show an average
detection accuracy of 88%, with an average detection time of 137 ms.

<p class="mathjax">Slip and skid compensation is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in
outdoor environments and uneven terrains. In addition to the general slipping
and skidding hazards for mobile robots in outdoor environments, slip and skid
cause uncertainty for the trajectory tracking system and put the validity of
stability analysis at risk. Despite research in this field, having a real-world
feasible online slip and skid compensation is still challenging due to the
complexity of wheel-terrain interaction in outdoor environments. This paper
presents a novel trajectory tracking technique with real-world feasible online
slip and skid compensation at the vehicle-level for skid-steering mobile robots
in outdoor environments. The sliding mode control technique is utilized to
design a robust trajectory tracking system to be able to consider the parameter
uncertainty of this type of robot. Two previously developed deep learning
models [1], [2] are integrated into the control feedback loop to estimate the
robot's slipping and undesired skidding and feed the compensator in a real-time
manner. The main advantages of the proposed technique are (1) considering two
slip-related parameters rather than the conventional three slip parameters at
the wheel-level, and (2) having an online real-world feasible slip and skid
compensator to be able to reduce the tracking errors in unforeseen
environments. The experimental results show that the proposed controller with
the slip and skid compensator improves the performance of the trajectory
tracking system by more than 27%.

<p class="mathjax">Stencil computation is an extensively-utilized class of scientific-computing
applications that can be efficiently accelerated by graphics processing units
(GPUs). Out-of-core approaches enable a GPU to handle large stencil codes whose
data size is beyond the memory capacity of the GPU. However, current research
on out-of-core stencil computation primarily focus on minimizing the amount of
data transferred between the CPU and GPU. Few studies consider simultaneously
optimizing data transfer and kernel execution. To fill the research gap, this
work presents a synergy between on- and off-chip data reuse for out-of-core
stencil codes, termed SO2DR. First, overlapping regions between data chunks are
shared in the off-chip memory to eliminate redundant CPU-GPU data transfer.
Secondly, redundant computation at the off-chip memory level is intentionally
introduced to decouple kernel execution from region sharing, hence enabling
data reuse in the on-chip memory. Experimental results demonstrate that SO2DR
significantly enhances the kernel-execution performance while reducing the
CPU-GPU data-transfer time. Specifically, SO2DR achieves average speedups of
2.78x and 1.14x for five stencil benchmarks, compared to an out-of-core stencil
code which is free of redundant transfer and computation, and an in-core
stencil code which is free of data transfer, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) pose a formidable challenge to emergency
medical services by overwhelming available resources and personnel. Effective
victim assessment is paramount to minimizing casualties during such a crisis.
In this paper, we introduce ARTEMIS, an AI-driven Robotic Triage Labeling and
Emergency Medical Information System. This system comprises a deep learning
model for acuity labeling that is integrated with a robot, that performs the
preliminary assessment of injury severity in patients and assigns appropriate
triage labels. Additionally, we have developed a frontend (graphical user
interface) that is updated by the robots in real time and is accessible to the
first responders. To validate the reliability of our proposed algorithmic
triage protocol, we employed an off-the-shelf robot kit equipped with sensors
for vital sign acquisition. A controlled laboratory simulation of an MCI was
conducted to assess the system's performance and effectiveness in real-world
scenarios resulting in a triage-level classification accuracy of 92%. This
noteworthy achievement underscores the model's proficiency in discerning
crucial patterns for accurate triage classification, showcasing its promising
potential in healthcare applications.

<p class="mathjax">The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the world dramatically ever since
2020. The minimum availability of physical interactions during the lockdown has
caused more and more people to turn to online activities on social media
platforms. These platforms have provided essential updates regarding the
pandemic, serving as bridges for communications. Research on studying these
communications on different platforms emerges during the meantime. Prior
studies focus on areas such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis and
prediction tasks such as predicting COVID-19 positive cases, misinformation
spread, etc. However, online communications with media outlets remain
unexplored on an international scale. We have little knowledge about the
patterns of the media consumption geographically and their association with
offline political preference. We believe addressing these questions could help
governments and researchers better understand human behaviors during the
pandemic. In this thesis, we specifically investigate the online consumption of
media outlets on Twitter through a set of quantitative analyses. We make use of
several public media outlet datasets to extract media consumption from tweets
collected based on COVID-19 keyword matching. We make use of a metric
"interaction" to quantify media consumption through weighted Twitter
activities. We further construct a matrix based on it which could be directly
used to measure user-media consumption in different granularities. We then
conduct analyses on the United States level and global level. To the best of
our knowledge, this thesis presents the first-of-its-kind study on media
consumption on COVID-19 across countries, it sheds light on understanding how
people consume media outlets during the pandemic and provides potential
insights for peer researchers.

<p class="mathjax">International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is the task of
assigning ICD diagnosis codes to clinical notes. This can be challenging given
the large quantity of labels (nearly 9,000) and lengthy texts (up to 8,000
tokens). However, unlike the single-pass reading process in previous works,
humans tend to read the text and label definitions again to get more confident
answers. Moreover, although pretrained language models have been used to
address these problems, they suffer from huge memory usage. To address the
above problems, we propose a simple but effective model called the Multi-Hop
Label-wise ATtention (MHLAT), in which multi-hop label-wise attention is
deployed to get more precise and informative representations. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark MIMIC datasets indicate that our method achieves
significantly better or competitive performance on all seven metrics, with much
fewer parameters to optimize.

<p class="mathjax">Geometric motion planning offers effective and interpretable gait analysis
and optimization tools for locomoting systems. However, due to the curse of
dimensionality in coordinate optimization, a key component of geometric motion
planning, it is almost infeasible to apply current geometric motion planning to
high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we propose a gait-based coordinate
optimization method that overcomes the curse of dimensionality. We also
identify a unified geometric representation of locomotion by generalizing
various nonholonomic constraints into local metrics. By combining these two
approaches, we take a step towards geometric motion planning for
high-dimensional systems. We test our method in two classes of high-dimensional
systems - low Reynolds number swimmers and free-falling Cassie - with up to
11-dimensional shape variables. The resulting optimal gait in the
high-dimensional system shows better efficiency compared to that of the
reduced-order model. Furthermore, we provide a geometric optimality
interpretation of the optimal gait.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have issues with document question answering
(QA) in situations where the document is unable to fit in the small context
length of an LLM. To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on
retrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain
text. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are
naturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on.
Representing such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the
user's mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has
to query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and
seemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this
fundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called
PDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure
or content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
PDFTriage-augmented models across several classes of questions where existing
retrieval-augmented LLMs fail. To facilitate further research on this
fundamental problem, we release our benchmark dataset consisting of 900+
human-generated questions over 80 structured documents from 10 different
categories of question types for document QA.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding when two pieces of text convey the same information is a goal
touching many subproblems in NLP, including textual entailment and
fact-checking. This problem becomes more complex when those two pieces of text
are in different languages. Here, we introduce X-PARADE (Cross-lingual
Paragraph-level Analysis of Divergences and Entailments), the first
cross-lingual dataset of paragraph-level information divergences. Annotators
label a paragraph in a target language at the span level and evaluate it with
respect to a corresponding paragraph in a source language, indicating whether a
given piece of information is the same, new, or new but can be inferred. This
last notion establishes a link with cross-language NLI. Aligned paragraphs are
sourced from Wikipedia pages in different languages, reflecting real
information divergences observed in the wild. Armed with our dataset, we
investigate a diverse set of approaches for this problem, including classic
token alignment from machine translation, textual entailment methods that
localize their decisions, and prompting of large language models. Our results
show that these methods vary in their capability to handle inferable
information, but they all fall short of human performance.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method, named DualMesh-UDF, to extract a surface from unsigned
distance functions (UDFs), encoded by neural networks, or neural UDFs. Neural
UDFs are becoming increasingly popular for surface representation because of
their versatility in presenting surfaces with arbitrary topologies, as opposed
to the signed distance function that is limited to representing a closed
surface. However, the applications of neural UDFs are hindered by the notorious
difficulty in extracting the target surfaces they represent. Recent methods for
surface extraction from a neural UDF suffer from significant geometric errors
or topological artifacts due to two main difficulties: (1) A UDF does not
exhibit sign changes; and (2) A neural UDF typically has substantial
approximation errors. DualMesh-UDF addresses these two difficulties.
Specifically, given a neural UDF encoding a target surface $\bar{S}$ to be
recovered, we first estimate the tangent planes of $\bar{S}$ at a set of sample
points close to $\bar{S}$. Next, we organize these sample points into local
clusters, and for each local cluster, solve a linear least squares problem to
determine a final surface point. These surface points are then connected to
create the output mesh surface, which approximates the target surface. The
robust estimation of the tangent planes of the target surface and the
subsequent minimization problem constitute our core strategy, which contributes
to the favorable performance of DualMesh-UDF over other competing methods. To
efficiently implement this strategy, we employ an adaptive Octree. Within this
framework, we estimate the location of a surface point in each of the octree
cells identified as containing part of the target surface. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of
surface reconstruction quality while maintaining comparable computational
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, the problem of semantic information extraction for resource
constrained text data transmission is studied. In the considered model, a
sequence of text data need to be transmitted within a communication
resource-constrained network, which only allows limited data transmission.
Thus, at the transmitter, the original text data is extracted with natural
language processing techniques. Then, the extracted semantic information is
captured in a knowledge graph. An additional probability dimension is
introduced in this graph to capture the importance of each information. This
semantic information extraction problem is posed as an optimization framework
whose goal is to extract most important semantic information for transmission.
To find an optimal solution for this problem, a Floyd's algorithm based
solution coupled with an efficient sorting mechanism is proposed. Numerical
results testify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with regards to two
novel performance metrics including semantic uncertainty and semantic
similarity.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of artificial intelligence algorithms
being used to design adaptive optimal controllers through online learning. This
paper presents a model-free, real-time, data-efficient Q-learning-based
algorithm to solve the H$_{\infty}$ control of linear discrete-time systems.
The computational complexity is shown to reduce from
$\mathcal{O}(\underline{q}^3)$ in the literature to
$\mathcal{O}(\underline{q}^2)$ in the proposed algorithm, where $\underline{q}$
is quadratic in the sum of the size of state variables, control inputs, and
disturbance. An adaptive optimal controller is designed and the parameters of
the action and critic networks are learned online without the knowledge of the
system dynamics, making the proposed algorithm completely model-free. Also, a
sufficient probing noise is only needed in the first iteration and does not
affect the proposed algorithm. With no need for an initial stabilizing policy,
the algorithm converges to the closed-form solution obtained by solving the
Riccati equation. A simulation study is performed by applying the proposed
algorithm to real-time control of an autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD)
system for a real-world case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Satisfiability Modulo Counting (SMC) encompasses problems that require both
symbolic decision-making and statistical reasoning. Its general formulation
captures many real-world problems at the intersection of symbolic and
statistical Artificial Intelligence. SMC searches for policy interventions to
control probabilistic outcomes. Solving SMC is challenging because of its
highly intractable nature($\text{NP}^{\text{PP}}$-complete), incorporating
statistical inference and symbolic reasoning. Previous research on SMC solving
lacks provable guarantees and/or suffers from sub-optimal empirical
performance, especially when combinatorial constraints are present. We propose
XOR-SMC, a polynomial algorithm with access to NP-oracles, to solve highly
intractable SMC problems with constant approximation guarantees. XOR-SMC
transforms the highly intractable SMC into satisfiability problems, by
replacing the model counting in SMC with SAT formulae subject to randomized XOR
constraints. Experiments on solving important SMC problems in AI for social
good demonstrate that XOR-SMC finds solutions close to the true optimum,
outperforming several baselines which struggle to find good approximations for
the intractable model counting in SMC.

<p class="mathjax">Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent correlations among
entities but remain vulnerable to data corruption. In this work, we introduce a
modified trimmed-inner-product algorithm to robustly estimate the covariance in
an online scenario even in the presence of arbitrary and adversarial data
attacks. At each time step, data points, drawn nominally independently and
identically from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, arrive. However, a
certain fraction of these points may have been arbitrarily corrupted. We
propose an online algorithm to estimate the sparse inverse covariance (i.e.,
precision) matrix despite this corruption. We provide the error-bound and
convergence properties of the estimates to the true precision matrix under our
algorithms.

multiple criteria may conflict and differ in importance. We introduce Grasp
Ranking and Criteria Evaluation (GRaCE), a novel approach that employs
hierarchical rule-based logic and a rank-preserving utility function to
optimize grasps based on various criteria such as stability, kinematic
constraints, and goal-oriented functionalities. Additionally, we propose
GRaCE-OPT, a hybrid optimization strategy that combines gradient-based and
gradient-free methods to effectively navigate the complex, non-convex utility
function. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world scenarios show
that GRaCE requires fewer samples to achieve comparable or superior performance
relative to existing methods. The modular architecture of GRaCE allows for easy
customization and adaptation to specific application needs.

<p class="mathjax">Since annotating medical images for segmentation tasks commonly incurs
expensive costs, it is highly desirable to design an annotation-efficient
method to alleviate the annotation burden. Recently, contrastive learning has
exhibited a great potential in learning robust representations to boost
downstream tasks with limited labels. In medical imaging scenarios, ready-made
meta labels (i.e., specific attribute information of medical images) inherently
reveal semantic relationships among images, which have been used to define
positive pairs in previous work. However, the multi-perspective semantics
revealed by various meta labels are usually incompatible and can incur
intractable "semantic contradiction" when combining different meta labels. In
this paper, we tackle the issue of "semantic contradiction" in a
gradient-guided manner using our proposed Gradient Mitigator method, which
systematically unifies multi-perspective meta labels to enable a pre-trained
model to attain a better high-level semantic recognition ability. Moreover, we
emphasize that the fine-grained discrimination ability is vital for
segmentation-oriented pre-training, and develop a novel method called Gradient
Filter to dynamically screen pixel pairs with the most discriminating power
based on the magnitude of gradients. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
image segmentation datasets verify that our new method GCL: (1) learns
informative image representations and considerably boosts segmentation
performance with limited labels, and (2) shows promising generalizability on
out-of-distribution datasets.

<p class="mathjax">As autonomous driving technology matures, safety and robustness of its key
components, including trajectory prediction, is vital. Though real-world
datasets, such as Waymo Open Motion, provide realistic recorded scenarios for
model development, they often lack truly safety-critical situations. Rather
than utilizing unrealistic simulation or dangerous real-world testing, we
instead propose a framework to characterize such datasets and find hidden
safety-relevant scenarios within. Our approach expands the spectrum of
safety-relevance, allowing us to study trajectory prediction models under a
safety-informed, distribution shift setting. We contribute a generalized
scenario characterization method, a novel scoring scheme to find subtly-avoided
risky scenarios, and an evaluation of trajectory prediction models in this
setting. We further contribute a remediation strategy, achieving a 10% average

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS)-based solutions have recently garnered
significant interest across various computer vision tasks, offering notable
benefits in terms of dynamic range, temporal resolution, and inference speed.
However, as a relatively nascent vision sensor compared to Active Pixel Sensor
(APS) devices such as RGB cameras, DVS suffers from a dearth of ample labeled
datasets. Prior efforts to convert APS data into events often grapple with
issues such as a considerable domain shift from real events, the absence of
quantified validation, and layering problems within the time axis. In this
paper, we present a novel method for video-to-events stream conversion from
multiple perspectives, considering the specific characteristics of DVS. A
series of carefully designed losses helps enhance the quality of generated
event voxels significantly. We also propose a novel local dynamic-aware
timestamp inference strategy to accurately recover event timestamps from event
voxels in a continuous fashion and eliminate the temporal layering problem.
Results from rigorous validation through quantified metrics at all stages of
the pipeline establish our method unquestionably as the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA).

<p class="mathjax">With the growing emphasis on the development and integration of service
robots within household environments, we will need to endow robots with the
ability to reliably pour a variety of liquids. However, liquid handling and
pouring is a challenging task due to the complex dynamics and varying
properties of different liquids, the exacting precision required to prevent
spills and ensure accurate pouring, and the necessity for robots to adapt
seamlessly to a multitude of containers in real-world scenarios. In response to
these challenges, we propose a novel autonomous robotics pipeline that empowers
robots to execute precision pouring tasks, encompassing both carbonated and
non-carbonated liquids, as well as opaque and transparent liquids, into a
variety of transparent containers. Our proposed approach maximizes the
potential of RGB input alone, achieving zero-shot capability by harnessing

additional data collection, manual image annotations, or extensive training.
Furthermore, our work integrates ChatGPT, facilitating seamless interaction
between individuals without prior expertise in robotics and our pouring

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models (DM) can gradually learn to remove noise, which have been
widely used in artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in recent
years. The property of DM for eliminating noise leads us to wonder whether DM
can be applied to wireless communications to help the receiver mitigate the
channel noise. To address this, we propose channel denoising diffusion models
(CDDM) for semantic communications over wireless channels in this paper. CDDM
can be applied as a new physical layer module after the channel equalization to
learn the distribution of the channel input signal, and then utilizes this
learned knowledge to remove the channel noise. We derive corresponding training
and sampling algorithms of CDDM according to the forward diffusion process
specially designed to adapt the channel models and theoretically prove that the
well-trained CDDM can effectively reduce the conditional entropy of the
received signal under small sampling steps. Moreover, we apply CDDM to a
semantic communications system based on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for
image transmission. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDDM can
further reduce the mean square error (MSE) after minimum mean square error
(MMSE) equalizer, and the joint CDDM and JSCC system achieves better
performance than the JSCC system and the traditional JPEG2000 with low-density
parity-check (LDPC) code approach.

also proposed heterogeneity-aware preprocessing to let all the different types

the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach in a range of
simulated scenarios. The model can allocate targets' positions close to the
expert algorithm's result, with a median spatial gap less than a unit length.
This approach can be used in multi-robot systems deployed in search and rescue

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores general multi-robot task and motion planning, where
multiple robots in close proximity manipulate objects while satisfying
constraints and a given goal. In particular, we formulate the plan refinement
problem--which, given a task plan, finds valid assignments of variables
corresponding to solution trajectories--as a hybrid constraint satisfaction
problem. The proposed algorithm follows several design principles that yield
the following features: (1) efficient solution finding due to sequential
heuristics and implicit time and roadmap representations, and (2) maximized
feasible solution space obtained by introducing minimally necessary
coordination-induced constraints and not relying on prevalent simplifications
that exist in the literature. The evaluation results demonstrate the planning
efficiency of the proposed algorithm, outperforming the synchronous approach in

<p class="mathjax">LLMs are increasingly powerful and widely used to assist users in a variety
of tasks. This use risks the introduction of LLM biases to consequential
decisions such as job hiring, human performance evaluation, and criminal
sentencing. Bias in NLP systems along the lines of gender and ethnicity has
been widely studied, especially for specific stereotypes (e.g., Asians are good
at math). In this paper, we investigate bias along less studied, but still
consequential, dimensions, such as age and beauty, measuring subtler correlated
decisions that LLMs (specially autoregressive language models) make between
social groups and unrelated positive and negative attributes. We ask whether
LLMs hold wide-reaching biases of positive or negative sentiment for specific
social groups similar to the ``what is beautiful is good'' bias found in people
in experimental psychology. We introduce a template-generated dataset of
sentence completion tasks that asks the model to select the most appropriate
attribute to complete an evaluative statement about a person described as a
member of a specific social group. We also reverse the completion task to
select the social group based on an attribute. Finally, we report the
correlations that we find for multiple cutting-edge LLMs. This dataset can be
used as a benchmark to evaluate progress in more generalized biases and the
templating technique can be used to expand the benchmark with minimal
additional human annotation.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a popular technique
for training controllers for robots. However, for complex dynamic robot control
tasks, RL-based method often produces controllers with unrealistic styles. In
contrast, humans can learn well-stylized skills under supervisions. For
example, people learn table tennis skills by imitating the motions of coaches.
Such reference motions are often incomplete, e.g. without the presence of an
actual ball. Inspired by this, we propose an RL-based algorithm to train a
robot that can learn the playing style from such incomplete human
demonstrations. We collect data through the teaching-and-dragging method. We
also propose data augmentation techniques to enable our robot to adapt to balls
of different velocities. We finally evaluate our policy in different simulators
with varying dynamics.

different user equipment may demand various extended reality (XR) services. In
such heterogeneous networks, time-frequency resource allocation needs to be
more adaptive since XR services are usually multi-modal and latency-sensitive.
To this end, we develop a scalable time-frequency resource allocation method
based on multi-numerology and mini-slot. To appropriately determining the
discrete parameters of multi-numerology and mini-slot for multiuser immersive

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops an algorithmic approach for obtaining approximate,
numerical estimates of the sizes of subcodes of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, all of
the codewords in which satisfy a constraint. Our algorithm is based on a
statistical physics technique for estimating the partition functions of spin
systems, which in turn makes use of a sampler that produces RM codewords
according to a Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution. The Gibbs distribution is
designed so that it is biased towards codewords that respect the constraint. We
apply our method to approximately compute the sizes of runlength limited (RLL)
subcodes and obtain estimates of the weight distribution of
moderate-blocklength RM codes. We observe that the estimates returned by our
method are close to the true sizes when these sizes are either known or
computable by brute-force search; in other cases, our computations provide
provably robust estimates.

are posed in our dataset with different dynamic levels and weather conditions.
Objects in both stereo images and point clouds are well-segmented with their

<p class="mathjax">Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years. In
particular, dynamic regret and adaptive regret are proposed as two principled
performance measures for online convex optimization in non-stationary
environments. To optimize them, a two-layer online ensemble is usually deployed
due to the inherent uncertainty of the non-stationarity, in which a group of
base-learners are maintained and a meta-algorithm is employed to track the best
one on the fly. However, the two-layer structure raises the concern about the
computational complexity -- those methods typically maintain $\mathcal{O}(\log
T)$ base-learners simultaneously for a $T$-round online game and thus perform
multiple projections onto the feasible domain per round, which becomes the
computational bottleneck when the domain is complicated. In this paper, we
present efficient methods for optimizing dynamic regret and adaptive regret,
which reduce the number of projections per round from $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ to
$1$. Moreover, our obtained algorithms require only one gradient query and one
function evaluation at each round. Our technique hinges on the reduction
mechanism developed in parameter-free online learning and requires non-trivial
twists on non-stationary online methods. Empirical studies verify our
theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves categorizing fine
subdivisions within a broader category, which poses challenges due to subtle
inter-class discrepancies and large intra-class variations. However, prevailing
approaches primarily focus on uni-modal visual concepts. Recent advancements in
pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in
various high-level vision tasks, yet the applicability of such models to FGVC
tasks remains uncertain. In this paper, we aim to fully exploit the
capabilities of cross-modal description to tackle FGVC tasks and propose a
novel multimodal prompting solution, denoted as MP-FGVC, based on the
contrastive language-image pertaining (CLIP) model. Our MP-FGVC comprises a
multimodal prompts scheme and a multimodal adaptation scheme. The former
includes Subcategory-specific Vision Prompt (SsVP) and Discrepancy-aware Text
Prompt (DaTP), which explicitly highlights the subcategory-specific
discrepancies from the perspectives of both vision and language. The latter
aligns the vision and text prompting elements in a common semantic space,
facilitating cross-modal collaborative reasoning through a Vision-Language
Fusion Module (VLFM) for further improvement on FGVC. Moreover, we tailor a
two-stage optimization strategy for MP-FGVC to fully leverage the pre-trained
CLIP model and expedite efficient adaptation for FGVC. Extensive experiments
conducted on four FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MP-FGVC.

<p class="mathjax">One-shot LiDAR localization refers to the ability to estimate the robot pose
from one single point cloud, which yields significant advantages in
initialization and relocalization processes. In the point cloud domain, the
topic has been extensively studied as a global descriptor retrieval (i.e., loop
closure detection) and pose refinement (i.e., point cloud registration) problem
both in isolation or combined. However, few have explicitly considered the
relationship between candidate retrieval and correspondence generation in pose
estimation, leaving them brittle to substructure ambiguities. To this end, we
propose a hierarchical one-shot localization algorithm called Outram that
leverages substructures of 3D scene graphs for locally consistent
correspondence searching and global substructure-wise outlier pruning. Such a
hierarchical process couples the feature retrieval and the correspondence

<p class="mathjax">A cross-bifix-free code of length $n$ over $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is defined as a
non-empty subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ satisfying that the prefix set of each
codeword is disjoint from the suffix set of every codeword. Cross-bifix-free
codes have found important applications in digital communication systems. One
of the main research problems on cross-bifix-free codes is to construct
cross-bifix-free codes as large as possible in size. Recently, Wang and Wang
introduced a family of cross-bifix-free codes $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$, which is a
generalization of the classical cross-bifix-free codes studied early by
Lvenshtein, Gilbert and Chee {\it et al.}. It is known that $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$
is nearly optimal in size and $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$ is non-expandable if $k=n-1$
or $1\leq k&lt;n/2$. In this paper, we first show that $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$ is
non-expandable if and only if $k=n-1$ or $1\leq k&lt;n/2$, thereby improving the
results in [Chee {\it et al.}, IEEE-TIT, 2013] and [Wang and Wang, IEEE-TIT,
2022]. We then construct a new family of cross-bifix-free codes
$U^{(t)}_{I,J}(n)$ to expand $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$ such that the resulting larger
code $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)\bigcup U^{(t)}_{I,J}(n)$ is a non-expandable
cross-bifix-free code whenever $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)$ is expandable. Finally, we
present an explicit formula for the size of $S_{I,J}^{(k)}(n)\bigcup
U^{(t)}_{I,J}(n)$.

<p class="mathjax">The relationship between brain structure and function is critical for
revealing the pathogenesis of brain disease, including Alzheimer's disease
(AD). However, it is a great challenge to map brain structure-function
connections due to various reasons. In this work, a bidirectional graph
generative adversarial networks (BGGAN) is proposed to represent brain
structure-function connections. Specifically, by designing a module
incorporating inner graph convolution network (InnerGCN), the generators of
BGGAN can employ features of direct and indirect brain regions to learn the
mapping function between structural domain and functional domain. Besides, a
new module named Balancer is designed to counterpoise the optimization between
generators and discriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BGGAN, both the
structural generator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue
of mode collapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional
features. Experimental results using ADNI datasets show that the both the
generated structure connections and generated function connections can improve
the identification accuracy of AD. More importantly, based the proposed model,
it is found that the relationship between brain structure and function is not a
complete one-to-one correspondence. Brain structure is the basis of brain
function. The strong structural connections are almost accompanied by strong
functional connections.

focus on AI and its implementation in edge computing. It first provides an
overview of TPUs, specifically their design in relation to neural networks,

Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of Cloud and Edge TPU
performance against other counterpart chip architectures. It is then discussed
how TPUs can be used to speed up AI workloads. The results show that TPUs can

<p class="mathjax">Current Scene text image super-resolution approaches primarily focus on
extracting robust features, acquiring text information, and complex training
strategies to generate super-resolution images. However, the upsampling module,
which is crucial in the process of converting low-resolution images to
high-resolution ones, has received little attention in existing works. To
address this issue, we propose the Pixel Adapter Module (PAM) based on graph
attention to address pixel distortion caused by upsampling. The PAM effectively
captures local structural information by allowing each pixel to interact with
its neighbors and update features. Unlike previous graph attention mechanisms,
our approach achieves 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency and
memory utilization by eliminating the dependency on sparse adjacency matrices
and introducing a sliding window approach for efficient parallel computation.
Additionally, we introduce the MLP-based Sequential Residual Block (MSRB) for
robust feature extraction from text images, and a Local Contour Awareness loss
($\mathcal{L}_{lca}$) to enhance the model's perception of details.
Comprehensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate that our proposed method
generates high-quality super-resolution images, surpassing existing methods in
recognition accuracy. For single-stage and multi-stage strategies, we achieved
improvements of 0.7\% and 2.6\%, respectively, increasing the performance from
52.6\% and 53.7\% to 53.3\% and 56.3\%. The code is available at
https://github.com/wenyu1009/RTSRN.

<p class="mathjax">Matrix product codes are generalizations of some well-known constructions of
codes, such as Reed-Muller codes, $[u+v,u-v]$-construction, etc. Recently, a
bound for the symbol-pair distance of a matrix product code was given in
\cite{LEL}, and new families of MDS symbol-pair codes were constructed by using
this bound. In this paper, we generalize this bound to the $b$-symbol distance
of a matrix product code and determine all minimum $b$-symbol distances of
Reed-Muller codes. We also give a bound for the minimum $b$-symbol distance of
codes obtained from the $[u+v,u-v]$-construction, and use this bound to
construct some $[2n,2n-2]_q$-linear $b$-symbol almost MDS codes with arbitrary
length. All the minimum $b$-symbol distances of $[n,n-1]_q$-linear codes and
$[n,n-2]_q$-linear codes for $1\leq b\leq n$ are determined. Some examples are

<p class="mathjax">We employ a tool-interacting divide-and-conquer strategy enabling large
language models (LLMs) to answer complex multimodal multi-hop questions. In
particular, we harness the power of large language models to divide a given
multimodal multi-hop question into unimodal single-hop sub-questions to be
answered by the appropriate tool from a predefined set of tools. After all
corresponding tools provide the LLM with their answers, the LLM generates the
next relevant unimodal single-hop question. To increase the reasoning ability
of LLMs, we prompt chatGPT to generate a tool-interacting divide-and-conquer
dataset. This dataset is then used to efficiently finetune the corresponding
LLM. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct an evaluation on
two recently introduced complex question-answering datasets. The experimental
analysis demonstrate substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art
solutions, indicating the efficacy and generality of our strategy

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an efficient archival framework for exploring and
tracking cyberspace large-scale data called Tempo-Spatial Content Delivery
Network (TS-CDN). Social media data streams are renewing in time and spatial
dimensions. Various types of websites and social networks (i.e., channels,
groups, pages, etc.) are considered spatial in cyberspace. Accurate analysis
entails encompassing the bulk of data. In TS-CDN by applying the hash function
on big data an efficient content delivery network is created. Using hash
function rebuffs data redundancy and leads to conclude unique data archive in
large-scale. This framework based on entered query allows for apparent
monitoring and exploring data in tempo-spatial dimension based on TF-IDF score.
Also by conformance from i18n standard, the Unicode problem has been dissolved.
For evaluation of TS-CDN framework, a dataset from Telegram news channels from
March 23, 2020 (1399-01-01), to September 21, 2020 (1399-06-31) on topics
including Coronavirus (COVID-19), vaccine, school reopening, flood, earthquake,
justice shares, petroleum, and quarantine exploited. By applying hash on
Telegram dataset in the mentioned time interval, a significant reduction in
media files such as 39.8% for videos (from 79.5 GB to 47.8 GB), and 10% for
images (from 4 GB to 3.6 GB) occurred. TS-CDN infrastructure in a web-based
approach has been presented as a service-oriented system. Experiments conducted
on enormous time series data, including different spatial dimensions (i.e.,
Khabare Fouri, Khabarhaye Fouri, Akhbare Rouze Iran, and Akhbare Rasmi Telegram
news channels), demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the implemented
TS-CDN framework.

<p class="mathjax">Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns environment model from
offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become
an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due
to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be
incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise
model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model
uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads
to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore
differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. Therefore,
this paper proposes a milDly cOnservative Model-bAsed offlINe RL algorithm
(DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty to address the above issues.
DOMAIN introduces adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can
adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this paper, we theoretically
demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a
lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous
model-based offline RL algorithms and has the guarantee of security policy
improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms
prior RL algorithms on the D4RL dataset benchmark, and achieves better
performance than other RL algorithms on tasks that require generalization.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic reconstruction with neural radiance fields (NeRF) requires accurate
camera poses. These are often hard to retrieve with existing
structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines as both camera and scene content can
change. We propose DynaMoN that leverages simultaneous localization and mapping

SLAM-based tracking module significantly accelerates the training process of
the dynamic NeRF while improving the quality of synthesized views at the same

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale noisy web image-text datasets have been proven to be efficient
for learning robust vision-language models. However, when transferring them to
the task of video retrieval, models still need to be fine-tuned on hand-curated
paired text-video data to adapt to the diverse styles of video descriptions. To
address this problem without the need for hand-annotated pairs, we propose a
new setting, text-video retrieval with uncurated &amp; unpaired data, that during
training utilizes only text queries together with uncurated web videos without
any paired text-video data. To this end, we propose an approach, In-Style, that
learns the style of the text queries and transfers it to uncurated web videos.
Moreover, to improve generalization, we show that one model can be trained with
multiple text styles. To this end, we introduce a multi-style contrastive
training procedure that improves the generalizability over several datasets
simultaneously. We evaluate our model on retrieval performance over multiple
datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our style transfer framework on the
new task of uncurated &amp; unpaired text-video retrieval and improve
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot text-video retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">Learning multi-lingual sentence embeddings is a fundamental and significant
task in natural language processing. Recent trends of learning both
mono-lingual and multi-lingual sentence embeddings are mainly based on
contrastive learning (CL) with an anchor, one positive, and multiple negative
instances. In this work, we argue that leveraging multiple positives should be
considered for multi-lingual sentence embeddings because (1) positives in a
diverse set of languages can benefit cross-lingual learning, and (2) transitive
similarity across multiple positives can provide reliable structural
information to learn. In order to investigate the impact of CL with multiple
positives, we propose a novel approach MPCL to effectively utilize multiple
positive instances to improve learning multi-lingual sentence embeddings. Our
experimental results on various backbone models and downstream tasks support
that compared with conventional CL, MPCL leads to better retrieval, semantic
similarity, and classification performances. We also observe that on unseen
languages, sentence embedding models trained on multiple positives have better
cross-lingual transferring performance than models trained on a single positive
instance.

<p class="mathjax">A key objective in field of artificial intelligence is to develop cognitive
models that can exhibit human-like intellectual capabilities. One promising
approach to achieving this is through neural-symbolic systems, which combine
the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. However, current
approaches in this area have been limited in their combining way,
generalization and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
general bi-level probabilistic graphical reasoning framework called GBPGR. This
framework leverages statistical relational learning to effectively integrate
deep learning models and symbolic reasoning in a mutually beneficial manner. In
GBPGR, the results of symbolic reasoning are utilized to refine and correct the
predictions made by the deep learning models. At the same time, the deep
learning models assist in enhancing the efficiency of the symbolic reasoning
process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach
achieves high performance and exhibits effective generalization in both
transductive and inductive tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Although LiDAR sensors are crucial for autonomous systems due to providing
precise depth information, they struggle with capturing fine object details,
especially at a distance, due to sparse and non-uniform data. Recent advances
introduced pseudo-LiDAR, i.e., synthetic dense point clouds, using additional
modalities such as cameras to enhance 3D object detection. We present a novel
LiDAR-only framework that augments raw scans with denser pseudo point clouds by
solely relying on LiDAR sensors and scene semantics, omitting the need for
cameras. Our framework first utilizes a segmentation model to extract scene
semantics from raw point clouds, and then employs a multi-modal domain
translator to generate synthetic image segments and depth cues without real
cameras. This yields a dense pseudo point cloud enriched with semantic
information. We also introduce a new semantically guided projection method,
which enhances detection performance by retaining only relevant pseudo points.
We applied our framework to different advanced 3D object detection methods and
reported up to 2.9% performance upgrade. We also obtained comparable results on
the KITTI 3D object detection dataset, in contrast to other state-of-the-art
LiDAR-only detectors.

<p class="mathjax">In modern commercial search engines and recommendation systems, data from
multiple domains is available to jointly train the multi-domain model.
Traditional methods train multi-domain models in the multi-task setting, with
shared parameters to learn the similarity of multiple tasks, and task-specific
parameters to learn the divergence of features, labels, and sample
distributions of individual tasks. With the development of large language
models, LLM can extract global domain-invariant text features that serve both
search and recommendation tasks. We propose a novel framework called S\&amp;R
Multi-Domain Foundation, which uses LLM to extract domain invariant features,
and Aspect Gating Fusion to merge the ID feature, domain invariant text
features and task-specific heterogeneous sparse features to obtain the
representations of query and item. Additionally, samples from multiple search
and recommendation scenarios are trained jointly with Domain Adaptive
Multi-Task module to obtain the multi-domain foundation model. We apply the
S\&amp;R Multi-Domain foundation model to cold start scenarios in the
pretrain-finetune manner, which achieves better performance than other SOTA
transfer learning methods. The S\&amp;R Multi-Domain Foundation model has been
successfully deployed in Alipay Mobile Application's online services, such as

<p class="mathjax">How human interact with objects depends on the functional roles of the target
objects, which introduces the problem of affordance-aware hand-object
interaction. It requires a large number of human demonstrations for the
learning and understanding of plausible and appropriate hand-object
interactions. In this work, we present AffordPose, a large-scale dataset of
hand-object interactions with affordance-driven hand pose. We first annotate
the specific part-level affordance labels for each object, e.g. twist, pull,
handle-grasp, etc, instead of the general intents such as use or handover, to
indicate the purpose and guide the localization of the hand-object
interactions. The fine-grained hand-object interactions reveal the influence of
hand-centered affordances on the detailed arrangement of the hand poses, yet
also exhibit a certain degree of diversity. We collect a total of 26.7K
hand-object interactions, each including the 3D object shape, the part-level
affordance label, and the manually adjusted hand poses. The comprehensive data
analysis shows the common characteristics and diversity of hand-object
interactions per affordance via the parameter statistics and contacting
computation. We also conduct experiments on the tasks of hand-object affordance
understanding and affordance-oriented hand-object interaction generation, to
validate the effectiveness of our dataset in learning the fine-grained
hand-object interactions. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">Translating training data into target languages has proven beneficial for
cross-lingual transfer. However, for structure extraction tasks, translating
data requires a label projection step, which translates input text and obtains
translated labels in the translated text jointly. Previous research in label
projection mostly compromises translation quality by either facilitating easy
identification of translated labels from translated text or using word-level
alignment between translation pairs to assemble translated phrase-level labels
from the aligned words. In this paper, we introduce CLAP, which first
translates text to the target language and performs contextual translation on
the labels using the translated text as the context, ensuring better accuracy
for the translated labels. We leverage instruction-tuned language models with
multilingual capabilities as our contextual translator, imposing the constraint
of the presence of translated labels in the translated text via instructions.
We compare CLAP with other label projection techniques for creating
pseudo-training data in target languages on event argument extraction, a
representative structure extraction task. Results show that CLAP improves by
2-2.5 F1-score over other methods on the Chinese and Arabic ACE05 datasets.

<p class="mathjax">A common practice in metric learning is to train and test an embedding model
for each dataset. This dataset-specific approach fails to simulate real-world
scenarios that involve multiple heterogeneous distributions of data. In this
regard, we introduce a novel metric learning paradigm, called Universal Metric
Learning (UML), which learns a unified distance metric capable of capturing
relations across multiple data distributions. UML presents new challenges, such
as imbalanced data distribution and bias towards dominant distributions. To
address these challenges, we propose Parameter-efficient Universal Metric
leArning (PUMA), which consists of a pre-trained frozen model and two
additional modules, stochastic adapter and prompt pool. These modules enable to
capture dataset-specific knowledge while avoiding bias towards dominant
distributions. Additionally, we compile a new universal metric learning
benchmark with a total of 8 different datasets. PUMA outperformed the
state-of-the-art dataset-specific models while using about 69 times fewer
trainable parameters.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, a certain type of problems have become of interest where one
wants to query a trained classifier. Specifically, one wants to find the
closest instance to a given input instance such that the classifier's predicted
label is changed in a desired way. Examples of these ``inverse classification''
problems are counterfactual explanations, adversarial examples and model
inversion. All of them are fundamentally optimization problems over the input
instance vector involving a fixed classifier, and it is of interest to achieve
a fast solution for interactive or real-time applications. We focus on solving
this problem efficiently for two of the most widely used classifiers: logistic
regression and softmax classifiers. Owing to special properties of these
models, we show that the optimization can be solved in closed form for logistic
regression, and iteratively but extremely fast for the softmax classifier. This
allows us to solve either case exactly (to nearly machine precision) in a
runtime of milliseconds to around a second even for very high-dimensional
instances and many classes.

<p class="mathjax">High Performance Computing (HPC) benefits from different improvements during
last decades, specially in terms of hardware platforms to provide more
processing power while maintaining the power consumption at a reasonable level.
The Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) is a new type of massively parallel
processor, designed to speedup parallel computations with huge number of
processing cores and on-chip memory components connected with high-speed
fabrics. IPUs mainly target machine learning applications, however, due to the
architectural differences between GPUs and IPUs, especially significantly less
memory capacity on an IPU, methods for reducing model size by sparsification
have to be considered. Butterfly factorizations are well-known replacements for
fully-connected and convolutional layers. In this paper, we examine how
butterfly structures can be implemented on an IPU and study their behavior and
performance compared to a GPU. Experimental results indicate that these methods
can provide 98.5% compression ratio to decrease the immense need for memory,
the IPU implementation can benefit from 1.3x and 1.6x performance improvement
for butterfly and pixelated butterfly, respectively. We also reach to 1.62x
training time speedup on a real-word dataset such as CIFAR10.

<p class="mathjax">Scene-aware global human motion forecasting is critical for manifold
applications, including virtual reality, robotics, and sports. The task
combines human trajectory and pose forecasting within the provided scene
context, which represents a significant challenge.
<br />So far, only Mao et al. NeurIPS'22 have addressed scene-aware global motion,
cascading the prediction of future scene contact points and the global motion
estimation. They perform the latter as the end-to-end forecasting of future
trajectories and poses. However, end-to-end contrasts with the coarse-to-fine
nature of the task and it results in lower performance, as we demonstrate here
empirically.
<br />We propose a STAGed contact-aware global human motion forecasting STAG, a
novel three-stage pipeline for predicting global human motion in a 3D
environment. We first consider the scene and the respective human interaction
as contact points. Secondly, we model the human trajectory forecasting within
the scene, predicting the coarse motion of the human body as a whole. The third
and last stage matches a plausible fine human joint motion to complement the
trajectory considering the estimated contacts.
<br />Compared to the state-of-the-art (SoA), STAG achieves a 1.8% and 16.2%
overall improvement in pose and trajectory prediction, respectively, on the
scene-aware GTA-IM dataset. A comprehensive ablation study confirms the
advantages of staged modeling over end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, we
establish the significance of a newly proposed temporal counter called the
"time-to-go", which tells how long it is before reaching scene contact and
endpoints. Notably, STAG showcases its ability to generalize to datasets
lacking a scene and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CMU-Mocap,
without leveraging any social cues. Our code is released at:

<p class="mathjax">This study investigates the outage performance of an under-laying
wireless-powered secondary system that reuses the primary users (PU) spectrum
in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) network. Each
secondary user (SU) harvests energy and receives information simultaneously by
applying power splitting (PS) protocol. The communication between SUs is aided
by a two-way (TW) decode and forward (DF) relay. We formulate a problem to
design the PS ratios at SUs, the power control factor at the secondary relay,
and beamforming matrices at all nodes to minimize the secondary network's
outage probability. To address this problem, we propose a two-step solution.
The first step establishes closedform expressions for the PS ratios at each SU
and secondary relay's power control factor. Furthermore, in the second step,
interference alignment (IA) is used to design proper precoding and decoding
matrices for managing the interference between secondary and primary networks.
We choose IA matrices based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) iterative
algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate a significant decrease in the
outage probability for the proposed scheme compared to the benchmark schemes,
with an average reduction of more than two orders of magnitude achieved.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been
significantly enhanced the question answering and dialogue generation, and
makes them become increasingly popular in current practical scenarios. While
unlike the general dialogue system which emphasizes the semantic performance,
the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems aim to achieve the dialogue goal
efficiently and successfully in multiple turns. Unfortunately, existing
LLM-induced ToD systems lack the direct reward toward the final goal and do not
take account of the dialogue proactivity that can strengthen the dialogue
efficiency. To fill these gaps, we introduce the ProToD (Proactively
Goal-Driven LLM-Induced ToD) approach, which anticipates the future dialogue
actions and incorporates the goal-oriented reward signal to enhance ToD
systems. Additionally, we present a novel evaluation method that assesses ToD
systems based on goal-driven dialogue simulations. This method allows us to
gauge user satisfaction, system efficiency and successful rate while overcoming
the limitations of current Information and Success metrics. Empirical
experiments conducted on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate that our model
can achieve superior performance using only 10% of the data compared to
previous end-to-end fully supervised models. This improvement is accompanied by
enhanced user satisfaction and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge editing aims to change language models' performance on several
special cases (i.e., editing scope) by infusing the corresponding expected
knowledge into them. With the recent advancements in large language models
(LLMs), knowledge editing has been shown as a promising technique to adapt LLMs
to new knowledge without retraining from scratch. However, most of the previous
studies neglect the multi-lingual nature of some main-stream LLMs (e.g., LLaMA,
ChatGPT and GPT-4), and typically focus on monolingual scenarios, where LLMs
are edited and evaluated in the same language. As a result, it is still unknown
the effect of source language editing on a different target language. In this
paper, we aim to figure out this cross-lingual effect in knowledge editing.
Specifically, we first collect a large-scale cross-lingual synthetic dataset by
translating ZsRE from English to Chinese. Then, we conduct English editing on
various knowledge editing methods covering different paradigms, and evaluate
their performance in Chinese, and vice versa. To give deeper analyses of the
cross-lingual effect, the evaluation includes four aspects, i.e., reliability,
generality, locality and portability. Furthermore, we analyze the inconsistent
behaviors of the edited models and discuss their specific challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models are widely deployed in many applications, such as object
detection in various security fields. However, these models are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Most backdoor attacks were intensively studied on classified
models, but little on object detection. Previous works mainly focused on the
backdoor attack in the digital world, but neglect the real world. Especially,
the backdoor attack's effect in the real world will be easily influenced by
physical factors like distance and illumination. In this paper, we proposed a
variable-size backdoor trigger to adapt to the different sizes of attacked
objects, overcoming the disturbance caused by the distance between the viewing
point and attacked object. In addition, we proposed a backdoor training named
malicious adversarial training, enabling the backdoor object detector to learn
the feature of the trigger with physical noise. The experiment results show
this robust backdoor attack (RBA) could enhance the attack success rate in the
real world.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing computer vision and the latest technological advancements, in this
study, we developed a honey bee monitoring system that aims to enhance our
understanding of Colony Collapse Disorder, honey bee behavior, population
decline, and overall hive health. The system is positioned at the hive entrance
providing real-time data, enabling beekeepers to closely monitor the hive's
activity and health through an account-based website. Using machine learning,
our monitoring system can accurately track honey bees, monitor pollen-gathering
activity, and detect Varroa mites, all without causing any disruption to the
honey bees. Moreover, we have ensured that the development of this monitoring
system utilizes cost-effective technology, making it accessible to apiaries of
various scales, including hobbyists, commercial beekeeping businesses, and
researchers. The inference models used to detect honey bees, pollen, and mites
are based on the YOLOv7-tiny architecture trained with our own data. The
F1-score for honey bee model recognition is 0.95 and the precision and recall
value is 0.981. For our pollen and mite object detection model F1-score is 0.95
and the precision and recall value is 0.821 for pollen and 0.996 for "mite".
The overall performance of our IntelliBeeHive system demonstrates its
effectiveness in monitoring the honey bee's activity, achieving an accuracy of
96.28 % in tracking and our pollen model achieved a F1-score of 0.831.

<p class="mathjax">We present ExBluRF, a novel view synthesis method for extreme motion blurred
images based on efficient radiance fields optimization. Our approach consists
of two main components: 6-DOF camera trajectory-based motion blur formulation
and voxel-based radiance fields. From extremely blurred images, we optimize the
sharp radiance fields by jointly estimating the camera trajectories that
generate the blurry images. In training, multiple rays along the camera
trajectory are accumulated to reconstruct single blurry color, which is
equivalent to the physical motion blur operation. We minimize the
photo-consistency loss on blurred image space and obtain the sharp radiance
fields with camera trajectories that explain the blur of all images. The joint
optimization on the blurred image space demands painfully increasing
computation and resources proportional to the blur size. Our method solves this
problem by replacing the MLP-based framework to low-dimensional 6-DOF camera
poses and voxel-based radiance fields. Compared with the existing works, our
approach restores much sharper 3D scenes from challenging motion blurred views
with the order of 10 times less training time and GPU memory consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Foundational large language models (LLMs) can be instruction-tuned to develop
open-ended question-answering capability, facilitating applications such as the
creation of AI assistants. While such efforts are often carried out in a single
language, building on prior research, we empirically analyze cost-efficient
approaches of monolingual and multilingual tuning, shedding light on the
efficacy of LLMs in responding to queries across monolingual and multilingual
contexts. Our study employs the Alpaca dataset and machine translations of it
to form multilingual training data, which is then used to tune LLMs through
low-rank adaptation and full-parameter training. Comparisons reveal that
multilingual tuning is not crucial for an LLM's English performance, but is key
to its robustness in a multilingual environment. With a fixed budget, a
multilingual instruction-tuned model, merely trained on downsampled data, can
be as powerful as training monolingual models for each language. Our findings
serve as a guide for expanding language support through instruction tuning with
constrained computational resources.

<p class="mathjax">Open-domain Multi-Document Summarization (ODMDS) is a critical tool for
condensing vast arrays of documents into coherent, concise summaries. With a
more inter-related document set, there does not necessarily exist a correct
answer for the retrieval, making it hard to measure the retrieving performance.
We propose a rule-based method to process query-based document summarization
datasets into ODMDS datasets. Based on this method, we introduce a novel
dataset, ODSum, a sophisticated case with its document index interdependent and
often interrelated. We tackle ODMDS with the \textit{retrieve-then-summarize}
method, and the performance of a list of retrievers and summarizers is
investigated. Through extensive experiments, we identify variances in
evaluation metrics and provide insights into their reliability. We also found
that LLMs suffer great performance loss from retrieving errors. We further
experimented methods to improve the performance as well as investigate their
robustness against imperfect retrieval. We will release our data and code at
https://github.com/yale-nlp/ODSum.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to enable
collaborative learning among multiple clients while preserving data privacy.
However, cross-domain FL tasks, where clients possess data from different
domains or distributions, remain a challenging problem due to the inherent
heterogeneity. In this paper, we present UNIDEAL, a novel FL algorithm
specifically designed to tackle the challenges of cross-domain scenarios and
heterogeneous model architectures. The proposed method introduces Adjustable
Teacher-Student Mutual Evaluation Curriculum Learning, which significantly
enhances the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in FL settings. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, comparing UNIDEAL with
state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that UNIDEAL achieves
superior performance in terms of both model accuracy and communication
efficiency. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis of the algorithm,
showing a convergence rate of O(1/T) under non-convex conditions.

assertion language of separation logic is extended with modalities for the five
types of the basic instructions of separation logic: simple assignment,
look-up, mutation, allocation, and de-allocation. The main novelty of the
resulting dynamic logic is that it allows to combine different approaches to
resolving these modalities. One such approach is based on the standard weakest

this paper provides a novel alternative formalization in the proposed dynamic
logic extension of separation logic. The soundness and completeness of this

<p class="mathjax">Despite the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, they still
struggle with tasks that require generating complex, structured outputs. In
this study, we assess the capability of Current LLMs in generating complex
structured data and propose a structure-aware fine-tuning approach as a
solution to improve this ability. To perform a comprehensive evaluation, we
propose Struc-Bench, include five representative LLMs (i.e., GPT-NeoX 20B,
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna) and evaluate them on our carefully constructed
datasets spanning raw text, HTML, and LaTeX tables. Based on our analysis of
current model performance, we identify specific common formatting errors and
areas of potential improvement. To address complex formatting requirements, we
utilize FormatCoT (Chain-of-Thought) to generate format instructions from
target outputs. Our experiments show that our structure-aware fine-tuning
method, when applied to LLaMA-7B, significantly improves adherence to natural
language constraints, outperforming other evaluated LLMs. Based on these
results, we present an ability map of model capabilities from six dimensions
(i.e., coverage, formatting, reasoning, comprehension, pragmatics, and
hallucination). This map highlights the weaknesses of LLMs in handling complex
structured outputs and suggests promising directions for future work. Our code
and models can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/Struc-Bench.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have brought revolutionary advances to
many research areas due to their capacity of learning from raw data. However,
when those methods are applied to non-controllable environments, many different
factors can degrade the model's expected performance, such as unlabeled
datasets with different levels of domain shift and category shift.
Particularly, when both issues occur at the same time, we tackle this
challenging setup as Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) problem. In general,
existing OSDA approaches focus their efforts only on aligning known classes or,
if they already extract possible negative instances, use them as a new category
learned with supervision during the course of training. We propose a novel way
to improve OSDA approaches by extracting a high-confidence set of unknown
instances and using it as a hard constraint to tighten the classification
boundaries of OSDA methods. Especially, we adopt a new loss constraint
evaluated in three different means, (1) directly with the pristine negative
instances; (2) with randomly transformed negatives using data augmentation
techniques; and (3) with synthetically generated negatives containing
adversarial features. We assessed all approaches in an extensive set of
experiments based on OVANet, where we could observe consistent improvements for
two public benchmarks, the Office-31 and Office-Home datasets, yielding
absolute gains of up to 1.3% for both Accuracy and H-Score on Office-31 and
5.8% for Accuracy and 4.7% for H-Score on Office-Home.

<p class="mathjax">Long Range (LoRa) wireless technology, characterized by low power consumption
and a long communication range, is regarded as one of the enabling technologies
for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, as the network scale
increases, the energy efficiency (EE) of LoRa networks decreases sharply due to
severe packet collisions. To address this issue, it is essential to
appropriately assign transmission parameters such as the spreading factor and
transmission power for each end device (ED). However, due to the sporadic
traffic and low duty cycle of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE
performance under different parameter settings is time-consuming. Therefore, we
first formulate an analytical model to calculate the system EE. On this basis,
we propose a transmission parameter allocation algorithm based on multiagent
reinforcement learning (MALoRa) with the aim of maximizing the system EE of
LoRa networks. Notably, MALoRa employs an attention mechanism to guide each ED
to better learn how much ''attention'' should be given to the parameter
assignments for relevant EDs when seeking to improve the system EE. Simulation
results demonstrate that MALoRa significantly improves the system EE compared
with baseline algorithms with an acceptable degradation in packet delivery rate
(PDR).

<p class="mathjax">Cross-modality point cloud registration is confronted with significant
challenges due to inherent differences in modalities between different sensors.
We propose a cross-modality point cloud registration framework FF-LOGO: a
cross-modality point cloud registration method with feature filtering and
local-global optimization. The cross-modality feature correlation filtering
module extracts geometric transformation-invariant features from cross-modality
point clouds and achieves point selection by feature matching. We also
introduce a cross-modality optimization process, including a local adaptive key
region aggregation module and a global modality consistency fusion optimization
module. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage optimization
significantly improves the registration accuracy of the feature association and
selection module. Our method achieves a substantial increase in recall rate
compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on the 3DCSR dataset,
improving from 40.59% to 75.74%. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/wangmohan17/FFLOGO.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation systems are widely used in web services, such as social
networks and e-commerce platforms, to serve personalized content to the users
and, thus, enhance their experience. While personalization assists users in
navigating through the available options, there have been growing concerns
regarding its repercussions on the users and their opinions. Examples of
negative impacts include the emergence of filter bubbles and the amplification
of users' confirmation bias, which can cause opinion polarization and
radicalization. In this paper, we study the impact of recommendation systems on
users, both from a microscopic (i.e., at the level of individual users) and a
macroscopic (i.e., at the level of a homogenous population) perspective.
Specifically, we build on recent work on the interactions between opinion
dynamics and recommendation systems to propose a model for this closed loop,
which we then study both analytically and numerically. Among others, our
analysis reveals that shifts in the opinions of individual users do not always
align with shifts in the opinion distribution of the population. In particular,
even in settings where the opinion distribution appears unaltered (e.g.,
measured via surveys across the population), the opinion of individual users
might be significantly distorted by the recommendation system.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP). While these models excel at understanding
and generating human-like text, their widespread deployment can be
prohibitively expensive. SortedNet is a recent training technique for enabling
dynamic inference for deep neural networks. It leverages network modularity to
create sub-models with varying computational loads, sorting them based on
computation/accuracy characteristics in a nested manner. We extend SortedNet to
generative NLP tasks, making large language models dynamic without any
pretraining and by only replacing standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with
Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) at the same costs. Our approach boosts model
efficiency, eliminating the need for multiple models for various scenarios
during inference. We show that using this approach, we are able to unlock the
potential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target
output. Our sub-models remain integral components of the original model,
minimizing storage requirements and transition costs between different
computational/latency budgets. By applying this approach on LLaMa 2 13B for
tuning on the Stanford Alpaca dataset and comparing it to normal tuning and
early exit via PandaLM benchmark, we show that Sorted Fine-Tuning can deliver
models twice as fast as the original model while maintaining or exceeding
performance.

models (LLMs). We first evaluate the accuracy of clinical/biomedical STS and
NLI over five datasets, and then we assess LLM predictive confidence and their
capability of capturing collective human opinions. We find that LLMs may be
able to provide personalised descriptions for a specific topic, or to generate
semantically similar content in different tones, but that this is hard for
current LLMs to make personalised judgements or decisions. We further find that
zero-shot ChatGPT achieves competitive accuracy over clinical and biomedical
STS/NLI, constraining to the fine-tuned BERT-base. However, there is a large
variation in sampling, ensembled results perform the best.

<p class="mathjax">Bioacoustic sound event detection allows for better understanding of animal
behavior and for better monitoring biodiversity using audio. Deep learning
systems can help achieve this goal, however it is difficult to acquire
sufficient annotated data to train these systems from scratch. To address this
limitation, the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events
(DCASE) community has recasted the problem within the framework of few-shot
learning and organize an annual challenge for learning to detect animal sounds
from only five annotated examples. In this work, we regularize supervised
contrastive pre-training to learn features that can transfer well on new target
tasks with animal sounds unseen during training, achieving a high F-score of
61.52%(0.48) when no feature adaptation is applied, and an F-score of
68.19%(0.75) when we further adapt the learned features for each new target
task. This work aims to lower the entry bar to few-shot bioacoustic sound event
detection by proposing a simple and yet effective framework for this task, by
also providing open-source code.

<p class="mathjax">An important mathematical tool in the analysis of dynamical systems is the
approximation of the reach set, i.e., the set of states reachable after a given
time from a given initial state. This set is difficult to compute for complex
systems even if the system dynamics are known and given by a system of ordinary
differential equations with known coefficients. In practice, parameters are
often unknown and mathematical models difficult to obtain. Data-based
approaches are promised to avoid these difficulties by estimating the reach set
based on a sample of states. If a model is available, this training set can be
obtained through numerical simulation. In the absence of a model, real-life
observations can be used instead. A recently proposed approach for data-based
reach set approximation uses Christoffel functions to approximate the reach
set. Under certain assumptions, the approximation is guaranteed to converge to
the true solution. In this paper, we improve upon these results by notably
improving the sample efficiency and relaxing some of the assumptions by
exploiting statistical guarantees from conformal prediction with training and
calibration sets. In addition, we exploit an incremental way to compute the
Christoffel function to avoid the calibration set while maintaining the
statistical convergence guarantees. Furthermore, our approach is robust to
outliers in the training and calibration set.

<p class="mathjax">Web applications are increasingly becoming the primary platform for AI
service delivery, making in-browser deep learning (DL) inference more
prominent. However, current in-browser inference systems fail to effectively
utilize advanced web programming techniques and customize kernels for various
client devices, leading to suboptimal performance.
<br />To address the issues, this paper presents the first in-browser inference
system, nn-JIT.web, which enables just-in-time (JIT) auto-generation of
optimized kernels for both CPUs and GPUs during inference. The system achieves
this by using two novel web programming techniques that can significantly
reduce kernel generation time, compared to other tensor compilers such as TVM,
while maintaining or even improving performance. The first technique,
Tensor-Web Compiling Co-Design, lowers compiling costs by unifying tensor and
web compiling and eliminating redundant and ineffective compiling passes. The
second technique, Web-Specific Lite Kernel Optimization Space Design, reduces
kernel tuning costs by focusing on web programming requirements and efficient
hardware resource utilization, limiting the optimization space to only dozens.
<br />nn-JIT.web is evaluated for modern transformer models on a range of client
devices, including the mainstream CPUs and GPUs from ARM, Intel, AMD and
Nvidia. Results show that nn-JIT.web can achieve up to 8.2x faster within 30
seconds compared to the baselines across various models.

<p class="mathjax">One key feature of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G is
to support short packet transmission (SPT). However, the pilot overhead in SPT
for channel estimation is relatively high, especially in high Doppler
environments. In this paper, we advocate the adoption of differential
modulation to support ultra-low latency services, which can ease the channel
estimation burden and reduce the power and bandwidth overhead incurred in
traditional coherent modulation schemes. Specifically, we consider a
multi-connectivity (MC) scheme employing differential modulation to enable
URLLC services. The popular selection combining and maximal ratio combining
schemes are respectively applied to explore the diversity gain in the MC
scheme. A first-order autoregressive model is further utilized to characterize
the time-varying nature of the channel. Theoretically, the maximum achievable
rate and minimum achievable block error rate under ergodic fading channels with
PSK inputs and perfect CSI are first derived by using the non-asymptotic
information-theoretic bounds. The performance of SPT with differential
modulation and MC schemes is then analysed by characterizing the effect of
differential modulation and time-varying channels as a reduction in the
effective SNR. Simulation results show that differential modulation does offer
a significant advantage over the pilot-assisted coherent scheme for SPT,
especially in high Doppler environments.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring wellbeing and stress is one of the problems covered by ambient
intelligence, as stress is a significant cause of human illnesses directly
affecting our emotional state. The primary aim was to propose a deliberation
architecture for an ambient intelligence healthcare application. The
architecture provides a plan for comforting stressed seniors suffering from
negative emotions in an assisted living home and executes the plan considering
the environment's dynamic nature. Literature was reviewed to identify the
convergence between deliberation and ambient intelligence and the latter's
latest healthcare trends. A deliberation function was designed to achieve
context-aware dynamic human-robot interaction, perception, planning
capabilities, reactivity, and context-awareness with regard to the environment.
A number of experimental case studies in a simulated assisted living home
scenario were conducted to demonstrate the approach's behavior and validity.
The proposed methods were validated to show classification accuracy. The
validation showed that the deliberation function has effectively achieved its
deliberative objectives.

<p class="mathjax">The existing image steganography methods either sequentially conceal secret
images or conceal a concatenation of multiple images. In such ways, the
interference of information among multiple images will become increasingly
severe when the number of secret images becomes larger, thus restrict the
development of very large capacity image steganography. In this paper, we
propose an Invertible Mosaic Image Hiding Network (InvMIHNet) which realizes
very large capacity image steganography with high quality by concealing a
single mosaic secret image. InvMIHNet consists of an Invertible Image Rescaling
(IIR) module and an Invertible Image Hiding (IIH) module. The IIR module works
for downscaling the single mosaic secret image form by spatially splicing the
multiple secret images, and the IIH module then conceal this mosaic image under
the cover image. The proposed InvMIHNet successfully conceal and reveal up to
16 secret images with a small number of parameters and memory consumption.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO and DIV2K show InvMIHNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the imperceptibility of stego image
and recover accuracy of secret image.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative robotics is a new and challenging field in the realm of motion
control and human-robot interaction. The safety measures needed for a reliable
interaction between the robot and its environment hinder the use of classical
control methods, pushing researchers to try new techniques such as machine
learning (ML). In this context, reinforcement learning has been adopted as the
primary way to create intelligent controllers for collaborative robots, however
supervised learning shows great promise in the hope of developing data-driven
model based ML controllers in a faster and safer way. In this work we study
several aspects of the methodology needed to create a dataset to be used to
learn the dynamics of a robot. For this we tune several PD controllers to
several trajectories, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) which
takes into account not only their accuracy, but also their safety. We
demonstrate the need to tune the controllers individually to each trajectory
and empirically explore the best population size for the GA and how the speed
of the trajectory affects the tuning and the dynamics of the robot.

<p class="mathjax">As the pretraining technique is growing in popularity, little work has been
done on pretrained learning-based motion prediction methods in autonomous
driving. In this paper, we propose a framework to formalize the pretraining
task for trajectory prediction of traffic participants. Within our framework,
inspired by the random masked model in natural language processing (NLP) and
computer vision (CV), objects' positions at random timesteps are masked and
then filled in by the learned neural network (NN). By changing the mask
profile, our framework can easily switch among a range of motion-related tasks.
We show that our proposed pretraining framework is able to deal with noisy
inputs and improves the motion prediction accuracy and miss rate, especially
for objects occluded over time by evaluating it on Argoverse and NuScenes
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The prospect of assistive robots aiding in object organization has always
been compelling. In an image-goal setting, the robot rearranges the current
scene to match the single image captured from the goal scene. The key to an
image-goal rearrangement system is estimating the desired placement pose of
each object based on the single goal image and observations from the current
scene. In order to establish sufficient associations for accurate estimation,
the system should observe an object from a viewpoint similar to that in the
goal image. Existing image-goal rearrangement systems, due to their reliance on
a fixed viewpoint for perception, often require redundant manipulations to
randomly adjust an object's pose for a better perspective. Addressing this
inefficiency, we introduce a novel object rearrangement system that employs
multi-view fusion. By observing the current scene from multiple viewpoints
before manipulating objects, our approach can estimate a more accurate pose
without redundant manipulation times. A standard visual localization pipeline
at the object level is developed to capitalize on the advantages of multi-view
observations. Simulation results demonstrate that the efficiency of our system
outperforms existing single-view systems. The effectiveness of our system is
further validated in a physical experiment.

<p class="mathjax">The abstract discusses the significance of Visible Light Communication (VLC)
as an efficient and cost-effective solution in the era of green technology. VLC
not only provides illumination but also high-speed data transmission through
existing infrastructure, making it ideal for indoor positioning systems (IPS)
with minimal interference with the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum and enhanced
security. While previous research has mainly focused on positioning accuracy,
this paper delves into the performance evaluation of a VLC-based indoor system.
The study examines key performance parameters, namely Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and path loss, in a Line of Sight (LOS) scenario. It employs a single LED
and ten different photodiode (PD) locations in a 3D room. MATLAB simulations
demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving a good SNR with low path
loss. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of optimizing the
PD's position to maximize signal strength while minimizing noise and losses.

<p class="mathjax">Developing algorithms for extra-terrestrial robotic exploration has always
been challenging. Along with the complexity associated with these environments,
one of the main issues remains the evaluation of said algorithms. With the
regained interest in lunar exploration, there is also a demand for quality
simulators that will enable the development of lunar robots. % In this paper,
we explain how we built a Lunar simulator based on Isaac Sim, Nvidia's robotic
simulator. In this paper, we propose Omniverse Lunar Robotic-Sim (OmniLRS) that
is a photorealistic Lunar simulator based on Nvidia's robotic simulator. This
simulation provides fast procedural environment generation, multi-robot
capabilities, along with synthetic data pipeline for machine-learning
applications. It comes with ROS1 and ROS2 bindings to control not only the
robots, but also the environments. This work also performs sim-to-real rock
instance segmentation to show the effectiveness of our simulator for
image-based perception. Trained on our synthetic data, a yolov8 model achieves
performance close to a model trained on real-world data, with 5% performance
gap. When finetuned with real data, the model achieves 14% higher average
precision than the model trained on real-world data, demonstrating our
simulator's photorealism.% to realize sim-to-real. The code is fully
open-source, accessible here: https://github.com/AntoineRichard/LunarSim, and
comes with demonstrations.

their success, prior studies have shown that PLMs are vulnerable to attacks
from adversarial examples. In this work, we focus on the named entity

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, remote sensing (RS) vision foundation models such as RingMo
have emerged and achieved excellent performance in various downstream tasks.
However, the high demand for computing resources limits the application of
these models on edge devices. It is necessary to design a more lightweight
foundation model to support on-orbit RS image interpretation. Existing methods
face challenges in achieving lightweight solutions while retaining
generalization in RS image interpretation. This is due to the complex high and
low-frequency spectral components in RS images, which make traditional single
CNN or Vision Transformer methods unsuitable for the task. Therefore, this
paper proposes RingMo-lite, an RS multi-task lightweight network with a
CNN-Transformer hybrid framework, which effectively exploits the
frequency-domain properties of RS to optimize the interpretation process. It is
combined by the Transformer module as a low-pass filter to extract global
features of RS images through a dual-branch structure, and the CNN module as a
stacked high-pass filter to extract fine-grained details effectively.
Furthermore, in the pretraining stage, the designed frequency-domain masked
image modeling (FD-MIM) combines each image patch's high-frequency and
low-frequency characteristics, effectively capturing the latent feature
representation in RS data. As shown in Fig. 1, compared with RingMo, the
proposed RingMo-lite reduces the parameters over 60% in various RS image
interpretation tasks, the average accuracy drops by less than 2% in most of the
scenes and achieves SOTA performance compared to models of the similar size. In
addition, our work will be integrated into the MindSpore computing platform in
the near future.

model which predicts the outcome of robot-terrain interaction from camera
images. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module, which
predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from the onboard camera, followed by
a white-box module, which transforms these forces through the laws of classical
mechanics into the predicted trajectories. As the white-box model is
implemented as a differentiable ODE solver, it enables measuring the physical
consistency between predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories of the
robot. Consequently, it creates a self-supervised loss similar to MonoDepth. To
facilitate the reproducibility of the paper, we provide the source code. See

<p class="mathjax">Range-only (RO) pose estimation involves determining a robot's pose over time
by measuring the distance between multiple devices on the robot, known as tags,
and devices installed in the environment, known as anchors. The nonconvex
nature of the range measurement model results in a cost function with possible
local minima. In the absence of a good initialization, commonly used iterative
solvers can get stuck in these local minima resulting in poor trajectory
estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose convex relaxations to the
original nonconvex problem based on semidefinite programs (SDPs). Specifically,
we formulate computationally tractable SDP relaxations to obtain accurate
initial pose and trajectory estimates for RO trajectory estimation under static
and dynamic (i.e., constant-velocity motion) conditions. Through simulation and
real experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed initialization strategies
estimate the initial state accurately compared to iterative local solvers.
Additionally, the proposed relaxations recover global minima under moderate
range measurement noise levels.

<p class="mathjax">Demand response (DR) plays a critical role in ensuring efficient electricity
consumption and optimal usage of network assets. Yet, existing DR models often
overlook a crucial element, the irrational behaviour of electricity end users.
In this work, we propose a price-responsive model that incorporates key aspects
of end-user irrationality, specifically loss aversion, time inconsistency, and
bounded rationality. To this end, we first develop a framework that uses
Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (MSTL) and non-stationary
Gaussian processes to model the randomness in the electricity consumption by
residential consumers. The impact of this model is then evaluated through a
community battery storage (CBS) business model. Additionally, we propose a
chance-constrained optimisation model for CBS operation that deals with the
unpredictability of the end-user irrationality. Our simulations using
real-world data show that the proposed DR model provides a more realistic
estimate of price-responsive behaviour considering irrationality. Compared to a
deterministic model that cannot fully take into account the irrational
behaviour of end users, the chance-constrained CBS operation model yields an
additional 19% revenue. In addition, the business model reduces the electricity
costs of end users with a rooftop solar system by 11%.

<p class="mathjax">Maximum inner product search (MIPS) over dense and sparse vectors have
progressed independently in a bifurcated literature for decades; the latter is
better known as top-$k$ retrieval in Information Retrieval. This duality exists
because sparse and dense vectors serve different end goals. That is despite the
fact that they are manifestations of the same mathematical problem. In this
work, we ask if algorithms for dense vectors could be applied effectively to
sparse vectors, particularly those that violate the assumptions underlying
top-$k$ retrieval methods. We study IVF-based retrieval where vectors are
partitioned into clusters and only a fraction of clusters are searched during
retrieval. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of dimensionality reduction for
sparse vectors, and examine standard and spherical KMeans for partitioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that IVF serves as an efficient solution for sparse
MIPS. As byproducts, we identify two research opportunities and demonstrate
their potential. First, we cast the IVF paradigm as a dynamic pruning technique
and turn that insight into a novel organization of the inverted index for
approximate MIPS for general sparse vectors. Second, we offer a unified regime
for MIPS over vectors that have dense and sparse subspaces, and show its
robustness to query distributions.

manipulation and motion planning due to their ability to enhance success rates
by enabling agents to test and evaluate various policies and trajectories. In
this paper, we investigate the advantages of integrating Sim2Real into robotic
frameworks. We introduce the Triple Regression Sim2Real framework, which
constructs a real-time digital twin. This twin serves as a replica of reality
to simulate and evaluate multiple plans before their execution in real-world
scenarios. Our triple regression approach addresses the reality gap by: (1)
mitigating projection errors between real and simulated camera perspectives
through the first two regression models, and (2) detecting discrepancies in
robot control using the third regression model. Experiments on 6-DoF grasp and
manipulation tasks (where the gripper can approach from any direction)
highlight the effectiveness of our framework. Remarkably, with only RGB input
images, our method achieves state-of-the-art success rates. This research
advances efficient robot training methods and sets the stage for rapid

<p class="mathjax">Continuum robots (CR) offer excellent dexterity and compliance in contrast to
rigid-link robots, making them suitable for navigating through, and interacting
with, confined environments. However, the study of path planning for CRs while
considering external elastic contact is limited. The challenge lies in the fact
that CRs can have multiple possible configurations when in contact, rendering
the forward kinematics not well-defined, and characterizing the set of feasible
robot configurations as non-trivial. In this paper, we propose to solve this
problem by performing quasi-static path planning on an implicit manifold. We
model elastic obstacles as external potential fields and formulate the robot
statics in the potential field as the extremal trajectory of an optimal control
problem obtained by the first-order variational principle. We show that the set
of stable robot configurations is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to a
submanifold embedded in the product space of the CR actuation and base internal
wrench. We then propose to perform path planning on this manifold using
AtlasRRT*, a sampling-based planner dedicated to planning on implicit
manifolds. Simulations in different operation scenarios were conducted and the
results show that the proposed planner outperforms Euclidean space planners in
terms of success rate and computational efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays an important role in autonomous
driving systems and robotics. Recent work utilising prominent deep learning
models for pedestrian motion prediction makes limited a priori assumptions
about human movements, resulting in a lack of explainability and explicit
constraints enforced on predicted trajectories. This paper presents a
dynamics-based deep learning framework where a novel asymptotically stable
dynamical system is integrated into a deep learning model. Our novel
asymptotically stable dynamical system is used to model human goal-targeted
motion by enforcing the human walking trajectory converges to a predicted goal
position and provides a deep learning model with prior knowledge and
explainability. Our deep learning model utilises recent innovations from
transformer networks and is used to learn some features of human motion, such
as collision avoidance, for our proposed dynamical system. The experimental
results show that our framework outperforms recent prominent models in
pedestrian trajectory prediction on five benchmark human motion datasets.

<p class="mathjax">This work describes a new version of a previously published Python package -
gym-saturation: a collection of OpenAI Gym environments for guiding
saturation-style provers based on the given clause algorithm with reinforcement
learning. We contribute usage examples with two different provers: Vampire and
iProver. We also have decoupled the proof state representation from
reinforcement learning per se and provided examples of using a known ast2vec
Python code embedding model as a first-order logic representation. In addition,
we demonstrate how environment wrappers can transform a prover into a problem
similar to a multi-armed bandit. We applied two reinforcement learning
algorithms (Thompson sampling and Proximal policy optimisation) implemented in
Ray RLlib to show the ease of experimentation with the new release of our
package.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of AI technology, we have witnessed numerous
innovations and conveniences. However, along with these advancements come
privacy threats and risks. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) emerges as a key
technology for privacy-preserving computation, enabling computations while
maintaining data privacy. Nevertheless, FHE has limitations in processing
continuous non-polynomial functions as it is restricted to discrete integers
and supports only addition and multiplication. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
operate on discrete spike signals, naturally aligning with the properties of
FHE. In this paper, we present a framework called FHE-DiCSNN. This framework is
based on the efficient TFHE scheme and leverages the discrete properties of
SNNs to achieve high prediction performance on ciphertexts. Firstly, by
employing bootstrapping techniques, we successfully implement computations of
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron model on ciphertexts. Through
bootstrapping, we can facilitate computations for SNNs of arbitrary depth. This
framework can be extended to other spiking neuron models, providing a novel
framework for the homomorphic evaluation of SNNs. Secondly, inspired by CNNs,
we adopt convolutional methods to replace Poisson encoding. This not only
enhances accuracy but also mitigates the issue of prolonged simulation time
caused by random encoding. Furthermore, we employ engineering techniques to
parallelize the computation of bootstrapping, resulting in a significant
improvement in computational efficiency. Finally, we evaluate our model on the
MNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the optimal
parameter configuration, FHE-DiCSNN achieves an accuracy of 97.94% on
ciphertexts, with a loss of only 0.53% compared to the original network's
accuracy of 98.47%. Moreover, each prediction requires only 0.75 seconds of
computation time

<p class="mathjax">As a modern ensemble technique, Deep Forest (DF) employs a cascading
structure to construct deep models, providing stronger representational power
compared to traditional decision forests. However, its greedy multi-layer
learning procedure is prone to overfitting, limiting model effectiveness and
generalizability. This paper presents an optimized Deep Forest, featuring
learnable, layerwise data augmentation policy schedules. Specifically, We
introduce the Cut Mix for Tabular data (CMT) augmentation technique to mitigate
overfitting and develop a population-based search algorithm to tailor
augmentation intensity for each layer. Additionally, we propose to incorporate
outputs from intermediate layers into a checkpoint ensemble for more stable
performance. Experimental results show that our method sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks in various tabular classification tasks,
outperforming shallow tree ensembles, deep forests, deep neural network, and
AutoML competitors. The learned policies also transfer effectively to Deep
Forest variants, underscoring its potential for enhancing non-differentiable
deep learning modules in tabular signal processing.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of recovering a signal $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from a
quadratic system $\{y_i=\boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{A}_i\boldsymbol{x},\
i=1,\ldots,m\}$ with full-rank matrices $\boldsymbol{A}_i$ frequently arises in
applications such as unassigned distance geometry and sub-wavelength imaging.
With i.i.d. standard Gaussian matrices $\boldsymbol{A}_i$, this paper addresses
the high-dimensional case where $m\ll n$ by incorporating prior knowledge of
$\boldsymbol{x}$. First, we consider a $k$-sparse $\boldsymbol{x}$ and
introduce the thresholded Wirtinger flow (TWF) algorithm that does not require
the sparsity level $k$. TWF comprises two steps: the spectral initialization
that identifies a point sufficiently close to $\boldsymbol{x}$ (up to a sign
flip) when $m=O(k^2\log n)$, and the thresholded gradient descent (with a good
initialization) that produces a sequence linearly converging to
$\boldsymbol{x}$ with $m=O(k\log n)$ measurements. Second, we explore the
generative prior, assuming that $\boldsymbol{x}$ lies in the range of an
$L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with $k$-dimensional inputs in an
$\ell_2$-ball of radius $r$. We develop the projected gradient descent (PGD)
algorithm that also comprises two steps: the projected power method that
provides an initial vector with $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{k \log L}{m}}\big)$
$\ell_2$-error given $m=O(k\log(Lnr))$ measurements, and the projected gradient
descent that refines the $\ell_2$-error to $O(\delta)$ at a geometric rate when
$m=O(k\log\frac{Lrn}{\delta^2})$. Experimental results corroborate our
theoretical findings and show that: (i) our approach for the sparse case
notably outperforms the existing provable algorithm sparse power factorization;
(ii) leveraging the generative prior allows for precise image recovery in the
MNIST dataset from a small number of quadratic measurements.

<p class="mathjax">The design of a statistical signal processing privacy problem is studied
where the private data is assumed to be observable. In this work, an agent
observes useful data $Y$, which is correlated with private data $X$, and wants
to disclose the useful information to a user. A statistical privacy mechanism
is employed to generate data $U$ based on $(X,Y)$ that maximizes the revealed
information about $Y$ while satisfying a privacy criterion. To this end, we use
extended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and Strong Functional
Representation Lemma and combine them with a simple observation which we call
separation technique. New lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-off are derived
and we show that they can improve the previous bounds. We study the obtained
bounds in different scenarios and compare them with previous results.

<p class="mathjax">A multi-user private data compression problem is studied. A server has access
to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits and is
connected to an encoder. The encoder is connected through an unsecured link to
a user. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private
attribute $X$, which is assumed to be accessible by the encoder. Moreover, an
adversary is assumed to have access to the link. The users and the encoder have
access to a shared secret key $W$. We assume that at each time the user asks
for a file $Y_{d_i}$, where $(d_1,\ldots,d_K)$ corresponds to the demand
vector. The goal is to design the delivered message $\mathcal {C}=(\mathcal
{C}_1,\ldots,\mathcal {C}_K)$ after the user send his demands to the encoder
such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying:
i. The message $\cal C$ does not reveal any information about $X$, i.e., $X$
and $\mathcal{C}$ are independent, which corresponds to the perfect privacy
constraint; ii. The user is able to decode its demands, $Y_{d_i}$, by using
$\cal C$, and the shared key $W$. Here, the encoder sequentially encode each
demand $Y_{d_i}$ at time $i$, using the shared key and previous encoded
messages.
<br />We propose a variable-length coding scheme that uses privacy-aware
compression techniques. We study proposed upper and lower bounds on the average
length of $\mathcal{C}$ in an example. Finally, we study an application

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the design of a partly-parallel cascaded FFT-IFFT
architecture that does not require any intermediate buffer. Folding can be used
to design partly-parallel architectures for FFT and IFFT. While many cascaded
FFT-IFFT architectures can be designed using various folding sets for the FFT
and the IFFT, for a specified folded FFT architecture, there exists a unique
folding set to design the IFFT architecture that does not require an
intermediate buffer. Such a folding set is designed by processing the output of
the FFT as soon as possible (ASAP) in the folded IFFT. Elimination of the
intermediate buffer reduces latency and saves area. The proposed approach is
also extended to interleaved processing of multi-channel time-series. The
proposed FFT-IFFT cascade architecture saves about N/2 memory elements and N/4
clock cycles of latency compared to a design with identical folding sets. For
the 2-interleaved FFT-IFFT cascade, the memory and latency savings are,
respectively, N/2 units and N/2 clock cycles, compared to a design with
identical folding sets.

<p class="mathjax">Background and objectives: Patients suffering from neurological diseases may
develop dysarthria, a motor speech disorder affecting the execution of speech.
Close and quantitative monitoring of dysarthria evolution is crucial for
enabling clinicians to promptly implement patient management strategies and
maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of communication functions in term of
restoring, compensating or adjusting. In the clinical assessment of orofacial
structures and functions, at rest condition or during speech and non-speech
movements, a qualitative evaluation is usually performed, throughout visual
observation. Methods: To overcome limitations posed by qualitative assessments,
this work presents a store-and-forward self-service telemonitoring system that
integrates, within its cloud architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for analyzing video recordings acquired by individuals with dysarthria. This
architecture, called facial landmark Mask RCNN, aims at locating facial
landmarks as a prior for assessing the orofacial functions related to speech
and examining dysarthria evolution in neurological diseases. Results: When
tested on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset, a publicly available annotated dataset
of video recordings from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
stroke, the proposed CNN achieved a normalized mean error equal to 1.79 on
localizing the facial landmarks. We also tested our system in a real-life
scenario on 11 bulbar-onset ALS subjects, obtaining promising outcomes in terms
of facial landmark position estimation. Discussion and conclusions: This
preliminary study represents a relevant step towards the use of remote tools to
support clinicians in monitoring the evolution of dysarthria.

<p class="mathjax">Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a nonoptical imaging technique in
which a map of the interior permittivity of a volume is estimated by making
capacitance measurements at its boundary and solving an inverse problem. While
previous ECT demonstrations have often been at centimeter scales, ECT is not
limited to macroscopic systems. In this paper, we demonstrate ECT imaging of
polymer microspheres and bacterial biofilms using a CMOS microelectrode array,
achieving spatial resolution of 10 microns. Additionally, we propose a deep
learning architecture and an improved multi-objective training scheme for
reconstructing out-of-plane permittivity maps from the sensor measurements.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to resolve
microscopic 3-D structures, achieving 91.5% prediction accuracy on the
microsphere dataset and 82.7% on the biofilm dataset, including an average of
4.6% improvement over baseline computational methods.

to certify and search for forward invariant sets in nonlinear systems with
neural network controllers. The framework (i) constructs localized first-order
inclusion functions for the closed-loop system using Jacobian bounds and
existing neural network verification tools; (ii) builds a dynamical embedding
system where its evaluation along a single trajectory directly corresponds with
a nested family of hyper-rectangles provably converging to an attractive set of
the original system; (iii) utilizes linear transformations to build families of
nested paralleletopes with the same properties. The framework is automated in
Python using our interval analysis toolbox $\texttt{npinterval}$, in
conjunction with the symbolic arithmetic toolbox $\texttt{sympy}$, demonstrated
on an $8$-dimensional leader-follower system.

<p class="mathjax">In this letter, inspired by the maximum inter-element spacing (IES)
constraint (MISC) criterion, an enhanced MISC-based (EMISC) sparse array (SA)
with high uniform degrees-of-freedom (uDOFs) and low mutual-coupling (MC) is
proposed, analyzed and discussed in detail. For the EMISC SA, an IES set is
first determined by the maximum IES and number of elements. Then, the EMISC SA
is composed of seven uniform linear sub-arrays (ULSAs) derived from an IES set.
An analysis of the uDOFs and weight function shows that, the proposed EMISC SA
outperforms the IMISC SA in terms of uDOF and MC. Simulation results show a
significant advantage of the EMISC SA over other existing SAs.

<p class="mathjax">Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational
data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied
typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions
between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for
graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts
that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes
crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the
temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al.
proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs
under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order
tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing
temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent
timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms
is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several
choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent
architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the
temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like
TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than
state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction
datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal
smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models.
Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new
state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers,
highlighting a promising avenue for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Image servo is an indispensable technique in robotic applications that helps
to achieve high precision positioning. The intermediate representation of image
servo policy is important to sensor input abstraction and policy output
guidance. Classical approaches achieve high precision but require clean
keypoint correspondence, and suffer from limited convergence basin or weak
feature error robustness. Recent learning-based methods achieve moderate
precision and large convergence basin on specific scenes but face issues when
generalizing to novel environments. In this paper, we encode keypoints and
correspondence into a graph and use graph neural network as architecture of
controller. This design utilizes both advantages: generalizable intermediate
representation from keypoint correspondence and strong modeling ability from
neural network. Other techniques including realistic data generation, feature
clustering and distance decoupling are proposed to further improve efficiency,
precision and generalization. Experiments in simulation and real-world verify
the effectiveness of our method in speed (maximum 40fps along with observer),
precision (&lt;0.3{\deg} and sub-millimeter accuracy) and generalization
(sim-to-real without fine-tuning). Project homepage (full paper with

polynomial input-affine nonlinear system. Motivated by event-triggered control,
we provide data-based conditions for input-to-state stability with respect to

<p class="mathjax">Due to the inherent uncertainty in their deformability during motion,
previous methods in deformable object manipulation, such as rope and cloth,
often required hundreds of real-world demonstrations to train a manipulation
policy for each object, which hinders their applications in our ever-changing
world. To address this issue, we introduce GenDOM, a framework that allows the
manipulation policy to handle different deformable objects with only a single
real-world demonstration. To achieve this, we augment the policy by
conditioning it on deformable object parameters and training it with a diverse
range of simulated deformable objects so that the policy can adjust actions
based on different object parameters. At the time of inference, given a new
object, GenDOM can estimate the deformable object parameters with only a single
real-world demonstration by minimizing the disparity between the grid density
of point clouds of real-world demonstrations and simulations in a
differentiable physics simulator. Empirical validations on both simulated and
real-world object manipulation setups clearly show that our method can
manipulate different objects with a single demonstration and significantly
outperforms the baseline in both environments (a 62% improvement for in-domain
ropes and a 15% improvement for out-of-distribution ropes in simulation, as
well as a 26% improvement for ropes and a 50% improvement for cloths in the
real world), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in one-shot
deformable object manipulation.

<p class="mathjax">During the last stage of RLHF, a large language model is aligned to human
intents via PPO training, a process that generally requires large-scale
computational resources. In this technical report, we empirically investigate
an efficient implementation of RLHF using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which
allows us to align the LLaMA 7B checkpoint on the Alpaca dataset using only two
A100 GPUs instead of the eight required for full model fine-tuning. Despite
tuning only 0.2% of LLaMA 7B's parameters, our implementation achieves better
performance than the publicly-released AlpacaFarm checkpoint with full model
fine-tuning. Next, we analyze several configurations of our LoRA-based PPO
implementation, varying the form of the KL regularization term in the training
objective. We find that (1) removing this penalty term does not harm
performance on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set under our LoRA setup; (2) other
regularizers, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, lead to improved performance;
and (3) while PPO training negatively impacts the factuality of model-generated
responses, training with LoRA largely mitigates this effect. We release our
code and pretrained checkpoints to facilitate future research on more efficient
RLHF.

$W_p^s([0,1]^d)$ using finitely many function evaluations within randomized
algorithms, aiming for the smallest possible probabilistic error guarantee
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$ at confidence level $1-\delta \in (0,1)$. For spaces
consisting of continuous functions, non-linear Monte Carlo methods with optimal
confidence properties have already been known, in few cases even linear methods
that succeed in that respect. In this paper we promote a new method called
stratified control variates (SCV) and by it show that already linear methods
achieve optimal probabilistic error rates in the high smoothness regime without
the need to adjust algorithmic parameters to the uncertainty $\delta$. We also
analyse a version of SCV in the low smoothness regime where $W_p^s([0,1]^d)$
may contain functions with singularities. Here, we observe a polynomial
dependence of the error on $\delta^{-1}$ which cannot be avoided for linear
methods. This is worse than what is known to be possible using non-linear
algorithms where only a logarithmic dependence on $\delta^{-1}$ occurs if we
tune in for a specific value of $\delta$.

<p class="mathjax">Point-level weakly-supervised temporal action localization (PWTAL) aims to
localize actions with only a single timestamp annotation for each action
instance. Existing methods tend to mine dense pseudo labels to alleviate the
label sparsity, but overlook the potential sub-action temporal structures,
resulting in inferior performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
sub-action prototype learning framework (SPL-Loc) which comprises Sub-action
Prototype Clustering (SPC) and Ordered Prototype Alignment (OPA). SPC
adaptively extracts representative sub-action prototypes which are capable to
perceive the temporal scale and spatial content variation of action instances.
OPA selects relevant prototypes to provide completeness clue for pseudo label
generation by applying a temporal alignment loss. As a result, pseudo labels
are derived from alignment results to improve action boundary prediction.
Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
SPL-Loc significantly outperforms existing SOTA PWTAL methods.

low-rank submatrices that can be handled efficiently in factorized form.
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices refine this representation following the ideas of fast
multipole methods in order to achieve linear, i.e., optimal complexity for a
variety of important algorithms.
<br />The matrix multiplication, a key component of many more advanced numerical
algorithms, has so far proven tricky: the only linear-time algorithms known so
far either require the very special structure of HSS-matrices or need to know a
suitable basis for all submatrices in advance.
<br />In this article, a new and fairly general algorithm for multiplying
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices in linear complexity with adaptively constructed bases
is presented. The algorithm consists of two phases: first an intermediate
representation with a generalized block structure is constructed, then this
representation is re-compressed in order to match the structure prescribed by
the application.
<br />The complexity and accuracy are analysed and numerical experiments indicate
that the new algorithm can indeed be significantly faster than previous
attempts.

<p class="mathjax">Precise crop yield prediction provides valuable information for agricultural
planning and decision-making processes. However, timely predicting crop yields
remains challenging as crop growth is sensitive to growing season weather
variation and climate change. In this work, we develop a deep learning-based
solution, namely Multi-Modal Spatial-Temporal Vision Transformer (MMST-ViT),
for predicting crop yields at the county level across the United States, by
considering the effects of short-term meteorological variations during the
growing season and the long-term climate change on crops. Specifically, our
MMST-ViT consists of a Multi-Modal Transformer, a Spatial Transformer, and a
Temporal Transformer. The Multi-Modal Transformer leverages both visual remote
sensing data and short-term meteorological data for modeling the effect of
growing season weather variations on crop growth. The Spatial Transformer
learns the high-resolution spatial dependency among counties for accurate
agricultural tracking. The Temporal Transformer captures the long-range
temporal dependency for learning the impact of long-term climate change on
crops. Meanwhile, we also devise a novel multi-modal contrastive learning
technique to pre-train our model without extensive human supervision. Hence,
our MMST-ViT captures the impacts of both short-term weather variations and
long-term climate change on crops by leveraging both satellite images and
meteorological data. We have conducted extensive experiments on over 200
counties in the United States, with the experimental results exhibiting that
our MMST-ViT outperforms its counterparts under three performance metrics of
interest.

<p class="mathjax">Node features bolster graph-based learning when exploited jointly with
network structure. However, a lack of nodal attributes is prevalent in graph
data. We present a framework to recover completely missing node features for a
set of graphs, where we only know the signals of a subset of graphs. Our
approach incorporates prior information from both graph topology and existing
nodal values. We demonstrate an example implementation of our framework where
we assume that node features depend on local graph structure. Missing nodal
values are estimated by aggregating known features from the most similar nodes.
Similarity is measured through a node embedding space that preserves local
topological features, which we train using a Graph AutoEncoder. We empirically
show not only the accuracy of our feature estimation approach but also its
value for downstream graph classification. Our success embarks on and implies
the need to emphasize the relationship between node features and graph
structure in graph-based learning.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a knowledge graph construction method for legal case
documents and related laws, aiming to organize legal information efficiently
and enhance various downstream tasks. Our approach consists of three main
steps: data crawling, information extraction, and knowledge graph deployment.
First, the data crawler collects a large corpus of legal case documents and
related laws from various sources, providing a rich database for further
processing. Next, the information extraction step employs natural language
processing techniques to extract entities such as courts, cases, domains, and
laws, as well as their relationships from the unstructured text. Finally, the
knowledge graph is deployed, connecting these entities based on their extracted
relationships, creating a heterogeneous graph that effectively represents legal
information and caters to users such as lawyers, judges, and scholars. The
established baseline model leverages unsupervised learning methods, and by
incorporating the knowledge graph, it demonstrates the ability to identify
relevant laws for a given legal case. This approach opens up opportunities for
various applications in the legal domain, such as legal case analysis, legal
recommendation, and decision support.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we present a novel and challenging multilabel Vietnamese
dataset (RMDM) designed to assess the performance of large language models
(LLMs), in verifying electronic information related to legal contexts, focusing
on fake news as potential input for electronic evidence. The RMDM dataset
comprises four labels: real, mis, dis, and mal, representing real information,
misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, respectively. By including
these diverse labels, RMDM captures the complexities of differing fake news
categories and offers insights into the abilities of different language models
to handle various types of information that could be part of electronic
evidence. The dataset consists of a total of 1,556 samples, with 389 samples
for each label. Preliminary tests on the dataset using GPT-based and BERT-based
models reveal variations in the models' performance across different labels,
indicating that the dataset effectively challenges the ability of various
language models to verify the authenticity of such information. Our findings
suggest that verifying electronic information related to legal contexts,
including fake news, remains a difficult problem for language models,
warranting further attention from the research community to advance toward more
reliable AI models for potential legal applications.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most critical problems in the field of string algorithms is the
longest common subsequence problem (LCS). The problem is NP-hard for an
arbitrary number of strings but can be solved in polynomial time for a fixed
number of strings. In this paper, we select a typical parallel LCS algorithm
and integrate it into our large-scale string analysis algorithm library to
support different types of large string analysis. Specifically, we take
advantage of the high-level parallel language, Chapel, to integrate Lu and
Liu's parallel LCS algorithm into Arkouda, an open-source framework. Through
Arkouda, data scientists can easily handle large string analytics on the
back-end high-performance computing resources from the front-end Python
interface. The Chapel-enabled parallel LCS algorithm can identify the longest
common subsequences of two strings, and experimental results are given to show
how the number of parallel resources and the length of input strings can affect
the algorithm's performance.

<p class="mathjax">Developing personalised thermal comfort models to inform occupant-centric
controls (OCC) in buildings requires collecting large amounts of real-time
occupant preference data. This process can be highly intrusive and
labour-intensive for large-scale implementations, limiting the practicality of
real-world OCC implementations. To address this issue, this study proposes a
thermal preference-based HVAC control framework enhanced with Active Learning
(AL) to address the data challenges related to real-world implementations of
such OCC systems. The proposed AL approach proactively identifies the most
informative thermal conditions for human annotation and iteratively updates a
supervised thermal comfort model. The resulting model is subsequently used to
predict the occupants' thermal preferences under different thermal conditions,
which are integrated into the building's HVAC controls. The feasibility of our
proposed AL-enabled OCC was demonstrated in an EnergyPlus simulation of a
real-world testbed supplemented with the thermal preference data of 58 study
occupants. The preliminary results indicated a significant reduction in overall
labelling effort (i.e., 31.0%) between our AL-enabled OCC and conventional OCC
while still achieving a slight increase in energy savings (i.e., 1.3%) and
thermal satisfaction levels above 98%. This result demonstrates the potential
for deploying such systems in future real-world implementations, enabling
personalised comfort and energy-efficient building operations.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex spatio-temporal
correlations among traffic series. In this paper, we identify an underexplored
problem in multivariate traffic series prediction: extreme events. Road
congestion and rush hours can result in low correlation in vehicle speeds at
various intersections during adjacent time periods. Existing methods generally
predict future series based on recent observations and entirely discard
training data during the testing phase, rendering them unreliable for
forecasting highly nonlinear multivariate time series. To tackle this issue, we
propose a test-time compensated representation learning framework comprising a
spatio-temporal decomposed data bank and a multi-head spatial transformer model
(CompFormer). The former component explicitly separates all training data along
the temporal dimension according to periodicity characteristics, while the
latter component establishes a connection between recent observations and
historical series in the data bank through a spatial attention matrix. This
enables the CompFormer to transfer robust features to overcome anomalous events
while using fewer computational resources. Our modules can be flexibly
integrated with existing forecasting methods through end-to-end training, and
we demonstrate their effectiveness on the METR-LA and PEMS-BAY benchmarks.
Extensive experimental results show that our method is particularly important
in extreme events, and can achieve significant improvements over six strong
baselines, with an overall improvement of up to 28.2%.

<p class="mathjax">Autoregressive models based on Transformers have become the prevailing
approach for generating music compositions that exhibit comprehensive musical
structure. These models are typically trained by minimizing the negative
log-likelihood (NLL) of the observed sequence in an autoregressive manner.
However, when generating long sequences, the quality of samples from these
models tends to significantly deteriorate due to exposure bias. To address this
issue, we leverage classifiers trained to differentiate between real and
sampled sequences to identify these failures. This observation motivates our
exploration of adversarial losses as a complement to the NLL objective. We
employ a pre-trained Span-BERT model as the discriminator in the Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which enhances training stability in our
experiments. To optimize discrete sequences within the GAN framework, we
utilize the Gumbel-Softmax trick to obtain a differentiable approximation of
the sampling process. Additionally, we partition the sequences into smaller
chunks to ensure that memory constraints are met. Through human evaluations and
the introduction of a novel discriminative metric, we demonstrate that our
approach outperforms a baseline model trained solely on likelihood
maximization.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised trackers trained on labeled data dominate the single object
tracking field for superior tracking accuracy. The labeling cost and the huge
computational complexity hinder their applications on edge devices.
Unsupervised learning methods have also been investigated to reduce the
labeling cost but their complexity remains high. Aiming at lightweight
high-performance tracking, feasibility without offline pre-training, and
algorithmic transparency, we propose a new single object tracking method,
called the green object tracker (GOT), in this work. GOT conducts an ensemble
of three prediction branches for robust box tracking: 1) a global object-based
correlator to predict the object location roughly, 2) a local patch-based
correlator to build temporal correlations of small spatial units, and 3) a
superpixel-based segmentator to exploit the spatial information of the target
frame. GOT offers competitive tracking accuracy with state-of-the-art
unsupervised trackers, which demand heavy offline pre-training, at a lower
computation cost. GOT has a tiny model size (&lt;3k parameters) and low inference
complexity (around 58M FLOPs per frame). Since its inference complexity is
between 0.1%-10% of DL trackers, it can be easily deployed on mobile and edge
devices.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in wireless technologies towards the next-generation
cellular networks have brought a new era that made it possible to apply
cellular technology on traditionally-wired networks with tighter requirements,
such as industrial networks. The next-generation cellular technologies (e.g.,
5G and Beyond) introduce the concept of ultra-reliable low-latency
communications (URLLC). This thesis presents a Software-Defined Networking
(SDN) architecture with programmable data planes for the next-generation
cellular networks to achieve URLLC. Our design deploys programmable switches
between the cellular core and Radio Access Networks (RAN) to monitor and modify
data traffic at the line speed. We introduce the concept of
\textit{intra-cellular optimization}, a relaxation in cellular networks to
allow pre-authorized in-network devices to communicate without being required
to signal the core network. We also present a control structure, Unified
Control Plane (UCP), containing a novel Ethernet Layer control protocol and an
adapted version of link-state routing information distribution among the
programmable switches. Our implementation uses P4 with an 5G implementation
(Open5Gs) and a UE/RAN simulator. We implement a Python simulator to evaluate
the performance of our system on multi-switch topologies by simulating the
switch behavior. Our evaluation indicates latency reduction up to 2x with
\textit{intra-cellular optimization} compared to the conventional architecture.
We show that our design has a ten-millisecond level of control latency, and
achieves fine-grained network security and monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Most automated driving systems comprise a diverse sensor set, including
several cameras, Radars, and LiDARs, ensuring a complete 360\deg coverage in
near and far regions. Unlike Radar and LiDAR, which measure directly in 3D,
cameras capture a 2D perspective projection with inherent depth ambiguity.
However, it is essential to produce perception outputs in 3D to enable the
spatial reasoning of other agents and structures for optimal path planning. The
3D space is typically simplified to the BEV space by omitting the less relevant
Z-coordinate, which corresponds to the height dimension.The most basic approach
to achieving the desired BEV representation from a camera image is IPM,
assuming a flat ground surface. Surround vision systems that are pretty common
in new vehicles use the IPM principle to generate a BEV image and to show it on
display to the driver. However, this approach is not suited for autonomous
driving since there are severe distortions introduced by this too-simplistic
transformation method.

self-supervised video frame reconstructor and key frame selector. The frame
reconstructor, FrameMAE, is developed by adapting the principles of the Masked
Autoencoder for Images (MAE) for video context. The key frame selector, Frame
Selector, is built on CNN architecture. By taking the high-level semantic
information from the encoder of FrameMAE as its input, it can predicted the key
frames with low computation costs. Integrated with our bespoke Frame Selector,
FrameMAE can effectively compress a video clip by retaining approximately 30%
of its pivotal frames. Performance-wise, our model showcases computational
efficiency and competitive accuracy, marking a notable improvement over
traditional Key Frame Extract algorithms. The implementation is available on

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we explore the performance of Intel Xeon MAX CPU Series,
representing the most significant new variation upon the classical CPU
architecture since the Intel Xeon Phi Processor. Given the availability of a
large on-package high-bandwidth memory, the bandwidth-to-compute ratio has
significantly shifted compared to other CPUs on the market. Since a large
fraction of HPC workloads are sensitive to the available bandwidth, we explore
how this architecture performs on a selection of HPC proxies and applications
that are mostly sensitive to bandwidth, and how it compares to the previous 3rd
generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors (codenamed Ice Lake) and an AMD EPYC
7003 Series Processor with 3D V-Cache Technology (codenamed Milan-X). We
explore performance with different parallel implementations (MPI, MPI+OpenMP,
MPI+SYCL), compiled with different compilers and flags, and executed with or
without hyperthreading. We show how performance bottlenecks are shifted from
bandwidth to communication latencies for some applications, and demonstrate
speedups compared to the previous generation between 2.0x-4.3x.

<p class="mathjax">Guitar tablature is a form of music notation widely used among guitarists. It
captures not only the musical content of a piece, but also its implementation
and ornamentation on the instrument. Guitar Tablature Transcription (GTT) is an
important task with broad applications in music education and entertainment.
Existing datasets are limited in size and scope, causing state-of-the-art GTT
models trained on such datasets to suffer from overfitting and to fail in
generalization across datasets. To address this issue, we developed a
methodology for synthesizing SynthTab, a large-scale guitar tablature
transcription dataset using multiple commercial acoustic and electric guitar
plugins. This dataset is built on tablatures from DadaGP, which offers a vast
collection and the degree of specificity we wish to transcribe. The proposed
synthesis pipeline produces audio which faithfully adheres to the original
fingerings, styles, and techniques specified in the tablature with diverse
timbre. Experiments show that pre-training state-of-the-art GTT model on
SynthTab improves transcription accuracy in same-dataset tests. More
importantly, it significantly mitigates overfitting problems of GTT models in
cross-dataset evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Sixth-generation (6G) networks anticipate intelligently supporting a wide
range of smart services and innovative applications. Such a context urges a
heavy usage of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly Deep Learning
(DL), to foster innovation and ease the deployment of intelligent network
functions/operations, which are able to fulfill the various requirements of the
envisioned 6G services. Specifically, collaborative ML/DL consists of deploying
a set of distributed agents that collaboratively train learning models without
sharing their data, thus improving data privacy and reducing the
time/communication overhead. This work provides a comprehensive study on how
collaborative learning can be effectively deployed over 6G wireless networks.
In particular, our study focuses on Split Federated Learning (SFL), a technique
recently emerged promising better performance compared with existing
collaborative learning approaches. We first provide an overview of three
emerging collaborative learning paradigms, including federated learning, split
learning, and split federated learning, as well as of 6G networks along with
their main vision and timeline of key developments. We then highlight the need
for split federated learning towards the upcoming 6G networks in every aspect,
including 6G technologies (e.g., intelligent physical layer, intelligent edge
computing, zero-touch network management, intelligent resource management) and
6G use cases (e.g., smart grid 2.0, Industry 5.0, connected and autonomous
systems). Furthermore, we review existing datasets along with frameworks that
can help in implementing SFL for 6G networks. We finally identify key technical
challenges, open issues, and future research directions related to SFL-enabled
6G networks.

<p class="mathjax">Vocoder models have recently achieved substantial progress in generating
authentic audio comparable to human quality while significantly reducing memory
requirement and inference time. However, these data-hungry generative models
require large-scale audio data for learning good representations. In this
paper, we apply contrastive learning methods in training the vocoder to improve
the perceptual quality of the vocoder without modifying its architecture or
adding more data. We design an auxiliary task with mel-spectrogram contrastive
learning to enhance the utterance-level quality of the vocoder model under
data-limited conditions. We also extend the task to include waveforms to
improve the multi-modality comprehension of the model and address the
discriminator overfitting problem. We optimize the additional task
simultaneously with GAN training objectives. Our result shows that the tasks
improve model performance substantially in data-limited settings. Our analysis
based on the result indicates that the proposed design successfully alleviates
discriminator overfitting and produces audio of higher fidelity.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained language models trained on large-scale data have learned serious
levels of social biases. Consequently, various methods have been proposed to
debias pre-trained models. Debiasing methods need to mitigate only
discriminatory bias information from the pre-trained models, while retaining
information that is useful for the downstream tasks. In previous research,
whether useful information is retained has been confirmed by the performance of
downstream tasks in debiased pre-trained models. On the other hand, it is not
clear whether these benchmarks consist of data pertaining to social biases and
are appropriate for investigating the impact of debiasing. For example in
gender-related social biases, data containing female words (e.g. ``she, female,
woman''), male words (e.g. ``he, male, man''), and stereotypical words (e.g.
``nurse, doctor, professor'') are considered to be the most affected by
debiasing. If there is not much data containing these words in a benchmark
dataset for a target task, there is the possibility of erroneously evaluating
the effects of debiasing. In this study, we compare the impact of debiasing on
performance across multiple downstream tasks using a wide-range of benchmark
datasets that containing female, male, and stereotypical words. Experiments
show that the effects of debiasing are consistently \emph{underestimated}
across all tasks. Moreover, the effects of debiasing could be reliably
evaluated by separately considering instances containing female, male, and
stereotypical words than all of the instances in a benchmark dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of teaching via demonstrations in sequential
decision-making tasks. In particular, we focus on the situation when the
teacher has no access to the learner's model and policy, and the feedback from
the learner is limited to trajectories that start from states selected by the
teacher. The necessity to select the starting states and infer the learner's
policy creates an opportunity for using the methods of inverse reinforcement
learning and active learning by the teacher. In this work, we formalize the
teaching process with limited feedback and propose an algorithm that solves
this teaching problem. The algorithm uses a modified version of the active
value-at-risk method to select the starting states, a modified maximum causal
entropy algorithm to infer the policy, and the difficulty score ratio method to
choose the teaching demonstrations. We test the algorithm in a synthetic car
driving environment and conclude that the proposed algorithm is an effective
solution when the learner's feedback is limited.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose three generic models of capacitated coverage and,
more generally, submodular maximization to study task-worker assignment
problems that arise in a wide range of gig economy platforms. Our models
incorporate the following features: (1) Each task and worker can have an
arbitrary matching capacity, which captures the limited number of copies or
finite budget for the task and the working capacity of the worker; (2) Each
task is associated with a coverage or, more generally, a monotone submodular
utility function. Our objective is to design an allocation policy that
maximizes the sum of all tasks' utilities, subject to capacity constraints on
tasks and workers. We consider two settings: offline, where all tasks and
workers are static, and online, where tasks are static while workers arrive
dynamically. We present three LP-based rounding algorithms that achieve optimal
approximation ratios of $1-1/\mathsf{e} \sim 0.632$ for offline coverage
maximization, competitive ratios of $(19-67/\mathsf{e}^3)/27\sim 0.580$ and
$0.436$ for online coverage and online monotone submodular maximization,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Formats for representing and manipulating verification problems are extremely
important for supporting the ecosystem of tools, developers, and practitioners.
A good format allows representing many different types of problems, has a
strong toolchain for manipulating and translating problems, and can grow with
the community. In the world of hardware verification, and, specifically, the
Hardware Model Checking Competition (HWMCC), the Btor2 format has emerged as
the dominating format. It is supported by Btor2Tools, verification tools, and
Verilog design tools like Yosys. In this paper, we present an alternative
format and toolchain, called Btor2MLIR, based on the recent MLIR framework. The
advantage of Btor2MLIR is in reusing existing components from a mature compiler
infrastructure, including parsers, text and binary formats, converters to a
variety of intermediate representations, and executable semantics of LLVM. We
hope that the format and our tooling will lead to rapid prototyping of
verification and related tools for hardware verification.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on coordinating a robot swarm orbiting a convex path
without collisions among the individuals. The individual robots lack braking
capabilities and can only adjust their courses while maintaining their constant
but different speeds. Instead of controlling the spatial relations between the
robots, our formation control algorithm aims to deploy a dense robot swarm that
mimics the behavior of tornado schooling fish. To achieve this objective
safely, we employ a combination of a scalable overtaking rule, a guiding vector
field, and a control barrier function with an adaptive radius to facilitate
smooth overtakes. The decision-making process of the robots is distributed,
relying only on local information. Practical applications include defensive
structures or escorting missions with the added resiliency of a swarm without a
centralized command. We provide a rigorous analysis of the proposed strategy
and validate its effectiveness through numerical simulations involving a high
density of unicycles.

<p class="mathjax">In this work we present CppFlow - a novel and performant planner for the
Cartesian Path Planning problem, which finds valid trajectories up to 129x
faster than current methods, while also succeeding on more difficult problems
where others fail. At the core of the proposed algorithm is the use of a
learned, generative Inverse Kinematics solver, which is able to efficiently
produce promising entire candidate solution trajectories on the GPU. Precise,
valid solutions are then found through classical approaches such as
differentiable programming, global search, and optimization. In combining
approaches from these two paradigms we get the best of both worlds - efficient
approximate solutions from generative AI which are made exact using the
guarantees of traditional planning and optimization. We evaluate our system
against other state of the art methods on a set of established baselines as
well as new ones introduced in this work and find that our method significantly
outperforms others in terms of the time to find a valid solution and planning
success rate, and performs comparably in terms of trajectory length over time.
The work is made open source and available for use upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous robotic systems, such as quadrotors, are susceptible to actuator
faults, and for the safe operation of such systems, timely detection and
isolation of these faults is essential. Neural networks can be used for
verification of actuator performance via online actuator fault detection with
high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel model-free fault detection and
isolation (FDI) framework for quadrotor systems using long-short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network architecture. The proposed framework only uses system
output data and the commanded control input and requires no knowledge of the
system model. Utilizing the symmetry in quadrotor dynamics, we train the FDI
for fault in just one of the motors (e.g., motor $\# 2$), and the trained FDI
can predict faults in any of the motors. This reduction in search space enables
us to design an FDI for partial fault as well as complete fault scenarios.
Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed NN-FDI correctly verifies
the actuator performance and identifies partial as well as complete faults with
over $90\%$ prediction accuracy. We also illustrate that model-free NN-FDI
performs at par with model-based FDI, and is robust to model uncertainties as
well as distribution shifts in input data.

<p class="mathjax">Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) are domain-specific devices
promising both the flexibility of FPGAs and the performance of ASICs. However,
with restricted domains comes a danger: designing chips that cannot accelerate
enough current and future software to justify the hardware cost. We introduce
FlexC, the first flexible CGRA compiler, which allows CGRAs to be adapted to
operations they do not natively support.
<br />FlexC uses dataflow rewriting, replacing unsupported regions of code with
equivalent operations that are supported by the CGRA. We use equality
saturation, a technique enabling efficient exploration of a large space of
rewrite rules, to effectively search through the program-space for supported
programs. We applied FlexC to over 2,000 loop kernels, compiling to four
different research CGRAs and 300 generated CGRAs and demonstrate a 2.2$\times$
increase in the number of loop kernels accelerated leading to 3$\times$ speedup
compared to an Arm A5 CPU on kernels that would otherwise be unsupported by the
accelerator.

<p class="mathjax">We demonstrate that Contrastive Decoding -- a simple, computationally light,
and training-free text generation method proposed by Li et al 2022 -- achieves
large out-of-the-box improvements over greedy decoding on a variety of
reasoning tasks. Originally shown to improve the perceived quality of long-form
text generation, Contrastive Decoding searches for strings that maximize a
weighted difference in likelihood between strong and weak models. We show that
Contrastive Decoding leads LLaMA-65B to outperform LLaMA 2, GPT-3.5 and PaLM
2-L on the HellaSwag commonsense reasoning benchmark, and to outperform LLaMA
2, GPT-3.5 and PaLM-540B on the GSM8K math word reasoning benchmark, in
addition to improvements on a collection of other tasks. Analysis suggests that
Contrastive Decoding improves over existing methods by preventing some abstract
reasoning errors, as well as by avoiding simpler modes such as copying sections
of the input during chain-of-thought. Overall, Contrastive Decoding outperforms
nucleus sampling for long-form generation and greedy decoding for reasoning
tasks, making it a powerful general purpose method for generating text from
language models.

<p class="mathjax">3D object-level mapping is a fundamental problem in robotics, which is
especially challenging when object CAD models are unavailable during inference.
In this work, we propose a framework that can reconstruct high-quality
object-level maps for unknown objects. Our approach takes multiple RGB-D images
as input and outputs dense 3D shapes and 9-DoF poses (including 3 scale
parameters) for detected objects. The core idea of our approach is to leverage
a learnt generative model for shape categories as a prior and to formulate a
probabilistic, uncertainty-aware optimization framework for 3D reconstruction.
We derive a probabilistic formulation that propagates shape and pose
uncertainty through two novel loss functions. Unlike current state-of-the-art
approaches, we explicitly model the uncertainty of the object shapes and poses
during our optimization, resulting in a high-quality object-level mapping
system. Moreover, the resulting shape and pose uncertainties, which we
demonstrate can accurately reflect the true errors of our object maps, can also
be useful for downstream robotics tasks such as active vision. We perform
extensive evaluations on indoor and outdoor real-world datasets, achieving
achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our code will
be available at https://github.com/TRAILab/UncertainShapePose.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models are quickly gaining momentum, yet are found to
demonstrate gender bias in their responses. In this paper, we conducted a
content analysis of social media discussions to gauge public perceptions of
gender bias in LLMs which are trained in different cultural contexts, i.e.,
ChatGPT, a US-based LLM, or Ernie, a China-based LLM. People shared both
observations of gender bias in their personal use and scientific findings about
gender bias in LLMs. A difference between the two LLMs was seen -- ChatGPT was
more often found to carry implicit gender bias, e.g., associating men and women
with different profession titles, while explicit gender bias was found in
Ernie's responses, e.g., overly promoting women's pursuit of marriage over
career. Based on the findings, we reflect on the impact of culture on gender
bias and propose governance recommendations to regulate gender bias in LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous exploration in dynamic environments necessitates a planner that
can proactively respond to changes and make efficient and safe decisions for
robots. Although plenty of sampling-based works have shown success in exploring
static environments, their inherent sampling randomness and limited utilization
of previous samples often result in sub-optimal exploration efficiency.
Additionally, most of these methods struggle with efficient replanning and
collision avoidance in dynamic settings. To overcome these limitations, we
propose the Heuristic-based Incremental Probabilistic Roadmap Exploration
(HIRE) planner for UAVs exploring dynamic environments. The proposed planner
adopts an incremental sampling strategy based on the probabilistic roadmap
constructed by heuristic sampling toward the unexplored region next to the free
space, defined as the heuristic frontier regions. The heuristic frontier
regions are detected by applying a lightweight vision-based method to the
different levels of the occupancy map. Moreover, our dynamic module ensures
that the planner dynamically updates roadmap information based on the
environment changes and avoids dynamic obstacles. Simulation and physical
experiments prove that our planner can efficiently and safely explore dynamic
environments.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses the task of class-incremental weakly supervised object
localization (CI-WSOL). The goal is to incrementally learn object localization
for novel classes using only image-level annotations while retaining the
ability to localize previously learned classes. This task is important because
annotating bounding boxes for every new incoming data is expensive, although
object localization is crucial in various applications. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to address this task. Thus, we first present a
strong baseline method for CI-WSOL by adapting the strategies of
class-incremental classifiers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. These
strategies include applying knowledge distillation, maintaining a small data
set from previous tasks, and using cosine normalization. We then propose the
feature drift compensation network to compensate for the effects of feature
drifts on class scores and localization maps. Since updating network parameters
to learn new tasks causes feature drifts, compensating for the final outputs is
necessary. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments
on two publicly available datasets (ImageNet-100 and CUB-200). The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline
methods.

<p class="mathjax">The concepts of conditional mutual information (CMI) and normalized
conditional mutual information (NCMI) are introduced to measure the
concentration and separation performance of a classification deep neural
network (DNN) in the output probability distribution space of the DNN, where
CMI and the ratio between CMI and NCMI represent the intra-class concentration
and inter-class separation of the DNN, respectively. By using NCMI to evaluate
popular DNNs pretrained over ImageNet in the literature, it is shown that their
validation accuracies over ImageNet validation data set are more or less
inversely proportional to their NCMI values. Based on this observation, the
standard deep learning (DL) framework is further modified to minimize the
standard cross entropy function subject to an NCMI constraint, yielding CMI
constrained deep learning (CMIC-DL). A novel alternating learning algorithm is
proposed to solve such a constrained optimization problem. Extensive experiment
results show that DNNs trained within CMIC-DL outperform the state-of-the-art
models trained within the standard DL and other loss functions in the
literature in terms of both accuracy and robustness against adversarial
attacks. In addition, visualizing the evolution of learning process through the
lens of CMI and NCMI is also advocated.

<p class="mathjax">People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) struggle to calculate the optimal insulin
dose at mealtime, especially when under multiple daily injections (MDI)
therapy. Effectively, they will not always perform rigorous and precise
calculations, but occasionally, they might rely on intuition and previous
experience. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding results in
outperforming humans on tasks requiring intuition and learning from experience.
In this work, we propose an RL agent that recommends the optimal
meal-accompanying insulin dose corresponding to a qualitative meal (QM)
strategy that does not require precise carbohydrate counting (CC) (e.g., a
usual meal at noon.). The agent is trained using the soft actor-critic approach
and comprises long short-term memory (LSTM) neurons. For training, eighty
virtual subjects (VS) of the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1D adult population were
simulated using MDI therapy and QM strategy. For validation, the remaining
twenty VS were examined in 26-week scenarios, including intra- and inter-day
variabilities in glucose. \textit{In-silico} results showed that the proposed
RL approach outperforms a baseline run-to-run approach and can replace the
standard CC approach. Specifically, after 26 weeks, the time-in-range
($70-180$mg/dL) and time-in-hypoglycemia ($&lt;70$mg/dL) were $73.1\pm11.6$% and $
2.0\pm 1.8$% using the RL-optimized QM strategy compared to $70.6\pm14.8$% and
$ 1.5\pm 1.5$% using CC. Such an approach can simplify diabetes treatment,
resulting in improved quality of life and glycemic outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT, a recently developed product by openAI, is successfully leaving its
mark as a multi-purpose natural language based chatbot. In this paper, we are
more interested in analyzing its potential in the field of computational
biology. A major share of work done by computational biologists these days
involve coding up Bioinformatics algorithms, analyzing data, creating
pipelining scripts and even machine learning modeling &amp; feature extraction.
This paper focuses on the potential influence (both positive and negative) of
ChatGPT in the mentioned aspects with illustrative examples from different
perspectives. Compared to other fields of Computer Science, Computational
Biology has - (1) less coding resources, (2) more sensitivity and bias issues
(deals with medical data) and (3) more necessity of coding assistance (people
from diverse background come to this field). Keeping such issues in mind, we
cover use cases such as code writing, reviewing, debugging, converting,
refactoring and pipelining using ChatGPT from the perspective of computational
biologists in this paper.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating outputs of large language models (LLMs) is challenging, requiring
making -- and making sense of -- many responses. Yet tools that go beyond basic
prompting tend to require knowledge of programming APIs, focus on narrow
domains, or are closed-source. We present ChainForge, an open-source visual
toolkit for prompt engineering and on-demand hypothesis testing of text
generation LLMs. ChainForge provides a graphical interface for comparison of
responses across models and prompt variations. Our system was designed to
support three tasks: model selection, prompt template design, and hypothesis
testing (e.g., auditing). We released ChainForge early in its development and
iterated on its design with academics and online users. Through in-lab and
interview studies, we find that a range of people could use ChainForge to
investigate hypotheses that matter to them, including in real-world settings.
We identify three modes of prompt engineering and LLM hypothesis testing:
opportunistic exploration, limited evaluation, and iterative refinement.

<p class="mathjax">Sparse Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (spMTTKRP) is the most
time-consuming compute kernel in sparse tensor decomposition. In this paper, we
introduce a novel algorithm to minimize the execution time of spMTTKRP across
all modes of an input tensor on multi-core CPU platform. The proposed algorithm
leverages the FLYCOO tensor format to exploit data locality in external memory
accesses. It effectively utilizes computational resources by enabling lock-free
concurrent processing of independent partitions of the input tensor. The
proposed partitioning ensures load balancing among CPU threads. Our dynamic
tensor remapping technique leads to reduced communication overhead along all
the modes. On widely used real-world tensors, our work achieves 2.12x - 9.01x
speedup in total execution time across all modes compared with the

<p class="mathjax">Around a third of type 2 diabetes patients (T2D) are escalated to basal
insulin injections. Basal insulin dose is titrated to achieve a tight glycemic
target without undue hypoglycemic risk. In the standard of care (SoC),
titration is based on intermittent fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurements.
Lack of adherence and the day-to-day variabilities in FBG measurements are
limiting factors to the existing insulin titration procedure. We propose an
adaptive receding horizon control strategy where a glucose-insulin fasting
model is identified and used to predict the optimal basal insulin dose. This
algorithm is evaluated in \textit{in-silico} experiments using the new UVA
virtual lab (UVlab) and a set of T2D avatars matched to clinical data
(NCT01336023). Compared to SoC, we show that this control strategy can achieve
the same glucose targets faster (as soon as week 8) and safer (increased
hypoglycemia protection and robustness to missing FBG measurements).
Specifically, when insulin is titrated daily, a time-in-range (TIR, 70--180
mg/dL) of 71.4$\pm$20.0\% can be achieved at week eight and maintained at week
52 (72.6$\pm$19.6%) without an increased hypoglycemia risk as measured by time
under 70 mg/dL (TBR, week 8: 1.3$\pm$1.9% and week 52: 1.2$\pm$1.9%), when
compared to the SoC (TIR at week 8: 59.3$\pm$28.0% and week:52 72.1$\pm$22.3%,
TBR at week 8: 0.5$\pm$1.3% and week 52: 2.8$\pm$3.4%). Such an approach can
potentially reduce treatment inertia and prescription complexity, resulting in
improved glycemic outcomes for T2D using basal insulin injections.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we establish a novel connection between total variation (TV)
distance estimation and probabilistic inference. In particular, we present an
efficient, structure-preserving reduction from relative approximation of TV
distance to probabilistic inference over directed graphical models. This
reduction leads to a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS)
for estimating TV distances between distributions over any class of Bayes nets
for which there is an efficient probabilistic inference algorithm. In
particular, it leads to an FPRAS for estimating TV distances between
distributions that are defined by Bayes nets of bounded treewidth. Prior to
this work, such approximation schemes only existed for estimating TV distances
between product distributions. Our approach employs a new notion of $partial$
couplings of high-dimensional distributions, which might be of independent
interest.

<p class="mathjax">Recent end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have become
increasingly larger, making them particularly challenging to be deployed on
resource-constrained devices. Model quantisation is an effective solution that
sometimes causes the word error rate (WER) to increase. In this paper, a novel
strategy of personalisation for a quantised model (PQM) is proposed, which
combines speaker adaptive training (SAT) with model quantisation to improve the
performance of heavily compressed models. Specifically, PQM uses a 4-bit
NormalFloat Quantisation (NF4) approach for model quantisation and low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) for SAT. Experiments have been performed on the LibriSpeech
and the TED-LIUM 3 corpora. Remarkably, with a 7x reduction in model size and
1% additional speaker-specific parameters, 15.1% and 23.3% relative WER
reductions were achieved on quantised Whisper and Conformer-based
attention-based encoder-decoder ASR models respectively, comparing to the
original full precision models.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting pedestrian movements remains a complex and persistent challenge in
robot navigation research. We must evaluate several factors to achieve accurate
predictions, such as pedestrian interactions, the environment, crowd density,
and social and cultural norms. Accurate prediction of pedestrian paths is vital
for ensuring safe human-robot interaction, especially in robot navigation.
Furthermore, this research has potential applications in autonomous vehicles,
pedestrian tracking, and human-robot collaboration. Therefore, in this paper,
we introduce \textbf{FlowMNO}, an Optical Flow-Integrated Markov Neural
Operator designed to capture pedestrian behavior across diverse scenarios. Our
paper models trajectory prediction as a Markovian process, where future
pedestrian coordinates depend solely on the current state. This problem
formulation eliminates the need to store previous states. We conducted
experiments using standard benchmark datasets like ETH, HOTEL, ZARA1, ZARA2,
UCY, and RGB-D pedestrian datasets. Our study demonstrates that FlowMNO
outperforms some of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods like LSTM, GAN,
and CNN-based approaches, by approximately 86.46\% when predicting pedestrian
trajectories. Thus, we show that FlowMNO can seamlessly integrate into robot
navigation systems, enhancing their ability to navigate crowded areas smoothly.

<p class="mathjax">High assurance of information-flow security (IFS) for concurrent systems is
challenging. A promising way for formal verification of concurrent systems is
the rely-guarantee method. However, existing compositional reasoning approaches
for IFS concentrate on language-based IFS. It is often not applicable for
system-level security, such as multicore operating system kernels, in which
secrecy of actions should also be considered. On the other hand, existing
studies on the rely-guarantee method are basically built on concurrent
programming languages, by which semantics of concurrent systems cannot be
completely captured in a straightforward way. In order to formally verify
state-action based IFS for concurrent systems, we propose a
rely-guarantee-based compositional reasoning approach for IFS in this paper. We
first design a language by incorporating ``Event'' into concurrent languages
and give the IFS semantics of the language. As a primitive element, events
offer an extremely neat framework for modeling system and are not necessarily
atomic in our language. For compositional reasoning of IFS, we use
rely-guarantee specification to define new forms of unwinding conditions (UCs)
on events, i.e., event UCs. By a rely-guarantee proof system of the language
and the soundness of event UCs, we have that event UCs imply IFS of concurrent
systems. In such a way, we relax the atomicity constraint of actions in
traditional UCs and provide a compositional reasoning way for IFS in which
security proof of systems can be discharged by independent security proof on
individual events. Finally, we mechanize the approach in Isabelle/HOL and
develop a formal specification and its IFS proof for multicore separation
kernels as a study case according to an industrial standard -- ARINC 653.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant momentum recently due to
their capability to learn on unstructured graph data. Dynamic GNNs (DGNNs) are
the current state-of-the-art for point cloud applications; such applications
(viz. autonomous driving) require real-time processing at the edge with tight
latency and memory constraints. Conducting performance analysis on such DGNNs,
thus, becomes a crucial task to evaluate network suitability.
<br />This paper presents a profiling analysis of EdgeConv-based DGNNs applied to
point cloud inputs. We assess their inference performance in terms of
end-to-end latency and memory consumption on state-of-the-art CPU and GPU
platforms. The EdgeConv layer has two stages: (1) dynamic graph generation
using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and, (2) node feature updation. The addition of
dynamic graph generation via kNN in each (EdgeConv) layer enhances network
performance compared to networks that work with the same static graph in each
layer; such performance enhancement comes, however, at the added computational
cost associated with the dynamic graph generation stage (via kNN algorithm).
Understanding its costs is essential for identifying the performance bottleneck
and exploring potential avenues for hardware acceleration. To this end, this
paper aims to shed light on the performance characteristics of EdgeConv-based
DGNNs for point cloud inputs. Our performance analysis on a state-of-the-art
EdgeConv network for classification shows that the dynamic graph construction
via kNN takes up upwards of 95% of network latency on the GPU and almost 90% on
the CPU. Moreover, we propose a quasi-Dynamic Graph Neural Network (qDGNN) that
halts dynamic graph updates after a specific depth within the network to
significantly reduce the latency on both CPU and GPU whilst matching the
original networks inference accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Interval Markov decision processes are a class of Markov models where the
transition probabilities between the states belong to intervals. In this paper,
we study the problem of efficient estimation of the optimal policies in
Interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs) with continuous action-space. Given
an IMDP, we show that the pessimistic (resp. the optimistic) value iterations,
i.e., the value iterations under the assumption of a competitive adversary
(resp. cooperative agent), are monotone dynamical systems and are contracting
with respect to the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm. Inspired by this dynamical system
viewpoint, we introduce another IMDP, called the action-space relaxation IMDP.
We show that the action-space relaxation IMDP has two key features: (i) its
optimal value is an upper bound for the optimal value of the original IMDP, and
(ii) its value iterations can be efficiently solved using tools and techniques
from convex optimization. We then consider the policy optimization problems at
each step of the value iterations as a feedback controller of the value
function. Using this system-theoretic perspective, we propose an
iteration-distributed implementation of the value iterations for approximating
the optimal value of the action-space relaxation IMDP.

<p class="mathjax">This paper discusses challenges and opportunities of considering the
Metaverse as an Information-Centric Network (ICN). The Web today essentially
represents a data-centric application layer: data named by URLs is manipulated
with REST primitives. However, the semantic gap with the underlying
host-oriented transport is significant, typically leading to complexity,
centralization, and brittleness. Popular interest in "the Metaverse" suggests
that the end-user experience of the Web will evolve towards always-on eXtended
Reality (XR). With the benefit of a historical perspective, computing advances,
and decades of experience with a global network, there is an opportunity to
holistically consider the Metaverse not as an application of the current
network, but an evolution of the network itself, reducing rather than widening
the gap between network architecture and application semantics. An ICN
architecture offers the possibility to achieve this with less overhead, low
latency, better security, and more disruption tolerance suitable to diverse
uses cases, even those facing intermittent connectivity.

<p class="mathjax">The rely-guarantee approach is a promising way for compositional verification
of concurrent reactive systems (CRSs), e.g. concurrent operating systems,
interrupt-driven control systems and business process systems. However,
specifications using heterogeneous reaction patterns, different abstraction
levels, and the complexity of real-world CRSs are still challenging the
rely-guarantee approach. This article proposes PiCore, a rely-guarantee
reasoning framework for formal specification and verification of CRSs. We
design an event specification language supporting complex reaction structures
and its rely-guarantee proof system to detach the specification and logic of
reactive aspects of CRSs from event behaviours. PiCore parametrizes the
language and its rely-guarantee system for event behaviour using a
rely-guarantee interface and allows to easily integrate 3rd-party languages via
rely-guarantee adapters. By this design, we have successfully integrated two
existing languages and their rely-guarantee proof systems without any change of
their specification and proofs. PiCore has been applied to two real-world case
studies, i.e. formal verification of concurrent memory management in Zephyr
RTOS and a verified translation for a standardized Business Process Execution
Language (BPEL) to PiCore.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) can understand human instructions, showing their
potential for pragmatic applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. However,
they still struggle with complex instructions, which can be either complex task
descriptions that require multiple tasks and constraints, or complex input that
contains long context, noise, heterogeneous information and multi-turn format.
Due to these features, LLMs often ignore semantic constraints from task
descriptions, generate incorrect formats, violate length or sample count
constraints, and be unfaithful to the input text. Existing benchmarks are
insufficient to assess LLMs' ability to understand complex instructions, as
they are close-ended and simple. To bridge this gap, we propose CELLO, a
benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions
systematically. We design eight features for complex instructions and construct
a comprehensive evaluation dataset from real-world scenarios. We also establish
four criteria and develop corresponding metrics, as current ones are
inadequate, biased or too strict and coarse-grained. We compare the performance
of representative Chinese-oriented and English-oriented models in following
complex instructions through extensive experiments. Resources of CELLO are
publicly available at https://github.com/Abbey4799/CELLO.

<p class="mathjax">We study an optimal control problem governed by elliptic PDEs with interface,
which the control acts on the interface. Due to the jump of the coefficient
across the interface and the control acting on the interface, the regularity of
solution of the control problem is limited on the whole domain, but smoother on
subdomains. The control function with pointwise inequality constraints is
served as the flux jump condition which we called Neumann interface control. We
use a simple uniform mesh that is independent of the interface. The standard
linear finite element method can not achieve optimal convergence when the
uniform mesh is used. Therefore the state and adjoint state equations are
discretized by piecewise linear immersed finite element method (IFEM). While
the accuracy of the piecewise constant approximation of the optimal control on
the interface is improved by a postprocessing step which possesses
superconvergence properties; as well as the variational discretization concept
for the optimal control is used to improve the error estimates. Optimal error
estimates for the control, suboptimal error estimates for state and adjoint
state are derived. Numerical examples with and without constraints are provided
to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and correctness of the
theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">In the typical multiagent formation tracking problem centered on consensus,
the prevailing assumption in the literature is that the agents' nonlinear
models can be approximated by integrator systems, by their feedback-linearized
equivalents, or by dynamics composed of deterministic linear and nonlinear
terms. The resulting approaches associated with such assumptions, however, are
hardly applicable to general nonlinear systems. To this end, we present
consensus-based control laws for multiagent formation tracking in
finite-dimensional state space, with the agents represented by a more general
class of dynamics: control-affine nonlinear systems. The agents also exchange
information via a leader-follower communication topology modeled as an
undirected and connected graph with a single leader node. By leveraging
standard tools from algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov analysis, we first
derive a locally asymptotically stabilizing formation tracking law. Next, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present results from
numerical simulations of an example in robotics. These results -- together with
a comparison of the formation errors obtained with our approach and those
realized via an optimization-based method -- further validate our theoretical
propositions.

<p class="mathjax">Reliable autonomous navigation requires adapting the control policy of a
mobile robot in response to dynamics changes in different operational
conditions. Hand-designed dynamics models may struggle to capture model
variations due to a limited set of parameters. Data-driven dynamics learning
approaches offer higher model capacity and better generalization but require
large amounts of state-labeled data. This paper develops an approach for
learning robot dynamics directly from point-cloud observations, removing the
need and associated errors of state estimation, while embedding Hamiltonian
structure in the dynamics model to improve data efficiency. We design an
observation-space loss that relates motion prediction from the dynamics model
with motion prediction from point-cloud registration to train a Hamiltonian
neural ordinary differential equation. The learned Hamiltonian model enables
the design of an energy-shaping model-based tracking controller for rigid-body
robots. We demonstrate dynamics learning and tracking control on a real
nonholonomic wheeled robot.

<p class="mathjax">To address the increasing computational demands of artificial intelligence
(AI) and big data, compute-in-memory (CIM) integrates memory and processing
units into the same physical location, reducing the time and energy overhead of
the system. Despite advancements in non-volatile memory (NVM) for matrix
multiplication, other critical data-intensive operations, like parallel search,
have been overlooked. Current parallel search architectures, namely
content-addressable memory (CAM), often use binary, which restricts density and
functionality. We present an analog CAM (ACAM) cell, built on two complementary
ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), that performs parallel search
in the analog domain with over 40 distinct match windows. We then deploy it to
calculate similarity between vectors, a building block in the following two
machine learning problems. ACAM outperforms ternary CAM (TCAM) when applied to
similarity search for few-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset, yielding
projected simulation results with improved inference accuracy by 5%, 3x denser
memory architecture, and more than 100x faster speed compared to central
processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) per similarity search
on scaled CMOS nodes. We also demonstrate 1-step inference on a kernel
regression model by combining non-linear kernel computation and matrix
multiplication in ACAM, with simulation estimates indicating 1,000x faster
inference than CPU and GPU.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed many successful trials in the robot learning
field. For contact-rich robotic tasks, it is challenging to learn coordinated
motor skills by reinforcement learning. Imitation learning solves this problem
by using a mimic reward to encourage the robot to track a given reference
trajectory. However, imitation learning is not so efficient and may constrain
the learned motion. In this paper, we propose instruction learning, which is
inspired by the human learning process and is highly efficient, flexible, and
versatile for robot motion learning. Instead of using a reference signal in the
reward, instruction learning applies a reference signal directly as a
feedforward action, and it is combined with a feedback action learned by
reinforcement learning to control the robot. Besides, we propose the action
bounding technique and remove the mimic reward, which is shown to be crucial
for efficient and flexible learning. We compare the performance of instruction
learning with imitation learning, indicating that instruction learning can
greatly speed up the training process and guarantee learning the desired motion
correctly. The effectiveness of instruction learning is validated through a
bunch of motion learning examples for a biped robot and a quadruped robot,
where skills can be learned typically within several million steps. Besides, we
also conduct sim-to-real transfer and online learning experiments on a real
quadruped robot. Instruction learning has shown great merits and potential,
making it a promising alternative for imitation learning.

IEEE 802.11bn amendment, alias Wi-Fi 8. Among the MAPC features, Coordinated
Spatial Reuse (C-SR) stands as one of the most appealing due to its capability
to orchestrate simultaneous access point transmissions at a low implementation
complexity. In this paper, we contribute to the understanding of C-SR by
introducing an analytical model based on Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs)
to characterize its throughput and spatial efficiency. Applying the proposed
model to several network topologies, we show that C-SR opportunistically
enables parallel high-quality transmissions and yields an average throughput
gain of up to 59% in comparison to the legacy 802.11 Distributed Coordination

<p class="mathjax">There are many existing differentially private algorithms for releasing
histograms, i.e. counts with corresponding labels, in various settings. Our
focus in this survey is to revisit some of the existing differentially private
algorithms for releasing histograms over unknown domains, i.e. the labels of
the counts that are to be released are not known beforehand. The main practical
advantage of releasing histograms over an unknown domain is that the algorithm
does not need to fill in missing labels because they are not present in the
original histogram but in a hypothetical neighboring dataset could appear in
the histogram. However, the challenge in designing differentially private
algorithms for releasing histograms over an unknown domain is that some
outcomes can clearly show which input was used, clearly violating privacy. The
goal then is to show that the differentiating outcomes occur with very low
probability. We present a unified framework for the privacy analyses of several
existing algorithms. Furthermore, our analysis uses approximate concentrated
differential privacy from Bun and Steinke'16, which can improve the privacy
loss parameters rather than using differential privacy directly, especially
when composing many of these algorithms together in an overall system.

<p class="mathjax">Modern streaming data categorization faces significant challenges from
concept drift and class imbalanced data. This negatively impacts the output of
the classifier, leading to improper classification. Furthermore, other factors
such as the overlapping of multiple classes limit the extent of the correctness
of the output. This work proposes a novel framework for integrating data
pre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection, by formulating the
classification framework for the nonstationary drifting imbalanced data stream,
which employs the data pre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection
techniques. The proposed framework was evaluated using six artificially
generated data streams with differing imbalance ratios in combination with two
different types of concept drifts. Each stream is composed of 200 chunks of 500
objects described by eight features and contains five concept drifts. Seven
pre-processing techniques and two dynamic ensemble selection methods were
considered. According to experimental results, data pre-processing combined
with Dynamic Ensemble Selection techniques significantly delivers more accuracy
when dealing with imbalanced data streams.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Question Answering (VQA) aims to automatically answer natural language
questions related to given image content. Existing VQA methods integrate vision
modeling and language understanding to explore the deep semantics of the
question. However, these methods ignore the significant syntax information of
the question, which plays a vital role in understanding the essential semantics
of the question and guiding the visual feature refinement. To fill the gap, we
suggested a novel Syntax Tree Constrained Graph Network (STCGN) for VQA based
on entity message passing and syntax tree. This model is able to extract a
syntax tree from questions and obtain more precise syntax information.
Specifically, we parse questions and obtain the question syntax tree using the
Stanford syntax parsing tool. From the word level and phrase level, syntactic
phrase features and question features are extracted using a hierarchical tree
convolutional network. We then design a message-passing mechanism for
phrase-aware visual entities and capture entity features according to a given
visual context. Extensive experiments on VQA2.0 datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed model.

<p class="mathjax">Task planning for robotic cooking involves generating a sequence of actions
for a robot to prepare a meal successfully. This paper introduces a novel task
tree generation pipeline producing correct planning and efficient execution for
cooking tasks. Our method first uses a large language model (LLM) to retrieve
recipe instructions and then utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-3 to convert them into a
task tree, capturing sequential and parallel dependencies among subtasks. The
pipeline then mitigates the uncertainty and unreliable features of LLM outputs
using task tree retrieval. We combine multiple LLM task tree outputs into a
graph and perform a task tree retrieval to avoid questionable nodes and
high-cost nodes to improve planning correctness and improve execution
efficiency. Our evaluation results show its superior performance compared to
previous works in task planning accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in metric, semantic, and topological mapping have equipped
autonomous robots with semantic concept grounding capabilities to interpret
natural language tasks. This work aims to leverage these new capabilities with
an efficient task planning algorithm for hierarchical metric-semantic models.
We consider a scene graph representation of the environment and utilize a large
language model (LLM) to convert a natural language task into a linear temporal
logic (LTL) automaton. Our main contribution is to enable optimal hierarchical
LTL planning with LLM guidance over scene graphs. To achieve efficiency, we
construct a hierarchical planning domain that captures the attributes and
connectivity of the scene graph and the task automaton, and provide semantic
guidance via an LLM heuristic function. To guarantee optimality, we design an
LTL heuristic function that is provably consistent and supplements the
potentially inadmissible LLM guidance in multi-heuristic planning. We
demonstrate efficient planning of complex natural language tasks in scene
graphs of virtualized real environments.

<p class="mathjax">The classical human-robot interface in uncalibrated image-based visual
servoing (UIBVS) relies on either human annotations or semantic segmentation
with categorical labels. Both methods fail to match natural human communication
and convey rich semantics in manipulation tasks as effectively as natural
language expressions. In this paper, we tackle this problem by using referring
expression segmentation, which is a prompt-based approach, to provide more
in-depth information for robot perception. To generate high-quality
segmentation predictions from referring expressions, we propose CLIPUNetr - a
new CLIP-driven referring expression segmentation network. CLIPUNetr leverages
CLIP's strong vision-language representations to segment regions from referring
expressions, while utilizing its ``U-shaped'' encoder-decoder architecture to
generate predictions with sharper boundaries and finer structures. Furthermore,
we propose a new pipeline to integrate CLIPUNetr into UIBVS and apply it to
control robots in real-world environments. In experiments, our method improves
boundary and structure measurements by an average of 120% and can successfully
assist real-world UIBVS control in an unstructured manipulation environment.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel B-spline trajectory optimization method for autonomous
racing. We consider the unavailability of sophisticated race car and race track
dynamics in early-stage autonomous motorsports development and derive methods
that work with limited dynamics data and additional conservative constraints.
We formulate a minimum-curvature optimization problem with only the spline
control points as optimization variables. We then compare the current
state-of-the-art method with our optimization result, which achieves a similar
level of optimality with a 90% reduction on the decision variable dimension,
and in addition offers mathematical smoothness guarantee and flexible
manipulation options. We concurrently reduce the problem computation time from
seconds to milliseconds for a long race track, enabling future online
adaptation of the previously offline technique.

<p class="mathjax">We consider data-driven reachability analysis of discrete-time stochastic
dynamical systems using conformal inference. We assume that we are not provided
with a symbolic representation of the stochastic system, but instead have
access to a dataset of $K$-step trajectories. The reachability problem is to
construct a probabilistic flowpipe such that the probability that a $K$-step
trajectory can violate the bounds of the flowpipe does not exceed a
user-specified failure probability threshold. The key ideas in this paper are:
(1) to learn a surrogate predictor model from data, (2) to perform reachability
analysis using the surrogate model, and (3) to quantify the surrogate model's
incurred error using conformal inference in order to give probabilistic
reachability guarantees. We focus on learning-enabled control systems with
complex closed-loop dynamics that are difficult to model symbolically, but
where state transition pairs can be queried, e.g., using a simulator. We
demonstrate the applicability of our method on examples from the domain of
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems.

<p class="mathjax">This expository manuscript presents generalized expressions for the
low-frequency voltage gain and terminal impedances of each of the three
fundamental bipolar-amplifier topologies (i.e., common emitter, common base,
and common collector). Unlike the formulas that students typically learn and
designers typically use, the equations presented in this tutorial assume the
most general set of conditions: finite output resistance and base-collector
current gain, a load resistor at each non-input terminal of the transistor, and
a "feedback" resistor between the base and collector terminals. Although
perhaps algebraically complex at first glance, emphasis is placed on
mathematical elegance and ease of use -- expressions are formulated in terms of
sub-terms that capture important aspects of the circuit's behavior.
Similarities in the mathematical structure of the results reveal a deeper
conceptual connection between different amplifier topologies and, ultimately, a
reciprocity relationship between the base and emitter terminals. Familiar
approximate expressions are subsumed as special cases. Tables consolidating the
expressions in an organized fashion are provided. Companion results for
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) single-transistor amplifiers are also included.

<p class="mathjax">Protein folding is the intricate process by which a linear sequence of amino
acids self-assembles into a unique three-dimensional structure. Protein folding
kinetics is the study of pathways and time-dependent mechanisms a protein
undergoes when it folds. Understanding protein kinetics is essential as a
protein needs to fold correctly for it to perform its biological functions
optimally, and a misfolded protein can sometimes be contorted into shapes that
are not ideal for a cellular environment giving rise to many degenerative,
neuro-degenerative disorders and amyloid diseases. Monitoring at-risk
individuals and detecting protein discrepancies in a protein's folding kinetics
at the early stages could majorly result in public health benefits, as
preventive measures can be taken. This research proposes an efficient pipeline
for predicting protein folding kinetics with high accuracy and low memory
footprint. The deployed machine learning (ML) model outperformed the
state-of-the-art ML models by 4.8% in terms of accuracy while consuming 327x
lesser memory and being 7.3% faster.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have drawn attention because of their outstanding
performance on various tasks. However, deploying full-fledged DNNs in
resource-constrained devices (edge, mobile, IoT) is difficult due to their
large size. To overcome the issue, various approaches are considered, like
offloading part of the computation to the cloud for final inference (split
computing) or performing the inference at an intermediary layer without passing
through all layers (early exits). In this work, we propose combining both
approaches by using early exits in split computing. In our approach, we decide
up to what depth of DNNs computation to perform on the device (splitting layer)
and whether a sample can exit from this layer or need to be offloaded. The
decisions are based on a weighted combination of accuracy, computational, and
communication costs. We develop an algorithm named SplitEE to learn an optimal
policy. Since pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains where the
ground truths may be unavailable and samples arrive in a streaming fashion,
SplitEE works in an online and unsupervised setup. We extensively perform
experiments on five different datasets. SplitEE achieves a significant cost
reduction ($&gt;50\%$) with a slight drop in accuracy ($&lt;2\%$) as compared to the
case when all samples are inferred at the final layer. The anonymized source
code is available at
\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SplitEE_M-B989/README.md}.

<p class="mathjax">Pathological myopia (PM) is the leading ocular disease for impaired vision
and blindness worldwide. The key to detecting PM as early as possible is to
detect informative features in global and local lesion regions, such as fundus
tessellation, atrophy and maculopathy. However, applying classical
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently highlight global and local
lesion context information in feature maps is quite challenging. To tackle this
issue, we aim to fully leverage the potential of global and local lesion
information with attention module design. Based on this, we propose an
efficient pyramid channel attention (EPCA) module, which dynamically explores
the relative importance of global and local lesion context information in
feature maps. Then we combine the EPCA module with the backbone network to
construct EPCA-Net for automatic PM detection based on fundus images. In
addition, we construct a PM dataset termed PM-fundus by collecting fundus
images of PM from publicly available datasets (e.g., the PALM dataset and ODIR
dataset). The comprehensive experiments are conducted on three datasets,
demonstrating that our EPCA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
detecting PM. Furthermore, motivated by the recent pretraining-and-finetuning
paradigm, we attempt to adapt pre-trained natural image models for PM detection
by freezing them and treating the EPCA module and other attention modules as
the adapters. The results show that our method with the
pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm achieves competitive performance through
comparisons to part of methods with traditional fine-tuning methods with fewer
tunable parameters.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a new task of Text Expansion (TE), which aims to insert
fine-grained modifiers into proper locations of the plain text to concretize or
vivify human writings. Different from existing insertion-based writing
assistance tasks, TE requires the model to be more flexible in both locating
and generation, and also more cautious in keeping basic semantics. We leverage
four complementary approaches to construct a dataset with 12 million
automatically generated instances and 2K human-annotated references for both
English and Chinese. To facilitate automatic evaluation, we design various
metrics from multiple perspectives. In particular, we propose Info-Gain to
effectively measure the informativeness of expansions, which is an important
quality dimension in TE. On top of a pre-trained text-infilling model, we build
both pipelined and joint Locate&amp;Infill models, which demonstrate the
superiority over the Text2Text baselines, especially in expansion
informativeness. Experiments verify the feasibility of the TE task and point
out potential directions for future research toward better automatic text
expansion.

idea of the presented approach is to select a representative paragraph from a
source text file, embed it to a vector space by a pre-trained fine-tuned
transformer, and classify the embedded vector according to its relevance to a
target ontology. We have considered different classifiers to categorize the
output from the transformer, in particular random forest, support vector
machine, multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, and Gaussian process
classifiers. Their suitability has been evaluated in a use case with ontologies
and scientific texts concerning catalysis research. From results we can say the
worst results have random forest. The best results in this task brought support
vector machine classifier.

<p class="mathjax">Design of process control scheme is critical for quality assurance to reduce
variations in manufacturing systems. Taking semiconductor manufacturing as an
example, extensive literature focuses on control optimization based on certain
process models (usually linear models), which are obtained by experiments
before a manufacturing process starts. However, in real applications,
pre-defined models may not be accurate, especially for a complex manufacturing
system. To tackle model inaccuracy, we propose a model-free reinforcement
learning (MFRL) approach to conduct experiments and optimize control
simultaneously according to real-time data. Specifically, we design a novel
MFRL control scheme by updating the distribution of disturbances using Bayesian
inference to reduce their large variations during manufacturing processes. As a
result, the proposed MFRL controller is demonstrated to perform well in a
nonlinear chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process when the process
model is unknown. Theoretical properties are also guaranteed when disturbances
are additive. The numerical studies also demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our methodology.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate a new paradigm that uses differentiable SLAM architectures in
a self-supervised manner to train end-to-end deep learning models in various
LiDAR based applications. To the best of our knowledge there does not exist any
work that leverages SLAM as a training signal for deep learning based models.
We explore new ways to improve the efficiency, robustness, and adaptability of
LiDAR systems with deep learning techniques. We focus on the potential benefits
of differentiable SLAM architectures for improving performance of deep learning
tasks such as classification, regression as well as SLAM. Our experimental
results demonstrate a non-trivial increase in the performance of two deep
learning applications - Ground Level Estimation and Dynamic to Static LiDAR
Translation, when used with differentiable SLAM architectures. Overall, our
findings provide important insights that enhance the performance of LiDAR based
navigation systems. We demonstrate that this new paradigm of using SLAM Loss

<p class="mathjax">The design of controllers from data for nonlinear systems is a challenging
problem. In a recent paper, De Persis, Rotulo and Tesi, "Learning controllers
from data via approximate nonlinearity cancellation," IEEE Transactions on
Automatic Control, 2023, a method to learn controllers that make the
closed-loop system stable and dominantly linear was proposed. The approach
leads to a simple solution based on data-dependent semidefinite programs. The
method uses input-state measurements as data, while in a realistic setup it is
more likely that only input-output measurements are available. In this note we
report how the design principle of the above mentioned paper can be adjusted to
deal with input-output data and obtain dynamic output feedback controllers in a
favourable setting.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Neural Gradient Learning (NGL), a deep learning approach to learn
gradient vectors with consistent orientation from 3D point clouds for normal
estimation. It has excellent gradient approximation properties for the
underlying geometry of the data. We utilize a simple neural network to
parameterize the objective function to produce gradients at points using a
global implicit representation. However, the derived gradients usually drift
away from the ground-truth oriented normals due to the lack of local detail
descriptions. Therefore, we introduce Gradient Vector Optimization (GVO) to
learn an angular distance field based on local plane geometry to refine the
coarse gradient vectors. Finally, we formulate our method with a two-phase
pipeline of coarse estimation followed by refinement. Moreover, we integrate
two weighting functions, i.e., anisotropic kernel and inlier score, into the
optimization to improve the robust and detail-preserving performance. Our
method efficiently conducts global gradient approximation while achieving
better accuracy and generalization ability of local feature description. This
leads to a state-of-the-art normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers
and point density variations. Extensive evaluations show that our method
outperforms previous works in both unoriented and oriented normal estimation on
widely used benchmarks. The source code and pre-trained models are available at
https://github.com/LeoQLi/NGLO.

evaluate robotics computing performance across a diverse range of hardware
platforms using ROS 2 as its common baseline. The suite encompasses ROS 2
packages covering the full robotics pipeline and integrates two distinct
benchmarking approaches: black-box testing, which measures performance by
eliminating upper layers and replacing them with a test application, and
grey-box testing, an application-specific measure that observes internal system
states with minimal interference. Our benchmarking framework provides
ready-to-use tools and is easily adaptable for the assessment of custom ROS 2
computational graphs. Drawing from the knowledge of leading robot architects
and system architecture experts, RobotPerf establishes a standardized approach
to robotics benchmarking. As an open-source initiative, RobotPerf remains
committed to evolving with community input to advance the future of
hardware-accelerated robotics.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this study is to formally express awareness for modeling practical
agent communication. The notion of awareness has been proposed as a set of
propositions for each agent, to which he/she pays attention, and has
contributed to avoiding \textit{logical omniscience}. However, when an agent
guesses another agent's knowledge states, what matters are not propositions but
are accessible possible worlds. Therefore, we introduce a partition of possible
worlds connected to awareness, that is an equivalence relation, to denote
\textit{indistinguishable} worlds. Our logic is called Awareness Logic with
Partition ($\mathcal{ALP}$). In this paper, we first show a running example to
illustrate a practical social game. Thereafter, we introduce syntax and Kripke
semantics of the logic and prove its completeness. Finally, we outline an idea
to incorporate some epistemic actions with dynamic operators that change the
state of awareness.

<p class="mathjax">The transformation to Industry 4.0 changes the way embedded software systems
are developed. Digital twins have the potential for cost-effective software
development and maintenance strategies. With reduced costs and faster
development cycles, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have the chance to
grow with new smart products. We interviewed SMEs about their current
development processes. In this paper, we present the first results of these
interviews. First results show that real-time requirements prevent, to date, a
Software-in-the-Loop development approach, due to a lack of proper tooling.
Security/safety concerns, and the accessibility of hardware are the main
impediments. Only temporary access to the hardware leads to
Software-in-the-Loop development approaches based on simulations/emulators.
Yet, this is not in all use cases possible. All interviewees see the potential
of Software-in-the-Loop approaches and digital twins with regard to quality and
customization. One reason it will take some effort to convince engineers, is
the conservative nature of the embedded community, particularly in SMEs.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Gaussian processes have been utilized to model the vector field of
continuous dynamical systems. Bayesian inference for such models
\cite{hegde2022variational} has been extensively studied and has been applied
in tasks such as time series prediction, providing uncertain estimates.
However, previous Gaussian Process Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models
may underperform on datasets with non-Gaussian process priors, as their
constrained priors and mean-field posteriors may lack flexibility. To address
this limitation, we incorporate normalizing flows to reparameterize the vector
field of ODEs, resulting in a more flexible and expressive prior distribution.
Additionally, due to the analytically tractable probability density functions
of normalizing flows, we apply them to the posterior inference of GP ODEs,
generating a non-Gaussian posterior. Through these dual applications of
normalizing flows, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for
Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data,
including tasks such as time series prediction and missing data recovery.
Experimental results indicate that our proposed method effectively captures
model uncertainty while improving accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Sound event localization and detection (SELD) systems estimate
direction-of-arrival (DOA) and temporal activation for sets of target classes.
Neural network (NN)-based SELD systems have performed well in various sets of
target classes, but they only output the DOA and temporal activation of preset
classes that are trained before inference. To customize target classes after
training, we tackle zero- and few-shot SELD tasks, in which we set new classes
with a text sample or a few audio samples. While zero-shot sound classification
tasks are achievable by embedding from contrastive language-audio pretraining
(CLAP), zero-shot SELD tasks require assigning an activity and a DOA to each
embedding, especially in overlapping cases. To tackle the assignment problem in
overlapping cases, we propose an embed-ACCDOA model, which is trained to output
track-wise CLAP embedding and corresponding activity-coupled Cartesian
direction-of-arrival (ACCDOA). In our experimental evaluations on zero- and
few-shot SELD tasks, the embed-ACCDOA model showed a better location-dependent
scores than a straightforward combination of the CLAP audio encoder and a DOA
estimation model. Moreover, the proposed combination of the embed-ACCDOA model
and CLAP audio encoder with zero- or few-shot samples performed comparably to
an official baseline system trained with complete train data in an evaluation

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of
CapsuleBot, a compact hybrid aerial-ground vehicle designed for long-term
covert reconnaissance. CapsuleBot combines the manoeuvrability of bicopter in
the air with the energy efficiency and noise reduction of ground vehicles on
the ground. To accomplish this, a structure named actuated-wheel-rotor has been
designed, utilizing a sole motor for both the unilateral rotor tilting in the
bicopter configuration and the wheel movement in ground mode. CapsuleBot comes
equipped with two of these structures, enabling it to attain hybrid
aerial-ground propulsion with just four motors. Importantly, the decoupling of
motion modes is achieved without the need for additional drivers, enhancing the
versatility and robustness of the system. Furthermore, we have designed the
full dynamics and control for aerial and ground locomotion based on the
bicopter model and the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle model. The
performance of CapsuleBot has been validated through experiments. The results
demonstrate that CapsuleBot produces 40.53% less noise in ground mode and
consumes 99.35% less energy, highlighting its potential for long-term covert
reconnaissance applications.

<p class="mathjax">Information freshness has attracted increasingly attention in the past decade
as it plays a critical role in the emerging real-time applications. Age of
information (AoI) holds the promise of effectively characterizing the
information freshness, hence widely considered as a fundamental performance
metric. However, in multiple-device scenarios, most existing works focus on the
analysis and optimization of AoI based on queueing systems. The study for a
unified approach for general multiple access control scheme in
freshness-oriented scenarios remains open. In this paper, we take into
consideration the combination of the fundamental freshness metric AoI and
multiple access control schemes to achieve efficient cross-layer analysis and
optimization in freshness-oriented scenarios, which is referred to as fresh
multiple access. To this end, we build a unified framework with a discrete-time
tandem queue model for fresh multiple access. The unified framework enables the
analysis and optimization for general multiple access protocols in fresh
multiple access. To handle the high dimension framework embedded in fresh
multiple access, we introduce large model approaches for the Markov chain
formulation in AoI oriented scenarios. Two typical AoI-based metric are studied
including age of incorrect information (AoII) and peak AoII. Moreover, to
address the computational complexity of the large model, we present mean-field
approximations which significantly reduces the dimension of the Markov chain
model by approximating the integral affect of massive devices in fresh multiple
access.

<p class="mathjax">A Hamiltonian path (a Hamiltonian cycle) in a graph is a path (a cycle,
respectively) that traverses all of its vertices. The problems of deciding
their existence in an input graph are well-known to be NP-complete, in fact,
they belong to the first problems shown to be computationally hard when the
theory of NP-completeness was being developed. A lot of research has been
devoted to the complexity of Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle problems
for special graph classes, yet only a handful of positive results are known.
The complexities of both of these problems have been open even for $4K_1$-free
graphs, i.e., graphs of independence number at most $3$. We answer this
question in the general setting of graphs of bounded independence number.
<br />We also consider a newly introduced problem called
\emph{Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage} which is related to the notions of a path
cover and of a linkage in a graph. This problem asks if given $\ell$ pairs of
vertices in an input graph can be connected by disjoint paths that altogether
traverse all vertices of the graph. For $\ell=1$, Hamiltonian-1-Linkage asks
for existence of a Hamiltonian path connecting a given pair of vertices. Our
main result reads that for every pair of integers $k$ and $\ell$, the
Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage problem is polynomial time solvable for graphs of
independence number not exceeding $k$. We further complement this general
polynomial time algorithm by a structural description of obstacles to
Hamiltonicity in graphs of independence number at most $k$ for small values of
$k$.

<p class="mathjax">Critical infrastructure systems - for which high reliability and availability
are paramount - must operate securely. Attack trees (ATs) are hierarchical
diagrams that offer a flexible modelling language used to assess how systems
can be attacked. ATs are widely employed both in industry and academia but - in
spite of their popularity - little work has been done to give practitioners
instruments to formulate queries on ATs in an understandable yet powerful way.
In this paper we fill this gap by presenting ATM, a logic to express
quantitative security properties on ATs. ATM allows for the specification of
properties involved with security metrics that include "cost", "probability"
and "skill" and permits the formulation of insightful what-if scenarios. To
showcase its potential, we apply ATM to the case study of a CubeSAT, presenting
three different ways in which an attacker can compromise its availability. We
showcase property specification on the corresponding attack tree and we present
theory and algorithms - based on binary decision diagrams - to check properties
and compute metrics of ATM-formulae.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting firearms and accurately localizing individuals carrying them in
images or videos is of paramount importance in security, surveillance, and
content customization. However, this task presents significant challenges in
complex environments due to clutter and the diverse shapes of firearms. To
address this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages human-firearm
interaction information, which provides valuable clues for localizing firearm
carriers. Our approach incorporates an attention mechanism that effectively
distinguishes humans and firearms from the background by focusing on relevant
areas. Additionally, we introduce a saliency-driven locality-preserving
constraint to learn essential features while preserving foreground information
in the input image. By combining these components, our approach achieves
exceptional results on a newly proposed dataset. To handle inputs of varying
sizes, we pass paired human-firearm instances with attention masks as channels
through a deep network for feature computation, utilizing an adaptive average
pooling layer. We extensively evaluate our approach against existing methods in
human-object interaction detection and achieve significant results (AP=77.8\%)
compared to the baseline approach (AP=63.1\%). This demonstrates the
effectiveness of leveraging attention mechanisms and saliency-driven locality
preservation for accurate human-firearm interaction detection. Our findings
contribute to advancing the fields of security and surveillance, enabling more
efficient firearm localization and identification in diverse scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory forecasting has become an interesting research area driven by
advancements in wearable sensing technology. Sensors can be seamlessly
integrated into clothing using cutting-edge electronic textiles technology,
allowing long-term recording of human movements outside the laboratory.
Motivated by the recent findings that clothing-attached sensors can achieve
higher activity recognition accuracy than body-attached sensors, this work
investigates motion prediction and trajectory forecasting using rigid-attached
and clothing-attached sensors. The future trajectory is forecasted from the
probabilistic trajectory model formulated by left-to-right hidden Markov model
(LR-HMM) and motion prediction accuracy is computed by the classification rule.
Surprisingly, the results show that clothing-attached sensors can forecast the
future trajectory and have better performance than body-attached sensors in
terms of motion prediction accuracy. In some cases, the clothing-attached
sensor can enhance accuracy by 45% compared to the body-attached sensor and
requires approximately 80% less duration of the historical trajectory to
achieve the same level of accuracy as the body-attached sensor.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a reduced algorithm to the classical projection method
for the solution of $d$-dimensional quasiperiodic problems, particularly
Schr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problems. Using the properties of the
Schr\"{o}dinger operator in higher-dimensional space via a projection matrix of
size $d\times n$, we rigorously prove that the generalized Fourier coefficients
of the eigenfunctions decay exponentially along a fixed direction associated
with the projection matrix. An efficient reduction strategy of the basis space
is then proposed to reduce the degrees of freedom from $O(N^{n})$ to
$O(N^{n-d}D^d)$, where $N$ is the number of Fourier grids in one dimension and
the truncation coefficient $D$ is much less than $N$. Correspondingly, the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm for solving the first $k$
eigenpairs using the Krylov subspace method decreases from $O(kN^{2n})$ to
$O(kN^{2(n-d)}D^{2d})$. Rigorous error estimates of the proposed reduced
projection method are provided, indicating that a small $D$ is sufficient to
achieve the same level of accuracy as the classical projection method. We
present numerical examples of quasiperiodic Schr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problems
in one and two dimensions to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Tensor data represents a multidimensional array. Regression methods based on
low-rank tensor decomposition leverage structural information to reduce the
parameter count. Multilinear logistic regression serves as a powerful tool for
the analysis of multidimensional data. To improve its efficacy and
interpretability, we present a Multilinear Sparse Logistic Regression model
with $\ell_0$-constraints ($\ell_0$-MLSR). In contrast to the $\ell_1$-norm and
$\ell_2$-norm, the $\ell_0$-norm constraint is better suited for feature
selection. However, due to its nonconvex and nonsmooth properties, solving it
is challenging and convergence guarantees are lacking. Additionally, the
multilinear operation in $\ell_0$-MLSR also brings non-convexity. To tackle
these challenges, we propose an Accelerated Proximal Alternating Linearized
Minimization with Adaptive Momentum (APALM$^+$) method to solve the
$\ell_0$-MLSR model. We provide a proof that APALM$^+$ can ensure the
convergence of the objective function of $\ell_0$-MLSR. We also demonstrate
that APALM$^+$ is globally convergent to a first-order critical point as well
as establish convergence rate by using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property.
Empirical results obtained from synthetic and real-world datasets validate the
superior performance of our algorithm in terms of both accuracy and speed
compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Information technology organizations and companies are seeking greener
alternatives to traditional terrestrial data centers to mitigate global warming
and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, terrestrial data centers consume a
significant amount of energy, estimated at about 1.5% of worldwide electricity
use. Furthermore, the increasing demand for data-intensive applications is
expected to raise energy consumption, making it crucial to consider sustainable
computing paradigms. In this study, we propose a data center-enabled High
Altitude Platform (HAP) system, where a flying data center supports the
operation of terrestrial data centers. We conduct a detailed analytical study
to assess the energy benefits and communication requirements of this approach.
Our findings demonstrate that a data center-enabled HAP is more
energy-efficient than a traditional terrestrial data center, owing to the
naturally low temperature in the stratosphere and the ability to harvest solar
energy. Adopting a data center-HAP can save up to 14% of energy requirements
while overcoming the offloading outage problem and the associated delay
resulting from server distribution. Our study highlights the potential of a
data center-enabled HAP system as a sustainable computing solution to meet the
growing energy demands and reduce carbon footprint.

<p class="mathjax">Next-generation mobile networks promise to support high throughput, massive
connectivity, and improved energy efficiency. To achieve these ambitious goals,
extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) and terahertz communications
constitute a pair of promising technologies. This will result in future
wireless communications occurring in the near-field regions. To accurately
portray the channel characteristics of near-field wireless propagation,
spherical wavefront-based models are required and present both opportunities as
well as challenges. Following the basics of near-field communications (NFC), we
contrast it to conventional far-field communications. Moreover, we cover the
key challenges of NFC, including its channel modeling and estimation,
near-field beamfocusing, as well as hardware design. Our numerical results
demonstrate the potential of NFC in improving the spatial multiplexing gain and
positioning accuracy. Finally, a suite of open issues are identified for

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are commonly used for automated medical image
segmentation, but models will frequently struggle to generalize well across
different imaging modalities. This issue is particularly problematic due to the
limited availability of annotated data, making it difficult to deploy these
models on a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new
semi-supervised training strategy called MoDATTS. Our approach is designed for
accurate cross-modality 3D tumor segmentation on unpaired bi-modal datasets. An
image-to-image translation strategy between imaging modalities is used to
produce annotated pseudo-target volumes and improve generalization to the
unannotated target modality. We also use powerful vision transformer
architectures and introduce an iterative self-training procedure to further
close the domain gap between modalities. MoDATTS additionally allows the
possibility to extend the training to unannotated target data by exploiting
image-level labels with an unsupervised objective that encourages the model to
perform 3D diseased-to-healthy translation by disentangling tumors from the
background. The proposed model achieves superior performance compared to other
methods from participating teams in the CrossMoDA 2022 challenge, as evidenced
by its reported top Dice score of 0.87+/-0.04 for the VS segmentation. MoDATTS
also yields consistent improvements in Dice scores over baselines on a
cross-modality brain tumor segmentation task composed of four different
contrasts from the BraTS 2020 challenge dataset, where 95% of a target
supervised model performance is reached. We report that 99% and 100% of this
maximum performance can be attained if 20% and 50% of the target data is
additionally annotated, which further demonstrates that MoDATTS can be
leveraged to reduce the annotation burden.

<p class="mathjax">When transferring a Deep Reinforcement Learning model from simulation to the
real world, the performance could be unsatisfactory since the simulation cannot
imitate the real world well in many circumstances. This results in a long
period of fine-tuning in the real world. This paper proposes a self-supervised
vision-based DRL method that allows robots to pick and place objects
effectively and efficiently when directly transferring a training model from
simulation to the real world. A height-sensitive action policy is specially
designed for the proposed method to deal with crowded and stacked objects in
challenging environments. The training model with the proposed approach can be
applied directly to a real suction task without any fine-tuning from the real
world while maintaining a high suction success rate. It is also validated that
our model can be deployed to suction novel objects in a real experiment with a
suction success rate of 90\% without any real-world fine-tuning. The

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancements in transformer-based visual trackers have led to
significant progress, attributed to their strong modeling capabilities.
However, as performance improves, running latency correspondingly increases,
presenting a challenge for real-time robotics applications, especially on edge
devices with computational constraints. In response to this, we introduce
LiteTrack, an efficient transformer-based tracking model optimized for
high-speed operations across various devices. It achieves a more favorable
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than the other lightweight trackers.
The main innovations of LiteTrack encompass: 1) asynchronous feature extraction
and interaction between the template and search region for better feature
fushion and cutting redundant computation, and 2) pruning encoder layers from a
heavy tracker to refine the balnace between performance and speed. As an
example, our fastest variant, LiteTrack-B4, achieves 65.2% AO on the GOT-10k
benchmark, surpassing all preceding efficient trackers, while running over 100
fps with ONNX on the Jetson Orin NX edge device. Moreover, our LiteTrack-B9
reaches competitive 72.2% AO on GOT-10k and 82.4% AUC on TrackingNet, and
operates at 171 fps on an NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU. The code and demo materials will
be available at https://github.com/TsingWei/LiteTrack.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, data-driven techniques have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness
in addressing challenges related to MR imaging inverse problems. However, these
methods still exhibit certain limitations in terms of interpretability and
robustness. In response, we introduce Convex Latent-Optimized Adversarial
Regularizers (CLEAR), a novel and interpretable data-driven paradigm. CLEAR
represents a fusion of deep learning (DL) and variational regularization.
Specifically, we employ a latent optimization technique to adversarially train
an input convex neural network, and its set of minima can fully represent the
real data manifold. We utilize it as a convex regularizer to formulate a
CLEAR-informed variational regularization model that guides the solution of the
imaging inverse problem on the real data manifold. Leveraging its inherent
convexity, we have established the convergence of the projected subgradient
descent algorithm for the CLEAR-informed regularization model. This convergence
guarantees the attainment of a unique solution to the imaging inverse problem,
subject to certain assumptions. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the
robustness of our CLEAR-informed model, explicitly showcasing its capacity to
achieve stable reconstruction even in the presence of measurement interference.
Finally, we illustrate the superiority of our approach using MRI reconstruction
as an example. Our method consistently outperforms conventional data-driven
techniques and traditional regularization approaches, excelling in both
reconstruction quality and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">The large population of wireless users is a key driver of data-crowdsourced
Machine Learning (ML). However, data privacy remains a significant concern.
Federated Learning (FL) encourages data sharing in ML without requiring data to
leave users' devices but imposes heavy computation and communications overheads
on mobile devices. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this problem by performing
partial model aggregation at edge servers. HFL can effectively reduce energy
consumption and latency through effective resource allocation and appropriate
user assignment. Nevertheless, resource allocation in HFL involves optimizing
multiple variables, and the objective function should consider both energy
consumption and latency, making the development of resource allocation
algorithms very complicated. Moreover, it is challenging to perform user
assignment, which is a combinatorial optimization problem in a large search
space. This article proposes a spectrum resource optimization algorithm (SROA)
and a two-stage iterative algorithm (TSIA) for HFL. Given an arbitrary user
assignment pattern, SROA optimizes CPU frequency, transmit power, and bandwidth
to minimize system cost. TSIA aims to find a user assignment pattern that
considerably reduces the total system cost. Experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed HFL framework over existing studies in energy
and latency reduction.

<p class="mathjax">Generative modeling of 3D LiDAR data is an emerging task with promising
applications for autonomous mobile robots, such as scalable simulation, scene
manipulation, and sparse-to-dense completion of LiDAR point clouds. Existing
approaches have shown the feasibility of image-based LiDAR data generation
using deep generative models while still struggling with the fidelity of
generated data and training instability. In this work, we present R2DM, a novel
generative model for LiDAR data that can generate diverse and high-fidelity 3D
scene point clouds based on the image representation of range and reflectance
intensity. Our method is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs), which have demonstrated impressive results among generative model
frameworks and have been significantly progressing in recent years. To
effectively train DDPMs on the LiDAR domain, we first conduct an in-depth
analysis regarding data representation, training objective, and spatial
inductive bias. Based on our designed model R2DM, we also introduce a flexible
LiDAR completion pipeline using the powerful properties of DDPMs. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines on the generation task of
KITTI-360 and KITTI-Raw datasets and the upsampling task of KITTI-360 datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in
research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety
of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models
(LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based
applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation
approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage
the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two
datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation
model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20%
compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple
approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can
provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We
publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">Automatically evaluate the correctness of programming assignments is rather
straightforward using unit and integration tests. However, programming tasks
can be solved in multiple ways, many of which, although correct, are inelegant.
For instance, excessive branching, poor naming or repetitiveness make the code
hard to understand and maintain. These subjective qualities of code are hard to
automatically assess using current techniques. In this work we investigate the
use of CodeBERT to automatically assign quality score to Java code. We
experiment with different models and training paradigms. We explore the
accuracy of the models on a novel dataset for code quality assessment. Finally,
we assess the quality of the predictions using saliency maps. We find that code
quality to some extent is predictable and that transformer based models using
task adapted pre-training can solve the task more efficiently than other

<p class="mathjax">With the frequent use of self-supervised monocular depth estimation in
robotics and autonomous driving, the model's efficiency is becoming
increasingly important. Most current approaches apply much larger and more
complex networks to improve the precision of depth estimation. Some researchers
incorporated Transformer into self-supervised monocular depth estimation to
achieve better performance. However, this method leads to high parameters and
high computation. We present a fully convolutional depth estimation network
using contextual feature fusion. Compared to UNet++ and HRNet, we use
high-resolution and low-resolution features to reserve information on small
targets and fast-moving objects instead of long-range fusion. We further
promote depth estimation results employing lightweight channel attention based
on convolution in the decoder stage. Our method reduces the parameters without
sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
can get better results than many large models, such as Monodepth2, with only 30
parameters. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We consider the downlink of a cooperative cellular communications system,
where several base-stations around each mobile cooperate and perform
zero-forcing to reduce the received interference at the mobile. We derive
closed-form expressions for the asymptotic performance of the network as the
number of antennas per base station grows large. These expressions capture the
trade off between various system parameters, and characterize the joint effect
of noise and interference (where either noise or interference is asymptotically
dominant and where both are asymptotically relevant). The asymptotic results
are verified using Monte Carlo simulations, which indicate that they are useful
even when the number of antennas per base station is only moderately large.
Additionally, we show that when the number of antennas per base station grows
large, power allocation can be optimized locally at each base station. We hence
present a power allocation algorithm that achieves near optimal performance
while significantly reducing the coordination overhead between base stations.
The presented analysis is significantly more challenging than the uplink
analysis, due to the dependence between beamforming vectors of nearby base
stations. This statistical dependence is handled by introducing novel bounds on
marked shot-noise point processes with dependent marks, which are also useful
in other contexts.

<p class="mathjax">The expansion of online social media platforms has led to a surge in online
content consumption. However, this has also paved the way for disseminating
false claims and misinformation. As a result, there is an escalating demand for
a substantial workforce to sift through and validate such unverified claims.
Currently, these claims are manually verified by fact-checkers. Still, the
volume of online content often outweighs their potency, making it difficult for
them to validate every single claim in a timely manner. Thus, it is critical to
determine which assertions are worth fact-checking and prioritize claims that
require immediate attention. Multiple factors contribute to determining whether
a claim necessitates fact-checking, encompassing factors such as its factual
correctness, potential impact on the public, the probability of inciting
hatred, and more. Despite several efforts to address claim check-worthiness, a
systematic approach to identify these factors remains an open challenge. To
this end, we introduce a new task of fine-grained claim check-worthiness, which
underpins all of these factors and provides probable human grounds for
identifying a claim as check-worthy. We present CheckIt, a manually annotated
large Twitter dataset for fine-grained claim check-worthiness. We benchmark our
dataset against a unified approach, CheckMate, that jointly determines whether
a claim is check-worthy and the factors that led to that conclusion. We compare
our suggested system with several baseline systems. Finally, we report a
thorough analysis of results and human assessment, validating the efficacy of
integrating check-worthiness factors in detecting claims worth fact-checking.

these issues, we turn to the recently proposed parameter-efficient tuning
methods, such as VPT, which updates only the newly added prompt parameters
while keeping the pre-trained backbone frozen. Inspired by VPT, we propose the
Meta Visual Prompt Tuning (MVP) method. Specifically, we integrate the VPT
method into the meta-learning framework and tailor it to the remote sensing
domain, resulting in an efficient framework for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene
Classification (FS-RSSC). Furthermore, we introduce a novel data augmentation
strategy based on patch embedding recombination to enhance the representation
and diversity of scenes for classification purposes. Experiment results on the
FS-RSSC benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MVP over
existing methods in various settings, such as various-way-various-shot,
various-way-one-shot, and cross-domain adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems are widely used to provide personalized recommendations
to users. Recent research has shown that recommender systems may be subject to
different types of biases, such as popularity bias, leading to an uneven
distribution of recommendation exposure among producer groups. To mitigate
this, producer-centered fairness re-ranking (PFR) approaches have been proposed
to ensure equitable recommendation utility across groups. However, these
approaches overlook the harm they may cause to within-group individuals
associated with colder items, which are items with few or no interactions.
<br />This study reproduces previous PFR approaches and shows that they
significantly harm colder items, leading to a fairness gap for these items in
both advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Surprisingly, the unfair base
recommendation models were providing greater exposure opportunities to these
individual cold items, even though at the group level, they appeared to be
unfair. To address this issue, the study proposes an amendment to the PFR
approach that regulates the number of colder items recommended by the system.
This modification achieves a balance between accuracy and producer fairness
while optimizing the selection of colder items within each group, thereby
preventing or reducing harm to within-group individuals and augmenting the
novelty of all recommended items. The proposed method is able to register an
increase in sub-group fairness (SGF) from 0.3104 to 0.3782, 0.6156, and 0.9442
while also improving group-level fairness (GF) (112% and 37% with respect to
base models and traditional PFR). Moreover, the proposed method achieves these
improvements with minimal or no reduction in accuracy (or even an increase
sometimes). We evaluate the proposed method on various recommendation datasets
and demonstrate promising results independent of the underlying model or
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Localizing a moving sound source in the real world involves determining its
direction-of-arrival (DOA) and distance relative to a microphone. Advancements
in DOA estimation have been facilitated by data-driven methods optimized with
large open-source datasets with microphone array recordings in diverse
environments. In contrast, estimating a sound source's distance remains
understudied. Existing approaches assume recordings by non-coincident
microphones to use methods that are susceptible to differences in room
reverberation. We present a CRNN able to estimate the distance of moving sound
sources across multiple datasets featuring diverse rooms, outperforming a
recently-published approach. We also characterize our model's performance as a
function of sound source distance and different training losses. This analysis
reveals optimal training using a loss that weighs model errors as an inverse
function of the sound source true distance. Our study is the first to
demonstrate that sound source distance estimation can be performed across
diverse acoustic conditions using deep learning.

<p class="mathjax">Operating systems provide an abstraction layer between the hardware and
higher-level software. Many abstractions, such as threads, processes,
containers, and virtual machines, are mechanisms to provide isolation. New
application scenarios frequently introduce new isolation mechanisms.
Implementing each isolation mechanism as an independent abstraction makes it
difficult to reason about the state and resources shared among different tasks,
leading to security vulnerabilities and performance interference. We present
OSmosis, an isolation model that expresses the precise level of resource
sharing, a framework in which to implement isolation mechanisms based on the
model, and an implementation of the framework on seL4. The OSmosis model lets
the user determine the degree of isolation guarantee that they need from the
system. This determination empowers developers to make informed decisions about
isolation and performance trade-offs, and the framework enables them to create
mechanisms with the desired degree of isolation.

<p class="mathjax">Gestures are non-verbal but important behaviors accompanying people's speech.
While previous methods are able to generate speech rhythm-synchronized
gestures, the semantic context of the speech is generally lacking in the
gesticulations. Although semantic gestures do not occur very regularly in human
speech, they are indeed the key for the audience to understand the speech
context in a more immersive environment. Hence, we introduce LivelySpeaker, a
framework that realizes semantics-aware co-speech gesture generation and offers
several control handles. In particular, our method decouples the task into two
stages: script-based gesture generation and audio-guided rhythm refinement.
Specifically, the script-based gesture generation leverages the pre-trained
CLIP text embeddings as the guidance for generating gestures that are highly
semantically aligned with the script. Then, we devise a simple but effective
diffusion-based gesture generation backbone simply using pure MLPs, that is
conditioned on only audio signals and learns to gesticulate with realistic
motions. We utilize such powerful prior to rhyme the script-guided gestures
with the audio signals, notably in a zero-shot setting. Our novel two-stage
generation framework also enables several applications, such as changing the
gesticulation style, editing the co-speech gestures via textual prompting, and
controlling the semantic awareness and rhythm alignment with guided diffusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over
competing methods. In addition, our core diffusion-based generative model also
achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. The code and model
will be released to facilitate future research.

<p class="mathjax">Achieving accurate, efficient, and consistent localization within an a priori
environment map remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and computer
vision. Conventional map-based keyframe localization often suffers from
sub-optimal viewpoints due to limited field of view (FOV), thus degrading its
performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we design a real-time
tightly-coupled Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-aided visual-inertial navigation
system (VINS), termed NeRF-VINS. By effectively leveraging NeRF's potential to
synthesize novel views, essential for addressing limited viewpoints, the
proposed NeRF-VINS optimally fuses IMU and monocular image measurements along
with synthetically rendered images within an efficient filter-based framework.
This tightly coupled integration enables 3D motion tracking with bounded error.
We extensively compare the proposed NeRF-VINS against the state-of-the-art
methods that use prior map information, which is shown to achieve superior
performance. We also demonstrate the proposed method is able to perform
real-time estimation at 15 Hz, on a resource-constrained Jetson AGX Orin
embedded platform with impressive accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Subsampling is effective in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) for reducing
overfitting caused by the sparsity in Knowledge Graph (KG) datasets. However,
current subsampling approaches consider only frequencies of queries that
consist of entities and their relations. Thus, the existing subsampling
potentially underestimates the appearance probabilities of infrequent queries
even if the frequencies of their entities or relations are high. To address
this problem, we propose Model-based Subsampling (MBS) and Mixed Subsampling
(MIX) to estimate their appearance probabilities through predictions of KGE
models. Evaluation results on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 showed
that our proposed subsampling methods actually improved the KG completion
performances for popular KGE models, RotatE, TransE, HAKE, ComplEx, and

<p class="mathjax">The ability to detect objects in all lighting (i.e., normal-, over-, and
under-exposed) conditions is crucial for real-world applications, such as
self-driving.Traditional RGB-based detectors often fail under such varying
lighting conditions.Therefore, recent works utilize novel event cameras to
supplement or guide the RGB modality; however, these methods typically adopt
asymmetric network structures that rely predominantly on the RGB modality,
resulting in limited robustness for all-day detection. In this paper, we
propose EOLO, a novel object detection framework that achieves robust and
efficient all-day detection by fusing both RGB and event modalities. Our EOLO
framework is built based on a lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) to
efficiently leverage the asynchronous property of events. Buttressed by it, we
first introduce an Event Temporal Attention (ETA) module to learn the high
temporal information from events while preserving crucial edge information.
Secondly, as different modalities exhibit varying levels of importance under
diverse lighting conditions, we propose a novel Symmetric RGB-Event Fusion
(SREF) module to effectively fuse RGB-Event features without relying on a
specific modality, thus ensuring a balanced and adaptive fusion for all-day
detection. In addition, to compensate for the lack of paired RGB-Event datasets
for all-day training and evaluation, we propose an event synthesis approach
based on the randomized optical flow that allows for directly generating the
event frame from a single exposure image. We further build two new datasets,
E-MSCOCO and E-VOC based on the popular benchmarks MSCOCO and PASCAL VOC.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EOLO outperforms the
state-of-the-art detectors,e.g.,RENet,by a substantial margin (+3.74% mAP50) in
all lighting conditions.Our code and datasets will be available at

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of IT operations, it has become increasingly
crucial to efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of data for practical
applications. The techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown
remarkable capabilities for various tasks, including named entity recognition,
machine translation and dialogue systems. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have achieved significant improvements across various NLP downstream
tasks. However, there is a lack of specialized LLMs for IT operations. In this
paper, we introduce the OWL, a large language model trained on our collected
OWL-Instruct dataset with a wide range of IT-related information, where the
mixture-of-adapter strategy is proposed to improve the parameter-efficient
tuning across different domains or tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of our OWL on the OWL-Bench established by us and open IT-related
benchmarks. OWL demonstrates superior performance results on IT tasks, which
outperforms existing models by significant margins. Moreover, we hope that the
findings of our work will provide more insights to revolutionize the techniques
of IT operations with specialized LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Argument mining is to analyze argument structure and extract important
argument information from unstructured text. An argument mining system can help
people automatically gain causal and logical information behind the text. As
argumentative corpus gradually increases, like more people begin to argue and
debate on social media, argument mining from them is becoming increasingly
critical. However, argument mining is still a big challenge in natural language
tasks due to its difficulty, and relative techniques are not mature. For
example, research on non-tree argument mining needs to be done more. Most works
just focus on extracting tree structure argument information. Moreover, current
methods cannot accurately describe and capture argument relations and do not
predict their types. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model called
AutoAM to solve these problems. We first introduce the argument component
attention mechanism in our model. It can capture the relevant information
between argument components, so our model can better perform argument mining.
Our model is a universal end-to-end framework, which can analyze argument
structure without constraints like tree structure and complete three subtasks
of argument mining in one model. The experiment results show that our model
outperforms the existing works on several metrics in two public datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The current interacting hand (IH) datasets are relatively simplistic in terms
of background and texture, with hand joints being annotated by a machine
annotator, which may result in inaccuracies, and the diversity of pose
distribution is limited. However, the variability of background, pose
distribution, and texture can greatly influence the generalization ability.
Therefore, we present a large-scale synthetic dataset RenderIH for interacting
hands with accurate and diverse pose annotations. The dataset contains 1M
photo-realistic images with varied backgrounds, perspectives, and hand
textures. To generate natural and diverse interacting poses, we propose a new
pose optimization algorithm. Additionally, for better pose estimation accuracy,
we introduce a transformer-based pose estimation network, TransHand, to
leverage the correlation between interacting hands and verify the effectiveness
of RenderIH in improving results. Our dataset is model-agnostic and can improve
more accuracy of any hand pose estimation method in comparison to other real or
synthetic datasets. Experiments have shown that pretraining on our synthetic
data can significantly decrease the error from 6.76mm to 5.79mm, and our
Transhand surpasses contemporary methods. Our dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/adwardlee/RenderIH.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of communication technologies and extended reality
(XR), the services and applications of the Metaverse are gradually entering our
lives. However, the current development of the Metaverse provides users with
services that are homogeneous with the user experience that the Internet has
brought in the past, making them more like an extension of the Internet. In
addition, as a mobile application carrier for the Metaverse, it is also worth
considering how vehicles with diverse onboard components can develop in synergy
with the Metaverse. In this article, we focus on the core of the Metaverse,
namely user experience, and provide a road map from Metaverse to Metaverse
vehicles (Metavehicles). Specifically, we first elaborate on six features of
the Metaverse from the perspective of user experience and propose a
hierarchical framework for the Metaverse based on the evolutionary logic of the
features. Under the guidance of this framework, we discuss the empowerment of
onboard components of Metavehicles on the development of the Metaverse, and
analyze the service experience that Metavehicles can bring to two types of
users, namely drivers and passengers. Finally, considering the differentiated
development levels of Metaverse and autonomous driving, we further establish a
hierarchical framework for Metavehicles from three aspects (i.e., enhance
Metaverse, enhance driving experience, and enhance entertainment experience),
providing an evolutionary path for the development of Metavehicles.

<p class="mathjax">Powerful manipulation techniques have made digital image forgeries be easily
created and widespread without leaving visual anomalies. The blind localization
of tampered regions becomes quite significant for image forensics. In this
paper, we propose an effective image tampering localization network (EITLNet)
based on a two-branch enhanced transformer encoder with attention-based feature
fusion. Specifically, a feature enhancement module is designed to enhance the
feature representation ability of the transformer encoder. The features
extracted from RGB and noise streams are fused effectively by the coordinate
attention-based fusion module at multiple scales. Extensive experimental
results verify that the proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art
generalization ability and robustness in various benchmark datasets. Code will

<p class="mathjax">Automated program repair (APR) aims to fix software bugs without human
intervention and template-based APR has been widely investigated with promising
results. However, it is challenging for template-based APR to select the
appropriate donor code, which is an important repair ingredient for generating
candidate patches. Inappropriate donor code may cause plausible but incorrect
patch generation even with correct fix patterns, limiting the repair
performance.
<br />In this paper, we aim to revisit template-based APR, and propose GAMMA, to
directly leverage large pre-trained language models for donor code generation.
Our main insight is that instead of retrieving donor code in the local buggy
file, we can directly predict the correct code tokens based on the context code
snippets and repair patterns by a cloze task. Specifically, (1) GAMMA revises a
variety of fix templates from state-of-the-art template-based APR techniques
(i.e., TBar) and transforms them into mask patterns. (2) GAMMA adopts a
pre-trained language model to predict the correct code for masked code as a
fill-in-the-blank task. The experimental results demonstrate that GAMMA
correctly repairs 82 bugs on Defects4J-v1.2, which achieves 20.59\% (14 bugs)
and 26.15\% (17 bugs) improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
template-based approach TBar and learning-based one Recoder. Furthermore, GAMMA
repairs 45 bugs and 22 bugs from the additional Defects4J-v2.0 and QuixBugs,
indicating the generalizability of GAMMA in addressing the dataset overfitting
issue. We also prove that adopting other pre-trained language models can
provide substantial advancement, e.g., CodeBERT-based and ChatGPT-based GAMMA
is able to fix 80 and 67 bugs on Defects4J-v1.2, indicating the scalability of
GAMMA. Overall, our study highlights the promising future of adopting
pre-trained models to generate correct patches on top of fix patterns.

<p class="mathjax">Active fault tolerance is essential for robot swarms to retain long-term
autonomy. Previous work on swarm fault tolerance focuses on reacting to
electro-mechanical faults that are spontaneously injected into robot sensors
and actuators. Resolving faults once they have manifested as failures is an
inefficient approach, and there are some safety-critical scenarios in which any
kind of robot failure is unacceptable. We propose a predictive approach to
fault tolerance, based on the principle of preemptive maintenance, in which
potential faults are autonomously detected and resolved before they manifest as
failures. Our approach is shown to improve swarm performance and prevent robot
failure in the cases tested.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the prevailing progress of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) in image-to-image translation. However, the success of these
GAN models hinges on ponderous computational costs and labor-expensive training
data. Current efficient GAN learning techniques often fall into two orthogonal
aspects: i) model slimming via reduced calculation costs;
ii)data/label-efficient learning with fewer training data/labels. To combine
the best of both worlds, we propose a new learning paradigm, Unified GAN
Compression (UGC), with a unified optimization objective to seamlessly prompt
the synergy of model-efficient and label-efficient learning. UGC sets up
semi-supervised-driven network architecture search and adaptive online
semi-supervised distillation stages sequentially, which formulates a
heterogeneous mutual learning scheme to obtain an architecture-flexible,
label-efficient, and performance-excellent model.

<p class="mathjax">Many studies focus on improving pretraining or developing new backbones in
text-video retrieval. However, existing methods may suffer from the learning
and inference bias issue, as recent research suggests in other
text-video-related tasks. For instance, spatial appearance features on action
recognition or temporal object co-occurrences on video scene graph generation
could induce spurious correlations. In this work, we present a unique and
systematic study of a temporal bias due to frame length discrepancy between
training and test sets of trimmed video clips, which is the first such attempt
for a text-video retrieval task, to the best of our knowledge. We first
hypothesise and verify the bias on how it would affect the model illustrated
with a baseline study. Then, we propose a causal debiasing approach and perform
extensive experiments and ablation studies on the Epic-Kitchens-100, YouCook2,
and MSR-VTT datasets. Our model overpasses the baseline and SOTA on nDCG, a
semantic-relevancy-focused evaluation metric which proves the bias is
mitigated, as well as on the other conventional metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in technology have brought forth new forms of interactive
applications, such as the social metaverse, where end users interact with each
other through their virtual avatars. In such applications, precise full-body
tracking is essential for an immersive experience and a sense of embodiment
with the virtual avatar. However, current motion capture systems are not easily
accessible to end users due to their high cost, the requirement for special
skills to operate them, or the discomfort associated with wearable devices. In
this paper, we present MOVIN, the data-driven generative method for real-time
motion capture with global tracking, using a single LiDAR sensor. Our
autoregressive conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model learns the
distribution of pose variations conditioned on the given 3D point cloud from
LiDAR.As a central factor for high-accuracy motion capture, we propose a novel
feature encoder to learn the correlation between the historical 3D point cloud
data and global, local pose features, resulting in effective learning of the
pose prior. Global pose features include root translation, rotation, and foot
contacts, while local features comprise joint positions and rotations.
Subsequently, a pose generator takes into account the sampled latent variable
along with the features from the previous frame to generate a plausible current
pose. Our framework accurately predicts the performer's 3D global information
and local joint details while effectively considering temporally coherent
movements across frames. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture
through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, comparing it against
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement a real-time application to
showcase our method in real-world scenarios. MOVIN dataset is available at

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory generation and trajectory prediction are two critical tasks for
autonomous vehicles, which generate various trajectories during development and
predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles during operation,
respectively. However, despite significant advances in improving their
performance, it remains a challenging problem to ensure that the
generated/predicted trajectories are realistic, explainable, and physically
feasible. Existing model-based methods provide explainable results, but are
constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to
address complex scenarios. Conversely, existing deep learning-based methods
have shown great promise in learning various traffic scenarios and improving
overall performance, but they often act as opaque black boxes and lack
explainability. In this work, we integrate kinematic knowledge with neural
stochastic differential equations (SDE) and develop a variational autoencoder
based on a novel latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle
motions. Our approach combines the advantages of both model-based and deep
learning-based techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baseline approaches in producing realistic,
physically-feasible, and precisely-controllable vehicle trajectories,
benefiting both generation and prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a new active learning method for semantic segmentation.
The core of our method lies in a new annotation query design. It samples
informative local image regions (e.g., superpixels), and for each of such
regions, asks an oracle for a multi-hot vector indicating all classes existing
in the region. This multi-class labeling strategy is substantially more
efficient than existing ones like segmentation, polygon, and even dominant
class labeling in terms of annotation time per click. However, it introduces
the class ambiguity issue in training since it assigns partial labels (i.e., a
set of candidate classes) to individual pixels. We thus propose a new algorithm
for learning semantic segmentation while disambiguating the partial labels in
two stages. In the first stage, it trains a segmentation model directly with
the partial labels through two new loss functions motivated by partial label
learning and multiple instance learning. In the second stage, it disambiguates
the partial labels by generating pixel-wise pseudo labels, which are used for
supervised learning of the model. Equipped with a new acquisition function
dedicated to the multi-class labeling, our method outperformed previous work on
Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 while spending less annotation cost.

<p class="mathjax">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique cryptographic assets representing the
ownership of digital media. NFTs have soared in popularity and trading prices.
However, there exists a large gap in the literature regarding NFTs, especially
regarding the stakeholders and online communities that have formed around NFT
projects. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is one of the most influential NFT
projects. Through an observational study of online BAYC communities across
social media platforms and semi-structured interviews with four participants
who owned BAYC NFTs, we explored the experiences of NFT collectors within the
online NFT community. Positive community experiences, i.e., personal expression
and identity, mutual support among BAYC holders, and exclusive access to online
and offline events, were expressed. Encountered challenges included scams and
"cash grab" NFT projects as well as trolling. The results of this study point
towards the welcoming, positive nature of the NFT community, which is a
possible causation factor of the initial rise in popularity of NFTs.
Demotivators, on the other hand, countered the established trustworthiness of
NFT technology among its consumers.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of causal inference, the primary frameworks are the Potential
Outcome (PO) and the Structural Causal Model (SCM), both predicated on the
consistency rule. However, when facing Layer 3 valuations, i.e., counterfactual
queries that inherently belong to individual-level semantics, they both seem
inadequate due to the issue of degeneration caused by the consistency rule. For
instance, in personalized incentive scenarios within the internet industry, the
probability of one particular user being a complier, denoted as $P(y_x,
y'_{x'})$, degenerates to a parameter that can only take values of 0 or 1. This
paper leverages the DiscoSCM framework to theoretically tackle the
aforementioned counterfactual degeneration problem, which is a novel framework
for causal modeling that combines the strengths of both PO and SCM, and could
be seen as an extension of them. The paper starts with a brief introduction to
the background of causal modeling frameworks. It then illustrates, through an
example, the difficulty in recovering counterfactual parameters from data
without imposing strong assumptions. Following this, we propose the DiscoSCM
with independent potential noise framework to address this problem.
Subsequently, the superior performance of the DiscoSCM framework in answering
counterfactual questions is demonstrated by several key results in the topic of
unit select problems. We then elucidate that this superiority stems from the
philosophy of individual causality. In conclusion, we suggest that DiscoSCM may
serve as a significant milestone in the causal modeling field for addressing
counterfactual queries.

<p class="mathjax">Fishery analysis is critical in maintaining the long-term sustainability of
species and the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing for
food and income. The fishing gear, or metier, is a key factor significantly
impacting marine habitats, selectively targeting species and fish sizes.
Analysis of commercial catches or landings by metier in fishery stock
assessment and management is crucial, providing robust estimates of fishing
efforts and their impact on marine ecosystems. In this paper, we focus on a
unique data set from the Azores' fishing data collection programs between 2010
and 2017, where little information on metiers is available and sparse
throughout our timeline. Our main objective is to tackle the task of data set
reconstruction, leveraging domain knowledge and machine learning methods to
retrieve or associate metier-related information to each fish landing. We
empirically validate the feasibility of this task using a diverse set of
modeling approaches and demonstrate how it provides new insights into different
fisheries' behavior and the impact of metiers over time, which are essential
for future fish population assessments, management, and conservation efforts.

<p class="mathjax">This research paper explores the classification of knee osteoarthritis (OA)
severity levels using advanced computer vision models and augmentation
techniques. The study investigates the effectiveness of data preprocessing,
including Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and data
augmentation using diffusion models. Three experiments were conducted: training
models on the original dataset, training models on the preprocessed dataset,
and training models on the augmented dataset. The results show that data
preprocessing and augmentation significantly improve the accuracy of the
models. The EfficientNetB3 model achieved the highest accuracy of 84\% on the
augmented dataset. Additionally, attention visualization techniques, such as
Grad-CAM, are utilized to provide detailed attention maps, enhancing the
understanding and trustworthiness of the models. These findings highlight the
potential of combining advanced models with augmented data and attention
visualization for accurate knee OA severity classification.

<p class="mathjax">Dysarthria is a speech disorder that hinders communication due to
difficulties in articulating words. Detection of dysarthria is important for
several reasons as it can be used to develop a treatment plan and help improve
a person's quality of life and ability to communicate effectively. Much of the
literature focused on improving ASR systems for dysarthric speech. The
objective of the current work is to develop models that can accurately classify
the presence of dysarthria and also give information about the intelligibility
level using limited data by employing a few-shot approach using a transformer
model. This work also aims to tackle the data leakage that is present in
previous studies. Our whisper-large-v2 transformer model trained on a subset of
the UASpeech dataset containing medium intelligibility level patients achieved
an accuracy of 85%, precision of 0.92, recall of 0.8 F1-score of 0.85, and
specificity of 0.91. Experimental results also demonstrate that the model
trained using the 'words' dataset performed better compared to the model
trained on the 'letters' and 'digits' dataset. Moreover, the multiclass model
achieved an accuracy of 67%.

<p class="mathjax">WSNs are vital in a variety of applications, including environmental
monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare. WSNs are a network of
spatially scattered and dedicated sensors that monitor and record the physical
conditions of the environment.Significant obstacles to WSN efficiency include
the restricted power and processing capabilities of individual sensor nodes and
the issues with remote and inaccessible deployment sites. By maximising power
utilisation, enhancing network effectiveness, and ensuring adaptability and
durability through dispersed and decentralised operation, this study suggests a
comprehensive approach to dealing with these challenges. The suggested
methodology involves data compression, aggregation, and energy-efficient
protocol. Using these techniques, WSN lifetimes can be increased and overall
performance can be improved. In this study we also provide methods to collect
data generated by several nodes in the WSN and store it in a remote cloud such
that it can be processed and analyzed whenever it is required.

<p class="mathjax">We extend the behaviour of generic sample-based motion planners to support
obstacle avoidance during long-range path following by introducing a new
edge-cost metric paired with a curvilinear planning space. The resulting
planner generates naturally smooth paths that avoid local obstacles while
minimizing lateral path deviation to best exploit prior terrain knowledge from
the reference path. In this adaptation, we explore the nuances of planning in
the curvilinear configuration space and describe a mechanism for natural
singularity handling to improve generality. We then shift our focus to the
trajectory generation problem, proposing a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC)
architecture to best exploit our path planner for improved obstacle avoidance.
Through rigorous field robotics trials over 5 km, we compare our approach to
the more common direct path-tracking MPC method and discuss the promise of
these techniques for reliable long-term autonomous operations.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate rainfall forecasting is crucial for effective disaster preparedness
and mitigation in the North-East region of India, which is prone to extreme
weather events such as floods and landslides. In this study, we investigated
the use of two data-driven methods, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for rainfall forecasting using daily rainfall data
collected from India Meteorological Department in northeast region over a
period of 118 years. We conducted a comparative analysis of these methods to
determine their relative effectiveness in predicting rainfall patterns. Using
historical rainfall data from multiple weather stations, we trained and
validated our models to forecast future rainfall patterns. Our results indicate
that both DMD and LSTM are effective in forecasting rainfall, with LSTM
outperforming DMD in terms of accuracy, revealing that LSTM has the ability to
capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data, making it a powerful tool
for rainfall forecasting. Our findings suggest that data-driven methods such as
DMD and deep learning approaches like LSTM can significantly improve rainfall
forecasting accuracy in the North-East region of India, helping to mitigate the
impact of extreme weather events and enhance the region's resilience to climate
change.

<p class="mathjax">Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) has been an active area of
machine-learning research for over a decade. It promises to let educators grade
and give feedback on free-form responses in large-enrollment courses in spite
of limited availability of human graders. Over the years, carefully trained
models have achieved increasingly higher levels of performance. More recently,
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged as a commodity, and an
intriguing question is how a general-purpose tool without additional training
compares to specialized models. We studied the performance of GPT-4 on the
standard benchmark 2-way and 3-way datasets SciEntsBank and Beetle, where in
addition to the standard task of grading the alignment of the student answer
with a reference answer, we also investigated withholding the reference answer.
We found that overall, the performance of the pre-trained general-purpose GPT-4
LLM is comparable to hand-engineered models, but worse than pre-trained LLMs
that had specialized training.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic systems, particularly in demanding environments like narrow corridors
or disaster zones, often grapple with imperfect state estimation. Addressing
this challenge requires a trajectory plan that not only navigates these
restrictive spaces but also manages the inherent uncertainty of the system. We
present a novel approach for graph-based belief space planning via the use of
an efficient covariance control algorithm. By adaptively steering state
statistics via output state feedback, we efficiently craft a belief roadmap
characterized by nodes with controlled uncertainty and edges representing
collision-free mean trajectories. The roadmap's structured design then paves
the way for precise path searches that balance control costs and uncertainty
considerations. Our numerical experiments affirm the efficacy and advantage of
our method in different motion planning tasks. Our open-source implementation
can be found at https://github.com/hzyu17/VIMP/tree/BRM.

<p class="mathjax">Embodied agents, in the form of virtual agents or social robots, are rapidly
becoming more widespread. In human-human interactions, humans use nonverbal
behaviours to convey their attitudes, feelings, and intentions. Therefore, this
capability is also required for embodied agents in order to enhance the quality
and effectiveness of their interactions with humans. In this paper, we propose
a novel framework that can generate sequences of joint angles from the speech
text and speech audio utterances. Based on a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), our proposed neural network model learns the relationships
between the co-speech gestures and both semantic and acoustic features from the
speech input. In order to train our neural network model, we employ a public
dataset containing co-speech gestures with corresponding speech audio
utterances, which were captured from a single male native English speaker. The
results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the efficacy
of our gesture-generation framework for Robots and Embodied Agents.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the plethora of telehealth applications to assist home-based older
adults and healthcare providers, basic messaging and phone calls are still the
most common communication methods, which suffer from limited availability,
information loss, and process inefficiencies. One promising solution to
facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models
(LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability.
However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the
communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults
(N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and
opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on
the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and
designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we
leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built
an LLM-powered VA interface for effective information collection. (2) For
health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present
important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA.
We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to
evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could
facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected
from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We
envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the
intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly relevant as a
potential tool for healthcare, aiding communication between clinicians,
researchers, and patients. However, traditional evaluations of LLMs on medical
exam questions do not reflect the complexity of real patient-doctor
interactions. An example of this complexity is the introduction of patient
self-diagnosis, where a patient attempts to diagnose their own medical
conditions from various sources. While the patient sometimes arrives at an
accurate conclusion, they more often are led toward misdiagnosis due to the
patient's over-emphasis on bias validating information. In this work we present
a variety of LLMs with multiple-choice questions from United States medical
board exams which are modified to include self-diagnostic reports from
patients. Our findings highlight that when a patient proposes incorrect
bias-validating information, the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs drop dramatically,
revealing a high susceptibility to errors in self-diagnosis.

mobile and static sensors with nonidentical sensing and communication radii.
The multiplicatively weighted Voronoi (MW-Voronoi) diagram is used to partition
the field and assign the underlying coverage task to each mobile sensor. A
gradient-based method is applied to find the best candidate point based on the
detected coverage holes and the coverage priority considering the relative
distance of the mobile sensor from the static ones and the obstacles in the
field. The sensors move to a new position if such a relocation increases their
local coverage. The efficiency of the proposed strategy in different scenarios
is demonstrated by simulations.

<p class="mathjax">The Semantic Web technologies have been used in the Internet of Things (IoT)
to facilitate data interoperability and address data heterogeneity issues. The
Resource Description Framework (RDF) model is employed in the integration of
IoT data, with RDF engines serving as gateways for semantic integration.
However, storing and querying RDF data obtained from distributed sources across
a dynamic network of edge devices presents a challenging task. The distributed
nature of the edge shares similarities with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. These
similarities include attributes like node heterogeneity, limited availability,
and resources. The nodes primarily undertake tasks related to data storage and
processing. Therefore, the P2P models appear to present an attractive approach
for constructing distributed RDF stores. Based on P-Grid, a data indexing
mechanism for load balancing and range query processing in P2P systems, this
paper proposes a design for storing and sharing RDF data on P2P networks of
low-cost edge devices. Our design aims to integrate both P-Grid and an
edge-based RDF storage solution, RDF4Led for building an P2P RDF engine. This
integration can maintain RDF data access and query processing while scaling
with increasing data and network size. We demonstrated the scaling behavior of
our implementation on a P2P network, involving up to 16 nodes of Raspberry Pi 4
devices.

<p class="mathjax">Previous research in multi-document news summarization has typically
concentrated on collating information that all sources agree upon. However, to
our knowledge, the summarization of diverse information dispersed across
multiple articles about an event has not been previously investigated. The
latter imposes a different set of challenges for a summarization model. In this
paper, we propose a new task of summarizing diverse information encountered in
multiple news articles encompassing the same event. To facilitate this task, we
outlined a data collection schema for identifying diverse information and
curated a dataset named DiverseSumm. The dataset includes 245 news stories,
with each story comprising 10 news articles and paired with a human-validated
reference. Moreover, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint the
position and verbosity biases when utilizing Large Language Model (LLM)-based
metrics for evaluating the coverage and faithfulness of the summaries, as well
as their correlation with human assessments. We applied our findings to study
how LLMs summarize multiple news articles by analyzing which type of diverse
information LLMs are capable of identifying. Our analyses suggest that despite
the extraordinary capabilities of LLMs in single-document summarization, the
proposed task remains a complex challenge for them mainly due to their limited
coverage, with GPT-4 only able to cover less than 40% of the diverse
information on average.

<p class="mathjax">Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has been widely used as an efficient way for
communication in many applications. Data centers, smartphones, and network
operators use MPTCP to balance the traffic in a network efficiently. MPTCP is
an extension of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides multiple
paths, leading to higher throughput and low latency. Although MPTCP has shown
better performance than TCP in many applications, it has its own challenges.
The network can become congested due to heavy traffic in the multiple paths
(subflows) if the subflow rates are not determined correctly. Moreover,
communication latency can occur if the packets are not scheduled correctly
between the subflows. This paper reviews techniques to solve the
above-mentioned problems based on two main approaches; non data-driven
(classical) and data-driven (Machine Learning) approaches. This paper compares
these two approaches and highlights their strengths and weaknesses with a view
to motivating future researchers in this exciting area of machine learning for
communications. This paper also provides details on the simulation of MPTCP and
its implementations in real environments.

<p class="mathjax">This work describes a novel simulation approach that combines machine
learning and device modelling simulations. The device simulations are based on
the quantum mechanical non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) approach and the
machine learning method is an extension to a convolutional generative network.
We have named our new simulation approach ML-NEGF and we have implemented it in
our in-house simulator called NESS (nano-electronics simulations software). The
reported results demonstrate the improved convergence speed of the ML-NEGF
method in comparison to the standard NEGF approach. The trained ML model
effectively learns the underlying physics of nano-sheet transistor behaviour,
resulting in faster convergence of the coupled Poisson-NEGF simulations.
Quantitatively, our ML- NEGF approach achieves an average convergence
acceleration of 60%, substantially reducing the computational time while
maintaining the same accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, photogrammetrically derived point clouds are widely used in many
civilian applications due to their low cost and flexibility in acquisition.
Typically, photogrammetric point clouds are assessed through reference data
such as LiDAR point clouds. However, when reference data are not available, the
assessment of photogrammetric point clouds may be challenging. Since these
point clouds are algorithmically derived, their accuracies and precisions are
highly varying with the camera networks, scene complexity, and dense image
matching (DIM) algorithms, and there is no standard error metric to determine
per-point errors. The theory of internal reliability of camera networks has
been well studied through first-order error estimation of Bundle Adjustment
(BA), which is used to understand the errors of 3D points assuming known
measurement errors. However, the measurement errors of the DIM algorithms are
intricate to an extent that every single point may have its error function
determined by factors such as pixel intensity, texture entropy, and surface
smoothness. Despite the complexity, there exist a few common metrics that may
aid the process of estimating the posterior reliability of the derived points,
especially in a multi-view stereo (MVS) setup when redundancies are present. In
this paper, by using an aerial oblique photogrammetric block with LiDAR
reference data, we analyze several internal matching metrics within a common
MVS framework, including statistics in ray convergence, intersection angles,
DIM energy, etc.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has shown that large language models rely on spurious
correlations in the data for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In
this work, we aim to answer the following research question: Can we reduce
spurious correlations by modifying the ground truth labels of the training
data? Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective debiasing framework,
named Soft Label Encoding (SoftLE). We first train a teacher model with hard
labels to determine each sample's degree of relying on shortcuts. We then add
one dummy class to encode the shortcut degree, which is used to smooth other
dimensions in the ground truth label to generate soft labels. This new ground
truth label is used to train a more robust student model. Extensive experiments
on two NLU benchmark tasks demonstrate that SoftLE significantly improves
out-of-distribution generalization while maintaining satisfactory
in-distribution accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully leveraged for
learning on graph-structured data across domains, several potential pitfalls
have been described recently. Those include the inability to accurately
leverage information encoded in long-range connections (over-squashing), as
well as difficulties distinguishing the learned representations of nearby nodes
with growing network depth (over-smoothing). An effective way to characterize
both effects is discrete curvature: Long-range connections that underlie
over-squashing effects have low curvature, whereas edges that contribute to
over-smoothing have high curvature. This observation has given rise to rewiring
techniques, which add or remove edges to mitigate over-smoothing and
over-squashing. Several rewiring approaches utilizing graph characteristics,
such as curvature or the spectrum of the graph Laplacian, have been proposed.
However, existing methods, especially those based on curvature, often require
expensive subroutines and careful hyperparameter tuning, which limits their
applicability to large-scale graphs. Here we propose a rewiring technique based
on Augmented Forman-Ricci curvature (AFRC), a scalable curvature notation,
which can be computed in linear time. We prove that AFRC effectively
characterizes over-smoothing and over-squashing effects in message-passing
GNNs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments, which demonstrate
that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while
significantly reducing the computational cost in comparison with other methods.
Utilizing fundamental properties of discrete curvature, we propose effective
heuristics for hyperparameters in curvature-based rewiring, which avoids
expensive hyperparameter searches, further improving the scalability of the
proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">In 2002, Kleinberg proposed three axioms for distance-based clustering, and
proved that it was impossible for a clustering method to satisfy all three.
While there has been much subsequent work examining and modifying these axioms
for distance-based clustering, little work has been done to explore axioms
relevant to the graph partitioning problem, i.e., when the graph is given
without a distance matrix. Here, we propose and explore axioms for graph
partitioning when given graphs without distance matrices, including
modifications of Kleinberg's axioms for the distanceless case and two others
(one axiom relevant to the ''Resolution Limit'' and one addressing
well-connectedness). We prove that clustering under the Constant Potts Model
satisfies all the axioms, while Modularity clustering and Iterative k-core both
fail many axioms we pose. These theoretical properties of the clustering
methods are relevant both for theoretical investigation as well as to
practitioners considering which methods to use for their domain science
studies.

<p class="mathjax">Spoken semantic parsing (SSP) involves generating machine-comprehensible
parses from input speech. Training robust models for existing application
domains represented in training data or extending to new domains requires
corresponding triplets of speech-transcript-semantic parse data, which is
expensive to obtain. In this paper, we address this challenge by examining
methods that can use transcript-semantic parse data (unpaired text) without
corresponding speech. First, when unpaired text is drawn from existing textual
corpora, Joint Audio Text (JAT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) are compared as ways
to generate speech representations for unpaired text. Experiments on the STOP
dataset show that unpaired text from existing and new domains improves
performance by 2% and 30% in absolute Exact Match (EM) respectively. Second, we
consider the setting when unpaired text is not available in existing textual
corpora. We propose to prompt Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate unpaired
text for existing and new domains. Experiments show that examples and words
that co-occur with intents can be used to generate unpaired text with Llama
2.0. Using the generated text with JAT and TTS for spoken semantic parsing
improves EM on STOP by 1.4% and 2.6% absolute for existing and new domains
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">We present a reactive base control method that enables high performance
mobile manipulation on-the-move in environments with static and dynamic
obstacles. Performing manipulation tasks while the mobile base remains in
motion can significantly decrease the time required to perform multi-step
tasks, as well as improve the gracefulness of the robot's motion. Existing
approaches to manipulation on-the-move either ignore the obstacle avoidance
problem or rely on the execution of planned trajectories, which is not suitable
in environments with dynamic objects and obstacles. The presented controller
addresses both of these deficiencies and demonstrates robust performance of
pick-and-place tasks in dynamic environments. The performance is evaluated on
several simulated and real-world tasks. On a real-world task with static
obstacles, we outperform an existing method by 48\% in terms of total task
time. Further, we present real-world examples of our robot performing
manipulation tasks on-the-move while avoiding a second autonomous robot in the
workspace. See https://benburgesslimerick.github.io/MotM-BaseControl for

<p class="mathjax">In highly diffusion regimes when the mean free path $\varepsilon$ tends to
zero, the radiative transfer equation has an asymptotic behavior which is
governed by a diffusion equation and the corresponding boundary condition.
Generally, a numerical scheme for solving this problem has the truncation error
containing an $\varepsilon^{-1}$ contribution, that leads to a nonuniform
convergence for small $\varepsilon$. Such phenomenons require high resolutions
of discretizations, which degrades the performance of the numerical scheme in
the diffusion limit. In this paper, we first provide a--priori estimates for
the scaled spherical harmonic ($P_N$) radiative transfer equation. Then we
present an error analysis for the spherical harmonic discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) method of the scaled radiative transfer equation showing that, under some
mild assumptions, its solutions converge uniformly in $\varepsilon$ to the
solution of the scaled radiative transfer equation. We further present an
optimal convergence result for the DG method with the upwind flux on Cartesian
grids. Error estimates of $\left(1+\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)\right)h^{k+1}$
(where $h$ is the maximum element length) are obtained when tensor product
polynomials of degree at most $k$ are used.

cofibrant types, are introduced. The necessity of such notions arises during
the task of formalization. In addition, we provide some novel results about
inductive types using cofibrant exo-nat, the natural number type at the

applications as justifications, we also touch upon the semantic aspect of the

</div>
<p class="mathjax">As Large Language Models are deployed within Artificial Intelligence systems,
that are increasingly integrated with human society, it becomes more important
than ever to study their internal structures. Higher level abilities of LLMs
such as GPT-3.5 emerge in large part due to informative language
representations they induce from raw text data during pre-training on trillions
of words. These embeddings exist in vector spaces of several thousand
dimensions, and their processing involves mapping between multiple vector
spaces, with total number of parameters on the order of trillions. Furthermore,
these language representations are induced by gradient optimization, resulting
in a black box system that is hard to interpret. In this paper, we take a look
at the topological structure of neuronal activity in the "brain" of Chat-GPT's
foundation language model, and analyze it with respect to a metric representing
the notion of fairness. We develop a novel approach to visualize GPT's moral
dimensions. We first compute a fairness metric, inspired by social psychology
literature, to identify factors that typically influence fairness assessments
in humans, such as legitimacy, need, and responsibility. Subsequently, we
summarize the manifold's shape using a lower-dimensional simplicial complex,
whose topology is derived from this metric. We color it with a heat map
associated with this fairness metric, producing human-readable visualizations
of the high-dimensional sentence manifold. Our results show that sentence
embeddings based on GPT-3.5 can be decomposed into two submanifolds
corresponding to fair and unfair moral judgments. This indicates that GPT-based
language models develop a moral dimension within their representation spaces
and induce an understanding of fairness during their training process.

<p class="mathjax">The driving factors behind the development of large language models (LLMs)
with impressive learning capabilities are their colossal model sizes and
extensive training datasets. Along with the progress in natural language
processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster
deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training
datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they
are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs
involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of
quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research
on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering
replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges
become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the
available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and
cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable
dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this
issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3
trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset
undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of
multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including
language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document
refinement, and data deduplication. CulturaX is fully released to the public in
HuggingFace to facilitate research and advancements in multilingual LLMs:

<p class="mathjax">We propose the new problem of choosing which dense retrieval model to use
when searching on a new collection for which no labels are available, i.e. in a
zero-shot setting. Many dense retrieval models are readily available. Each
model however is characterized by very differing search effectiveness -- not
just on the test portion of the datasets in which the dense representations
have been learned but, importantly, also across different datasets for which
data was not used to learn the dense representations. This is because dense
retrievers typically require training on a large amount of labeled data to
achieve satisfactory search effectiveness in a specific dataset or domain.
Moreover, effectiveness gains obtained by dense retrievers on datasets for
which they are able to observe labels during training, do not necessarily
generalise to datasets that have not been observed during training. This is
however a hard problem: through empirical experimentation we show that methods
inspired by recent work in unsupervised performance evaluation with the
presence of domain shift in the area of computer vision and machine learning
are not effective for choosing highly performing dense retrievers in our setup.
The availability of reliable methods for the selection of dense retrieval
models in zero-shot settings that do not require the collection of labels for
evaluation would allow to streamline the widespread adoption of dense
retrieval. This is therefore an important new problem we believe the
information retrieval community should consider. Implementation of methods,
along with raw result files and analysis scripts are made publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Building teams and promoting collaboration are two very common business
activities. An example of these are seen in the TeamingForFunding problem,
where research institutions and researchers are interested to identify
collaborative opportunities when applying to funding agencies in response to
latter's calls for proposals. We describe a novel system to recommend teams
using a variety of AI methods, such that (1) each team achieves the highest
possible skill coverage that is demanded by the opportunity, and (2) the
workload of distributing the opportunities is balanced amongst the candidate
members. We address these questions by extracting skills latent in open data of
proposal calls (demand) and researcher profiles (supply), normalizing them
using taxonomies, and creating efficient algorithms that match demand to
supply. We create teams to maximize goodness along a novel metric balancing
short- and long-term objectives. We validate the success of our algorithms (1)
quantitatively, by evaluating the recommended teams using a goodness score and
find that more informed methods lead to recommendations of smaller number of
teams but higher goodness, and (2) qualitatively, by conducting a large-scale
user study at a college-wide level, and demonstrate that users overall found
the tool very useful and relevant. Lastly, we evaluate our system in two
diverse settings in US and India (of researchers and proposal calls) to
establish generality of our approach, and deploy it at a major US university
for routine use.

size of the input videos to be summarized. We propose an efficient,
language-only video summarizer that achieves competitive accuracy with high

we train a language transformer model and forego image representations. This
method allows us to perform filtration amongst the representative text vectors

<p class="mathjax">Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to find a policy that achieves high
rewards while satisfying cost constraints. When learning from scratch, safe RL
agents tend to be overly conservative, which impedes exploration and restrains
the overall performance. In many realistic tasks, e.g. autonomous driving,
large-scale expert demonstration data are available. We argue that extracting
expert policy from offline data to guide online exploration is a promising
solution to mitigate the conserveness issue. Large-capacity models, e.g.
decision transformers (DT), have been proven to be competent in offline policy
learning. However, data collected in real-world scenarios rarely contain
dangerous cases (e.g., collisions), which makes it prohibitive for the policies
to learn safety concepts. Besides, these bulk policy networks cannot meet the
computation speed requirements at inference time on real-world tasks such as
autonomous driving. To this end, we propose Guided Online Distillation (GOLD),
an offline-to-online safe RL framework. GOLD distills an offline DT policy into
a lightweight policy network through guided online safe RL training, which
outperforms both the offline DT policy and online safe RL algorithms.
Experiments in both benchmark safe RL tasks and real-world driving tasks based
on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that GOLD can successfully
distill lightweight policies and solve decision-making problems in challenging
safety-critical scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Although multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are widely used for
automatic tumor detection on whole slide images (WSI), they suffer from the
extreme class imbalance within the small tumor WSIs. This occurs when the tumor
comprises only a few isolated cells. For early detection, it is of utmost
importance that MIL algorithms can identify small tumors, even when they are
less than 1% of the size of the WSI. Existing studies have attempted to address
this issue using attention-based architectures and instance selection-based
methodologies, but have not yielded significant improvements. This paper
proposes cross-attention-based salient instance inference MIL (CASiiMIL), which
involves a novel saliency-informed attention mechanism, to identify breast
cancer lymph node micro-metastasis on WSIs without the need for any
annotations. Apart from this new attention mechanism, we introduce a negative
representation learning algorithm to facilitate the learning of
saliency-informed attention weights for improved sensitivity on tumor WSIs. The
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods on two popular
tumor metastasis detection datasets, and demonstrates great cross-center
generalizability. In addition, it exhibits excellent accuracy in classifying
WSIs with small tumor lesions. Moreover, we show that the proposed model has
excellent interpretability attributed to the saliency-informed attention
weights. We strongly believe that the proposed method will pave the way for
training algorithms for early tumor detection on large datasets where acquiring
fine-grained annotations is practically impossible.

<p class="mathjax">Large self-supervised pre-trained speech models require computationally
expensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Soft prompt tuning offers a simple
parameter-efficient alternative by utilizing minimal soft prompt guidance,
enhancing portability while also maintaining competitive performance. However,
not many people understand how and why this is so. In this study, we aim to
deepen our understanding of this emerging method by investigating the role of
soft prompts in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our findings highlight
their role as zero-shot learners in improving ASR performance but also make
them vulnerable to malicious modifications. Soft prompts aid generalization but
are not obligatory for inference. We also identify two primary roles of soft
prompts: content refinement and noise information enhancement, which enhances
robustness against background noise. Additionally, we propose an effective
modification on noise prompts to show that they are capable of zero-shot
learning on adapting to out-of-distribution noise environments.

<p class="mathjax">We are not only observers but also actors of reality. Our capability to
intervene and alter the course of some events in the space and time surrounding
us is an essential component of how we build our model of the world. In this
doctoral thesis we introduce a generic a-priori assessment of each possible
intervention, in order to select the most cost-effective interventions only,
and avoid unnecessary systematic experimentation on the real world. Based on
this a-priori assessment, we propose an active learning algorithm that
identifies the causal relations in any given causal model, using a least cost
sequence of interventions. There are several novel aspects introduced by our
algorithm. It is, in most case scenarios, able to discard many causal model
candidates using relatively inexpensive interventions that only test one value
of the intervened variables. Also, the number of interventions performed by the
algorithm can be bounded by the number of causal model candidates. Hence, fewer
initial candidates (or equivalently, more prior knowledge) lead to fewer
interventions for causal discovery.
<br />Causality is intimately related to time, as causes appear to precede their
effects. Cyclical causal processes are a very interesting case of causality in
relation to time. In this doctoral thesis we introduce a formal analysis of
time cyclical causal settings by defining a causal analog to the purely
observational Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and provide a sound and complete
algorithm for the identification of causal effects in the cyclic setting. We
introduce the existence of two types of hidden confounder variables in this
framework, which affect in substantially different ways the identification
procedures, a distinction with no analog in either Dynamic Bayesian Networks or
standard causal graphs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a method for uncertainty quantification of an
autoencoder-based Koopman operator. The main challenge of using the Koopman
operator is to design the basis functions for lifting the state. To this end,
this paper builds an autoencoder to automatically search the optimal lifting
basis functions with a given loss function. We approximate the Koopman operator
in a finite-dimensional space with the autoencoder, while the approximated
Koopman has an approximation uncertainty. To resolve the problem, we compute a
robust positively invariant set for the approximated Koopman operator to
consider the approximation error. Then, the decoder of the autoencoder is
analyzed by robustness certification against approximation error using the
Lipschitz constant in the reconstruction phase. The forced Van der Pol model is
used to show the validity of the proposed method. From the numerical simulation
results, we confirmed that the trajectory of the true state stays in the
uncertainty set centered by the reconstructed state.

<p class="mathjax">Background music (BGM) can enhance the video's emotion. However, selecting an
appropriate BGM often requires domain knowledge. This has led to the
development of video-music retrieval techniques. Most existing approaches
utilize pretrained video/music feature extractors trained with different target
sets to obtain average video/music-level embeddings. The drawbacks are
two-fold. One is that different target sets for video/music pretraining may
cause the generated embeddings difficult to match. The second is that the
underlying temporal correlation between video and music is ignored. In this
paper, our proposed approach leverages a unified target set to perform
video/music pretraining and produces clip-level embeddings to preserve temporal
information. The downstream cross-modal matching is based on the clip-level
features with embedded music rhythm and optical flow information. Experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve superior performance over the
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

<p class="mathjax">Desensitization addresses safe optimal planning under parametric
uncertainties by providing sensitivity function-based risk measures. This paper
expands upon the existing work on desensitization to address safe planning for
a class of two-player differential games. In the proposed game, parametric
uncertainties correspond to variations in a vector of model parameters about
its nominal value. The two players in the proposed formulation are assumed to
have information about the nominal value of the parameter vector. However, only
one of the players is assumed to have complete knowledge of parametric
variation, creating a form of information asymmetry in the proposed game. The
lack of knowledge regarding the parametric variations is expected to result in
state constraint violations for the player with an information disadvantage. In
this regard, a desensitized feedback strategy that provides safe trajectories
is proposed for the player with incomplete information. The proposed feedback
strategy is evaluated in instances involving one pursuer and one evader with an
uncertain dynamic obstacle, where the pursuer is assumed to know only the
nominal value of the obstacle's speed. At the same time, the evader knows the
obstacle's true speed, and also the fact that the pursuer possesses only the
nominal value. Subsequently, deceptive strategies are proposed for the evader,
who has an information advantage, and these strategies are assessed against the
pursuer's desensitized strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Soft robotics, with their inherent flexibility and infinite degrees of
freedom (DoF), offer promising advancements in human-machine interfaces.
Particularly, pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) and pneumatic bending
actuators have been fundamental in driving this evolution, capitalizing on
their mimetic nature to natural muscle movements. However, with the versatility
of these actuators comes the intricate challenge of hysteresis - a nonlinear
phenomenon that hampers precise positioning, especially pronounced in pneumatic
actuators due to gas compressibility. In this study, we introduce a novel 2-DoF
adaptive control for precise bending tracking using a pneumatic continuum
actuator. Notably, our control method integrates adaptability into both the
feedback and the feedforward element, enhancing trajectory tracking in the
presence of profound nonlinear effects. Comparative analysis with existing
approaches underscores the superior tracking accuracy of our proposed strategy.
This work discusses a new way of simple yet effective control designs for soft
actuators with hysteresis properties.

<p class="mathjax">Realistic digital models of plant leaves are crucial to fluid dynamics
simulations of droplets for optimising agrochemical spray technologies. The
presence and nature of small features (on the order of 100$\mathrm{\mu m}$)
such as ridges and hairs on the surface have been shown to significantly affect
the droplet evaporation, and thus the leaf's potential uptake of active
ingredients. We show that these microstructures can be captured by implicit
radial basis function partition of unity (RBFPU) surface reconstructions from
micro-CT scan datasets. However, scanning a whole leaf ($20\mathrm{cm^2}$) at
micron resolutions is infeasible due to both extremely large data storage
requirements and scanner time constraints. Instead, we micro-CT scan only a
small segment of a wheat leaf ($4\mathrm{mm^2}$). We fit a RBFPU implicit
surface to this segment, and an explicit RBFPU surface to a lower resolution
laser scan of the whole leaf. Parameterising the leaf using a locally
orthogonal coordinate system, we then replicate the now resolved microstructure
many times across a larger, coarser, representation of the leaf surface that
captures important macroscale features, such as its size, shape, and
orientation. The edge of one segment of the microstructure model is blended
into its neighbour naturally by the partition of unity method. The result is
one implicit surface reconstruction that captures the wheat leaf's features at
both the micro- and macro-scales.

<p class="mathjax">Transparent objects are common in daily life. However, depth sensing for
transparent objects remains a challenging problem. While learning-based methods
can leverage shape priors to improve the sensing quality, the labor-intensive
data collection in the real world and the sim-to-real domain gap restrict these
methods' scalability. In this paper, we propose a method to finetune a stereo
network with sparse depth labels automatically collected using a probing system
with tactile feedback. We present a novel utility function to evaluate the
benefit of touches. By approximating and optimizing the utility function, we
can optimize the probing locations given a fixed touching budget to better
improve the network's performance on real objects. We further combine tactile
depth supervision with a confidence-based regularization to prevent
over-fitting during finetuning. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we
construct a real-world dataset including both diffuse and transparent objects.
Experimental results on this dataset show that our method can significantly
improve real-world depth sensing accuracy, especially for transparent objects.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral images (HSIs) contain rich spectral and spatial information.
Motivated by the success of transformers in the field of natural language
processing and computer vision where they have shown the ability to learn long
range dependencies within input data, recent research has focused on using
transformers for HSIs. However, current state-of-the-art hyperspectral
transformers only tokenize the input HSI sample along the spectral dimension,
resulting in the under-utilization of spatial information. Moreover,
transformers are known to be data-hungry and their performance relies heavily
on large-scale pre-training, which is challenging due to limited annotated
hyperspectral data. Therefore, the full potential of HSI transformers has not
been fully realized. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
factorized spectral-spatial transformer that incorporates factorized
self-supervised pre-training procedures, leading to significant improvements in
performance. The factorization of the inputs allows the spectral and spatial
transformers to better capture the interactions within the hyperspectral data
cubes. Inspired by masked image modeling pre-training, we also devise efficient
masking strategies for pre-training each of the spectral and spatial
transformers. We conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets for
HSI classification task and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in all three datasets. The code for our model will
be made available at https://github.com/csiro-robotics/factoformer.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) represents a
pivotal moment in the evolution of information technology. With AIGC, it can be
effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to
distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across
cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of
individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both
academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative
data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and
privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on
generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from
the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the
successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the
foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and
compliance, respectively. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and
potential exploration directions from each of theses properties.

<p class="mathjax">Most deep anomaly detection models are based on learning normality from
datasets due to the difficulty of defining abnormality by its diverse and
inconsistent nature. Therefore, it has been a common practice to learn
normality under the assumption that anomalous data are absent in a training
dataset, which we call normality assumption. However, in practice, the
normality assumption is often violated due to the nature of real data
distributions that includes anomalous tails, i.e., a contaminated dataset.
Thereby, the gap between the assumption and actual training data affects
detrimentally in learning of an anomaly detection model. In this work, we
propose a learning framework to reduce this gap and achieve better normality
representation. Our key idea is to identify sample-wise normality and utilize
it as an importance weight, which is updated iteratively during the training.
Our framework is designed to be model-agnostic and hyperparameter insensitive
so that it applies to a wide range of existing methods without careful
parameter tuning. We apply our framework to three different representative
approaches of deep anomaly detection that are classified into one-class
classification-, probabilistic model-, and reconstruction-based approaches. In
addition, we address the importance of a termination condition for iterative
methods and propose a termination criterion inspired by the anomaly detection
objective. We validate that our framework improves the robustness of the
anomaly detection models under different levels of contamination ratios on five
anomaly detection benchmark datasets and two image datasets. On various
contaminated datasets, our framework improves the performance of three
representative anomaly detection methods, measured by area under the ROC curve.

<p class="mathjax">Formal property verification (FPV) has existed for decades and has been shown
to be effective at finding intricate RTL bugs. However, formal properties, such
as those written as SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), are time-consuming and
error-prone to write, even for experienced users. Prior work has attempted to
lighten this burden by raising the abstraction level so that SVA is generated
from high-level specifications. However, this does not eliminate the manual
effort of reasoning and writing about the detailed hardware behavior. Motivated
by the increased need for FPV in the era of heterogeneous hardware and the
advances in large language models (LLMs), we set out to explore whether LLMs
can capture RTL behavior and generate correct SVA properties.
<br />First, we design an FPV-based evaluation framework that measures the
correctness and completeness of SVA. Then, we evaluate GPT4 iteratively to
craft the set of syntax and semantic rules needed to prompt it toward creating
better SVA. We extend the open-source AutoSVA framework by integrating our
improved GPT4-based flow to generate safety properties, in addition to
facilitating their existing flow for liveness properties. Lastly, our use cases
evaluate (1) the FPV coverage of GPT4-generated SVA on complex open-source RTL
and (2) using generated SVA to prompt GPT4 to create RTL from scratch.
<br />Through these experiments, we find that GPT4 can generate correct SVA even
for flawed RTL, without mirroring design errors. Particularly, it generated SVA
that exposed a bug in the RISC-V CVA6 core that eluded the prior work's
evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">As the emerging services have increasingly strict requirements on quality of
service (QoS), such as millisecond network service latency ect., network
traffic classification technology is required to assist more advanced network
management and monitoring capabilities. So far as we know, the delays of
flow-granularity classification methods are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements for too long packet-waiting time, whereas the present
packet-granularity classification methods may have problems related to privacy
protection due to using excessive user payloads. To solve the above problems,
we proposed a network traffic classification method only by the IP packet
header, which satisfies the requirements of both user's privacy protection and
classification performances. We opted to remove the IP address from the header
information of the network layer and utilized the remaining 12-byte IP packet
header information as input for the model. Additionally, we examined the
variations in header value distributions among different categories of network
traffic samples. And, the external attention is also introduced to form the
online classification framework, which performs well for its low time
complexity and strong ability to enhance high-dimensional classification
features. The experiments on three open-source datasets show that our average
accuracy can reach upon 94.57%, and the classification time is shortened to
meet the real-time requirements (0.35ms for a single packet).

<p class="mathjax">Cloud computing is a concept introduced in the information technology era,
with the main components being the grid, distributed, and valuable computing.
The cloud is being developed continuously and, naturally, comes up with many
challenges, one of which is scheduling. A schedule or timeline is a mechanism
used to optimize the time for performing a duty or set of duties. A scheduling
process is accountable for choosing the best resources for performing a duty.
The main goal of a scheduling algorithm is to improve the efficiency and
quality of the service while at the same time ensuring the acceptability and
effectiveness of the targets. The task scheduling problem is one of the most
important NP-hard issues in the cloud domain and, so far, many techniques have
been proposed as solutions, including using genetic algorithms (GAs), particle
swarm optimization, (PSO), and ant colony optimization (ACO). To address this
problem, in this paper, one of the collective intelligence algorithms, called
the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), has been expanded, improved, and applied. The
performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with that of GAs, PSO,
continuous ACO, and the basic SSA. The results show that our algorithm has
generally higher performance than the other algorithms. For example, compared
to the basic SSA, the proposed method has an average reduction of approximately
21% in makespan.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explore zero- and few-shot generalization for fact
verification (FV), which aims to generalize the FV model trained on
well-resourced domains (e.g., Wikipedia) to low-resourced domains that lack
human annotations. To this end, we first construct a benchmark dataset
collection which contains 11 FV datasets representing 6 domains. We conduct an
empirical analysis of generalization across these FV datasets, finding that
current models generalize poorly. Our analysis reveals that several factors
affect generalization, including dataset size, length of evidence, and the type
of claims. Finally, we show that two directions of work improve generalization:
1) incorporating domain knowledge via pretraining on specialized domains, and
2) automatically generating training data via claim generation.

<p class="mathjax">Footpath mapping, modeling, and analysis can provide important geospatial
insights to many fields of study, including transport, health, environment and
urban planning. The availability of robust Geographic Information System (GIS)
layers can benefit the management of infrastructure inventories, especially at
local government level with urban planners responsible for the deployment and
maintenance of such infrastructure. However, many cities still lack real-time
information on the location, connectivity, and width of footpaths, and/or
employ costly and manual survey means to gather this information. This work
designs and implements an automatic pipeline for generating footpath networks
based on remote sensing images using machine learning models. The annotation of
segmentation tasks, especially labeling remote sensing images with specialized
requirements, is very expensive, so we aim to introduce a pipeline requiring
less labeled data. Considering supervised methods require large amounts of
training data, we use a self-supervised method for feature representation
learning to reduce annotation requirements. Then the pre-trained model is used
as the encoder of the U-Net for footpath segmentation. Based on the generated
masks, the footpath polygons are extracted and converted to footpath networks
which can be loaded and visualized by geographic information systems
conveniently. Validation results indicate considerable consistency when
compared to manually collected GIS layers. The footpath network generation
pipeline proposed in this work is low-cost and extensible, and it can be
applied where remote sensing images are available. Github:

of AI systems is bountiful, though, is still unknown-as are their risks. In
this work, we offer a brief, high-level overview of societal impacts of AI
systems. To do so, we highlight the requirement of multi-disciplinary
governance and convergence throughout its lifecycle via critical systemic
examinations (e.g., energy consumption), and later discuss induced effects on
the environment (i.e., carbon footprint) and its users (i.e., social
development). In particular, we consider these impacts from a
multi-disciplinary perspective: computer science, sociology, environmental
science, and so on to discuss its inter-connected societal risks and inability
to simultaneously satisfy aspects of well-being. Therefore, we accentuate the
necessity of holistically addressing pressing concerns of AI systems from a
socioethical impact assessment perspective to explicate its harmful societal
effects to truly enable humanity-centered Trustworthy AI.

relationship among the notions, which includes that in ${\bf S4}$, all
higher-order ignorance are reduced to second-order ignorance. This is thought
of as a bad consequence by some researchers. It is then natural to ask how to
avoid this consequence. We deal with this issue in a much more general
framework. In detail, we treat the forms of Fitchean ignorance and first-order
ignorance as primitive modalities and study them as first-class citizens under
neighborhood semantics, in which Rumsfeld ignorance and second-order ignorance
are definable. We can see that even under neighborhood semantics, there is also
interesting relationship among the aforementioned four notions. The main
contributions include axiomatizations and model-theoretical results such as
expressivity and frame definability.

<p class="mathjax">The asymptotically efficient online learning problem is investigated for
stochastic censored regression models, which arise from various fields of
learning and statistics but up to now still lacks comprehensive theoretical
studies on the efficiency of the learning algorithms. For this, we propose a
two-step online algorithm, where the first step focuses on achieving algorithm
convergence, and the second step is dedicated to improving the estimation
performance. Under a general excitation condition on the data, we show that our
algorithm is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal by employing the
stochastic Lyapunov function method and limit theories for martingales.
Moreover, we show that the covariances of the estimates can achieve the
Cramer-Rao (C-R) bound asymptotically, indicating that the performance of the
proposed algorithm is the best possible that one can expect in general. Unlike
most of the existing works, our results are obtained without resorting to the
traditionally used but stringent conditions such as independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d) assumption on the data, and thus our results do not exclude
applications to stochastic dynamical systems with feedback. A numerical example
is also provided to illustrate the superiority of the proposed online algorithm
over the existing related ones in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Continual graph learning (CGL) is purposed to continuously update a graph
model with graph data being fed in a streaming manner. Since the model easily
forgets previously learned knowledge when training with new-coming data, the
catastrophic forgetting problem has been the major focus in CGL. Recent
replay-based methods intend to solve this problem by updating the model using
both (1) the entire new-coming data and (2) a sampling-based memory bank that
stores replayed graphs to approximate the distribution of historical data.
After updating the model, a new replayed graph sampled from the incoming graph
will be added to the existing memory bank. Despite these methods are intuitive
and effective for the CGL, two issues are identified in this paper. Firstly,
most sampling-based methods struggle to fully capture the historical
distribution when the storage budget is tight. Secondly, a significant data
imbalance exists in terms of the scales of the complex new-coming graph data
and the lightweight memory bank, resulting in unbalanced training. To solve
these issues, a \textit{Condense and Train (CaT)} framework is proposed in this
paper. Prior to each model update, the new-coming graph is condensed to a small
yet informative synthesised replayed graph, which is then stored in a
\textit{Condensed Graph Memory} with historical replay graphs. In the continual
learning phase, a \textit{Training in Memory} scheme is used to update the
model directly with the \textit{Condensed Graph Memory} rather than the whole
new-coming graph, which alleviates the data imbalance problem. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets successfully demonstrate
superior performances of the proposed CaT framework in terms of effectiveness
and efficiency. The code has been released on

<p class="mathjax">Point cloud-based open-vocabulary 3D object detection aims to detect 3D
categories that do not have ground-truth annotations in the training set. It is
extremely challenging because of the limited data and annotations (bounding
boxes with class labels or text descriptions) of 3D scenes. Previous approaches
leverage large-scale richly-annotated image datasets as a bridge between 3D and
category semantics but require an extra alignment process between 2D images and
3D points, limiting the open-vocabulary ability of 3D detectors. Instead of
leveraging 2D images, we propose Object2Scene, the first approach that
leverages large-scale large-vocabulary 3D object datasets to augment existing
3D scene datasets for open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Object2Scene inserts
objects from different sources into 3D scenes to enrich the vocabulary of 3D
scene datasets and generates text descriptions for the newly inserted objects.
We further introduce a framework that unifies 3D detection and visual
grounding, named L3Det, and propose a cross-domain category-level contrastive
learning approach to mitigate the domain gap between 3D objects from different
datasets. Extensive experiments on existing open-vocabulary 3D object detection
benchmarks show that Object2Scene obtains superior performance over existing
methods. We further verify the effectiveness of Object2Scene on a new benchmark
OV-ScanNet-200, by holding out all rare categories as novel categories not seen
during training.

<p class="mathjax">The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that
the learner has access to a known feature map $\phi(x, a)$ that maps
state-action pairs to $d$-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and
transitions are linear functions in this representation. But where do these
features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting
strategy is to use the ``kitchen sink" approach and hope that the true features
are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this paper we
revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a $k$-sparse
linear MDP, there is an unknown subset $S \subset [d]$ of size $k$ containing
all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in
only poly$(k,\log d)$ interactions with the environment. Our main result is the
first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works
either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for
exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization
problems.
<br />Along the way we introduce the notion of an emulator: a succinct approximate
representation of the transitions that suffices for computing certain Bellman
backups. Since linear MDPs are a non-parametric model, it is not even obvious
whether polynomial-sized emulators exist. We show that they do exist and can be
computed efficiently via convex programming.
<br />As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a
near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth
decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a
polynomial number of samples. This can be seen as a reinforcement learning
analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it
gives a natural model where improving the sample complexity via representation
learning is computationally feasible.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performances in various
domains, while they are vulnerable to the inputs with well-crafted but small
perturbations, which are named after adversarial examples (AEs). Among many
strategies to improve the model robustness against AEs, Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD) based adversarial training is one of the most effective methods.
Unfortunately, the prohibitive computational overhead of generating strong
enough AEs, due to the maximization of the loss function, sometimes makes the
regular PGD adversarial training impractical when using larger and more
complicated models. In this paper, we propose that the adversarial loss can be
approximated by the partial sum of Taylor series. Furthermore, we approximate
the gradient of adversarial loss and propose a new and efficient adversarial
training method, adversarial training with gradient approximation (GAAT), to
reduce the cost of building up robust models. Additionally, extensive
experiments demonstrate that this efficiency improvement can be achieved
without any or with very little loss in accuracy on natural and adversarial
examples, which show that our proposed method saves up to 60\% of the training
time with comparable model test accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Active learning has been utilized as an efficient tool in building anomaly
detection models by leveraging expert feedback. In an active learning
framework, a model queries samples to be labeled by experts and re-trains the
model with the labeled data samples. It unburdens in obtaining annotated
datasets while improving anomaly detection performance. However, most of the
existing studies focus on helping experts identify as many abnormal data
samples as possible, which is a sub-optimal approach for one-class
classification-based deep anomaly detection. In this paper, we tackle two
essential problems of active learning for Deep SVDD: query strategy and
semi-supervised learning method. First, rather than solely identifying
anomalies, our query strategy selects uncertain samples according to an
adaptive boundary. Second, we apply noise contrastive estimation in training a
one-class classification model to incorporate both labeled normal and abnormal
data effectively. We analyze that the proposed query strategy and
semi-supervised loss individually improve an active learning process of anomaly
detection and further improve when combined together on seven anomaly detection
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">In spite of the rapidly evolving landscape of text-to-image generation, the
synthesis and manipulation of multiple entities while adhering to specific
relational constraints pose enduring challenges. This paper introduces an
innovative progressive synthesis and editing operation that systematically
incorporates entities into the target image, ensuring their adherence to
spatial and relational constraints at each sequential step. Our key insight
stems from the observation that while a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
model adeptly handles one or two entities, it often falters when dealing with a
greater number. To address this limitation, we propose harnessing the
capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose intricate and
protracted text descriptions into coherent directives adhering to stringent
formats. To facilitate the execution of directives involving distinct semantic
operations-namely insertion, editing, and erasing-we formulate the Stimulus,
Response, and Fusion (SRF) framework. Within this framework, latent regions are
gently stimulated in alignment with each operation, followed by the fusion of
the responsive latent components to achieve cohesive entity manipulation. Our
proposed framework yields notable advancements in object synthesis,
particularly when confronted with intricate and lengthy textual inputs.
Consequently, it establishes a new benchmark for text-to-image generation
tasks, further elevating the field's performance standards.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic memoization is a higher-order construct of probabilistic
programming languages that is key in Bayesian nonparametrics, a modular
approach that allows us to extend models beyond their parametric limitations
and compose them in an elegant and principled manner. Stochastic memoization is
simple and useful in practice, but semantically elusive, particularly regarding
dataflow transformations. As the naive implementation resorts to the state
monad, which is not commutative, it is not clear if stochastic memoization
preserves the dataflow property -- i.e., whether we can reorder the lines of a
program without changing its semantics, provided the dataflow graph is
preserved. In this paper, we give an operational and categorical semantics to
stochastic memoization and name generation in the context of a minimal
probabilistic programming language, for a restricted class of functions. Our
contribution is a first model of stochastic memoization of constant Bernoulli
functions with a non-enumerable type, which validates data flow
transformations, bridging the gap between traditional probability theory and
higher-order probability models. Our model uses a presheaf category and a novel
probability monad on it.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated great
potential for temporal signal processing. However, their performance in speech
processing remains limited due to the lack of an effective auditory front-end.
To address this limitation, we introduce Spiking-LEAF, a learnable auditory
front-end meticulously designed for SNN-based speech processing. Spiking-LEAF
combines a learnable filter bank with a novel two-compartment spiking neuron
model called IHC-LIF. The IHC-LIF neurons draw inspiration from the structure
of inner hair cells (IHC) and they leverage segregated dendritic and somatic
compartments to effectively capture multi-scale temporal dynamics of speech
signals. Additionally, the IHC-LIF neurons incorporate the lateral feedback
mechanism along with spike regularization loss to enhance spike encoding
efficiency. On keyword spotting and speaker identification tasks, the proposed
Spiking-LEAF outperforms both SOTA spiking auditory front-ends and conventional
real-valued acoustic features in terms of classification accuracy, noise
robustness, and encoding efficiency.

images (zero-shot FaceVC), which aims at converting the voice characteristics
of an utterance from any source speaker to a newly coming target speaker,
solely relying on a single face image of the target speaker. To address this
task, we propose a face-voice memory-based zero-shot FaceVC method. This method
leverages a memory-based face-voice alignment module, in which slots act as the
bridge to align these two modalities, allowing for the capture of voice
characteristics from face images. A mixed supervision strategy is also
introduced to mitigate the long-standing issue of the inconsistency between
training and inference phases for voice conversion tasks. To obtain
speaker-independent content-related representations, we transfer the knowledge
from a pretrained zero-shot voice conversion model to our zero-shot FaceVC
model. Considering the differences between FaceVC and traditional voice
conversion tasks, systematic subjective and objective metrics are designed to
thoroughly evaluate the homogeneity, diversity and consistency of voice
characteristics controlled by face images. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on the zero-shot FaceVC

<p class="mathjax">Multi-view clustering (MVC) has had significant implications in cross-modal
representation learning and data-driven decision-making in recent years. It
accomplishes this by leveraging the consistency and complementary information
among multiple views to cluster samples into distinct groups. However, as
contrastive learning continues to evolve within the field of computer vision,
self-supervised learning has also made substantial research progress and is
progressively becoming dominant in MVC methods. It guides the clustering
process by designing proxy tasks to mine the representation of image and video
data itself as supervisory information. Despite the rapid development of
self-supervised MVC, there has yet to be a comprehensive survey to analyze and
summarize the current state of research progress. Therefore, this paper
explores the reasons and advantages of the emergence of self-supervised MVC and
discusses the internal connections and classifications of common datasets, data
issues, representation learning methods, and self-supervised learning methods.
This paper does not only introduce the mechanisms for each category of methods
but also gives a few examples of how these techniques are used. In the end,
some open problems are pointed out for further investigation and development.

<p class="mathjax">Automated game design (AGD), the study of automatically generating game
rules, has a long history in technical games research. AGD approaches generally
rely on approximations of human play, either objective functions or AI agents.
Despite this, the majority of these approximators are static, meaning they do
not reflect human player's ability to learn and improve in a game. In this
paper, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an
approximator for human play for rule generation. We recreate the classic AGD
environment Mechanic Maker in Unity as a new, open-source rule generation
framework. Our results demonstrate that RL produces distinct sets of rules from
an A* agent baseline, which may be more usable by humans.

<p class="mathjax">It is tempting to assume that because effectiveness metrics have free choice
to assign scores to search engine result pages (SERPs) there must thus be a
similar degree of freedom as to the relative order that SERP pairs can be put
into. In fact that second freedom is, to a considerable degree, illusory.
That's because if one SERP in a pair has been given a certain score by a
metric, fundamental ordering constraints in many cases then dictate that the
score for the second SERP must be either not less than, or not greater than,
the score assigned to the first SERP. We refer to these fixed relationships as
innate pairwise SERP orderings. Our first goal in this work is to describe and
defend those pairwise SERP relationship constraints, and tabulate their
relative occurrence via both exhaustive and empirical experimentation.
<br />We then consider how to employ such innate pairwise relationships in IR
experiments, leading to a proposal for a new measurement paradigm.
Specifically, we argue that tables of results in which many different metrics
are listed for champion versus challenger system comparisons should be avoided;
and that instead a single metric be argued for in principled terms, with any
relationships identified by that metric then reinforced via an assessment of
the innate relationship as to whether other metrics - indeed, all other metrics
- are likely to yield the same system-vs-system outcome.

<p class="mathjax">Log data is a crucial resource for recording system events and states during
system execution. However, as systems grow in scale, log data generation has
become increasingly explosive, leading to an expensive overhead on log storage,
such as several petabytes per day in production. To address this issue, log
compression has become a crucial task in reducing disk storage while allowing
for further log analysis. Unfortunately, existing general-purpose and
log-specific compression methods have been limited in their ability to utilize
log data characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we conduct an
empirical study and obtain three major observations on the characteristics of
log data that can facilitate the log compression task. Based on these
observations, we propose LogShrink, a novel and effective log compression
method by leveraging commonality and variability of log data. An analyzer based
on longest common subsequence and entropy techniques is proposed to identify
the latent commonality and variability in log messages. The key idea behind
this is that the commonality and variability can be exploited to shrink log
data with a shorter representation. Besides, a clustering-based sequence
sampler is introduced to accelerate the commonality and variability analyzer.
The extensive experimental results demonstrate that LogShrink can exceed
baselines in compression ratio by 16% to 356% on average while preserving a
reasonable compression speed.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on
face recognition (FR) tasks in the last decade. In real scenarios, the
deployment of DNNs requires taking various face accessories into consideration,
like glasses, hats, and masks. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, wearing face masks
is one of the most effective ways to defend against the novel coronavirus.
However, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples with a small
but elaborated perturbation. Thus, a facial mask with adversarial perturbations
may pose a great threat to the widely used deep learning-based FR models. In
this paper, we consider a challenging adversarial setting: targeted attack
against FR models. We propose a new stealthy physical masked FR attack via
adversarial style optimization. Specifically, we train an adversarial style
mask generator that hides adversarial perturbations inside style masks.
Moreover, to ameliorate the phenomenon of sub-optimization with one fixed
style, we propose to discover the optimal style given a target through style
optimization in a continuous relaxation manner. We simultaneously optimize the
generator and the style selection for generating strong and stealthy
adversarial style masks. We evaluated the effectiveness and transferability of
our proposed method via extensive white-box and black-box digital experiments.
Furthermore, we also conducted physical attack experiments against local FR
models and online platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Digital video splicing has become easy and ubiquitous. Malicious users copy
some regions of a video and paste them to another video for creating realistic
forgeries. It is significant to blindly detect such forgery regions in videos.
In this paper, a spatio-temporal co-attention fusion network (SCFNet) is
proposed for video splicing localization. Specifically, a three-stream network
is used as an encoder to capture manipulation traces across multiple frames.
The deep interaction and fusion of spatio-temporal forensic features are
achieved by the novel parallel and cross co-attention fusion modules. A
lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder is adopted to yield a
pixel-level tampering localization map. A new large-scale video splicing
dataset is created for training the SCFNet. Extensive tests on benchmark
datasets show that the localization and generalization performances of our
SCFNet outperform the state-of-the-art. Code and datasets will be available at
https://github.com/multimediaFor/SCFNet.

<p class="mathjax">Face recognition systems have become increasingly vulnerable to security
threats in recent years, prompting the use of Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) to
protect against various types of attacks, such as phone unlocking, face
payment, and self-service security inspection. While FAS has demonstrated its
effectiveness in traditional settings, securing it in long-distance
surveillance scenarios presents a significant challenge. These scenarios often
feature low-quality face images, necessitating the modeling of data uncertainty
to improve stability under extreme conditions. To address this issue, this work
proposes Distributional Estimation (DisE), a method that converts traditional
FAS point estimation to distributional estimation by modeling data uncertainty
during training, including feature (mean) and uncertainty (variance). By
adjusting the learning strength of clean and noisy samples for stability and
accuracy, the learned uncertainty enhances DisE's performance. The method is
evaluated on SuHiFiMask [1], a large-scale and challenging FAS dataset in
surveillance scenarios. Results demonstrate that DisE achieves comparable
performance on both ACER and AUC metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Logistic regression is an algorithm widely used for binary classification in
various real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and
recommendation systems. However, training a logistic regression model with data
from different parties raises privacy concerns. Secure Multi-Party Computation
(MPC) is a cryptographic tool that allows multiple parties to train a logistic
regression model jointly without compromising privacy. The efficiency of the
online training phase becomes crucial when dealing with large-scale data in
practice. In this paper, we propose an online efficient protocol for
privacy-preserving logistic regression based on Function Secret Sharing (FSS).
Our protocols are designed in the two non-colluding servers setting and assume
the existence of a third-party dealer who only poses correlated randomness to
the computing parties. During the online phase, two servers jointly train a
logistic regression model on their private data by utilizing pre-generated
correlated randomness. Furthermore, we propose accurate and MPC-friendly
alternatives to the sigmoid function and encapsulate the logistic regression
training process into a function secret sharing gate. The online communication
overhead significantly decreases compared with the traditional secure logistic
regression training based on secret sharing. We provide both theoretical and
experimental analyses to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional semantic segmentation tasks require a large number of labels and
are difficult to identify unlearned categories. Few-shot semantic segmentation
(FSS) aims to use limited labeled support images to identify the segmentation
of new classes of objects, which is very practical in the real world. Previous
researches were primarily based on prototypes or correlations. Due to colors,
textures, and styles are similar in the same image, we argue that the query
image can be regarded as its own support image. In this paper, we proposed the
Target-aware Bi-Transformer Network (TBTNet) to equivalent treat of support
images and query image. A vigorous Target-aware Transformer Layer (TTL) also be
designed to distill correlations and force the model to focus on foreground
information. It treats the hypercorrelation as a feature, resulting a
significant reduction in the number of feature channels. Benefit from this
characteristic, our model is the lightest up to now with only 0.4M learnable
parameters. Futhermore, TBTNet converges in only 10% to 25% of the training
epochs compared to traditional methods. The excellent performance on standard
FSS benchmarks of PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i proves the efficiency of our method.
Extensive ablation studies were also carried out to evaluate the effectiveness
of Bi-Transformer architecture and TTL.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized programming and software
engineering. AI programming assistants such as GitHub Copilot X enable
conversational programming, narrowing the gap between human intent and code
generation. However, prior literature has identified a key challenge--there is
a gap between user's mental model of the system's understanding after a
sequence of natural language utterances, and the AI system's actual
understanding. To address this, we introduce Programming with Representations
(PwR), an approach that uses representations to convey the system's
understanding back to the user in natural language. We conducted an in-lab
task-centered study with 14 users of varying programming proficiency and found
that representations significantly improve understandability, and instilled a
sense of agency among our participants. Expert programmers use them for
verification, while intermediate programmers benefit from confirmation. Natural
language-based development with LLMs, coupled with representations, promises to
transform software development, making it more accessible and efficient.

textual query. The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap
between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited

Knowledge Transfer(CSKT) approach for TBPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's
knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring
(BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional
prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is
designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Self-Attention
(MHSA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism
promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing
knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across
three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4%
of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and
generalization.

Traditional text generation systems are trained in a supervised way, requiring

discrete search algorithms generate a sentence by maximizing the search

<p class="mathjax">The rise of advanced persistent threats (APTs) has marked a significant
cybersecurity challenge, characterized by sophisticated orchestration, stealthy
execution, extended persistence, and targeting valuable assets across diverse
sectors. Provenance graph-based kernel-level auditing has emerged as a
promising approach to enhance visibility and traceability within intricate
network environments. However, it still faces challenges including
reconstructing complex lateral attack chains, detecting dynamic evasion
behaviors, and defending smart adversarial subgraphs. To bridge the research
gap, this paper proposes an efficient and robust APT defense scheme leveraging
provenance graphs, including a network-level distributed audit model for
cost-effective lateral attack reconstruction, a trust-oriented APT evasion
behavior detection strategy, and a hidden Markov model based adversarial
subgraph defense approach. Through prototype implementation and extensive
experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our system. Lastly, crucial open

<p class="mathjax">In the era of information explosion, spatio-temporal data mining serves as a
critical part of urban management. Considering the various fields demanding
attention, e.g., traffic state, human activity, and social event, predicting
multiple spatio-temporal attributes simultaneously can alleviate regulatory
pressure and foster smart city construction. However, current research can not
handle the spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction well due to the complex
relationships between diverse attributes. The key challenge lies in how to
address the common spatio-temporal patterns while tackling their distinctions.
In this paper, we propose an effective solution for spatio-temporal
multi-attribute prediction, PromptST. We devise a spatio-temporal transformer
and a parameter-sharing training scheme to address the common knowledge among
different spatio-temporal attributes. Then, we elaborate a spatio-temporal
prompt tuning strategy to fit the specific attributes in a lightweight manner.
Through the pretrain and prompt tuning phases, our PromptST is able to enhance
the specific spatio-temoral characteristic capture by prompting the backbone
model to fit the specific target attribute while maintaining the learned common
knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify that our
PromptST attains state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also prove
PromptST owns good transferability on unseen spatio-temporal attributes, which
brings promising application potential in urban computing. The implementation
code is available to ease reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">Audio visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment the sounding objects for each
frame of a given video. To distinguish the sounding objects from silent ones,
both audio-visual semantic correspondence and temporal interaction are
required. The previous method applies multi-frame cross-modal attention to
conduct pixel-level interactions between audio features and visual features of
multiple frames simultaneously, which is both redundant and implicit. In this
paper, we propose an Audio-Queried Transformer architecture, AQFormer, where we
define a set of object queries conditioned on audio information and associate
each of them to particular sounding objects. Explicit object-level semantic
correspondence between audio and visual modalities is established by gathering
object information from visual features with predefined audio queries. Besides,
an Audio-Bridged Temporal Interaction module is proposed to exchange sounding
object-relevant information among multiple frames with the bridge of audio
features. Extensive experiments are conducted on two AVS benchmarks to show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, especially 7.1% M_J and
7.6% M_F gains on the MS3 setting.

<p class="mathjax">3D occupancy prediction holds significant promise in the fields of robot
perception and autonomous driving, which quantifies 3D scenes into grid cells
with semantic labels. Recent works mainly utilize complete occupancy labels in
3D voxel space for supervision. However, the expensive annotation process and
sometimes ambiguous labels have severely constrained the usability and
scalability of 3D occupancy models. To address this, we present RenderOcc, a
novel paradigm for training 3D occupancy models only using 2D labels.
Specifically, we extract a NeRF-style 3D volume representation from multi-view
images, and employ volume rendering techniques to establish 2D renderings, thus
enabling direct 3D supervision from 2D semantics and depth labels.
Additionally, we introduce an Auxiliary Ray method to tackle the issue of
sparse viewpoints in autonomous driving scenarios, which leverages sequential
frames to construct comprehensive 2D rendering for each object. To our best
knowledge, RenderOcc is the first attempt to train multi-view 3D occupancy
models only using 2D labels, reducing the dependence on costly 3D occupancy
annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RenderOcc achieves
comparable performance to models fully supervised with 3D labels, underscoring
the significance of this approach in real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">Graphic layout generation, a growing research field, plays a significant role
in user engagement and information perception. Existing methods primarily treat
layout generation as a numerical optimization task, focusing on quantitative
aspects while overlooking the semantic information of layout, such as the
relationship between each layout element. In this paper, we propose LayoutNUWA,
the first model that treats layout generation as a code generation task to
enhance semantic information and harness the hidden layout expertise of large
language models~(LLMs). More concretely, we develop a Code Instruct Tuning
(CIT) approach comprising three interconnected modules: 1) the Code
Initialization (CI) module quantifies the numerical conditions and initializes
them as HTML code with strategically placed masks; 2) the Code Completion (CC)
module employs the formatting knowledge of LLMs to fill in the masked portions
within the HTML code; 3) the Code Rendering (CR) module transforms the
completed code into the final layout output, ensuring a highly interpretable
and transparent layout generation procedure that directly maps code to a
visualized layout. We attain significant state-of-the-art performance (even
over 50\% improvements) on multiple datasets, showcasing the strong
capabilities of LayoutNUWA. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ProjectNUWA/LayoutNUWA.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models(LLMs) containing tens of billions of parameters (or
even more) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various NLP tasks.
However, substantial model size poses challenges to training, inference, and
deployment so that it is necessary to compress the model. At present, most
model compression for LLMs requires manual design of pruning features, which
has problems such as complex optimization pipeline and difficulty in retaining
the capabilities of certain parts of the model.Therefore, we propose a novel
pruning approach: firstly, a training set of a certain number of
architecture-accuracy pairs is established, and then a non-neural model is
trained as an accuracy predictor. Using the accuracy predictor to further
optimize the search space and search, the optimal model can be automatically
selected. Experiments show that our proposed approach is effective and
efficient. Compared with the baseline, the perplexity(PPL) on Wikitext2 and PTB
dropped by 9.48% and 5,76% respectively, and the average accuracy of MMLU
increased by 6.28%.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the framing of political issues is of paramount importance as
it significantly shapes how individuals perceive, interpret, and engage with
these matters. While prior research has independently explored framing within
news media and by social media users, there remains a notable gap in our
comprehension of the disparities in framing political issues between these two
distinct groups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive investigation,
focusing on the nuanced distinctions both qualitatively and quantitatively in
the framing of social media and traditional media outlets concerning a series
of American Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action, student loans, and
abortion rights. Our findings reveal that, while some overlap in framing exists
between social media and traditional media outlets, substantial differences
emerge both across various topics and within specific framing categories.
Compared to traditional news media, social media platforms tend to present more
polarized stances across all framing categories. Further, we observe
significant polarization in the news media's treatment (i.e., Left vs. Right
leaning media) of affirmative action and abortion rights, whereas the topic of
student loans tends to exhibit a greater degree of consensus. The disparities
in framing between traditional and social media platforms carry significant
implications for the formation of public opinion, policy decision-making, and
the broader political landscape.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the extremely low latency, events have been recently exploited to
supplement lost information for motion deblurring. Existing approaches largely
rely on the perfect pixel-wise alignment between intensity images and events,
which is not always fulfilled in the real world. To tackle this problem, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework, named NETwork of Event-based motion
Deblurring with STereo event and intensity cameras (St-EDNet), to recover
high-quality images directly from the misaligned inputs, consisting of a single
blurry image and the concurrent event streams. Specifically, the coarse spatial
alignment of the blurry image and the event streams is first implemented with a
cross-modal stereo matching module without the need for ground-truth depths.
Then, a dual-feature embedding architecture is proposed to gradually build the
fine bidirectional association of the coarsely aligned data and reconstruct the
sequence of the latent sharp images. Furthermore, we build a new dataset with
STereo Event and Intensity Cameras (StEIC), containing real-world events,
intensity images, and dense disparity maps. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network over state-of-the-art
methods.

<p class="mathjax">The volume and diversity of training data are critical for modern deep
learningbased methods. Compared to the massive amount of labeled perspective
images, 360 panoramic images fall short in both volume and diversity. In this
paper, we propose PanoMixSwap, a novel data augmentation technique specifically
designed for indoor panoramic images. PanoMixSwap explicitly mixes various
background styles, foreground furniture, and room layouts from the existing
indoor panorama datasets and generates a diverse set of new panoramic images to
enrich the datasets. We first decompose each panoramic image into its
constituent parts: background style, foreground furniture, and room layout.
Then, we generate an augmented image by mixing these three parts from three
different images, such as the foreground furniture from one image, the
background style from another image, and the room structure from the third
image. Our method yields high diversity since there is a cubical increase in
image combinations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of PanoMixSwap on two
indoor scene understanding tasks: semantic segmentation and layout estimation.
Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods trained with
PanoMixSwap outperform their original setting on both tasks consistently.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a sparse and privacy-enhanced representation for Human Pose
Estimation (HPE). Given a perspective camera, we use a proprietary motion
vector sensor(MVS) to extract an edge image and a two-directional motion vector
image at each time frame. Both edge and motion vector images are sparse and
contain much less information (i.e., enhancing human privacy). We advocate that
edge information is essential for HPE, and motion vectors complement edge
information during fast movements. We propose a fusion network leveraging
recent advances in sparse convolution used typically for 3D voxels to
efficiently process our proposed sparse representation, which achieves about
13x speed-up and 96% reduction in FLOPs. We collect an in-house edge and motion
vector dataset with 16 types of actions by 40 users using the proprietary MVS.
Our method outperforms individual modalities using only edge or motion vector
images. Finally, we validate the privacy-enhanced quality of our sparse
representation through face recognition on CelebA (a large face dataset) and a
user study on our in-house dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Federated training of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has become popular in
recent years due to its ability to perform graph-related tasks under data
isolation scenarios while preserving data privacy. However, graph heterogeneity
issues in federated GNN systems continue to pose challenges. Existing
frameworks address the problem by representing local tasks using different
statistics and relating them through a simple aggregation mechanism. However,
these approaches suffer from limited efficiency from two aspects: low quality
of task-relatedness quantification and inefficacy of exploiting the
collaboration structure. To address these issues, we propose FedGKD, a novel
federated GNN framework that utilizes a novel client-side graph dataset
distillation method to extract task features that better describe
task-relatedness, and introduces a novel server-side aggregation mechanism that
is aware of the global collaboration structure. We conduct extensive
experiments on six real-world datasets of different scales, demonstrating our
framework's outperformance.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing reliance on small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) for
Emergency Response Scenarios, such as Search and Rescue, the integration of
computer vision capabilities has become a key factor in mission success.
Nevertheless, computer vision performance for detecting humans severely
degrades when shifting from ground to aerial views. Several aerial datasets
have been created to mitigate this problem, however, none of them has
specifically addressed the issue of occlusion, a critical component in
Emergency Response Scenarios. Natural Occluded Multi-scale Aerial Dataset
(NOMAD) presents a benchmark for human detection under occluded aerial views,
with five different aerial distances and rich imagery variance. NOMAD is
composed of 100 different Actors, all performing sequences of walking, laying
and hiding. It includes 42,825 frames, extracted from 5.4k resolution videos,
and manually annotated with a bounding box and a label describing 10 different
visibility levels, categorized according to the percentage of the human body
visible inside the bounding box. This allows computer vision models to be
evaluated on their detection performance across different ranges of occlusion.
NOMAD is designed to improve the effectiveness of aerial search and rescue and
to enhance collaboration between sUAS and humans, by providing a new benchmark
dataset for human detection under occluded aerial views.

methods. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Directed fuzzing is a dynamic testing technique that focuses exploration on
specific, pre targeted program locations. Like other types of fuzzers, directed
fuzzers are most effective when maximizing testing speed and precision. To this
end, recent directed fuzzers have begun leveraging path pruning: preventing the
wasteful testing of program paths deemed irrelevant to reaching a desired
target location. Yet, despite code pruning's substantial speedup, current
approaches are imprecise failing to capture indirect control flow requiring
additional dynamic analyses that diminish directed fuzzers' speeds. Thus,
without code pruning that is both fast and precise, directed fuzzers'
effectiveness will continue to remain limited. This paper aims to tackle the
challenge of upholding both speed and precision in pruning-based directed
fuzzing. We show that existing pruning approaches fail to recover common case
indirect control flow; and identify opportunities to enhance them with
lightweight heuristics namely, function signature matching enabling them to
maximize precision without the burden of dynamic analysis. We implement our
enhanced pruning as a prototype, TOPr (Target Oriented Pruning), and evaluate
it against the leading pruning based and pruning agnostic directed fuzzers
SieveFuzz and AFLGo. We show that TOPr's enhanced pruning outperforms these
fuzzers in (1) speed (achieving 222% and 73% higher test case throughput,
respectively); (2) reachability (achieving 149% and 9% more target relevant
coverage, respectively); and (3) bug discovery time (triggering bugs faster 85%
and 8%, respectively). Furthermore, TOPr's balance of speed and precision
enables it to find 24 new bugs in 5 open source applications, with 18 confirmed
by developers, 12 bugs labelled as "Priority - 1. High", and 12 bugs fixed,
underscoring the effectiveness of our framework.

<p class="mathjax">End-to-end models, such as the neural Transducer, have been successful in
integrating acoustic and linguistic information jointly to achieve excellent
recognition performance. However, adapting these models with text-only data is
challenging. Factorized neural Transducer (FNT) aims to address this issue by
introducing a separate vocabulary decoder to predict the vocabulary, which can
effectively perform traditional text data adaptation. Nonetheless, this
approach has limitations in fusing acoustic and language information
seamlessly. Moreover, a degradation in word error rate (WER) on the general
test sets was also observed, leading to doubts about its overall performance.
In response to this challenge, we present an improved factorized neural
Transducer (IFNT) model structure designed to comprehensively integrate
acoustic and language information while enabling effective text adaptation. We
evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through in-domain experiments
on GigaSpeech and out-of-domain experiments adapting to EuroParl, TED-LIUM, and
Medical datasets. After text-only adaptation, IFNT yields 7.9% to 28.5%
relative WER improvements over the standard neural Transducer with shallow
fusion, and relative WER reductions ranging from 1.6% to 8.2% on the three test
sets compared to the FNT model.

<p class="mathjax">The malicious use and widespread dissemination of deepfake pose a significant
crisis of trust. Current deepfake detection models can generally recognize
forgery images by training on a large dataset. However, the accuracy of
detection models degrades significantly on images generated by new deepfake
methods due to the difference in data distribution. To tackle this issue, we
present a novel incremental learning framework that improves the generalization
of deepfake detection models by continual learning from a small number of new
samples. To cope with different data distributions, we propose to learn a
domain-invariant representation based on supervised contrastive learning,
preventing overfit to the insufficient new data. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, we regularize our model in both feature-level and label-level based
on a multi-perspective knowledge distillation approach. Finally, we propose to
select both central and hard representative samples to update the replay set,
which is beneficial for both domain-invariant representation learning and
rehearsal-based knowledge preserving. We conduct extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets, obtaining the new state-of-the-art average forgetting rate
of 7.01 and average accuracy of 85.49 on FF++, DFDC-P, DFD, and CDF2. Our code
is released at https://github.com/DeepFakeIL/DFIL.

education, and millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals possess advantages such as high
resolution and strong penetration capability. This paper introduces a highly
accurate and robust gesture recognition method using mmWave radar. The method
involves capturing the raw signals of hand movements with the mmWave radar
module and preprocessing the received radar signals, including Fourier
transformation, distance compression, Doppler processing, and noise reduction
through moving target indication (MTI). The preprocessed signals are then fed
into the Convolutional Neural Network-Time Domain Convolutional Network
(CNN-TCN) model to extract spatio-temporal features, with recognition
performance evaluated through classification. Experimental results demonstrate
that this method achieves an accuracy rate of 98.2% in domain-specific
recognition and maintains a consistently high recognition rate across different
neural networks, showcasing exceptional recognition performance and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchain technology is a breakthrough in changing the ways of business and
organization operations, in which the consensus problem is challenging with
practical constraints, such as computational power and consensus standard. In
this paper, a novel consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Prospect-Theory (PoPT)
is designed from the view of game theory, where the game prospect value is
considered as an important election criterion of the block-recorder. PoPT
portrays the popularity of a node in the network as an attribute, which is
constituted by the subjective sensibilities of nodes. Furthermore, the
performances of the PoPT and the willingness of ordinary nodes to participate
in the consensus are analyzed, exploring fairness, decentralization,
credibility, and the motivating ability of the consensus mechanism. Finally,
numerical simulations with optimization of the PoPT consensus mechanism are
demonstrated in the scenario of a smart grid system to illustrate the
effectiveness of the PoPT.

<p class="mathjax">We explore how continued pre-training on domain-specific corpora influences
large language models, revealing that training on the raw corpora endows the
model with domain knowledge, but drastically hurts its prompting ability for
question answering. Taken inspiration from human learning via reading
comprehension--practice after reading improves the ability to answer questions
based on the learned knowledge--we propose a simple method for transforming raw
corpora into reading comprehension texts. Each raw text is enriched with a
series of tasks related to its content. Our method, highly scalable and
applicable to any pre-training corpora, consistently enhances performance
across various tasks in three different domains: biomedicine, finance, and law.
Notably, our 7B language model achieves competitive performance with
domain-specific models of much larger scales, such as BloombergGPT-50B.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-specific reading comprehension texts
can improve the model's performance even on general benchmarks, showing the
potential to develop a general model across even more domains. Our model, code,
and data will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps.

<p class="mathjax">Composed image retrieval is a type of image retrieval task where the user
provides a reference image as a starting point and specifies a text on how to
shift from the starting point to the desired target image. However, most
existing methods focus on the composition learning of text and reference images
and oversimplify the text as a description, neglecting the inherent structure
and the user's shifting intention of the texts. As a result, these methods
typically take shortcuts that disregard the visual cue of the reference images.
To address this issue, we reconsider the text as instructions and propose a
Semantic Shift network (SSN) that explicitly decomposes the semantic shifts
into two steps: from the reference image to the visual prototype and from the
visual prototype to the target image. Specifically, SSN explicitly decomposes
the instructions into two components: degradation and upgradation, where the
degradation is used to picture the visual prototype from the reference image,
while the upgradation is used to enrich the visual prototype into the final
representations to retrieve the desired target image. The experimental results
show that the proposed SSN demonstrates a significant improvement of 5.42% and
1.37% on the CIRR and FashionIQ datasets, respectively, and establishes a new
state-of-the-art performance. Codes will be publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers have convincingly demonstrated high learning capability for video
action recognition on large datasets. Nevertheless, deep models often suffer
from the overfitting effect on small-scale datasets with a limited number of
training videos. A common solution is to exploit the existing image
augmentation strategies for each frame individually including Mixup, Cutmix,
and RandAugment, which are not particularly optimized for video data. In this
paper, we propose a novel video augmentation strategy named Selective Volume
Mixup (SV-Mix) to improve the generalization ability of deep models with
limited training videos. SV-Mix devises a learnable selective module to choose
the most informative volumes from two videos and mixes the volumes up to
achieve a new training video. Technically, we propose two new modules, i.e., a
spatial selective module to select the local patches for each spatial position,
and a temporal selective module to mix the entire frames for each timestamp and
maintain the spatial pattern. At each time, we randomly choose one of the two
modules to expand the diversity of training samples. The selective modules are
jointly optimized with the video action recognition framework to find the
optimal augmentation strategy. We empirically demonstrate the merits of the
SV-Mix augmentation on a wide range of video action recognition benchmarks and
consistently boot the performances of both CNN-based and transformer-based
models.

<p class="mathjax">The information diffusion prediction on social networks aims to predict
future recipients of a message, with practical applications in marketing and
social media. While different prediction models all claim to perform well,
general frameworks for performance evaluation remain limited. Here, we aim to
identify a performance characteristic curve for a model, which captures its
performance on tasks of different complexity. We propose a metric based on
information entropy to quantify the randomness in diffusion data, then identify
a scaling pattern between the randomness and the prediction accuracy of the
model. Data points in the patterns by different sequence lengths, system sizes,
and randomness all collapse into a single curve, capturing a model's inherent
capability of making correct predictions against increased uncertainty. Given
that this curve has such important properties that it can be used to evaluate
the model, we define it as the performance characteristic curve of the model.
The validity of the curve is tested by three prediction models in the same
family, reaching conclusions in line with existing studies. Also, the curve is
successfully applied to evaluate two distinct models from the literature. Our
work reveals a pattern underlying the data randomness and prediction accuracy.
The performance characteristic curve provides a new way to systematically
evaluate models' performance, and sheds light on future studies on other
frameworks for model evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperledger Fabric is one of the most popular permissioned blockchain
platforms. Although many existing works on the overall system performance of
Hyperledger Fabric are available, a decomposition of each phase in Hyperledger
Fabric remains to be explored. Admittedly, the overall system performance of
Hyperledger Fabric might provide an end-user with satisfied performance
information when invoking a transaction; however, it is far from informative
when deploying a distributed system with specific performance goals, except for
understanding each phase in Hyperledger Fabric. In this paper, we develop a
measurement framework to characterize each phase's transaction and block data
in Hyperledger Fabric based on the Fabric SDK Nodejs, where we thoroughly
analyze and open source the implementation details of the measurement
framework. We evaluate the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and have some
interesting observations; 1. The number of CPU cores has a linear impact on the
throughput of an endorsing peer. 2. The Raft-based ordering service shows good
scalability with the number of ordering service nodes. 3. The communication
latencies between the client and service in Hyperledger Fabric are significant.
We then identify each phase's dominant latency in Hyperledger Fabric via
primitive operation analysis and propose a stochastic computation model for
performance analysis. We also use the alpha-beta communication model to analyze
the corresponding communication latency. Finally, we validate the accuracy of
the performance model on both local and cloud clusters. The experiment results
and the performance model help guide the deployment of the Hyperledger Fabric
service.

<p class="mathjax">The human brain can self-organize rich and diverse sparse neural pathways to
incrementally master hundreds of cognitive tasks. However, most existing
continual learning algorithms for deep artificial and spiking neural networks
are unable to adequately auto-regulate the limited resources in the network,
which leads to performance drop along with energy consumption rise as the
increase of tasks. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired continual
learning algorithm with adaptive reorganization of neural pathways, which
employs Self-Organizing Regulation networks to reorganize the single and
limited Spiking Neural Network (SOR-SNN) into rich sparse neural pathways to
efficiently cope with incremental tasks. The proposed model demonstrates
consistent superiority in performance, energy consumption, and memory capacity
on diverse continual learning tasks ranging from child-like simple to complex
tasks, as well as on generalized CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. In particular,
the SOR-SNN model excels at learning more complex tasks as well as more tasks,
and is able to integrate the past learned knowledge with the information from
the current task, showing the backward transfer ability to facilitate the old
tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed model exhibits self-repairing ability to
irreversible damage and for pruned networks, could automatically allocate new
pathway from the retained network to recover memory for forgotten knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to
recognize rare name entities, such as personal names, organizations, or
technical terms that are not frequently encountered in the training data. This
paper presents Contextual Biasing Whisper (CB-Whisper), a novel ASR system
based on OpenAI's Whisper model that performs keyword-spotting (KWS) before the
decoder. The KWS module leverages text-to-speech (TTS) techniques and a
convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to match the features between the
entities and the utterances. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating
predicted entities into a carefully designed spoken form prompt, the
mixed-error-rate (MER) and entity recall of the Whisper model is significantly
improved on three internal datasets and two open-sourced datasets that cover
English-only, Chinese-only, and code-switching scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The excellent text-to-image synthesis capability of diffusion models has
driven progress in synthesizing coherent visual stories. The current
state-of-the-art method combines the features of historical captions,
historical frames, and the current captions as conditions for generating the
current frame. However, this method treats each historical frame and caption as
the same contribution. It connects them in order with equal weights, ignoring
that not all historical conditions are associated with the generation of the
current frame. To address this issue, we propose Causal-Story. This model
incorporates a local causal attention mechanism that considers the causal
relationship between previous captions, frames, and current captions. By
assigning weights based on this relationship, Causal-Story generates the
current frame, thereby improving the global consistency of story generation. We
evaluated our model on the PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and obtained
state-of-the-art FID scores, and the generated frames also demonstrate better
storytelling in visuals. The source code of Causal-Story can be obtained from
https://github.com/styufo/Causal-Story.

<p class="mathjax">Grasping occluded objects in cluttered environments is an essential component
in complex robotic manipulation tasks. In this paper, we introduce an
AffordanCE-driven Next-Best-View planning policy (ACE-NBV) that tries to find a
feasible grasp for target object via continuously observing scenes from new
viewpoints. This policy is motivated by the observation that the grasp
affordances of an occluded object can be better-measured under the view when
the view-direction are the same as the grasp view. Specifically, our method
leverages the paradigm of novel view imagery to predict the grasps affordances
under previously unobserved view, and select next observation view based on the
gain of the highest imagined grasp quality of the target object. The
experimental results in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed affordance-driven next-best-view planning policy.
Additional results, code, and videos of real robot experiments can be found in
the supplementary materials.

<p class="mathjax">How well can large language models (LLMs) generate summaries? We develop new
datasets and conduct human evaluation experiments to evaluate the zero-shot
generation capability of LLMs across five distinct summarization tasks. Our
findings indicate a clear preference among human evaluators for LLM-generated
summaries over human-written summaries and summaries generated by fine-tuned
models. Specifically, LLM-generated summaries exhibit better factual
consistency and fewer instances of extrinsic hallucinations. Due to the
satisfactory performance of LLMs in summarization tasks (even surpassing the
benchmark of reference summaries), we believe that most conventional works in
the field of text summarization are no longer necessary in the era of LLMs.
However, we recognize that there are still some directions worth exploring,
such as the creation of novel datasets with higher quality and more reliable
evaluation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Shaping first year students' mind to help them master abstraction skills is
as crucial as it is challenging. Although abstraction is a key competence in
problem-solving (in particular in STEM disciplines), students are often found
to rush that process because they find it hard and do not get any direct
outcome out of it. They prefer to invest their efforts directly in a concrete
ground, rather than using abstraction to create a solution.
<br />To overcome that situation, in the context of our CS1 course, we implemented
a tool called CAF\'E 2.0. It allows students to actively and regularly practice
(thanks to a longitudinal activity) their abstraction skills through a
graphical programming methodology. Moreover, further than reviewing students'
final implementation, CAF\'E 2.0 produces a personalized feedback on how
students modeled their solution, and on how consistent it is with their final
code. This paper describes CAF\'E 2.0 in a general setting and also provides a
concrete example in our CS1 course context. This paper also assesses students'
interaction with CAF\'E 2.0 through perception and participation data. Finally,
we explain how CAF\'E 2.0 could extended in another context than a CS1 course.

<p class="mathjax">Unlike in natural images, in endoscopy there is no clear notion of an
up-right camera orientation. Endoscopic videos therefore often contain large
rotational motions, which require keypoint detection and description algorithms
to be robust to these conditions. While most classical methods achieve
rotation-equivariant detection and invariant description by design, many
learning-based approaches learn to be robust only up to a certain degree. At
the same time learning-based methods under moderate rotations often outperform
classical approaches. In order to address this shortcoming, in this paper we
propose RIDE, a learning-based method for rotation-equivariant detection and
invariant description. Following recent advancements in group-equivariant
learning, RIDE models rotation-equivariance implicitly within its architecture.
Trained in a self-supervised manner on a large curation of endoscopic images,
RIDE requires no manual labeling of training data. We test RIDE in the context
of surgical tissue tracking on the SuPeR dataset as well as in the context of
relative pose estimation on a repurposed version of the SCARED dataset. In
addition we perform explicit studies showing its robustness to large rotations.
Our comparison against recent learning-based and classical approaches shows
that RIDE sets a new state-of-the-art performance on matching and relative pose
estimation tasks and scores competitively on surgical tissue tracking.

<p class="mathjax">Small CNN-based models usually require transferring knowledge from a large
model before they are deployed in computationally resource-limited edge
devices. Masked image modeling (MIM) methods achieve great success in various
visual tasks but remain largely unexplored in knowledge distillation for
heterogeneous deep models. The reason is mainly due to the significant
discrepancy between the Transformer-based large model and the CNN-based small
network. In this paper, we develop the first Heterogeneous Generative Knowledge
Distillation (H-GKD) based on MIM, which can efficiently transfer knowledge
from large Transformer models to small CNN-based models in a generative
self-supervised fashion. Our method builds a bridge between Transformer-based
models and CNNs by training a UNet-style student with sparse convolution, which
can effectively mimic the visual representation inferred by a teacher over
masked modeling. Our method is a simple yet effective learning paradigm to
learn the visual representation and distribution of data from heterogeneous
teacher models, which can be pre-trained using advanced generative methods.
Extensive experiments show that it adapts well to various models and sizes,
consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in image classification,
object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. For example, in the Imagenet
1K dataset, H-GKD improves the accuracy of Resnet50 (sparse) from 76.98% to
80.01%.

<p class="mathjax">Data assimilation is crucial in a wide range of applications, but it often
faces challenges such as high computational costs due to data dimensionality
and incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms. To address these
challenges, this study presents a novel assimilation framework, termed Latent
Assimilation with Implicit Neural Representations (LAINR). By introducing
Spherical Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) along with a data-driven
uncertainty estimator of the trained neural networks, LAINR enhances efficiency
in assimilation process. Experimental results indicate that LAINR holds certain
advantage over existing methods based on AutoEncoders, both in terms of
accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Most NLP tasks are modeled as supervised learning and thus require labeled
training data to train effective models. However, manually producing such data
at sufficient quality and quantity is known to be costly and time-intensive.
Current research addresses this bottleneck by exploring a novel paradigm called
zero-shot learning via dataset generation. Here, a powerful LLM is prompted
with a task description to generate labeled data that can be used to train a
downstream NLP model. For instance, an LLM might be prompted to "generate 500
movie reviews with positive overall sentiment, and another 500 with negative
sentiment." The generated data could then be used to train a binary sentiment
classifier, effectively leveraging an LLM as a teacher to a smaller student
model. With this demo, we introduce Fabricator, an open-source Python toolkit
for dataset generation. Fabricator implements common dataset generation
workflows, supports a wide range of downstream NLP tasks (such as text
classification, question answering, and entity recognition), and is integrated
with well-known libraries to facilitate quick experimentation. With Fabricator,
we aim to support researchers in conducting reproducible dataset generation
experiments using LLMs and help practitioners apply this approach to train
models for downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">U-space as defined by the European Commission is a set of new services
relying on a high level of digitalization and automation of functions and
specific procedures, designed to provide safe, efficient and secure access to
airspace for large numbers of unmanned aircraft, operating automatically and
even beyond visual line of sight. This kind of concepts of operations (ConOps)
of airspace integration for drones and air taxis are also called UTM (Unmanned
aircraft system Traffic Management) systems, being U-space the UTM ConOps
agreed for Europe. U-space services are under development but commercially not
available yet. For demonstration purposes, in the project HorizonUAM, a central
U-space cloud service is simulated through a local messaging server using the
protocol MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport). A prototypical vertidrome
management tool was created to demonstrate the scheduling and sequencing of air
taxi flights. The vertidrome manager is fully integrated within U-space and
receives real-time information on flight plans, including requests for start

<p class="mathjax">A reliable deepfake detector or spoofing countermeasure (CM) should be robust
in the face of unpredictable spoofing attacks. To encourage the learning of
more generaliseable artefacts, rather than those specific only to known
attacks, CMs are usually exposed to a broad variety of different attacks during
training. Even so, the performance of deep-learning-based CM solutions are
known to vary, sometimes substantially, when they are retrained with different
initialisations, hyper-parameters or training data partitions. We show in this
paper that the potency of spoofing attacks, also deep-learning-based, can
similarly vary according to training conditions, sometimes resulting in
substantial degradations to detection performance. Nevertheless, while a
RawNet2 CM model is vulnerable when only modest adjustments are made to the
attack algorithm, those based upon graph attention networks and self-supervised
learning are reassuringly robust. The focus upon training data generated with
different attack algorithms might not be sufficient on its own to ensure
generaliability; some form of spoofing attack augmentation at the algorithm
level can be complementary.

<p class="mathjax">The surge of deep-space probes makes it unsustainable to navigate them with
standard radiometric tracking. Self-driving interplanetary satellites represent
a solution to this problem. In this work, a full vision-based navigation
algorithm is built by combining an orbit determination method with an image
processing pipeline suitable for interplanetary transfers of autonomous
platforms. To increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, a
non-dimensional extended Kalman filter is selected as state estimator, fed by
the positions of the planets extracted from deep-space images. An enhancement
of the estimation accuracy is performed by applying an optimal strategy to
select the best pair of planets to track. Moreover, a novel analytical
measurement model for deep-space navigation is developed providing a
first-order approximation of the light-aberration and light-time effects.
Algorithm performance is tested on a high-fidelity, Earth--Mars interplanetary
transfer, showing the algorithm applicability for deep-space navigation.

<p class="mathjax">Generalized zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (GZSSAR) is a new
challenging problem in computer vision community, which requires models to
recognize actions without any training samples. Previous studies only utilize
the action labels of verb phrases as the semantic prototypes for learning the
mapping from skeleton-based actions to a shared semantic space. However, the
limited semantic information of action labels restricts the generalization
ability of skeleton features for recognizing unseen actions. In order to solve
this dilemma, we propose a multi-semantic fusion (MSF) model for improving the
performance of GZSSAR, where two kinds of class-level textual descriptions
(i.e., action descriptions and motion descriptions), are collected as auxiliary
semantic information to enhance the learning efficacy of generalizable skeleton
features. Specially, a pre-trained language encoder takes the action
descriptions, motion descriptions and original class labels as inputs to obtain
rich semantic features for each action class, while a skeleton encoder is
implemented to extract skeleton features. Then, a variational autoencoder (VAE)
based generative module is performed to learn a cross-modal alignment between
skeleton and semantic features. Finally, a classification module is built to
recognize the action categories of input samples, where a seen-unseen
classification gate is adopted to predict whether the sample comes from seen
action classes or not in GZSSAR. The superior performance in comparisons with
previous models validates the effectiveness of the proposed MSF model on
GZSSAR.

<p class="mathjax">In the expanding landscape of AI-enabled robotics, robust quantification of
predictive uncertainties is of great importance. Three-dimensional (3D) object
detection, a critical robotics operation, has seen significant advancements;
however, the majority of current works focus only on accuracy and ignore
uncertainty quantification. Addressing this gap, our novel study integrates the
principles of conformal inference (CI) with information theoretic measures to
perform lightweight, Monte Carlo-free uncertainty estimation within a
multimodal framework. Through a multivariate Gaussian product of the latent
variables in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), features from RGB camera and
LiDAR sensor data are fused to improve the prediction accuracy. Normalized
mutual information (NMI) is leveraged as a modulator for calibrating
uncertainty bounds derived from CI based on a weighted loss function. Our
simulation results show an inverse correlation between inherent predictive
uncertainty and NMI throughout the model's training. The framework demonstrates
comparable or better performance in KITTI 3D object detection benchmarks to
similar methods that are not uncertainty-aware, making it suitable for
real-time edge robotics.

of finite-dimensional commutative $\mathbb{F}$-algebras which admit an
$\mathbb{F}$-valued trace. In fact, in these cases, we explicitly construct a
trace map. The existence of an $\mathbb{F}$-valued trace on a finite

<p class="mathjax">The process of self-morphing in curved surfaces found in nature, such as with
the growth of flowers and leaves, has generated interest in the study of
self-morphing bilayers, which has been used in many soft robots or switchers.
However, previous research has primarily focused on materials or bilayer
fabrication technologies. The self-morphing mechanism and process have been
rarely investigated, despite their importance. This study proposed a new
deformation simulation method for self-morphing bilayers based on a
checkerboard-based discrete differential geometry approach. This new method
achieved higher efficiency than traditional finite element methods while still
maintaining accuracy. It was also effective in handling complex finite strain
situations. Finally, the simulation model was used to design three
self-morphing bilayers inspired by folding flowers, spiral grass, and conical
seashells. These designs further prove the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results of this study propose a good method for predicting
deformation and designing self-morphing bilayers and provide a useful viewpoint
for using geometrical methods to solve mechanical problems.

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in deep learning-based 3D object detection necessitate the
availability of large-scale datasets. However, this requirement introduces the
challenge of manual annotation, which is often both burdensome and
time-consuming. To tackle this issue, the literature has seen the emergence of
several weakly supervised frameworks for 3D object detection which can
automatically generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Nevertheless, these
generated pseudo labels contain noise and are not as accurate as those labeled
by humans. In this paper, we present the first approach that addresses the
inherent ambiguities present in pseudo labels by introducing an Evidential Deep
Learning (EDL) based uncertainty estimation framework. Specifically, we propose
MEDL-U, an EDL framework based on MTrans, which not only generates pseudo
labels but also quantifies the associated uncertainties. However, applying EDL
to 3D object detection presents three primary challenges: (1) relatively lower
pseudolabel quality in comparison to other autolabelers; (2) excessively high
evidential uncertainty estimates; and (3) lack of clear interpretability and
effective utilization of uncertainties for downstream tasks. We tackle these
issues through the introduction of an uncertainty-aware IoU-based loss, an
evidence-aware multi-task loss function, and the implementation of a
post-processing stage for uncertainty refinement. Our experimental results
demonstrate that probabilistic detectors trained using the outputs of MEDL-U
surpass deterministic detectors trained using outputs from previous 3D
annotators on the KITTI val set for all difficulty levels. Moreover, MEDL-U
achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI official test set compared to
existing 3D automatic annotators.

<p class="mathjax">Existing propositions often rely on logical constants for classification.
Compared with Western languages that lean towards hypotaxis such as English,
Chinese often relies on semantic or logical understanding rather than logical
connectives in daily expressions, exhibiting the characteristics of parataxis.
However, existing research has rarely paid attention to this issue. And
accurately classifying these propositions is crucial for natural language
understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we put forward the concepts of
explicit and implicit propositions and propose a comprehensive multi-level
proposition classification system based on linguistics and logic.
Correspondingly, we create a large-scale Chinese proposition dataset PEACE from
multiple domains, covering all categories related to propositions. To evaluate
the Chinese proposition classification ability of existing models and explore
their limitations, We conduct evaluations on PEACE using several different
methods including the Rule-based method, SVM, BERT, RoBERTA, and ChatGPT.
Results show the importance of properly modeling the semantic features of
propositions. BERT has relatively good proposition classification capability,
but lacks cross-domain transferability. ChatGPT performs poorly, but its
classification ability can be improved by providing more proposition
information. Many issues are still far from being resolved and require further
study.

portability and performance of the SYCL and CUDA languages for one fundamental
bioinformatics application (Smith-Waterman protein database search) across
different GPU architectures, considering single and multi-GPU configurations

<p class="mathjax">As the most critical components in a sentence, subject, predicate and object
require special attention in the video captioning task. To implement this idea,
we design a novel framework, named COllaborative three-Stream Transformers
(COST), to model the three parts separately and complement each other for
better representation. Specifically, COST is formed by three branches of
transformers to exploit the visual-linguistic interactions of different
granularities in spatial-temporal domain between videos and text, detected
objects and text, and actions and text. Meanwhile, we propose a
cross-granularity attention module to align the interactions modeled by the
three branches of transformers, then the three branches of transformers can
support each other to exploit the most discriminative semantic information of
different granularities for accurate predictions of captions. The whole model
is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments conducted on three
large-scale challenging datasets, i.e., YouCookII, ActivityNet Captions and
MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently achieved
remarkable results in conditional and unconditional image generation. The
pre-trained models can be adapted without further training to different
downstream tasks, by guiding their iterative denoising process at inference
time to satisfy additional constraints. For the specific task of image
inpainting, the current guiding mechanism relies on copying-and-pasting the
known regions from the input image at each denoising step. However, diffusion
models are strongly conditioned by the initial random noise, and therefore
struggle to harmonize predictions inside the inpainting mask with the real
parts of the input image, often producing results with unnatural artifacts.
<br />Our method, dubbed GradPaint, steers the generation towards a globally
coherent image. At each step in the denoising process, we leverage the model's
"denoised image estimation" by calculating a custom loss measuring its
coherence with the masked input image. Our guiding mechanism uses the gradient
obtained from backpropagating this loss through the diffusion model itself.
GradPaint generalizes well to diffusion models trained on various datasets,
improving upon current state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">Next activity prediction aims to forecast the future behavior of running
process instances. Recent publications in this field predominantly employ deep
learning techniques and evaluate their prediction performance using publicly
available event logs. This paper presents empirical evidence that calls into
question the effectiveness of these current evaluation approaches. We show that
there is an enormous amount of example leakage in all of the commonly used
event logs, so that rather trivial prediction approaches perform almost as well
as ones that leverage deep learning. We further argue that designing robust
evaluations requires a more profound conceptual engagement with the topic of
next-activity prediction, and specifically with the notion of generalization to
new data. To this end, we present various prediction scenarios that necessitate
different types of generalization to guide future research.

<p class="mathjax">High-risk operational tasks such as those in aviation require training
environments that are realistic and capable of inducing high levels of
workload. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a simulated 3D environment for immersive,
safe and valid training of pilots. An added advantage of such training
environments is that they can be personalized to enhance learning, e.g., by
adapting the simulation to the user's workload in real-time. The question
remains how to reliably and robustly measure a pilot's workload during the
training. In this study, six novice military pilots (average of 34.33 flight
hours) conducted a speed change maneuver in a VR flight simulator. In half of
the runs an auditory 2-back task was added as a secondary task. This led to
trials of low and high workload which we compared using the pilot's control
input in longitudinal (i.e., pitch) and lateral (i.e., roll) directions. We
extracted Pilot Inceptor Workload (PIW) from the stick data and conducted a
binary logistic regression to determine whether PIW is predictive of
task-induced workload. The results show that inputs on the stick along its
longitudinal direction were predictive of workload (low vs. high) when
performing a speed change maneuver. Given that PIW may be a task-specific
measure, future work may consider (neuro)physiological predictors. Nonetheless,
the current paper provides evidence that measuring PIW in a VR flight simulator
yields real-time and non-invasive means to determine workload.

<p class="mathjax">Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with offset quadrature
amplitude modulation (OQAM) has been widely discussed in the literature and is
considered a popular waveform for 5th generation (5G) wireless
telecommunications and beyond. In this work, we show that OFDM-OQAM can be
generated using the Hilbert transform and is equivalent to single sideband
modulation (SSB), that has roots in analog telecommunications. The transmit
filter for OFDM-OQAM is complex valued whose real part is given by the pulse
corresponding to the root raised cosine spectrum and the imaginary part is the
Hilbert transform of the real part. The real-valued digital information
(message) are passed through the transmit filter and frequency division
multiplexed on orthogonal subcarriers. The message bandwidth corresponding to
each subcarrier is assumed to be narrow enough so that the channel can be
considered ideal. Therefore, at the receiver, a matched filter can used to
recover the message. Turbo coding is used to achieve bit-error-rate (BER) as
low as $10^{-5}$ at an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit close to 0
db. The system has been simulated in discrete time.

<p class="mathjax">The inference of topological principles is a key problem in structured
reconstruction. We observe that wrongly predicted topological relationships are
often incurred by the lack of holistic geometry clues in low-level features.
Inspired by the fact that massive signals can be compactly described with
frequency analysis, we experimentally explore the efficiency and tendency of
learning structure geometry in the frequency domain. Accordingly, we propose a
frequency-domain feature learning strategy (F-Learn) to fuse scattered
geometric fragments holistically for topology-intact structure reasoning.
Benefiting from the parsimonious design, the F-Learn strategy can be easily
deployed into a deep reconstructor with a lightweight model modification.
Experiments demonstrate that the F-Learn strategy can effectively introduce
structure awareness into geometric primitive detection and topology inference,
bringing significant performance improvement to final structured
reconstruction. Code and pre-trained models are available at
https://github.com/Geo-Tell/F-Learn.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces the HumTrans dataset, which is publicly available and
primarily designed for humming melody transcription. The dataset can also serve
as a foundation for downstream tasks such as humming melody based music
generation. It consists of 500 musical compositions of different genres and
languages, with each composition divided into multiple segments. In total, the
dataset comprises 1000 music segments. To collect this humming dataset, we
employed 10 college students, all of whom are either music majors or proficient
in playing at least one musical instrument. Each of them hummed every segment
twice using the web recording interface provided by our designed website. The
humming recordings were sampled at a frequency of 44,100 Hz. During the humming
session, the main interface provides a musical score for students to reference,
with the melody audio playing simultaneously to aid in capturing both melody
and rhythm. The dataset encompasses approximately 56.22 hours of audio, making
it the largest known humming dataset to date. The dataset will be released on
Hugging Face, and we will provide a GitHub repository containing baseline
results and evaluation codes.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel framework for electrolaryngeal speech intelligibility
enhancement through the use of robust linguistic encoders. Pretraining and
fine-tuning approaches have proven to work well in this task, but in most
cases, various mismatches, such as the speech type mismatch (electrolaryngeal
vs. typical) or a speaker mismatch between the datasets used in each stage, can
deteriorate the conversion performance of this framework. To resolve this
issue, we propose a linguistic encoder robust enough to project both EL and
typical speech in the same latent space, while still being able to extract
accurate linguistic information, creating a unified representation to reduce
the speech type mismatch. Furthermore, we introduce HuBERT output features to
the proposed framework for reducing the speaker mismatch, making it possible to
effectively use a large-scale parallel dataset during pretraining. We show that
compared to the conventional framework using mel-spectrogram input and output
features, using the proposed framework enables the model to synthesize more
intelligible and naturally sounding speech, as shown by a significant 16%
improvement in character error rate and 0.83 improvement in naturalness score.

their journeys on many popular apps and websites. While substantial efforts
from the research community in the last five years have led to consolidated
taxonomies of dark patterns, including an emerging ontology, most applications
of these descriptors have been focused on analysis of static images or as
isolated pattern types. In this paper, we present a case study of Amazon
Prime's "Iliad Flow" to illustrate the interplay of dark patterns across a user
journey, grounded in insights from a US Federal Trade Commission complaint
against the company. We use this case study to lay the groundwork for a
methodology of Temporal Analysis of Dark Patterns (TADP), including
considerations for characterization of individual dark patterns across a user

<p class="mathjax">Identification of cracks is essential to assess the structural integrity of
concrete infrastructure. However, robust crack segmentation remains a
challenging task for computer vision systems due to the diverse appearance of
concrete surfaces, variable lighting and weather conditions, and the
overlapping of different defects. In particular recent data-driven methods
struggle with the limited availability of data, the fine-grained and
time-consuming nature of crack annotation, and face subsequent difficulty in
generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we move past these
challenges in a two-fold way. We introduce a high-fidelity crack graphics
simulator based on fractals and a corresponding fully-annotated crack dataset.
We then complement the latter with a system that learns generalizable
representations from simulation, by leveraging both a pointwise mutual
information estimate along with adaptive instance normalization as inductive
biases. Finally, we empirically highlight how different design choices are
symbiotic in bridging the simulation to real gap, and ultimately demonstrate
that our introduced system can effectively handle real-world crack
segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the decision-making process of a machine/deep learning model is
crucial, particularly in security-sensitive applications. In this study, we
introduce a neural network framework that combines the global and exact
interpretability properties of rule-based models with the high performance of
deep neural networks.
<br />Our proposed framework, called $\textit{Truth Table rules}$ (TT-rules), is
built upon $\textit{Truth Table nets}$ (TTnets), a family of deep neural
networks initially developed for formal verification. By extracting the set of
necessary and sufficient rules $\mathcal{R}$ from the trained TTnet model
(global interpretability), yielding the same output as the TTnet (exact
interpretability), TT-rules effectively transforms the neural network into a
rule-based model. This rule-based model supports binary classification,
multi-label classification, and regression tasks for tabular datasets.
Furthermore, our TT-rules framework optimizes the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ into
$\mathcal{R}_{opt}$ by reducing the number and size of the rules. To enhance
model interpretation, we leverage Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
(ROBDDs) to visualize these rules effectively.
<br />After outlining the framework, we evaluate the performance of TT-rules on
seven tabular datasets from finance, healthcare, and justice domains. We also
compare the TT-rules framework to state-of-the-art rule-based methods. Our
results demonstrate that TT-rules achieves equal or higher performance compared
to other interpretable methods while maintaining a balance between performance
and complexity. Notably, TT-rules presents the first accurate rule-based model
capable of fitting large tabular datasets, including two real-life DNA datasets
with over 20K features. Finally, we extensively investigate a rule-based model
derived from TT-rules using the Adult dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Deceptive and coercive design practices are increasingly used by companies to
extract profit, harvest data, and limit consumer choice. Dark patterns
represent the most common contemporary amalgamation of these problematic
practices, connecting designers, technologists, scholars, regulators, and legal
professionals in transdisciplinary dialogue. However, a lack of universally
accepted definitions across the academic, legislative and regulatory space has
likely limited the impact that scholarship on dark patterns might have in
supporting sanctions and evolved design practices. In this paper, we seek to
support the development of a shared language of dark patterns, harmonizing ten
existing regulatory and academic taxonomies of dark patterns and proposing a
three-level ontology with standardized definitions for 65 synthesized dark
patterns types across low-, meso-, and high-level patterns. We illustrate how
this ontology can support translational research and regulatory action,
including pathways to extend our initial types through new empirical work and
map across application domains.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a smart handheld textural sensing medical device with
complementary Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to enable on-site Colorectal
Cancer (CRC) polyp diagnosis and pathology of excised tumors. The proposed
unique handheld edge device benefits from a unique tactile sensing module and a
dual-stage machine learning algorithms (composed of a dilated residual network
and a t-SNE engine) for polyp type and stiffness characterization. Solely
utilizing the occlusion-free, illumination-resilient textural images captured
by the proposed tactile sensor, the framework is able to sensitively and
reliably identify the type and stage of CRC polyps by classifying their texture
and stiffness, respectively. Moreover, the proposed handheld medical edge
device benefits from internet connectivity for enabling remote digital
pathology (boosting the diagnosis in operating rooms and promoting
accessibility and equity in medical diagnosis).

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based methods have been extensively explored for automatic
building mapping from high-resolution remote sensing images over recent years.
While most building mapping models produce vector polygons of buildings for
geographic and mapping systems, dominant methods typically decompose polygonal
building extraction in some sub-problems, including segmentation,
polygonization, and regularization, leading to complex inference procedures,
low accuracy, and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a simple and
novel building mapping method with Hierarchical Transformers, called HiT,
improving polygonal building mapping quality from high-resolution remote
sensing images. HiT builds on a two-stage detection architecture by adding a
polygon head parallel to classification and bounding box regression heads. HiT
simultaneously outputs building bounding boxes and vector polygons, which is
fully end-to-end trainable. The polygon head formulates a building polygon as
serialized vertices with the bidirectional characteristic, a simple and elegant
polygon representation avoiding the start or end vertex hypothesis. Under this
new perspective, the polygon head adopts a transformer encoder-decoder
architecture to predict serialized vertices supervised by the designed
bidirectional polygon loss. Furthermore, a hierarchical attention mechanism
combined with convolution operation is introduced in the encoder of the polygon
head, providing more geometric structures of building polygons at vertex and
edge levels. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmarks (the CrowdAI and Inria
datasets) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in terms
of instance segmentation and polygonal metrics compared with state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, qualitative results verify the superiority and effectiveness
of our model under complex scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Perceptual processes are frequently multi-modal. This is the case of haptic
perception. Data sets of visual and haptic sensory signals have been compiled
in the past, especially when it comes to the exploration of textured surfaces.
These data sets were intended to be used in natural and artificial perception
studies and to provide training data sets for machine learning research. These
data sets were typically acquired with rigid probes or artificial robotic
fingers. Here, we collected visual, auditory, and haptic signals acquired when
a human finger explored textured surfaces. We assessed the data set via machine
learning classification techniques. Interestingly, multi-modal classification
performance could reach 97% when haptic classification was around 80%.

<p class="mathjax">The openness of modern IT systems and their permanent change make it
challenging to keep these systems secure. A combination of regression and
security testing called security regression testing, which ensures that changes
made to a system do not harm its security, are therefore of high significance
and the interest in such approaches has steadily increased. In this article we
present a systematic classification of available security regression testing
approaches based on a solid study of background and related work to sketch
which parts of the research area seem to be well understood and evaluated, and
which ones require further research. For this purpose we extract approaches
relevant to security regression testing from computer science digital libraries
based on a rigorous search and selection strategy. Then, we provide a
classification of these according to security regression approach criteria:
abstraction level, security issue, regression testing techniques, and tool
support, as well as evaluation criteria, for instance evaluated system,
maturity of the system, and evaluation measures. From the resulting
classification we derive observations with regard to the abstraction level,
regression testing techniques, tool support as well as evaluation, and finally
identify several potential directions of future research.

<p class="mathjax">Conducting safety simulations in various simulators, such as the Gazebo
simulator, became a very popular means of testing vehicles against potential
safety risks (i.e. crashes). However, this was not the case with security
testing. Performing security testing in a simulator is very difficult because
security attacks are performed on a different abstraction level. In addition,
the attacks themselves are becoming more sophisticated, which directly
contributes to the difficulty of executing them in a simulator. In this paper,
we attempt to tackle the aforementioned gap by investigating possible attacks
that can be simulated, and then performing their simulations. The presented
approach shows that attacks targeting the LiDAR and GPS components of unmanned
aerial vehicles can be simulated. This is achieved by exploiting
vulnerabilities of the ROS and MAVLink protocol and injecting malicious
processes into an application. As a result, messages with arbitrary values can
be spoofed to the corresponding topics, which allows attackers to update
relevant parameters and cause a potential crash of a vehicle. This was tested
in multiple scenarios, thereby proving that it is indeed possible to simulate
certain attack types, such as spoofing and jamming.

<p class="mathjax">The identification of vulnerabilities is a continuous challenge in software
projects. This is due to the evolution of methods that attackers employ as well
as the constant updates to the software, which reveal additional issues. As a
result, new and innovative approaches for the identification of vulnerable
software are needed. In this paper, we present VULNERLIZER, which is a novel
framework for cross-analysis between vulnerabilities and software libraries. It
uses CVE and software library data together with clustering algorithms to
generate links between vulnerabilities and libraries. In addition, the training
of the model is conducted in order to reevaluate the generated associations.
This is achieved by updating the assigned weights. Finally, the approach is
then evaluated by making the predictions using the CVE data from the test set.
The results show that the VULNERLIZER has a great potential in being able to
predict future vulnerable libraries based on an initial input CVE entry or a
software library. The trained model reaches a prediction accuracy of 75% or
higher.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion based vocoders have been criticised for being slow due to the many
steps required during sampling. Moreover, the model's loss function that is
popularly implemented is designed such that the target is the original input
$x_0$ or error $\epsilon_0$. For early time steps of the reverse process, this
results in large prediction errors, which can lead to speech distortions and
increase the learning time. We propose a setup where the targets are the
different outputs of forward process time steps with a goal to reduce the
magnitude of prediction errors and reduce the training time. We use the
different layers of a neural network (NN) to perform denoising by training them
to learn to generate representations similar to the noised outputs in the
forward process of the diffusion. The NN layers learn to progressively denoise
the input in the reverse process until finally the final layer estimates the
clean speech. To avoid 1:1 mapping between layers of the neural network and the
forward process steps, we define a skip parameter $\tau&gt;1$ such that an NN
layer is trained to cumulatively remove the noise injected in the $\tau$ steps
in the forward process. This significantly reduces the number of data
distribution recovery steps and, consequently, the time to generate speech. We
show through extensive evaluation that the proposed technique generates
high-fidelity speech in competitive time that outperforms current
state-of-the-art tools. The proposed technique is also able to generalize well
to unseen speech.

<p class="mathjax">Self-adaptive systems offer several attack surfaces due to the communication
via different channels and the different sensors required to observe the
environment. Often, attacks cause safety to be compromised as well, making it
necessary to consider these two aspects together. Furthermore, the approaches
currently used for safety and security analysis do not sufficiently take into
account the intermediate steps of an adaptation. Current work in this area
ignores the fact that a self-adaptive system also reveals possible
vulnerabilities (even if only temporarily) during the adaptation. To address
this issue, we propose a modeling approach that takes into account the
different relevant aspects of a system, its adaptation process, as well as
safety hazards and security attacks. We present several models that describe
different aspects of a self-adaptive system and we outline our idea of how
these models can then be combined into an Attack-Fault Tree. This allows
modeling aspects of the system on different levels of abstraction and co-evolve
the models using transformations according to the adaptation of the system.
Finally, analyses can then be performed as usual on the resulting Attack-Fault
Tree.

<p class="mathjax">Topic modeling is admittedly a convenient way to monitor markets trend.
Conventionally, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA, is considered a must-do model
to gain this type of information. By given the merit of deducing keyword with
token conditional probability in LDA, we can know the most possible or
essential topic. However, the results are not intuitive because the given
topics cannot wholly fit human knowledge. LDA offers the first possible
relevant keywords, which also brings out another problem of whether the
connection is reliable based on the statistic possibility. It is also hard to
decide the topic number manually in advance. As the booming trend of using
fuzzy membership to cluster and using transformers to embed words, this work
presents the fuzzy topic modeling based on soft clustering and document
embedding from state-of-the-art transformer-based model. In our practical
application in a press release monitoring, the fuzzy topic modeling gives a

stabilizer of the virtual elements can be dropped while the quasi-optimality is

on the Hsieh-Clough-Tocher macro-triangle, where the macro-triangle is defined
by connecting three vertices of a triangle with its barycenter. We show that
such an interpolation preserves $P_k$ polynomials locally and enforces the
coerciveness of the resulting bilinear form. Consequently the stabilizer-free

<p class="mathjax">Anomalous diffusion in the presence or absence of an external force field is
often modelled in terms of the fractional evolution equations, which can
involve the hyper-singular source term.
<br />For this case, conventional time stepping methods may exhibit a severe order
reduction. Although a second-order numerical algorithm is provided for the
subdiffusion model with a simple hyper-singular source term $t^{\mu}$,
$-2&lt;\mu&lt;-1$ in [<a href="/abs/2207.08447">arXiv:2207.08447</a>], the convergence analysis remain to be
proved.
<br />To fill in these gaps, we present a simple and robust smoothing method for
the hyper-singular source term, where the Hadamard finite-part integral is
introduced. This method is based on the smoothing/ID$m$-BDF$k$ method proposed
by the authors [Shi and Chen, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., to appear] for subdiffusion
equation with a weakly singular source term.
<br />We prove that the $k$th-order convergence rate can be restored for the
diffusion-wave case $\gamma \in (1,2)$ and sketch the proof for the
subdiffusion case $\gamma \in (0,1)$, even if the source term is hyper-singular
and the initial data is not compatible.
<br />Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of uplink power control for distributed massive
multiple-input multiple-output systems where the base stations (BSs) are
equipped with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The scenario with a
single-user equipment (UE) is first considered to provide insights into the
signal-tonoise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). With a single BS, the SNDR is a
unimodal function of the UE transmit power. With multiple BSs, the SNDR at the
output of the joint combiner can be made unimodal by adding properly tuned
dithering at each BS. As a result, the UE can be effectively served by multiple
BSs with 1-bit ADCs. Considering the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-anddistortion ratio (SINDR) in the multi-UE
scenario, we aim at optimizing the UE transmit powers and the dithering at each
BS based on the min-power and max-min-SINDR criteria. To this end, we propose
three algorithms with different convergence and complexity properties.
Numerical results show that, if the desired SINDR can only be achieved via
joint combining across multiple BSs with properly tuned dithering, the optimal
UE transmit power is imposed by the distance to the farthest serving BS (unlike
in the unquantized case). In this context, dithering plays a crucial role in
enhancing the SINDR, especially for UEs with significant path loss disparity
among the serving BSs.

<p class="mathjax">Dialogue related Machine Reading Comprehension requires language models to
effectively decouple and model multi-turn dialogue passages. As a dialogue
development goes after the intentions of participants, its topic may not keep
constant through the whole passage. Hence, it is non-trivial to detect and
leverage the topic shift in dialogue modeling. Topic modeling, although has
been widely studied in plain text, deserves far more utilization in dialogue
reading comprehension. This paper proposes to model multi-turn dialogues from a
topic-aware perspective. We start with a dialogue segmentation algorithm to
split a dialogue passage into topic-concentrated fragments in an unsupervised
way. Then we use these fragments as topic-aware language processing units in
further dialogue comprehension. On one hand, the split segments indict specific
topics rather than mixed intentions, thus showing convenient on in-domain topic
detection and location. For this task, we design a clustering system with a
self-training auto-encoder, and we build two constructed datasets for
evaluation. On the other hand, the split segments are an appropriate element of
multi-turn dialogue response selection. For this purpose, we further present a
novel model, Topic-Aware Dual-Attention Matching (TADAM) Network, which takes
topic segments as processing elements and matches response candidates with a
dual cross-attention. Empirical studies on three public benchmarks show great
improvements over baselines. Our work continues the previous studies on
document topic, and brings the dialogue modeling to a novel topic-aware
perspective with exhaustive experiments and analyses.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM^4) has become
increasingly crucial due to the widespread dissemination of face forgery and
text misinformation. In this paper, we present the Unified Frequency-Assisted
transFormer framework, named UFAFormer, to address the DGM^4 problem. Unlike
previous state-of-the-art methods that solely focus on the image (RGB) domain
to describe visual forgery features, we additionally introduce the frequency
domain as a complementary viewpoint. By leveraging the discrete wavelet
transform, we decompose images into several frequency sub-bands, capturing rich
face forgery artifacts. Then, our proposed frequency encoder, incorporating
intra-band and inter-band self-attentions, explicitly aggregates forgery
features within and across diverse sub-bands. Moreover, to address the semantic
conflicts between image and frequency domains, the forgery-aware mutual module
is developed to further enable the effective interaction of disparate image and
frequency features, resulting in aligned and comprehensive visual forgery
representations. Finally, based on visual and textual forgery features, we
propose a unified decoder that comprises two symmetric cross-modal interaction
modules responsible for gathering modality-specific forgery information, along
with a fusing interaction module for aggregation of both modalities. The
proposed unified decoder formulates our UFAFormer as a unified framework,
ultimately simplifying the overall architecture and facilitating the
optimization process. Experimental results on the DGM^4 dataset, containing
several perturbations, demonstrate the superior performance of our framework
compared to previous methods, setting a new benchmark in the field.

<p class="mathjax">We present DFormer, a novel RGB-D pretraining framework to learn transferable
representations for RGB-D segmentation tasks. DFormer has two new key
innovations: 1) Unlike previous works that aim to encode RGB features,DFormer
comprises a sequence of RGB-D blocks, which are tailored for encoding both RGB
and depth information through a novel building block design; 2) We pre-train
the backbone using image-depth pairs from ImageNet-1K, and thus the DFormer is
endowed with the capacity to encode RGB-D representations. It avoids the
mismatched encoding of the 3D geometry relationships in depth maps by RGB
pre-trained backbones, which widely lies in existing methods but has not been
resolved. We fine-tune the pre-trained DFormer on two popular RGB-D tasks,
i.e., RGB-D semantic segmentation and RGB-D salient object detection, with a
lightweight decoder head. Experimental results show that our DFormer achieves
new state-of-the-art performance on these two tasks with less than half of the
computational cost of the current best methods on two RGB-D segmentation
datasets and five RGB-D saliency datasets. Our code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">The domain shift between training and testing data presents a significant
challenge for training generalizable deep learning models. As a consequence,
the performance of models trained with the independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d) assumption deteriorates when deployed in the real world.
This problem is exacerbated in the medical imaging context due to variations in
data acquisition across clinical centers, medical apparatus, and patients.
Domain generalization (DG) aims to address this problem by learning a model
that generalizes well to any unseen target domain. Many domain generalization
techniques were unsuccessful in learning domain-invariant representations due
to the large domain shift. Furthermore, multiple tasks in medical imaging are
not yet extensively studied in existing literature when it comes to DG point of
view. In this paper, we introduce a DG method that re-establishes the model
objective function as a maximization of mutual information with a large
pretrained model to the medical imaging field. We re-visit the problem of DG in
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification to establish a clear benchmark with a
correct model selection strategy and to achieve robust domain-invariant
representation for an improved generalization. Moreover, we conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets to show that our proposed method consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a margin of 5.25% in average
accuracy and a lower standard deviation. Source code available at

number of directions including developing advanced electricity trading markets.
Due to electricity markets being responsible for a large portion of carbon
emissions, improving the electricity markets' method for determining energy
transactions could have a significant impact on carbon reductions and thus
facilitate this transition. V2X technology can be applied to regulate different
energy markets, and thus reduce costs and carbon emissions by using the
batteries in electric vehicles to store energy during off-peak hours and export
it during peak hours.

<p class="mathjax">Controlled execution of dynamic motions in quadrupedal robots, especially
those with articulated soft bodies, presents a unique set of challenges that
traditional methods struggle to address efficiently. In this study, we tackle
these issues by relying on a simple yet effective two-stage learning framework
to generate dynamic motions for quadrupedal robots. First, a gradient-free
evolution strategy is employed to discover simply represented control policies,
eliminating the need for a predefined reference motion. Then, we refine these
policies using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach enables the
acquisition of complex motions like pronking and back-flipping, effectively
from scratch. Additionally, our method simplifies the traditionally
labour-intensive task of reward shaping, boosting the efficiency of the
learning process. Importantly, our framework proves particularly effective for
articulated soft quadrupeds, whose inherent compliance and adaptability make
them ideal for dynamic tasks but also introduce unique control challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Students' decisions on whether to take a class are strongly affected by
whether their friends plan to take the class with them. A student may prefer to
be assigned to a course they likes less, just to be with their friends, rather
than taking a more preferred class alone. It has been shown that taking classes
with friends positively affects academic performance. Thus, academic institutes
should prioritize friendship relations when assigning course seats. The
introduction of friendship relations results in several non-trivial changes to
current course allocation methods. This paper explores how course allocation
mechanisms can account for friendships between students and provide a unique,
distributed solution. In particular, we model the problem as an asymmetric
distributed constraint optimization problem and develop a new dedicated
algorithm. Our extensive evaluation includes both simulated data and data
derived from a user study on 177 students' preferences over courses and
friends. The results show that our algorithm obtains high utility for the
students while keeping the solution fair and observing courses' seat capacity
limitations.

<p class="mathjax">An ugly duckling is an obviously different skin lesion from surrounding
lesions of an individual, and the ugly duckling sign is a criterion used to aid
in the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma by differentiating between highly
suspicious and benign lesions. However, the appearance of pigmented lesions,
can change drastically from one patient to another, resulting in difficulties
in visual separation of ugly ducklings. Hence, we propose DMT-Quadruplet - a
deep metric learning network to learn lesion features at two tiers -
patient-level and lesion-level. We introduce a patient-specific quadruplet
mining approach together with a tiered quadruplet network, to drive the network
to learn more contextual information both globally and locally between the two
tiers. We further incorporate a dynamic margin within the patient-specific
mining to allow more useful quadruplets to be mined within individuals.
Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms traditional
classifiers, achieving 54% higher sensitivity than a baseline ResNet18 CNN and
37% higher than a naive triplet network in classifying ugly duckling lesions.
Visualisation of the data manifold in the metric space further illustrates that
DMT-Quadruplet is capable of classifying ugly duckling lesions in both
patient-specific and patient-agnostic manner successfully.

<p class="mathjax">With the surge in data generation, both vertically (i.e., volume of data) and
horizontally (i.e., dimensionality), the burden of the curse of dimensionality
has become increasingly palpable. Feature selection, a key facet of
dimensionality reduction techniques, has advanced considerably to address this
challenge. One such advancement is the Boruta feature selection algorithm,
which successfully discerns meaningful features by contrasting them to their
permutated counterparts known as shadow features. However, the significance of
a feature is shaped more by the data's overall traits than by its intrinsic
value, a sentiment echoed in the conventional Boruta algorithm where shadow
features closely mimic the characteristics of the original ones. Building on
this premise, this paper introduces an innovative approach to the Boruta
feature selection algorithm by incorporating noise into the shadow variables.
Drawing parallels from the perturbation analysis framework of artificial neural
networks, this evolved version of the Boruta method is presented. Rigorous
testing on four publicly available benchmark datasets revealed that this
proposed technique outperforms the classic Boruta algorithm, underscoring its
potential for enhanced, accurate feature selection.

measurements, the fusion between the GNSS and the inertial navigation system
provides accurate and robust navigation information. When considering land
vehicles,like autonomous ground vehicles,off-road vehicles or mobile robots,a
GNSS-based heading angle measurement can be obtained and used in parallel to
the position measurement to bound the heading angle drift. Yet, at low vehicle
speeds (less than 2m/s) such a model-based heading measurement fails to provide
satisfactory performance. This paper proposes GHNet, a deep-learning framework
capable of accurately regressing the heading angle for vehicles operating at
low speeds. We demonstrate that GHNet outperforms the current model-based
approach for simulation and experimental datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Discriminatory social biases, including gender biases, have been found in
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). In Natural Language Inference (NLI), recent
bias evaluation methods have observed biased inferences from the outputs of a
particular label such as neutral or entailment. However, since different biased
inferences can be associated with different output labels, it is inaccurate for
a method to rely on one label. In this work, we propose an evaluation method
that considers all labels in the NLI task. We create evaluation data and assign
them into groups based on their expected biased output labels. Then, we define
a bias measure based on the corresponding label output of each data group. In
the experiment, we propose a meta-evaluation method for NLI bias measures, and
then use it to confirm that our measure can evaluate bias more accurately than
the baseline. Moreover, we show that our evaluation method is applicable to
multiple languages by conducting the meta-evaluation on PLMs in three different
languages: English, Japanese, and Chinese. Finally, we evaluate PLMs of each
language to confirm their bias tendency. To our knowledge, we are the first to
build evaluation datasets and measure the bias of PLMs from the NLI task in
Japanese and Chinese.

<p class="mathjax">Severe acute respiratory disease SARS-CoV-2 has had a found impact on public
health systems and healthcare emergency response especially with respect to
making decisions on the most effective measures to be taken at any given time.
As demonstrated throughout the last three years with COVID-19, the prediction
of the number of positive cases can be an effective way to facilitate
decision-making. However, the limited availability of data and the highly
dynamic and uncertain nature of the virus transmissibility makes this task very
challenging. Aiming at investigating these challenges and in order to address
this problem, this work studies data-driven (learning, statistical) methods for
incrementally training models to adapt to these nonstationary conditions. An
extensive empirical study is conducted to examine various characteristics, such
as, performance analysis on a per virus wave basis, feature extraction,
"lookback" window size, memory size, all for next-, 7-, and 14-day forecasting
tasks. We demonstrate that the incremental learning framework can successfully
address the aforementioned challenges and perform well during outbreaks,
providing accurate predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Image steganography is the art of concealing secret information in images in
a way that is imperceptible to unauthorized parties. Recent advances show that
is possible to use a fixed neural network (FNN) for secret embedding and
extraction. Such fixed neural network steganography (FNNS) achieves high
steganographic performance without training the networks, which could be more
useful in real-world applications. However, the existing FNNS schemes are
vulnerable in the sense that anyone can extract the secret from the
stego-image. To deal with this issue, we propose a key-based FNNS scheme to
improve the security of the FNNS, where we generate key-controlled
perturbations from the FNN for data embedding. As such, only the receiver who
possesses the key is able to correctly extract the secret from the stego-image
using the FNN. In order to improve the visual quality and undetectability of
the stego-image, we further propose an adaptive perturbation optimization
strategy by taking the perturbation cost into account. Experimental results
show that our proposed scheme is capable of preventing unauthorized secret
extraction from the stego-images. Furthermore, our scheme is able to generate
stego-images with higher visual quality than the state-of-the-art FNNS scheme,
especially when the FNN is a neural network for ordinary learning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">With large chess-playing neural network models like AlphaZero contesting the
state of the art within the world of computerised chess, two challenges present
themselves: The question of how to explain the domain knowledge internalised by
such models, and the problem that such models are not made openly available.
This work presents the re-implementation of the concept detection methodology
applied to AlphaZero in McGrath et al. (2022), by using large, open-source
chess models with comparable performance. We obtain results similar to those
achieved on AlphaZero, while relying solely on open-source resources. We also
present a novel explainable AI (XAI) method, which is guaranteed to highlight
exhaustively and exclusively the information used by the explained model. This
method generates visual explanations tailored to domains characterised by
discrete input spaces, as is the case for chess. Our presented method has the
desirable property of controlling the information flow between any input vector
and the given model, which in turn provides strict guarantees regarding what
information is used by the trained model during inference. We demonstrate the
viability of our method by applying it to standard 8x8 chess, using large
open-source chess models.

<p class="mathjax">Data-driven approaches hold promise for audio captioning. However, the
development of audio captioning methods can be biased due to the limited
availability and quality of text-audio data. This paper proposes a SynthAC
framework, which leverages recent advances in audio generative models and
commonly available text corpus to create synthetic text-audio pairs, thereby
enhancing text-audio representation. Specifically, the text-to-audio generation
model, i.e., AudioLDM, is used to generate synthetic audio signals with
captions from an image captioning dataset. Our SynthAC expands the availability
of well-annotated captions from the text-vision domain to audio captioning,
thus enhancing text-audio representation by learning relations within synthetic
text-audio pairs. Experiments demonstrate that our SynthAC framework can
benefit audio captioning models by incorporating well-annotated text corpus
from the text-vision domain, offering a promising solution to the challenge
caused by data scarcity. Furthermore, SynthAC can be easily adapted to various
state-of-the-art methods, leading to substantial performance improvements.

labor market policy formation. This paper introduces LLM4Jobs, a novel
unsupervised methodology that taps into the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) for occupation coding. LLM4Jobs uniquely harnesses both the
natural language understanding and generation capacities of LLMs. Evaluated on
rigorous experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that LLM4Jobs consistently surpasses unsupervised state-of-the-art benchmarks,
demonstrating its versatility across diverse datasets and granularities. As a

which may be instrumental for subsequent research in this domain. Overall, this
investigation highlights the promise of contemporary LLMs for the intricate
task of occupation extraction and standardization, laying the foundation for a
robust and adaptable framework relevant to both research and industrial

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual video segmentation~(AVVS) aims to generate pixel-level maps of
sound-producing objects within image frames and ensure the maps faithfully
adhere to the given audio, such as identifying and segmenting a singing person
in a video. However, existing methods exhibit two limitations: 1) they address
video temporal features and audio-visual interactive features separately,
disregarding the inherent spatial-temporal dependence of combined audio and
video, and 2) they inadequately introduce audio constraints and object-level
information during the decoding stage, resulting in segmentation outcomes that
fail to comply with audio directives. To tackle these issues, we propose a
decoupled audio-video transformer that combines audio and video features from
their respective temporal and spatial dimensions, capturing their combined
dependence. To optimize memory consumption, we design a block, which, when
stacked, enables capturing audio-visual fine-grained combinatorial-dependence
in a memory-efficient manner. Additionally, we introduce audio-constrained
queries during the decoding phase. These queries contain rich object-level
information, ensuring the decoded mask adheres to the sounds. Experimental
results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving a
new SOTA performance on all three datasets using two backbones. The code is

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal
multiple-access (NOMA) systems have attracted a significant interest in the
relevant research communities. As a potential precoding scheme, the generalized
singular value decomposition (GSVD) can be adopted in MIMO-NOMA systems and has
been proved to have high spectral efficiency. In this paper, the performance of
the GSVD-based MIMO-NOMA communications with Rician fading is studied. In
particular, the distribution characteristics of generalized singular values
(GSVs) of channel matrices are analyzed. Two novel mathematical tools, the
linearization trick and the deterministic equivalent method, which are based on
operator-valued free probability theory, are exploited to derive the Cauchy
transform of GSVs. An iterative process is proposed to obtain the numerical
values of the Cauchy transform of GSVs, which can be exploited to derive the
average data rates of the communication system. In addition, the special case
when the channel is modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e., the line-of-sight
propagation is trivial, is analyzed. In this case, the closed-form expressions
of average rates are derived from the proposed iterative process. Simulation
results are provided to validate the derived analytical results.

<p class="mathjax">Recent span-based joint extraction models have demonstrated significant
advantages in both entity recognition and relation extraction. These models
treat text spans as candidate entities, and span pairs as candidate
relationship tuples, achieving state-of-the-art results on datasets like ADE.
However, these models encounter a significant number of non-entity spans or
irrelevant span pairs during the tasks, impairing model performance
significantly. To address this issue, this paper introduces a span-based
multitask entity-relation joint extraction model. This approach employs the
multitask learning to alleviate the impact of negative samples on entity and
relation classifiers. Additionally, we leverage the Intersection over
Union(IoU) concept to introduce the positional information into the entity
classifier, achieving a span boundary detection. Furthermore, by incorporating
the entity Logits predicted by the entity classifier into the embedded
representation of entity pairs, the semantic input for the relation classifier
is enriched. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SpERT.MT model
can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of excessive negative samples on
the model performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrated commendable F1
scores of 73.61\%, 53.72\%, and 83.72\% on three widely employed public
datasets, namely CoNLL04, SciERC, and ADE, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Tensor decomposition methods are popular tools for analysis of multi-way
datasets from social media, healthcare, spatio-temporal domains, and others.
Widely adopted models such as Tucker and canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD)
follow a data-driven philosophy: they decompose a tensor into factors that
approximate the observed data well. In some cases side information is available
about the tensor modes. For example, in a temporal user-item purchases tensor a
user influence graph, an item similarity graph, and knowledge about seasonality
or trends in the temporal mode may be available. Such side information may
enable more succinct and interpretable tensor decomposition models and improved
quality in downstream tasks.
<br />We propose a framework for Multi-Dictionary Tensor Decomposition (MDTD) which
takes advantage of prior structural information about tensor modes in the form
of coding dictionaries to obtain sparsely encoded tensor factors. We derive a
general optimization algorithm for MDTD that handles both complete input and
input with missing values. Our framework handles large sparse tensors typical
to many real-world application domains. We demonstrate MDTD's utility via
experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets. It learns more concise
models than dictionary-free counterparts and improves (i) reconstruction
quality ($60\%$ fewer non-zero coefficients coupled with smaller error); (ii)
missing values imputation quality (two-fold MSE reduction with up to orders of
magnitude time savings) and (iii) the estimation of the tensor rank. MDTD's
quality improvements do not come with a running time premium: it can decompose
$19GB$ datasets in less than a minute. It can also impute missing values in
sparse billion-entry tensors more accurately and scalably than state-of-the-art
competitors.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of learning error covariance matrices for robotic
state estimation. The convergence of a state estimator to the correct belief
over the robot state is dependent on the proper tuning of noise models. During
inference, these models are used to weigh different blocks of the Jacobian and
error vector resulting from linearization and hence, additionally affect the
stability and convergence of the non-linear system. We propose a gradient-based
method to estimate well-conditioned covariance matrices by formulating the
learning process as a constrained bilevel optimization problem over factor
graphs. We evaluate our method against baselines across a range of simulated
and real-world tasks and demonstrate that our technique converges to model
estimates that lead to better solutions as evidenced by the improved tracking
accuracy on unseen test trajectories.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning is an emerging distributed machine learning method,
enables a large number of clients to train a model without exchanging their
local data. The time cost of communication is an essential bottleneck in
federated learning, especially for training large-scale deep neural networks.
Some communication-efficient federated learning methods, such as FedAvg and
FedAdam, share the same learning rate across different clients. But they are
not efficient when data is heterogeneous. To maximize the performance of
optimization methods, the main challenge is how to adjust the learning rate
without hurting the convergence. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous
local variant of AMSGrad, named FedLALR, in which each client adjusts its
learning rate based on local historical gradient squares and synchronized
learning rates. Theoretical analysis shows that our client-specified auto-tuned
learning rate scheduling can converge and achieve linear speedup with respect
to the number of clients, which enables promising scalability in federated
optimization. We also empirically compare our method with several
communication-efficient federated optimization methods. Extensive experimental
results on Computer Vision (CV) tasks and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task show the efficacy of our proposed FedLALR method and also coincides with
our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring validation for highly automated driving poses significant obstacles
to the widespread adoption of highly automated vehicles. Scenario-based testing
offers a potential solution by reducing the homologation effort required for
these systems. However, a crucial prerequisite, yet unresolved, is the
definition and reduction of the test space to a finite number of scenarios. To
tackle this challenge, we propose an extension to a contrastive learning
approach utilizing graphs to construct a meaningful embedding space. Our
approach demonstrates the continuous mapping of scenes using scene-specific
features and the formation of thematically similar clusters based on the
resulting embeddings. Based on the found clusters, similar scenes could be
identified in the subsequent test process, which can lead to a reduction in
redundant test runs.

<p class="mathjax">Static analysis tools have gained popularity among developers for finding
potential bugs, but their widespread adoption is hindered by the accomnpanying
high false alarm rates (up to 90%). To address this challenge, previous studies
proposed the concept of actionable warnings, and apply machine-learning methods
to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. Despite these efforts,
our preliminary study suggests that the current methods used to collect
actionable warnings are rather shaky and unreliable, resulting in a large
proportion of invalid actionable warnings. In this work, we mined 68,274
reversions from Top-500 Github C repositories to create a substantia actionable
warning dataset and assigned weak labels to each warning's likelihood of being
a real bug. To automatically identify actionable warnings and recommend those
with a high probability of being real bugs (AWHB), we propose a two-stage
framework called ACWRecommender. In the first stage, our tool use a pre-trained
model, i.e., UniXcoder, to identify actionable warnings from a huge number of
SA tool's reported warnings. In the second stage, we rerank valid actionable
warnings to the top by using weakly supervised learning. Experimental results
showed that our tool outperformed several baselines for actionable warning
detection (in terms of F1-score) and performed better for AWHB recommendation
(in terms of nDCG and MRR). Additionaly, we also performed an in-the-wild
evaluation, we manually validated 24 warnings out of 2,197 reported warnings on
10 randomly selected projects, 22 of which were confirmed by developers as real
bugs, demonstrating the practical usage of our tool.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we address the challenge of 3D scene structure recovery from
monocular depth estimation. While traditional depth estimation methods leverage
labeled datasets to directly predict absolute depth, recent advancements
advocate for mix-dataset training, enhancing generalization across diverse
scenes. However, such mixed dataset training yields depth predictions only up
to an unknown scale and shift, hindering accurate 3D reconstructions. Existing
solutions necessitate extra 3D datasets or geometry-complete depth annotations,
constraints that limit their versatility. In this paper, we propose a learning
framework that trains models to predict geometry-preserving depth without
requiring extra data or annotations. To produce realistic 3D structures, we
render novel views of the reconstructed scenes and design loss functions to
promote depth estimation consistency across different views. Comprehensive
experiments underscore our framework's superior generalization capabilities,
surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets
without leveraging extra training information. Moreover, our innovative loss
functions empower the model to autonomously recover domain-specific
scale-and-shift coefficients using solely unlabeled images.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) alongside human-driven vehicles (HVs)
has ushered in an era of mixed traffic flow, presenting a significant
challenge: the intricate interaction between these entities within complex
driving environments. AVs are expected to have human-like driving behavior to
seamlessly integrate into human-dominated traffic systems. To address this
issue, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that considers driving
priors and Social Coordination Awareness (SCA) to optimize the behavior of AVs.
The framework integrates a driving prior learning (DPL) model based on a
variational autoencoder to infer the driver's driving priors from human
drivers' trajectories. A policy network based on a multi-head attention
mechanism is designed to effectively capture the interactive dependencies
between AVs and other traffic participants to improve decision-making quality.
The introduction of SCA into the autonomous driving decision-making system, and
the use of Coordination Tendency (CT) to quantify the willingness of AVs to
coordinate the traffic system is explored. Simulation results show that the
proposed framework can not only improve the decision-making quality of AVs but
also motivate them to produce social behaviors, with potential benefits for the
safety and traffic efficiency of the entire transportation system.

<p class="mathjax">Citations in scholarly work serve the essential purpose of acknowledging and
crediting the original sources of knowledge that have been incorporated or
referenced. Depending on their surrounding textual context, these citations are
used for different motivations and purposes. Large Language Models (LLMs) could
be helpful in capturing these fine-grained citation information via the
corresponding textual context, thereby enabling a better understanding towards
the literature. Furthermore, these citations also establish connections among
scientific papers, providing high-quality inter-document relationships and
human-constructed knowledge. Such information could be incorporated into LLMs
pre-training and improve the text representation in LLMs. Therefore, in this
paper, we offer a preliminary review of the mutually beneficial relationship
between LLMs and citation analysis. Specifically, we review the application of
LLMs for in-text citation analysis tasks, including citation classification,
citation-based summarization, and citation recommendation. We then summarize
the research pertinent to leveraging citation linkage knowledge to improve text
representations of LLMs via citation prediction, network structure information,
and inter-document relationship. We finally provide an overview of these
contemporary methods and put forth potential promising avenues in combining
LLMs and citation analysis for further investigation.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-organ segmentation in abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images is of
great importance for diagnosis of abdominal lesions and subsequent treatment
planning. Though deep learning based methods have attained high performance,
they rely heavily on large-scale pixel-level annotations that are
time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. Due to its low dependency on
annotation, weakly supervised segmentation has attracted great attention.
However, there is still a large performance gap between current
weakly-supervised methods and fully supervised learning, leaving room for
exploration. In this work, we propose a novel 3D framework with two consistency
constraints for scribble-supervised multiple abdominal organ segmentation from
CT. Specifically, we employ a Triple-branch multi-Dilated network (TDNet) with
one encoder and three decoders using different dilation rates to capture
features from different receptive fields that are complementary to each other
to generate high-quality soft pseudo labels. For more stable unsupervised
learning, we use voxel-wise uncertainty to rectify the soft pseudo labels and
then supervise the outputs of each decoder. To further regularize the network,
class relationship information is exploited by encouraging the generated class
affinity matrices to be consistent across different decoders under multi-view
projection. Experiments on the public WORD dataset show that our method
outperforms five existing scribble-supervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last years we witnessed a renewed interest towards Traffic
Classification (TC) captivated by the rise of Deep Learning (DL). Yet, the vast
majority of TC literature lacks code artifacts, performance assessments across
datasets and reference comparisons against Machine Learning (ML) methods. Among
those works, a recent study from IMC'22 [17] is worth of attention since it
adopts recent DL methodologies (namely, few-shot learning, self-supervision via
contrastive learning and data augmentation) appealing for networking as they
enable to learn from a few samples and transfer across datasets. The main
result of [17] on the UCDAVIS19, ISCX-VPN and ISCX-Tor datasets is that, with
such DL methodologies, 100 input samples are enough to achieve very high
accuracy using an input representation called "flowpic" (i.e., a per-flow 2d
histograms of the packets size evolution over time). In this paper (i) we
reproduce [17] on the same datasets and (ii) we replicate its most salient
aspect (the importance of data augmentation) on three additional public
datasets, MIRAGE-19, MIRAGE-22 and UTMOBILENET21. While we confirm most of the
original results, we also found a 20% accuracy drop on some of the investigated
scenarios due to a data shift in the original dataset that we uncovered.
Additionally, our study validates that the data augmentation strategies studied
in [17] perform well on other datasets too. In the spirit of reproducibility
and replicability we make all artifacts (code and data) available at [10].

<p class="mathjax">Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) technologies promise to attenuate
undesired traffic disturbances. However, in mixed traffic where human-driven
vehicles (HDVs) also exist, the nonlinear human-driving behavior has brought
critical challenges for effective CAV control. This paper employs the policy
iteration method to learn the optimal robust controller for nonlinear mixed
traffic systems. Precisely, we consider the H_infty control framework and
formulate it as a zero-sum game, the equivalent condition for whose solution is
converted into a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality with a Hamiltonian constraint.
Then, a policy iteration algorithm is designed to generate stabilizing
controllers with desired attenuation performance. Based on the updated robust
controller, the attenuation level is further optimized in sum of squares
program by leveraging the gap of the Hamiltonian constraint. Simulation studies
verify that the obtained controller enables the CAVs to dampen traffic
perturbations and smooth traffic flow.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile autonomy relies on the precise perception of dynamic environments.
Robustly tracking moving objects in 3D world thus plays a pivotal role for
applications like trajectory prediction, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.
While most current methods utilize LiDARs or cameras for Multiple Object
Tracking (MOT), the capabilities of 4D imaging radars remain largely
unexplored. Recognizing the challenges posed by radar noise and point sparsity
in 4D radar data, we introduce RaTrack, an innovative solution tailored for
radar-based tracking. Bypassing the typical reliance on specific object types
and 3D bounding boxes, our method focuses on motion segmentation and
clustering, enriched by a motion estimation module. Evaluated on the
View-of-Delft dataset, RaTrack showcases superior tracking precision of moving
objects, largely surpassing the performance of the state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">3D scene reconstruction from 2D images has been a long-standing task. Instead
of estimating per-frame depth maps and fusing them in 3D, recent research
leverages the neural implicit surface as a unified representation for 3D
reconstruction. Equipped with data-driven pre-trained geometric cues, these
methods have demonstrated promising performance. However, inaccurate prior
estimation, which is usually inevitable, can lead to suboptimal reconstruction
quality, particularly in some geometrically complex regions. In this paper, we
propose a two-stage training process, decouple view-dependent and
view-independent colors, and leverage two novel consistency constraints to
enhance detail reconstruction performance without requiring extra priors.
Additionally, we introduce an essential mask scheme to adaptively influence the
selection of supervision constraints, thereby improving performance in a
self-supervised paradigm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show
the capability of reducing the interference from prior estimation errors and
achieving high-quality scene reconstruction with rich geometric details.

<p class="mathjax">The reliability of supervised machine learning systems depends on the
accuracy and availability of ground truth labels. However, the process of human
annotation, being prone to error, introduces the potential for noisy labels,
which can impede the practicality of these systems. While training with noisy
labels is a significant consideration, the reliability of test data is also
crucial to ascertain the dependability of the results. A common approach to
addressing this issue is repeated labeling, where multiple annotators label the
same example, and their labels are combined to provide a better estimate of the
true label. In this paper, we propose a novel localization algorithm that
adapts well-established ground truth estimation methods for object detection
and instance segmentation tasks. The key innovation of our method lies in its
ability to transform combined localization and classification tasks into
classification-only problems, thus enabling the application of techniques such
as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or Majority Voting (MJV). Although our main
focus is the aggregation of unique ground truth for test data, our algorithm
also shows superior performance during training on the TexBiG dataset,
surpassing both noisy label training and label aggregation using Weighted Boxes
Fusion (WBF). Our experiments indicate that the benefits of repeated labels
emerge under specific dataset and annotation configurations. The key factors
appear to be (1) dataset complexity, the (2) annotator consistency, and (3) the
given annotation budget constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Missing data can pose a challenge for machine learning (ML) modeling. To
address this, current approaches are categorized into feature imputation and
label prediction and are primarily focused on handling missing data to enhance
ML performance. These approaches rely on the observed data to estimate the
missing values and therefore encounter three main shortcomings in imputation,
including the need for different imputation methods for various missing data
mechanisms, heavy dependence on the assumption of data distribution, and
potential introduction of bias. This study proposes a Contrastive Learning (CL)
framework to model observed data with missing values, where the ML model learns
the similarity between an incomplete sample and its complete counterpart and
the dissimilarity between other samples. Our proposed approach demonstrates the
advantages of CL without requiring any imputation. To enhance interpretability,
we introduce CIVis, a visual analytics system that incorporates interpretable
techniques to visualize the learning process and diagnose the model status.
Users can leverage their domain knowledge through interactive sampling to
identify negative and positive pairs in CL. The output of CIVis is an optimized
model that takes specified features and predicts downstream tasks. We provide
two usage scenarios in regression and classification tasks and conduct
quantitative experiments, expert interviews, and a qualitative user study to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In short, this study offers a
valuable contribution to addressing the challenges associated with ML modeling
in the presence of missing data by providing a practical solution that achieves
high predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content, in the context of a dialogue, can have
severe side effects on users in open-domain dialogue systems. However, research
on detecting NSFW language, especially sexually explicit content, within a
dialogue context has significantly lagged behind. To address this issue, we
introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at NSFW dialogue
detection. Leveraging knowledge distillation techniques involving GPT-4 and
ChatGPT, this dataset offers a cost-effective means of constructing NSFW
content detectors. The process entails collecting real-life human-machine
interaction data and breaking it down into single utterances and single-turn
dialogues, with the chatbot delivering the final utterance. ChatGPT is employed
to annotate unlabeled data, serving as a training set. Rationale validation and
test sets are constructed using ChatGPT and GPT-4 as annotators, with a
self-criticism strategy for resolving discrepancies in labeling. A BERT model
is fine-tuned as a text classifier on pseudo-labeled data, and its performance
is assessed. The study emphasizes the importance of AI systems prioritizing
user safety and well-being in digital conversations while respecting freedom of
expression. The proposed approach not only advances NSFW content detection but
also aligns with evolving user protection needs in AI-driven dialogues.

<p class="mathjax">In Reinforcement Learning, the trade-off between exploration and exploitation
poses a complex challenge for achieving efficient learning from limited
samples. While recent works have been effective in leveraging past experiences
for policy updates, they often overlook the potential of reusing past
experiences for data collection. Independent of the underlying RL algorithm, we
introduce the concept of a Contrastive Initial State Buffer, which
strategically selects states from past experiences and uses them to initialize
the agent in the environment in order to guide it toward more informative
states. We validate our approach on two complex robotic tasks without relying
on any prior information about the environment: (i) locomotion of a quadruped
robot traversing challenging terrains and (ii) a quadcopter drone racing
through a track. The experimental results show that our initial state buffer
achieves higher task performance than the nominal baseline while also speeding
up training convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to surpass human performance in
driving without needing any expert supervision. Despite its promise, the
state-of-the-art in sensorimotor self-driving is dominated by imitation
learning methods due to the inherent shortcomings of RL algorithms.
Nonetheless, RL agents are able to discover highly successful policies when
provided with privileged ground truth representations of the environment. In
this work, we investigate what separates privileged RL agents from sensorimotor
agents for urban driving in order to bridge the gap between the two. We propose
vision-based deep learning models to approximate the privileged representations
from sensor data. In particular, we identify aspects of state representation
that are crucial for the success of the RL agent such as desired route
generation and stop zone prediction, and propose solutions to gradually develop
less privileged RL agents. We also observe that bird's-eye-view models trained
on offline datasets do not generalize to online RL training due to distribution
mismatch. Through rigorous evaluation on the CARLA simulation environment, we
shed light on the significance of the state representations in RL for
autonomous driving and point to unresolved challenges for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, while the demand for capacity continues to expand, the blossoming
of Internet of Everything is bringing in a paradigm shift to new perceptions of
communication networks, ushering in a plethora of totally unique services. To
provide these services, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) must be established
and reachable by end-users, which will generate and consume massive volumes of
data that must be processed locally for service responsiveness and scalability.
For this to be realized, a solid cloud-network Integrated infrastructure is a
necessity, and since cloud and network domains would be diverse in terms of
characteristics but limited in terms of capability, communication and computing
resources should be jointly controlled to unleash its full potential. Although
several innovative methods have been proposed to allocate the resources, most
of them either ignored network resources or relaxed the network as a simple
graph, which are not applicable to Beyond 5G because of its dynamism and
stringent QoS requirements. This paper fills in the gap by studying the joint
problem of communication and computing resource allocation, dubbed CCRA,
including VNF placement and assignment, traffic prioritization, and path
selection considering capacity constraints as well as link and queuing delays,
with the goal of minimizing overall cost. We formulate the problem as a
non-linear programming model, and propose two approaches, dubbed B\&amp;B-CCRA and
WF-CCRA respectively, based on the Branch \&amp; Bound and Water-Filling
algorithms. Numerical simulations show that B\&amp;B-CCRA can solve the problem
optimally, whereas WF-CCRA can provide near-optimal solutions in significantly
less time.

<p class="mathjax">Current deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks are commonly
incapable of handling problems to which multiple different plausible solutions
exist. In response, posterior-based methods such as conditional Diffusion
Models and Invertible Neural Networks have emerged; however, their translation
is hampered by a lack of research on adequate validation. In other words, the
way progress is measured often does not reflect the needs of the driving
practical application. Closing this gap in the literature, we present the first
systematic framework for the application-driven validation of posterior-based
methods in inverse problems. As a methodological novelty, it adopts key
principles from the field of object detection validation, which has a long
history of addressing the question of how to locate and match multiple object
instances in an image. Treating modes as instances enables us to perform
mode-centric validation, using well-interpretable metrics from the application
perspective. We demonstrate the value of our framework through instantiations
for a synthetic toy example and two medical vision use cases: pose estimation
in surgery and imaging-based quantification of functional tissue parameters for
diagnostics. Our framework offers key advantages over common approaches to
posterior validation in all three examples and could thus revolutionize
performance assessment in inverse problems.

<p class="mathjax">In currently available literature, no tracking-by-detection (TBD)
paradigm-based tracking method has considered the localization confidence of
detection boxes. In most TBD-based methods, it is considered that objects of
low detection confidence are highly occluded and thus it is a normal practice
to directly disregard such objects or to reduce their priority in matching. In
addition, appearance similarity is not a factor to consider for matching these
objects. However, in terms of the detection confidence fusing classification
and localization, objects of low detection confidence may have inaccurate
localization but clear appearance; similarly, objects of high detection
confidence may have inaccurate localization or unclear appearance; yet these
objects are not further classified. In view of these issues, we propose
Localization-Guided Track (LG-Track). Firstly, localization confidence is
applied in MOT for the first time, with appearance clarity and localization
accuracy of detection boxes taken into account, and an effective deep
association mechanism is designed; secondly, based on the classification
confidence and localization confidence, a more appropriate cost matrix can be
selected and used; finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on MOT17
and MOT20 datasets. The results show that our proposed method outperforms the
compared state-of-art tracking methods. For the benefit of the community, our
code has been made publicly at https://github.com/mengting2023/LG-Track.

significantly improve wear figures, comfort, and safety of railway running
gears, but certain measures for wheelset stabilization are required. This is
one reason why the application of traditional wheelsets is still common
practice in industry. Apart from lateral guidance, the longitudinal control is
of crucial importance for railway safety. In the current contribution, an
integrated controller for joined lateral and longitudinal control of a
high-speed railway running gear with driven IRW is designed. To this end, a
novel adhesion-based traction control law is combined with linear time-variant
and nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) schemes for lateral guidance. The
MPC schemes are able to use tabulated track geometry data and preview
information about set points to minimize the lateral displacement error.
Co-simulation results with a detailed multi-body simulation show the
effectiveness of the approach compared with state-of-the-art techniques in
various scenarios, including curving, varying velocities up to 400 km/h and
abruptly changing wheel-rail adhesion conditions.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of datathons, also known as data or data science hackathons, has
provided a platform to collaborate, learn, and innovate in a short timeframe.
Despite their significant potential benefits, organizations often struggle to
effectively work with data due to a lack of clear guidelines and best practices
for potential issues that might arise. Drawing on our own experiences and
insights from organizing &gt;80 datathon challenges with &gt;60 partnership
organizations since 2016, we provide guidelines and recommendations that serve
as a resource for organizers to navigate the data-related complexities of
datathons. We apply our proposed framework to 10 case studies.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its innate capacity to independently
learn hierarchical features from complex and multi-dimensional data. A common
understanding is that its performance scales up with the amount of training
data. Another data attribute is the inherent variety. It follows, therefore,
that semantic redundancy, which is the presence of similar or repetitive
information, would tend to lower performance and limit generalizability to
unseen data. In medical imaging data, semantic redundancy can occur due to the
presence of multiple images that have highly similar presentations for the
disease of interest. Further, the common use of augmentation methods to
generate variety in DL training may be limiting performance when applied to
semantically redundant data. We propose an entropy-based sample scoring
approach to identify and remove semantically redundant training data. We
demonstrate using the publicly available NIH chest X-ray dataset that the model
trained on the resulting informative subset of training data significantly
outperforms the model trained on the full training set, during both internal
(recall: 0.7164 vs 0.6597, p&lt;0.05) and external testing (recall: 0.3185 vs
0.2589, p&lt;0.05). Our findings emphasize the importance of information-oriented
training sample selection as opposed to the conventional practice of using all
available training data.

<p class="mathjax">Recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods typically include a filtering
strategy to improve the quality of pseudo labels. However, these filtering
strategies are usually hand-crafted and do not change as the model is updated,
resulting in a lot of correct pseudo labels being discarded and incorrect
pseudo labels being selected during the training process. In this work, we
observe that the distribution gap between the confidence values of correct and
incorrect pseudo labels emerges at the very beginning of the training, which
can be utilized to filter pseudo labels. Based on this observation, we propose
a Self-Adaptive Pseudo-Label Filter (SPF), which automatically filters noise in
pseudo labels in accordance with model evolvement by modeling the confidence
distribution throughout the training process. Specifically, with an online
mixture model, we weight each pseudo-labeled sample by the posterior of it
being correct, which takes into consideration the confidence distribution at
that time. Unlike previous handcrafted filters, our SPF evolves together with
the deep neural network without manual tuning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that incorporating SPF into the existing SSL methods can help
improve the performance of SSL, especially when the labeled data is extremely
scarce.

<p class="mathjax">World models, especially in autonomous driving, are trending and drawing
extensive attention due to their capacity for comprehending driving
environments. The established world model holds immense potential for the
generation of high-quality driving videos, and driving policies for safe
maneuvering. However, a critical limitation in relevant research lies in its
predominant focus on gaming environments or simulated settings, thereby lacking
the representation of real-world driving scenarios. Therefore, we introduce
DriveDreamer, a pioneering world model entirely derived from real-world driving
scenarios. Regarding that modeling the world in intricate driving scenes
entails an overwhelming search space, we propose harnessing the powerful
diffusion model to construct a comprehensive representation of the complex
environment. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline. In the
initial phase, DriveDreamer acquires a deep understanding of structured traffic
constraints, while the subsequent stage equips it with the ability to
anticipate future states. The proposed DriveDreamer is the first world model
established from real-world driving scenarios. We instantiate DriveDreamer on
the challenging nuScenes benchmark, and extensive experiments verify that
DriveDreamer empowers precise, controllable video generation that faithfully
captures the structural constraints of real-world traffic scenarios.
Additionally, DriveDreamer enables the generation of realistic and reasonable
driving policies, opening avenues for interaction and practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">The escalating surge in data generation presents formidable challenges to
information technology, necessitating advancements in storage, retrieval, and
utilization. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence and big data,
the "Data Age 2025" report forecasts an exponential increase in global data
production. The escalating data volumes raise concerns about efficient data
processing. The paper addresses the predicament of achieving a lower
compression ratio while maintaining or surpassing the compression performance
of state-of-the-art techniques.
<br />This paper introduces a lossy compression framework grounded in the
perceptron model for data prediction, striving for high compression quality.
The contributions of this study encompass the introduction of positive and
negative factors within the relative-to-absolute domain transformation
algorithm, the utilization of a three-layer perceptron for improved predictive
accuracy, and data selection rule modifications for parallelized compression
within compression blocks. Comparative experiments with SZ2.1's PW_REL mode
demonstrate a maximum compression ratio reduction of 17.78%.
<br />The article is structured as follows: the introduction highlights the data
explosion challenge; related work delves into existing solutions; optimization
of mapping algorithms in the relative and absolute domains is expounded in
Section 3,the design of the new compression framework is detailed in Section
4,In Section 5 we describe the whole process and give pseudo-code, and in
Section 6, our solution is evaluated. Finally, in Section 7, we provide an
outlook for future work.

<p class="mathjax">Measuring the complexity of tree structures can be beneficial in areas that
use tree data structures for storage, communication, and processing purposes.
This complexity can then be used to compress tree data structures to their
information-theoretic limit. Additionally, the lack of models for random
generation of trees is very much felt in mathematical modeling of trees and
graphs. In this paper, a number of existing tree generation models such as
simply generated trees are discussed, and their information content is analysed
by means of information theory and Shannon's entropy. Subsequently, a new model
for generating trees based on practical appearances of trees is introduced, and
an upper bound for its entropy is calculated. This model is based on selecting
a random tree from possible spanning trees of graphs, which is what happens
often in practice. Moving on to tree compression, we find approaches to
universal tree compression of the discussed models. These approaches first
transform a tree into a sequence of symbols, and then apply a dictionary-based
compression method. Conditions for the universality of these method are then
studied and analysed.

<p class="mathjax">Physical attacks form one of the most severe threats against secure computing
platforms. Their criticality arises from their corresponding threat model: By,
e.g., passively measuring an integrated circuit's (IC's) environment during a
security-related operation, internal secrets may be disclosed. Furthermore, by
actively disturbing the physical runtime environment of an IC, an adversary can
cause a specific, exploitable misbehavior. The set of physical attacks consists
of techniques that apply either globally or locally. When compared to global
techniques, local techniques exhibit a much higher precision, hence having the
potential to be used in advanced attack scenarios. However, using physical
techniques with additional spatial dependency expands the parameter search
space exponentially. In this work, we present and compare two techniques,
namely laser logic state imaging (LLSI) and lock-in thermography (LIT), that
can be used to discover sub-circuitry of an entirely unknown IC based on
optical and thermal principles. We show that the time required to identify
specific regions can be drastically reduced, thus lowering the complexity of
physical attacks requiring positional information. Our case study on an Intel
H610 Platform Controller Hub showcases that, depending on the targeted voltage
rail, our technique reduces the search space by around 90 to 98 percent.

<p class="mathjax">Sentiments inherently drive politics. How we receive and process information
plays an essential role in political decision-making, shaping our judgment with
strategic consequences both on the level of legislators and the masses. If
sentiment plays such an important role in politics, how can we study and
measure it systematically? The paper presents a new dataset of
sentiment-annotated sentences, which are used in a series of experiments
focused on training a robust sentiment classifier for parliamentary
proceedings. The paper also introduces the first domain-specific LLM for
political science applications additionally pre-trained on 1.72 billion
domain-specific words from proceedings of 27 European parliaments. We present
experiments demonstrating how the additional pre-training of LLM on
parliamentary data can significantly improve the model downstream performance
on the domain-specific tasks, in our case, sentiment detection in parliamentary
proceedings. We further show that multilingual models perform very well on
unseen languages and that additional data from other languages significantly
improves the target parliament's results. The paper makes an important
contribution to multiple domains of social sciences and bridges them with
computer science and computational linguistics. Lastly, it sets up a more
robust approach to sentiment analysis of political texts in general, which
allows scholars to study political sentiment from a comparative perspective
using standardized tools and techniques.

<p class="mathjax">The 2-colorable perfect matching problem asks whether a graph can be colored
with two colors so that each node has exactly one neighbor with the same color
as itself. We prove that this problem is NP-complete, even when restricted to
2-connected 3-regular planar graphs. In 1978, Schaefer proved that this problem
is NP-complete in general graphs, and claimed without proof that the same
result holds when restricted to 3-regular planar graphs. Thus we fill in the
missing proof of this claim, while simultaneously strengthening to 2-connected
graphs (which implies existence of a perfect matching). We also prove
NP-completeness of $k$-colorable perfect matching, for any fixed $k \geq 2$.

Consensus Theory (CCT) provides a statistical framework for detecting and
characterizing these divergent consensus beliefs. However, it is unworkable in
modern applications because it lacks the ability to generalize across even
highly similar beliefs, is ineffective with sparse data, and can leverage
neither external knowledge bases nor learned machine representations. Here, we
overcome these limitations through Infinite Deep Latent Construct Cultural
Consensus Theory (iDLC-CCT), a nonparametric Bayesian model that extends CCT
with a latent construct that maps between pretrained deep neural network
embeddings of entities and the consensus beliefs regarding those entities among
one or more subsets of respondents. We validate the method across domains
including perceptions of risk sources, food healthiness, leadership, first
impressions, and humor. We find that iDLC-CCT better predicts the degree of
consensus, generalizes well to out-of-sample entities, and is effective even
with sparse data. To improve scalability, we introduce an efficient
hard-clustering variant of the iDLC-CCT using an algorithm derived from a
small-variance asymptotic analysis of the model. The iDLC-CCT, therefore,
provides a workable computational foundation for harnessing collective
intelligence under a lack of cultural consensus and may potentially form the
basis of consensus-aware information technologies.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the electrical
grid causes various challenges in the distribution grids. The complexity of
smart grids as multi-domain energy systems requires innovative architectures
and algorithms for system control. While these solutions are good on paper,
several testing methods are required to test the applicability of components,
functions and entire systems to the existing energy grids. In this paper, a
full-scale low-voltage test setup in the Smart Grid Technology Lab (SGTL) at TU
Dortmund University is used to evaluate the capability of an Optimal Power Flow
Algorithm (OPF) to support voltage control, congestion management, and to
provide redispatch to the higher grid levels. While conventional redispatch is
commonly done preemptively, this paper analyses the possibility of providing
redispatch to the higher voltage levels without taking the future grid state
into consideration. The importance of this implementation is that the smart
grid application used to execute the OPF is configured based on IEC 61850 data
models, making the software independent of the hardware. Such standardised
control algorithms are interoperable and can be implemented on any hardware
that suits the requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Electric airplanes are expected to take to the skies soon, finding first use
cases in small networks within hardly accessible areas, such as island
communities. In this context, the environmental footprint of such airplanes
will be strongly determined by the energy sources employed when charging them.
This paper presents a framework to optimize aircraft assignment, routing and
charge schedules explicitly accounting for the energy availability at the
different airports, which are assumed to be equipped with renewable energy
sources and stationary batteries. Specifically, considering the daily travel
demand and weather conditions forecast in advance, we first capture the
aircraft operations within a time-expanded directed acyclic graph, and combine
it with a dynamic energy model of the individual airports. Second, aiming at
minimizing grid-dependency, we leverage our models to frame the optimal
electric aircraft and airport operational problem as a mixed-integer linear
program that can be solved with global optimality guarantees. Finally, we
showcase our framework in a real-world case-study considering one week of
operations on the Dutch Leeward Antilles. Our results show that, depending on
weather conditions and compared to current schedules, optimizing flights and
operations in a renewable-energy-aware manner can reduce grid dependency from
18 to 100%, whilst significantly shrinking the operational window of the
airplanes.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) has attracted widespread attention
in the natural language processing field due to its enormous potential for
practical applications. Existing ERC methods face challenges in achieving
generalization to diverse scenarios due to insufficient modeling of context,
ambiguous capture of dialogue relationships and overfitting in speaker
modeling. In this work, we present a Hybrid Continuous Attributive Network
(HCAN) to address these issues in the perspective of emotional continuation and
emotional attribution. Specifically, HCAN adopts a hybrid recurrent and
attention-based module to model global emotion continuity. Then a novel
Emotional Attribution Encoding (EAE) is proposed to model intra- and
inter-emotional attribution for each utterance. Moreover, aiming to enhance the
robustness of the model in speaker modeling and improve its performance in
different scenarios, A comprehensive loss function emotional cognitive loss
$\mathcal{L}_{\rm EC}$ is proposed to alleviate emotional drift and overcome
the overfitting of the model to speaker modeling. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, demonstrating the superiority
of our work. Another extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies on
three benchmarks are conducted to provided evidence to support the efficacy of
each module. Further exploration of generalization ability experiments shows
the plug-and-play nature of the EAE module in our method.

<p class="mathjax">We study principal-agent problems in which a principal commits to an
outcome-dependent payment scheme -- called contract -- in order to induce an
agent to take a costly, unobservable action leading to favorable outcomes. We
consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the
problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to
contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the
agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome
realized at each round. We focus on settings in which the size of the agent's
action space is small. We design an algorithm that learns an
approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds
polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is
constant. Our algorithm solves an open problem by Zhu et al.[2022]. Moreover,
it can also be employed to provide a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{4/5})$ regret
bound in the related online learning setting in which the principal aims at
maximizing their cumulative utility, thus considerably improving
previously-known regret bounds.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents DFL-TORO, a novel Demonstration Framework for Learning
Time-Optimal Robotic tasks via One-shot kinesthetic demonstration. It aims at
optimizing the process of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), applied in the
manufacturing sector. As the effectiveness of LfD is challenged by the quality
and efficiency of human demonstrations, our approach offers a streamlined
method to intuitively capture task requirements from human teachers, by
reducing the need for multiple demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose an
optimization-based smoothing algorithm that ensures time-optimal and
jerk-regulated demonstration trajectories, while also adhering to the robot's
kinematic constraints. The result is a significant reduction in noise, thereby
boosting the robot's operation efficiency. Evaluations using a Franka Emika
Research 3 (FR3) robot for a reaching task further substantiate the efficacy of
our framework, highlighting its potential to transform kinesthetic
demonstrations in contemporary manufacturing environments.

<p class="mathjax">The hydrogen combustion engine (H$_2$ICE) is known to be able to burn H$_2$
under ultra-lean conditions, while producing no CO$_2$ emissions and extremely
low engine-out NO$_x^{\mathrm{eo}}$ emissions. Immediate goals, as for instance
the upcoming EURO 7 NO$_x$ limitations, can be reached more easily as extremely
low engine-out NO$_x^{\mathrm{eo}}$ emissions facilitate the reduction of the
overall tailpipe NO$_x^{\mathrm{tp}}$ emissions. In this work, the feasibility
of achieving consistent reductions in NO$_x^{\mathrm{eo}}$ emissions through
the implementation of electric hybridization of an H$_2$ICE-equipped passenger
car (H$_2$-HEV), combined with a dedicated energy management strategy (EMS) is
discussed. In particular, the mixed H$_2$-HEV architecture is investigated and
compared to a series H$_2$-HEV, a parallel H$_2$-HEV, and a base H$_2$-vehicle,
which is only equipped with an H$_2$ICE. For hybrid vehicles, a low H$_2$
consumption and low NO$_x^{\mathrm{eo}}$ emissions are conflicting objectives,
the trade-off of which depends on the EMS and can be represented as a Pareto
front. Overall, through the utilization of a dedicated energy management
calibration, the mixed H$_2$-HEV demonstrates the capability to consistently
achieve extremely low engine-out NO$_x^{\mathrm{eo}}$ emissions. For a broad
range of driving missions, the mixed H$_2$-HEV is able to decrease the
engine-out NO$_\mathrm{x}^\mathrm{eo}$ emissions by more than 90%, while, at
the same time, the H$_2$ consumption is decreased by over 16%, compared to a
comparable non-hybridized H$_2$-vehicle. These significant emission reductions
are possible without having to modify the exhaust-gas aftertreatment system, or
the optimization of any of the individual drivetrain components, but solely by
setting the EMS calibration accordingly.

<p class="mathjax">We present a numerically robust algorithm for computing the constrained
Delaunay tetrahedrization (CDT) of a piecewise-linear complex, which has a 100%
success rate on the 4408 valid models in the Thingi10k dataset. We build on the
underlying theory of the well-known TetGen software, but use a floating-point
implementation based on indirect geometric predicates to implicitly represent
Steiner points: this new approach dramatically simplifies the implementation,
removing the need for ad-hoc tolerances in geometric operations. Our approach
leads to a robust and parameter-free implementation, with an empirically
manageable number of added Steiner points. Furthermore, our algorithm addresses
a major gap in TetGen's theory which may lead to algorithmic failure on valid
models, even when assuming perfect precision in the calculations. Our output
tetrahedrization conforms with the input geometry without approximations. We
can further round our output to floating-point coordinates for downstream
applications, which almost always results in valid floating-point meshes unless
the input triangulation is very close to being degenerate.

<p class="mathjax">The rapidly evolving nature of Android apps poses a significant challenge to
static batch machine learning algorithms employed in malware detection systems,
as they quickly become obsolete. Despite this challenge, the existing
literature pays limited attention to addressing this issue, with many advanced
Android malware detection approaches, such as Drebin, DroidDet and MaMaDroid,
relying on static models. In this work, we show how retraining techniques are
able to maintain detector capabilities over time. Particularly, we analyze the
effect of two aspects in the efficiency and performance of the detectors: 1)
the frequency with which the models are retrained, and 2) the data used for
retraining. In the first experiment, we compare periodic retraining with a more
advanced concept drift detection method that triggers retraining only when
necessary. In the second experiment, we analyze sampling methods to reduce the
amount of data used to retrain models. Specifically, we compare fixed sized
windows of recent data and state-of-the-art active learning methods that select
those apps that help keep the training dataset small but diverse. Our
experiments show that concept drift detection and sample selection mechanisms
result in very efficient retraining strategies which can be successfully used
to maintain the performance of the static Android malware state-of-the-art
detectors in changing environments.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose an efficient continuous-time LiDAR-Inertial-Camera
Odometry, utilizing non-uniform B-splines to tightly couple measurements from
the LiDAR, IMU, and camera. In contrast to uniform B-spline-based
continuous-time methods, our non-uniform B-spline approach offers significant
advantages in terms of achieving real-time efficiency and high accuracy. This
is accomplished by dynamically and adaptively placing control points, taking
into account the varying dynamics of the motion. To enable efficient fusion of
heterogeneous LiDAR-Inertial-Camera data within a short sliding-window
optimization, we assign depth to visual pixels using corresponding map points
from a global LiDAR map, and formulate frame-to-map reprojection factors for
the associated pixels in the current image frame. This way circumvents the
necessity for depth optimization of visual pixels, which typically entails a
lengthy sliding window with numerous control points for continuous-time
trajectory estimation. We conduct dedicated experiments on real-world datasets
to demonstrate the advantage and efficacy of adopting non-uniform
continuous-time trajectory representation. Our LiDAR-Inertial-Camera odometry
system is also extensively evaluated on both challenging scenarios with sensor
degenerations and large-scale scenarios, and has shown comparable or higher
accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. The codebase of this paper will
also be open-sourced at https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Coco-LIC.

<p class="mathjax">As an interpretable and universal neuro-symbolic paradigm based on Large
Language Models, visual programming (VisualProg) can execute compositional
visual tasks without training, but its performance is markedly inferior
compared to task-specific supervised learning models. To increase its
practicality, the performance of VisualProg on specific tasks needs to be
improved. However, the non-differentiability of VisualProg limits the
possibility of employing the fine-tuning strategy on specific tasks to achieve
further improvements. In our analysis, we discovered that significant
performance issues in VisualProg's execution originated from errors made by the
sub-modules at corresponding visual sub-task steps. To address this, we propose
``VisualProg Distiller", a method of supplementing and distilling process
knowledge to optimize the performance of each VisualProg sub-module on
decoupled visual sub-tasks, thus enhancing the overall task performance.
Specifically, we choose an end-to-end model that is well-performed on the given
task as the teacher and further distill the knowledge of the teacher into the
invoked visual sub-modules step-by-step based on the execution flow of the
VisualProg-generated programs. In this way, our method is capable of
facilitating the fine-tuning of the non-differentiable VisualProg frameworks
effectively. Extensive and comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate
that our method can achieve a substantial performance improvement of
VisualProg, and outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art methods by large
margins. Furthermore, to provide valuable process supervision for the GQA task,
we construct a large-scale dataset by utilizing the distillation process of our
method.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the dynamics of unknown object is crucial for collaborative
robots including humanoids to more safely and accurately interact with humans.
Most relevant literature leverage a force/torque sensor, prior knowledge of
object, vision system, and a long-horizon trajectory which are often
impractical. Moreover, these methods often entail solving non-linear
optimization problem, sometimes yielding physically inconsistent results. In
this work, we propose a fast learningbased inertial parameter estimation as
more practical manner. We acquire a reliable dataset in a high-fidelity
simulation and train a time-series data-driven regression model (e.g., LSTM) to
estimate the inertial parameter of unknown objects. We also introduce a novel
sim-to-real adaptation method combining Robot System Identification and
Gaussian Processes to directly transfer the trained model to real-world
application. We demonstrate our method with a 4-DOF single manipulator of
physical wheeled humanoid robot, SATYRR. Results show that our method can
identify the inertial parameters of various unknown objects faster and more
accurately than conventional methods.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have consistently showcased remarkable
generalization capabilities when applied to various language tasks.
Nonetheless, harnessing the full potential of LLMs for Radiology Report
Generation (R2Gen) still presents a challenge, stemming from the inherent
disparity in modality between LLMs and the R2Gen task. To bridge this gap
effectively, we propose R2GenGPT, which is a novel solution that aligns visual
features with the word embedding space of LLMs using an efficient visual
alignment module. This innovative approach empowers the previously static LLM
to seamlessly integrate and process image information, marking a step forward
in optimizing R2Gen performance. R2GenGPT offers the following benefits. First,
it attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by training only the lightweight
visual alignment module while freezing all the parameters of LLM. Second, it
exhibits high training efficiency, as it requires the training of an
exceptionally minimal number of parameters while achieving rapid convergence.
By employing delta tuning, our model only trains 5M parameters (which
constitute just 0.07\% of the total parameter count) to achieve performance
close to the SOTA levels. Our code is available at
https://github.com/wang-zhanyu/R2GenGPT.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models such as ChatGPT have made significant strides in robotic
tasks due to their universal representation of real-world domains. In this
paper, we leverage foundation models to tackle grasp detection, a persistent
challenge in robotics with broad industrial applications. Despite numerous
grasp datasets, their object diversity remains limited compared to real-world
figures. Fortunately, foundation models possess an extensive repository of
real-world knowledge, including objects we encounter in our daily lives. As a
consequence, a promising solution to the limited representation in previous
grasp datasets is to harness the universal knowledge embedded in these
foundation models. We present Grasp-Anything, a new large-scale grasp dataset
synthesized from foundation models to implement this solution. Grasp-Anything
excels in diversity and magnitude, boasting 1M samples with text descriptions
and more than 3M objects, surpassing prior datasets. Empirically, we show that
Grasp-Anything successfully facilitates zero-shot grasp detection on
vision-based tasks and real-world robotic experiments. Our dataset and code are
available at https://grasp-anything-2023.github.io.

silos of cloud and edge computing, can enable the seamless and dynamic
deployment of applications across diverse infrastructures. By utilizing the
cloud-native features and scalability of Kubernetes, this concept promotes
deployment transparency, communication transparency, and resource availability
transparency. Key features of this paradigm include intent-driven policies, a
decentralized architecture, multi-ownership, and a fluid topology. Integral to
the computing continuum are the building blocks of dynamic discovery and

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform our lives and
work through the content they generate, known as AI-Generated Content (AIGC).
To harness this transformation, we need to understand the limitations of LLMs.
Here, we investigate the bias of AIGC produced by seven representative LLMs,
including ChatGPT and LLaMA. We collect news articles from The New York Times
and Reuters, both known for delivering relatively unbiased news. We then apply
each examined LLM to generate news content with headlines of these news
articles as prompts, and evaluate the gender and racial biases of the AIGC
produced by the LLM by comparing the AIGC and the original news articles. We
further analyze the gender bias of each LLM under biased prompts by adding
gender-biased messages to prompts constructed from these news headlines. Our
study reveals that the AIGC produced by each examined LLM demonstrates
substantial gender and racial biases. Moreover, the AIGC generated by each LLM
exhibits notable discrimination against females and individuals of the Black
race. Among the LLMs, the AIGC generated by ChatGPT demonstrates the lowest
level of bias, and ChatGPT is the sole model capable of declining content
generation when provided with biased prompts.

<p class="mathjax">Auto-completing code enables developers to speed up coding significantly.
Recent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies
have been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such
synthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel
vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable
code generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable
lines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when
generating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we
deny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To
evaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain
smart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC
security. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397
Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning
took more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned
model could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation
Understudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were
vulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing
different types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that
more than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further
fine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of
vulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning
took only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and
found that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as
vulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could
efficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.

<p class="mathjax">Clustering of urban traffic patterns is an essential task in many different
areas of traffic management and planning. In this paper, two significant
applications in the clustering of urban traffic patterns are described. The
first application estimates the missing speed values using the speed of road
segments with similar traffic patterns to colorify map tiles. The second one is
the estimation of essential road segments for generating addresses for a local
point on the map, using the similarity patterns of different road segments. The
speed time series extracts the traffic pattern in different road segments. In
this paper, we proposed the time series clustering algorithm based on K-Means
and Dynamic Time Warping. The case study of our proposed algorithm is based on
the Snapp application's driver speed time series data. The results of the two
applications illustrate that the proposed method can extract similar urban

<p class="mathjax">Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the performance of a primary task
by jointly learning with related auxiliary tasks. Traditional MTL methods
select tasks randomly during training. However, both previous studies and our
results suggest that such the random selection of tasks may not be helpful, and
can even be harmful to performance. Therefore, new strategies for task
selection and assignment in MTL need to be explored. This paper studies the
multi-modal, multi-task dialogue act classification task, and proposes a method
for selecting and assigning tasks based on non-stationary multi-armed bandits
(MAB) with discounted Thompson Sampling (TS) using Gaussian priors. Our
experimental results show that in different training stages, different tasks
have different utility. Our proposed method can effectively identify the task
utility, actively avoid useless or harmful tasks, and realise the task
assignment during training. Our proposed method is significantly superior in
terms of UAR and F1 to the single-task and multi-task baselines with p-values &lt;
0.05. Further analysis of experiments indicates that for the dataset with the
data imbalance problem, our proposed method has significantly higher stability
and can obtain consistent and decent performance for minority classes. Our
proposed method is superior to the current state-of-the-art model.

<p class="mathjax">Societal biases that are contained in retrieved documents have received
increased interest. Such biases, which are often prevalent in the training data
and learned by the model, can cause societal harms, by misrepresenting certain
groups, and by enforcing stereotypes. Mitigating such biases demands algorithms
that balance the trade-off between maximized utility for the user with fairness
objectives, which incentivize unbiased rankings. Prior work on bias mitigation
often assumes that ranking scores, which correspond to the utility that a
document holds for a user, can be accurately determined. In reality, there is
always a degree of uncertainty in the estimate of expected document utility.
This uncertainty can be approximated by viewing ranking models through a
Bayesian perspective, where the standard deterministic score becomes a
distribution.
<br />In this work, we investigate whether uncertainty estimates can be used to
decrease the amount of bias in the ranked results, while minimizing loss in
measured utility. We introduce a simple method that uses the uncertainty of the
ranking scores for an uncertainty-aware, post hoc approach to bias mitigation.
We compare our proposed method with existing baselines for bias mitigation with
respect to the utility-fairness trade-off, the controllability of methods, and
computational costs. We show that an uncertainty-based approach can provide an
intuitive and flexible trade-off that outperforms all baselines without
additional training requirements, allowing for the post hoc use of this
approach on top of arbitrary retrieval models.

<p class="mathjax">Voice spoofing attacks pose a significant threat to automated speaker
verification systems. Existing anti-spoofing methods often simulate specific
attack types, such as synthetic or replay attacks. However, in real-world
scenarios, the countermeasures are unaware of the generation schema of the
attack, necessitating a unified solution. Current unified solutions struggle to
detect spoofing artifacts, especially with recent spoofing mechanisms. For
instance, the spoofing algorithms inject spectral or temporal anomalies, which
are challenging to identify. To this end, we present a spectra-temporal fusion
leveraging frame-level and utterance-level coefficients. We introduce a novel
local spectral deviation coefficient (SDC) for frame-level inconsistencies and
employ a bi-LSTM-based network for sequential temporal coefficients (STC),
which capture utterance-level artifacts. Our spectra-temporal fusion strategy
combines these coefficients, and an auto-encoder generates spectra-temporal
deviated coefficients (STDC) to enhance robustness. Our proposed approach
addresses multiple spoofing categories, including synthetic, replay, and
partial deepfake attacks. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets
(ASVspoof2019, ASVspoof2021, VSDC, partial spoofs, and in-the-wild deepfakes)
demonstrated its robustness for a wide range of voice applications.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of deep learning, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has
made significant progress. To further enhance the performance, revising
recognition results is one of the lightweight but efficient manners. Various
methods can be roughly classified into N-best reranking methods and error
correction models. The former aims to select the hypothesis with the lowest
error rate from a set of candidates generated by ASR for a given input speech.
The latter focuses on detecting recognition errors in a given hypothesis and
correcting these errors to obtain an enhanced result. However, we observe that
these studies are hardly comparable to each other as they are usually evaluated
on different corpora, paired with different ASR models, and even use different
datasets to train the models. Accordingly, we first concentrate on releasing an
ASR hypothesis revising (HypR) dataset in this study. HypR contains several
commonly used corpora (AISHELL-1, TED-LIUM 2, and LibriSpeech) and provides 50
recognition hypotheses for each speech utterance. The checkpoint models of the
ASR are also published. In addition, we implement and compare several classic
and representative methods, showing the recent research progress in revising
speech recognition results. We hope the publicly available HypR dataset can
become a reference benchmark for subsequent research and promote the school of
research to an advanced level.

<p class="mathjax">In 5G cellular networks, frequency range 2 (FR2) introduces higher
frequencies that cause rapid signal degradation and challenge user mobility. In
recent studies, a conditional handover procedure has been adopted as an
enhancement to baseline handover to enhance user mobility robustness. In this
article, the mobility performance of conditional handover is analyzed for a 5G
mm-wave network in FR2 that employs beamforming. In addition, a
resource-efficient random access procedure is proposed that increases the
probability of contention-free random access during a handover. Moreover, a
simple yet effective decision tree-based supervised learning method is proposed
to minimize the handover failures that are caused by the beam preparation phase
of the random access procedure. Results have shown that a tradeoff exists
between contention-free random access and handover failures. It is also seen
that the optimum operation point of random access is achievable with the
proposed learning algorithm for conditional handover. Moreover, a mobility
performance comparison of conditional handover with baseline handover is also
carried out. Results have shown that while baseline handover causes fewer
handover failures than conditional handover, the total number of mobility
failures in the latter is less due to the decoupling of the handover
preparation and execution phases.

<p class="mathjax">Conventional end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models primarily
focus on exact transcription tasks, lacking flexibility for nuanced user
interactions. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in speech
processing, more organic, text-prompt-based interactions have become possible.
However, the mechanisms behind these models' speech understanding and
"reasoning" capabilities remain underexplored. To study this question from the
data perspective, we introduce instruction-following speech recognition,
training a Listen-Attend-Spell model to understand and execute a diverse set of
free-form text instructions. This enables a multitude of speech recognition
tasks -- ranging from transcript manipulation to summarization -- without
relying on predefined command sets. Remarkably, our model, trained from scratch
on Librispeech, interprets and executes simple instructions without requiring
LLMs or pre-trained speech modules. It also offers selective transcription
options based on instructions like "transcribe first half and then turn off
listening," providing an additional layer of privacy and safety compared to
existing LLMs. Our findings highlight the significant potential of
instruction-following training to advance speech foundation models.

<p class="mathjax">Corner case scenarios are an essential tool for testing and validating the
safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). As these scenarios are often
insufficiently present in naturalistic driving datasets, augmenting the data
with synthetic corner cases greatly enhances the safe operation of AVs in
unique situations. However, the generation of synthetic, yet realistic, corner
cases poses a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach based on Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) to transform
regular driving scenarios into corner cases. To achieve this, we first generate
concise representations of regular driving scenes as scene graphs, minimally
manipulating their structure and properties. Our model then learns to perturb
those graphs to generate corner cases using attention and triple embeddings.
The input and perturbed graphs are then imported back into the simulation to
generate corner case scenarios. Our model successfully learned to produce
corner cases from input scene graphs, achieving 89.9% prediction accuracy on
our testing dataset. We further validate the generated scenarios on baseline
autonomous driving methods, demonstrating our model's ability to effectively
create critical situations for the baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration is a critical task for multi-sensor fusion
in autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles and mobile robots.
Traditional techniques often require manual intervention or specific
environments, making them labour-intensive and error-prone. Existing deep
learning-based self-calibration methods focus on small realignments and still
rely on initial estimates, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we
present PseudoCal, a novel self-calibration method that overcomes these
limitations by leveraging the pseudo-LiDAR concept and working directly in the
3D space instead of limiting itself to the camera field of view. In typical
autonomous vehicle and robotics contexts and conventions, PseudoCal is able to
perform one-shot calibration quasi-independently of initial parameter
estimates, addressing extreme cases that remain unsolved by existing
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we show that recent advances in video representation learning
and pre-trained vision-language models allow for substantial improvements in
self-supervised video object localization. We propose a method that first
localizes objects in videos via a slot attention approach and then assigns text
to the obtained slots. The latter is achieved by an unsupervised way to read
localized semantic information from the pre-trained CLIP model. The resulting
video object localization is entirely unsupervised apart from the implicit
annotation contained in CLIP, and it is effectively the first unsupervised
approach that yields good results on regular video benchmarks.

representing spatial and conceptual relationships within an environment. The
ability to learn and infer the underlying structure of the environment is
crucial for effective exploration and navigation. This paper introduces a
hierarchical active inference model addressing the challenge of inferring

hierarchical model consisting of a cognitive map, an allocentric, and an

goal-oriented behaviour at the different levels of reasoning from context to

<p class="mathjax">Scene transfer for vision-based mobile robotics applications is a highly
relevant and challenging problem. The utility of a robot greatly depends on its
ability to perform a task in the real world, outside of a well-controlled lab
environment. Existing scene transfer end-to-end policy learning approaches
often suffer from poor sample efficiency or limited generalization
capabilities, making them unsuitable for mobile robotics applications. This
work proposes an adaptive multi-pair contrastive learning strategy for visual
representation learning that enables zero-shot scene transfer and real-world
deployment. Control policies relying on the embedding are able to operate in
unseen environments without the need for finetuning in the deployment
environment. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the task of
agile, vision-based quadrotor flight. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully generalizes beyond the
training domain and outperforms all baselines.

<p class="mathjax">When translating UI design prototypes to code in industry, automatically
generating code from design prototypes can expedite the development of
applications and GUI iterations. However, in design prototypes without strict
design specifications, UI components may be composed of fragmented elements.
Grouping these fragmented elements can greatly improve the readability and
maintainability of the generated code. Current methods employ a two-stage
strategy that introduces hand-crafted rules to group fragmented elements.
Unfortunately, the performance of these methods is not satisfying due to
visually overlapped and tiny UI elements. In this study, we propose EGFE, a
novel method for automatically End-to-end Grouping Fragmented Elements via UI
sequence prediction. To facilitate the UI understanding, we innovatively
construct a Transformer encoder to model the relationship between the UI
elements with multi-modal representation learning. The evaluation on a dataset
of 4606 UI prototypes collected from professional UI designers shows that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the precision (by
29.75\%), recall (by 31.07\%), and F1-score (by 30.39\%) at edit distance
threshold of 4. In addition, we conduct an empirical study to assess the
improvement of the generated front-end code. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a real software engineering application. Our
end-to-end fragmented elements grouping method creates opportunities for
improving UI-related software engineering tasks.

<p class="mathjax">We report on a study that employs an in-house developed simulation
infrastructure to accomplish zero shot policy transferability for a control
policy associated with a scale autonomous vehicle. We focus on implementing
policies that require no real world data to be trained (Zero-Shot Transfer),
and are developed in-house as opposed to being validated by previous works. We
do this by implementing a Neural Network (NN) controller that is trained only
on a family of circular reference trajectories. The sensors used are RTK-GPS
and IMU, the latter for providing heading. The NN controller is trained using
either a human driver (via human in the loop simulation), or a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) strategy. We demonstrate these two approaches in conjunction with
two operation scenarios: the vehicle follows a waypoint-defined trajectory at
constant speed; and the vehicle follows a speed profile that changes along the
vehicle's waypoint-defined trajectory. The primary contribution of this work is
the demonstration of Zero-Shot Transfer in conjunction with a novel
feed-forward NN controller trained using a general purpose, in-house developed

<p class="mathjax">Localization is paramount for autonomous robots. While camera and LiDAR-based
approaches have been extensively investigated, they are affected by adverse
illumination and weather conditions. Therefore, radar sensors have recently
gained attention due to their intrinsic robustness to such conditions. In this
paper, we propose RaLF, a novel deep neural network-based approach for
localizing radar scans in a LiDAR map of the environment, by jointly learning
to address both place recognition and metric localization. RaLF is composed of
radar and LiDAR feature encoders, a place recognition head that generates
global descriptors, and a metric localization head that predicts the 3-DoF
transformation between the radar scan and the map. We tackle the place
recognition task by learning a shared embedding space between the two
modalities via cross-modal metric learning. Additionally, we perform metric
localization by predicting pixel-level flow vectors that align the query radar
scan with the LiDAR map. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple
real-world driving datasets and show that RaLF achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both place recognition and metric localization. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our approach can effectively generalize to different cities
and sensor setups than the ones used during training. We make the code and

<p class="mathjax">User-generated texts available on the web and social platforms are often long
and semantically challenging, making them difficult to annotate. Obtaining
human annotation becomes increasingly difficult as problem domains become more
specialized. For example, many health NLP problems require domain experts to be
a part of the annotation pipeline. Thus, it is crucial that we develop
low-resource NLP solutions able to work with this set of limited-data problems.
In this study, we employ Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs as a
means to model low-resource Health NLP tasks sourced from various online health
resources and communities. AMRs are well suited to model online health texts as
they can represent multi-sentence inputs, abstract away from complex
terminology, and model long-distance relationships between co-referring tokens.
AMRs thus improve the ability of pre-trained language models to reason about
high-complexity texts. Our experiments show that we can improve performance on
6 low-resource health NLP tasks by augmenting text embeddings with semantic
graph embeddings. Our approach is task agnostic and easy to merge into any
standard text classification pipeline. We experimentally validate that AMRs are
useful in the modeling of complex texts by analyzing performance through the
lens of two textual complexity measures: the Flesch Kincaid Reading Level and
Syntactic Complexity. Our error analysis shows that AMR-infused language models
perform better on complex texts and generally show less predictive variance in
the presence of changing complexity.

<p class="mathjax">In static environments, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM)
methods achieve remarkable performance. However, moving objects severely affect
core modules of such systems like state estimation and loop closure detection.
To address this, dynamic SLAM approaches often use semantic information,
geometric constraints, or optical flow to mask features associated with dynamic
entities. These are limited by various factors such as a dependency on the
quality of the underlying method, poor generalization to unknown or unexpected
moving objects, and often produce noisy results, e.g. by masking static but
movable objects or making use of predefined thresholds. In this paper, to
address these trade-offs, we introduce a novel visual SLAM system, DynaPix,
based on per-pixel motion probability values. Our approach consists of a new
semantic-free probabilistic pixel-wise motion estimation module and an improved
pose optimization process. Our per-pixel motion probability estimation combines
a novel static background differencing method on both images and optical flows
from splatted frames. DynaPix fully integrates those motion probabilities into
both map point selection and weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and
optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We evaluate DynaPix against ORB-SLAM2 and
DynaSLAM on both GRADE and TUM-RGBD datasets, obtaining lower errors and longer
trajectory tracking times. We will release both source code and data upon
acceptance of this work.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic congestion in dense urban centers presents an economical and
environmental burden. In recent years, the availability of vehicle-to-anything
communication allows for the transmission of detailed vehicle states to the
infrastructure that can be used for intelligent traffic light control. The
other way around, the infrastructure can provide vehicles with advice on
driving behavior, such as appropriate velocities, which can improve the
efficacy of the traffic system. Several research works applied deep
reinforcement learning to either traffic light control or vehicle speed advice.
In this work, we propose a first attempt to jointly learn the control of both.
We show this to improve the efficacy of traffic systems. In our experiments,
the joint control approach reduces average vehicle trip delays, w.r.t.
controlling only traffic lights, in eight out of eleven benchmark scenarios.
Analyzing the qualitative behavior of the vehicle speed advice policy, we
observe that this is achieved by smoothing out the velocity profile of vehicles
nearby a traffic light. Learning joint control of traffic signaling and speed
advice in the real world could help to reduce congestion and mitigate the
economical and environmental repercussions of today's traffic systems.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a differentiable representation for optimization of
boustrophedon path plans in convex polygons, explores an additional parameter
of these path plans that can be optimized, discusses the properties of this
representation that can be leveraged during the optimization process, and shows
that the previously published attempt at optimization of these path plans was
too coarse to be practically useful. Experiments were conducted to show that
this differentiable representation can reproduce the same scores from
transitional discrete representations of boustrophedon path plans with high
fidelity. Finally, optimization via gradient descent was attempted, but found
to fail because the search space is far more non-convex than was previously
considered in the literature. The wide range of applications for boustrophedon
path plans means that this work has the potential to improve path planning
efficiency in numerous areas of robotics including mapping and search tasks
using uncrewed aerial systems, environmental sampling tasks using uncrewed
marine vehicles, and agricultural tasks using ground vehicles, among numerous
others applications.

<p class="mathjax">Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) integrates communication and model
aggregation by exploiting the innate superposition property of wireless
channels. The approach renders bandwidth efficient learning, but requires care
in handling the wireless physical layer impairments. In this paper, federated
edge learning is considered for a network that is heterogeneous with respect to
client (edge node) data set distributions and individual client resources,
under a general non-convex learning objective. We augment the wireless OTA-FL
system with a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to enable a propagation
environment with improved learning performance in a realistic time varying
physical layer. Our approach is a cross-layer perspective that jointly
optimizes communication, computation and learning resources, in this general
heterogeneous setting. We adapt the local computation steps and transmission
power of the clients in conjunction with the RIS phase shifts. The resulting
joint communication and learning algorithm, RIS-assisted Over-the-air Adaptive
Resource Allocation for Federated learning (ROAR-Fed) is shown to be convergent
in this general setting. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
ROAR-Fed under heterogeneous (non i.i.d.) data and imperfect CSI, indicating
the advantage of RIS assisted learning in this general set up.

<p class="mathjax">Neural pathways as model explanations consist of a sparse set of neurons that
provide the same level of prediction performance as the whole model. Existing
methods primarily focus on accuracy and sparsity but the generated pathways may
offer limited interpretability thus fall short in explaining the model
behavior. In this paper, we suggest two interpretability criteria of neural
pathways: (i) same-class neural pathways should primarily consist of
class-relevant neurons; (ii) each instance's neural pathway sparsity should be
optimally determined. To this end, we propose a Generative Class-relevant
Neural Pathway (GEN-CNP) model that learns to predict the neural pathways from
the target model's feature maps. We propose to learn class-relevant information
from features of deep and shallow layers such that same-class neural pathways
exhibit high similarity. We further impose a faithfulness criterion for GEN-CNP
to generate pathways with instance-specific sparsity. We propose to transfer
the class-relevant neural pathways to explain samples of the same class and
show experimentally and qualitatively their faithfulness and interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Two lines of work are taking the central stage in AI research. On the one
hand, the community is making increasing efforts to build models that discard
spurious correlations and generalize better in novel test environments.
Unfortunately, the bitter lesson so far is that no proposal convincingly
outperforms a simple empirical risk minimization baseline. On the other hand,
large language models (LLMs) have erupted as algorithms able to learn
in-context, generalizing on-the-fly to the eclectic contextual circumstances
that users enforce by means of prompting. In this paper, we argue that context
$\approx$ environment, and posit that in-context learning holds the key to
better domain generalization. Via extensive theory and experiments, we show
that paying attention to context$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$unlabeled
examples as they arrive$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$allows our proposed
In-Context Risk Minimization (ICRM) algorithm to zoom-in on the test
environment risk minimizer, leading to significant out-of-distribution
performance improvements. From all of this, two messages are worth taking home.
Researchers in domain generalization should consider environment as context,
and harness the adaptive power of in-context learning. Researchers in LLMs
should consider context as environment to better structure data towards
generalization.

<p class="mathjax">The English proficiency of students in rural areas of China tends to be lower
than that of their urban counterparts, owing to outdated teaching methods, a
lack of advanced technology resources, and low motivation for English learning.
This study examines the impact of an Augmented Reality English Words Learning
(AREWL) system on the learning motivation, achievement, behavioral patterns,
and cognitive attainment of elementary school students in rural China. The
study explores whether student motivation varies with their level of
achievement and vice versa, and provides an analysis of behavioral patterns and
cognitive attainment. The AREWL system employs 3D virtual objects, animations,
and assessments to teach English pronunciation and spelling. Instructions are
provided in both English and Chinese for ease of use.
<br />The sample group consisted of 20 students from grades 1 and 2, selected based
on low pretest scores, along with five non-native teachers. Data were collected
through pretests and posttests, questionnaires, surveys, video recordings, and
in-app evaluations. Quantitative methods were used to analyze test scores and
teacher opinions, while qualitative methods were employed to study student
behavior and its relationship with cognitive attainment.
<br />Results indicate that both teachers and students responded favorably to the
AREWL system. Students exhibited both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which
correlated significantly with their learning achievements. While behavioral
analysis showed interactive engagement with the AREWL system, cognitive
attainment was found to be relatively low. The study concludes that AR-based
learning applications can play an important role in motivating English learning
among young learners in China. The findings contribute to the field of
educational technology by introducing a new AR-based English words learning
application.

<p class="mathjax">Causality and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have developed as
separate fields in computer science, even though the underlying concepts of
causation and explanation share common ancient roots. This is further enforced
by the lack of review works jointly covering these two fields. In this paper,
we investigate the literature to try to understand how and to what extent
causality and XAI are intertwined. More precisely, we seek to uncover what
kinds of relationships exist between the two concepts and how one can benefit
from them, for instance, in building trust in AI systems. As a result, three
main perspectives are identified. In the first one, the lack of causality is
seen as one of the major limitations of current AI and XAI approaches, and the
"optimal" form of explanations is investigated. The second is a pragmatic
perspective and considers XAI as a tool to foster scientific exploration for
causal inquiry, via the identification of pursue-worthy experimental
manipulations. Finally, the third perspective supports the idea that causality
is propaedeutic to XAI in three possible manners: exploiting concepts borrowed
from causality to support or improve XAI, utilizing counterfactuals for
explainability, and considering accessing a causal model as explaining itself.
To complement our analysis, we also provide relevant software solutions used to
automate causal tasks. We believe our work provides a unified view of the two
fields of causality and XAI by highlighting potential domain bridges and
uncovering possible limitations.

<p class="mathjax">The growing body of political texts opens up new opportunities for rich
insights into political dynamics and ideologies but also increases the workload
for manual analysis. Automated speaker attribution, which detects who said what
to whom in a speech event and is closely related to semantic role labeling, is
an important processing step for computational text analysis. We study the
potential of the large language model family Llama 2 to automate speaker
attribution in German parliamentary debates from 2017-2021. We fine-tune Llama
2 with QLoRA, an efficient training strategy, and observe our approach to
achieve competitive performance in the GermEval 2023 Shared Task On Speaker
Attribution in German News Articles and Parliamentary Debates. Our results shed
light on the capabilities of large language models in automating speaker
attribution, revealing a promising avenue for computational analysis of
political discourse and the development of semantic role labeling systems.

<p class="mathjax">The recent surge of utilizing deep neural networks for geometric processing
and shape modeling has opened up exciting avenues. However, there is a
conspicuous lack of research efforts on using powerful neural representations
to extend the capabilities of parametric surfaces, which are the prevalent
surface representations in product design, CAD/CAM, and computer animation. We
present Neural Parametric Surfaces, the first piecewise neural surface
representation that allows coarse patch layouts of arbitrary $n$-sided surface
patches to model complex surface geometries with high precision, offering
greater flexibility over traditional parametric surfaces. By construction, this
new surface representation guarantees $G^0$ continuity between adjacent patches
and empirically achieves $G^1$ continuity, which cannot be attained by existing
neural patch-based methods. The key ingredient of our neural parametric surface
is a learnable feature complex $\mathcal{C}$ that is embedded in a
high-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^D$ and topologically equivalent to the patch
layout of the surface; each face cell of the complex is defined by
interpolating feature vectors at its vertices. The learned feature complex is
mapped by an MLP-encoded function $f:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ to
produce the neural parametric surface $\mathcal{S}$. We present a surface
fitting algorithm that optimizes the feature complex $\mathcal{C}$ and trains
the neural mapping $f$ to reconstruct given target shapes with high accuracy.
We further show that the proposed representation along with a compact-size
neural net can learn a plausible shape space from a shape collection, which can
be used for shape interpolation or shape completion from noisy and incomplete
input data. Extensive experiments show that neural parametric surfaces offer
greater modeling capabilities than traditional parametric surfaces.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous mobility tasks such as lastmile delivery require reasoning about
operator indicated preferences over terrains on which the robot should navigate
to ensure both robot safety and mission success. However, coping with out of
distribution data from novel terrains or appearance changes due to lighting
variations remains a fundamental problem in visual terrain adaptive navigation.
Existing solutions either require labor intensive manual data recollection and
labeling or use handcoded reward functions that may not align with operator
preferences. In this work, we posit that operator preferences for visually
novel terrains, which the robot should adhere to, can often be extrapolated
from established terrain references within the inertial, proprioceptive, and
tactile domain. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Preference extrApolation
for Terrain awarE Robot Navigation, PATERN, a novel framework for extrapolating
operator terrain preferences for visual navigation. PATERN learns to map
inertial, proprioceptive, tactile measurements from the robots observations to
a representation space and performs nearest neighbor search in this space to
estimate operator preferences over novel terrains. Through physical robot
experiments in outdoor environments, we assess PATERNs capability to
extrapolate preferences and generalize to novel terrains and challenging
lighting conditions. Compared to baseline approaches, our findings indicate
that PATERN robustly generalizes to diverse terrains and varied lighting
conditions, while navigating in a preference aligned manner.

<p class="mathjax">In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research, the predominant focus
has been on interpreting models for experts and practitioners. Model agnostic
and local explanation approaches are deemed interpretable and sufficient in
many applications. However, in domains like healthcare, where end users are
patients without AI or domain expertise, there is an urgent need for model
explanations that are more comprehensible and instil trust in the model's
operations. We hypothesise that generating model explanations that are
narrative, patient-specific and global(holistic of the model) would enable
better understandability and enable decision-making. We test this using a
decision tree model to generate both local and global explanations for patients
identified as having a high risk of coronary heart disease. These explanations
are presented to non-expert users. We find a strong individual preference for a
specific type of explanation. The majority of participants prefer global
explanations, while a smaller group prefers local explanations. A task based
evaluation of mental models of these participants provide valuable feedback to
enhance narrative global explanations. This, in turn, guides the design of
health informatics systems that are both trustworthy and actionable.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new
research domain, LLM agents, for solving robotics and planning tasks by
leveraging the world knowledge and general reasoning abilities of LLMs obtained
during pretraining. However, while considerable effort has been made to teach
the robot the "dos," the "don'ts" received relatively less attention. We argue
that, for any practical usage, it is as crucial to teach the robot the
"don'ts": conveying explicit instructions about prohibited actions, assessing
the robot's comprehension of these restrictions, and, most importantly,
ensuring compliance. Moreover, verifiable safe operation is essential for
deployments that satisfy worldwide standards such as ISO 61508, which defines
standards for safely deploying robots in industrial factory environments
worldwide. Aiming at deploying the LLM agents in a collaborative environment,
we propose a queryable safety constraint module based on linear temporal logic
(LTL) that simultaneously enables natural language (NL) to temporal constraints
encoding, safety violation reasoning and explaining, and unsafe action pruning.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments in
VirtualHome environment and on a real robot. The experimental results show that
our system strictly adheres to the safety constraints and scales well with
complex safety constraints, highlighting its potential for practical utility.

system to ensure minimum downtime and maintain reliable operation. This
necessitates access to a comprehensive procedure that can provide the grid
operators with insightful information in the case of a fault event. In this
paper, we propose a heterogeneous multi-task learning graph neural network
(MTL-GNN) capable of detecting, locating and classifying faults in addition to
providing an estimate of the fault resistance and current. Using a graph neural
network (GNN) allows for learning the topological representation of the
distribution system as well as feature learning through a message-passing
scheme. We investigate the robustness of our proposed model using the IEEE-123
test feeder system. This work also proposes a novel GNN-based explainability
method to identify key nodes in the distribution system which then facilitates
informed sparse measurements. Numerical tests validate the performance of the
model across all tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Robust and efficient solvers for coupled-adjoint linear systems are crucial
to successful aerostructural optimization. Monolithic and partitioned
strategies can be applied. The monolithic approach is expected to offer better
robustness and efficiency for strong fluid-structure interactions. However, it
requires a high implementation cost and convergence may depend on appropriate
scaling and initialization strategies. On the other hand, the modularity of the
partitioned method enables a straightforward implementation while its
convergence may require relaxation. In addition, a partitioned solver leads to
a higher number of iterations to get the same level of convergence as the
monolithic one.
<br />The objective of this paper is to accelerate the fluid-structure
coupled-adjoint partitioned solver by considering techniques borrowed from
approximate invariant subspace recycling strategies adapted to sequences of
linear systems with varying right-hand sides. Indeed, in a partitioned
framework, the structural source term attached to the fluid block of equations
affects the right-hand side with the nice property of quickly converging to a
constant value. We also consider deflation of approximate eigenvectors in
conjunction with advanced inner-outer Krylov solvers for the fluid block
equations. We demonstrate the benefit of these techniques by computing the
coupled derivatives of an aeroelastic configuration of the ONERA-M6 fixed wing
in transonic flow. For this exercise the fluid grid was coupled to a structural
model specifically designed to exhibit a high flexibility. All computations are
performed using RANS flow modeling and a fully linearized one-equation
Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Numerical simulations show up to 39%
reduction in matrix-vector products for GCRO-DR and up to 19% for the nested
FGCRO-DR solver.

is assumed to be non-functional (that is, has a functionality of zero) with
respect to a perturbation bound if a conventional measure of performance, such

robustness in terms of an expected value is motivated by a domain general

<p class="mathjax">Typical arguments for results like Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem and the
existence of self-writing computer programs bear the fingerprints of equational
reasoning and combinatory logic. In fact, the connection of combinatory logic
and computability theory is very old, and this paper extends this connection in
new ways. In one direction, we counter the main trend in both computability
theory and combinatory logic of heading straight to undecidability. Instead,
this paper proposes using several very small equational logics to examine
results in computability theory itself. These logics are decidable via term
rewriting. We argue that they have something interesting to say about
computability theory. They are closely related to fragments of combinatory
logic which are decidable, and so this paper contributes to the study of such
fragments. The paper has a few surprising results such as a classification of
quine programs (programs which output themselves) in two decidable fragments.
The classification goes via examination of normal forms in term rewriting
systems, hence the title of the paper. The classification is an explanation of
why all quine programs (in any language) are "pretty much the same, except for
inessential details." In addition, we study the relational structure whose
objects are the programs with the relation "p expresses q" meaning that if the
program p is run on nothing, then it eventually outputs the program q.

<p class="mathjax">The most commonly used method for addressing 3D geometric registration is the
iterative closet-point algorithm, this approach is incremental and prone to
drift over multiple consecutive frames. The Common strategy to address the
drift is the pose graph optimization subsequent to frame-to-frame registration,
incorporating a loop closure process that identifies previously visited places.
In this paper, we explore a framework that replaces traditional geometric
registration and pose graph optimization with a learned model utilizing
hierarchical attention mechanisms and graph neural networks. We propose a
strategy to condense the data flow, preserving essential information required
for the precise estimation of rigid poses. Our results, derived from tests on
the KITTI Odometry dataset, demonstrate a significant improvement in pose
estimation accuracy. This improvement is especially notable in determining
rotational components when compared with results obtained through conventional
multi-way registration via pose graph optimization. The code will be made
available upon completion of the review process.

<p class="mathjax">Joint safety and security analysis of cyber-physical systems is a necessary
step to correctly capture inter-dependencies between these properties.
Attack-Fault Trees represent a combination of dynamic Fault Trees and Attack
Trees and can be used to model and model-check a holistic view on both safety
and security. Manually creating a complete AFT for the whole system is,
however, a daunting task. It needs to span multiple abstraction layers, e.g.,
abstract application architecture and data flow as well as system and library
dependencies that are affected by various vulnerabilities. We present an AFT
generation tool-chain that facilitates this task using partial Fault and Attack
Trees that are either manually created or mined from vulnerability databases.
We semi-automatically create two system models that provide the necessary
information to automatically combine these partial Fault and Attack Trees into
complete AFTs using graph transformation rules.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of surveying expansive areas, but
their operational range is constrained by limited battery capacity. The
deployment of mobile recharging stations using unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)
significantly extends the endurance and effectiveness of UAVs. However,
optimizing the routes of both UAVs and UGVs, known as the UAV-UGV cooperative
routing problem, poses substantial challenges, particularly with respect to the
selection of recharging locations. Here in this paper, we leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) for the purpose of identifying optimal recharging
locations while employing constraint programming to determine cooperative
routes for the UAV and UGV. Our proposed framework is then benchmarked against
a baseline solution that employs Genetic Algorithms (GA) to select rendezvous
points. Our findings reveal that RL surpasses GA in terms of reducing overall
mission time, minimizing UAV-UGV idle time, and mitigating energy consumption
for both the UAV and UGV. These results underscore the efficacy of
incorporating heuristics to assist RL, a method we refer to as
heuristics-assisted RL, in generating high-quality solutions for intricate
routing problems.

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing large-scale graphs poses challenges due to their increasing size
and the demand for interactive and user-friendly analytics tools. These graphs
arise from various domains, including cybersecurity, social sciences, health
sciences, and network sciences, where networks can represent interactions
between humans, neurons in the brain, or malicious flows in a network.
Exploring these large graphs is crucial for revealing hidden structures and
metrics that are not easily computable without parallel computing. Currently,
Python users can leverage the open-source Arkouda framework to efficiently
execute Pandas and NumPy-related tasks on thousands of cores. To address
large-scale graph analysis, Arachne, an extension to Arkouda, enables easy
transformation of Arkouda dataframes into graphs. This paper proposes and
evaluates three distributable data structures for property graphs, implemented
in Chapel, that are integrated into Arachne. Enriching Arachne with support for
property graphs will empower data scientists to extend their analysis to new
problem domains. Property graphs present additional complexities, requiring
efficient storage for extra information on vertices and edges, such as labels,
relationships, and properties.

<p class="mathjax">Generative text-to-image (GTI) models produce high-quality images from short
textual descriptions and are widely used in academic and creative domains.
However, GTI models frequently amplify biases from their training data, often
producing prejudiced or stereotypical images. Yet, current bias mitigation
strategies are limited and primarily focus on enforcing gender parity across
occupations. To enhance GTI bias mitigation, we introduce DiffusionWorldViewer,
a tool to analyze and manipulate GTI models' attitudes, values, stories, and
expectations of the world that impact its generated images. Through an
interactive interface deployed as a web-based GUI and Jupyter Notebook plugin,
DiffusionWorldViewer categorizes existing demographics of GTI-generated images
and provides interactive methods to align image demographics with user
worldviews. In a study with 13 GTI users, we find that DiffusionWorldViewer
allows users to represent their varied viewpoints about what GTI outputs are
fair and, in doing so, challenges current notions of fairness that assume a
universal worldview.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Odometry (VO) is crucial for autonomous robotic navigation, especially
in GPS-denied environments like planetary terrains. While standard RGB cameras
struggle in low-light or high-speed motion, event-based cameras offer high
dynamic range and low latency. However, seamlessly integrating asynchronous
event data with synchronous frames remains challenging. We introduce RAMP-VO,
the first end-to-end learned event- and image-based VO system. It leverages
novel Recurrent, Asynchronous, and Massively Parallel (RAMP) encoders that are
8x faster and 20% more accurate than existing asynchronous encoders. RAMP-VO
further employs a novel pose forecasting technique to predict future poses for
initialization. Despite being trained only in simulation, RAMP-VO outperforms
image- and event-based methods by 52% and 20%, respectively, on traditional,
real-world benchmarks as well as newly introduced Apollo and Malapert landing
sequences, paving the way for robust and asynchronous VO in space.

<p class="mathjax">Posts, as important containers of user-generated-content pieces on social
media, are of tremendous social influence and commercial value. As an integral
components of a post, the headline has a decisive contribution to the post's
popularity. However, current mainstream method for headline generation is still
manually writing, which is unstable and requires extensive human effort. This
drives us to explore a novel research question: Can we automate the generation
of popular headlines on social media? We collect more than 1 million posts of
42,447 celebrities from public data of Xiaohongshu, which is a well-known
social media platform in China. We then conduct careful observations on the
headlines of these posts. Observation results demonstrate that trends and
personal styles are widespread in headlines on social medias and have
significant contribution to posts's popularity. Motivated by these insights, we
present MEBART, which combines Multiple preference-Extractors with
Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART), capturing trends and
personal styles to generate popular headlines on social medias. We perform
extensive experiments on real-world datasets and achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared with several advanced baselines. In addition, ablation and
case studies demonstrate that MEBART advances in capturing trends and personal
styles.

<p class="mathjax">Visual instruction tuning has recently shown encouraging progress with
open-source large multimodal models (LMM) such as LLaVA and MiniGPT-4. However,
most existing studies of open-source LMM are performed using models with 13B
parameters or smaller. In this paper we present an empirical study of scaling
LLaVA up to 33B and 65B/70B, and share our findings from our explorations in
image resolution, data mixing and parameter-efficient training methods such as
LoRA/QLoRA. These are evaluated by their impact on the multi-modal and language
capabilities when completing real-world tasks in the wild.
<br />We find that scaling LMM consistently enhances model performance and improves
language capabilities, and performance of LoRA/QLoRA tuning of LMM are
comparable to the performance of full-model fine-tuning. Additionally, the
study highlights the importance of higher image resolutions and mixing
multimodal-language data to improve LMM performance, and visual instruction
tuning can sometimes improve LMM's pure language capability. We hope that this
study makes state-of-the-art LMM research at a larger scale more accessible,
thus helping establish stronger baselines for future research. Code and
checkpoints will be made public.

<p class="mathjax">Given a mapping from a set of players to the leaves of a complete binary tree
(called a seeding), a knockout tournament is conducted as follows: every round,
every two players with a common parent compete against each other, and the
winner is promoted to the common parent; then, the leaves are deleted. When
only one player remains, it is declared the winner. This is a popular
competition format in sports, elections, and decision-making. Over the past
decade, it has been studied intensively from both theoretical and practical
points of view. Most frequently, the objective is to seed the tournament in a
way that "assists" (or even guarantees) some particular player to win the
competition. We introduce a new objective, which is very sensible from the
perspective of the directors of the competition: maximize the profit or
popularity of the tournament. Specifically, we associate a "score" with every
possible match, and aim to seed the tournament to maximize the sum of the
scores of the matches that take place. We focus on the case where we assume a
total order on the players' strengths, and provide a wide spectrum of results
on the computational complexity of the problem.

training dataset is either clean or tainted by missing data and ii) generates
diverse plausible data imputations. Our method often outperforms deep-learning

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast internet-scale data have
showcased remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Recently, there has
been escalating interest in deploying LLMs for robotics, aiming to harness the
power of foundation models in real-world settings. However, this approach faces
significant challenges, particularly in grounding these models in the physical
world and in generating dynamic robot motions. To address these issues, we
introduce a novel paradigm in which we use few-shot prompts collected from the
physical environment, enabling the LLM to autoregressively generate low-level
control commands for robots without task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments
across various robots and environments validate that our method can effectively
prompt a robot to walk. We thus illustrate how LLMs can proficiently function
as low-level feedback controllers for dynamic motion control even in
high-dimensional robotic systems. The project website and source code can be

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation is a common practice to help generalization in the
procedure of deep model training. In the context of physiological time series
classification, previous research has primarily focused on label-invariant data
augmentation methods. However, another class of augmentation techniques
(\textit{i.e., Mixup}) that emerged in the computer vision field has yet to be
fully explored in the time series domain. In this study, we systematically
review the mix-based augmentations, including mixup, cutmix, and manifold
mixup, on six physiological datasets, evaluating their performance across
different sensory data and classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that
the three mix-based augmentations can consistently improve the performance on
the six datasets. More importantly, the improvement does not rely on expert
knowledge or extensive parameter tuning. Lastly, we provide an overview of the
unique properties of the mix-based augmentation methods and highlight the
potential benefits of using the mix-based augmentation in physiological time

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity of performing complex
scheduling in a multi-agent system and can coordinate these agents into
completing sophisticated tasks that require extensive collaboration. However,
despite the introduction of numerous gaming frameworks, the community has
insufficient benchmarks towards building general multi-agents collaboration
infrastructure that encompass both LLM and human-NPCs collaborations. In this
work, we propose a novel infrastructure - MindAgent - to evaluate planning and
coordination emergent capabilities for gaming interaction. In particular, our
infrastructure leverages existing gaming framework, to i) require understanding
of the coordinator for a multi-agent system, ii) collaborate with human players
via un-finetuned proper instructions, and iii) establish an in-context learning
on few-shot prompt with feedback. Furthermore, we introduce CUISINEWORLD, a new
gaming scenario and related benchmark that dispatch a multi-agent collaboration
efficiency and supervise multiple agents playing the game simultaneously. We
conduct comprehensive evaluations with new auto-metric CoS for calculating the
collaboration efficiency. Finally, our infrastructure can be deployed into
real-world gaming scenarios in a customized VR version of CUISINEWORLD and
adapted in existing broader Minecraft gaming domain. We hope our findings on
LLMs and the new infrastructure for general-purpose scheduling and coordination
can help shed light on how such skills can be obtained by learning from large
language corpora.

<p class="mathjax">Web 3.0 is the new generation of the Internet that is reconstructed with
distributed technology, which focuses on data ownership and value expression.
Also, it operates under the principle that data and digital assets should be
owned and controlled by users rather than large corporations. In this survey,
we explore the current development state of Web 3.0 and the application of AI
Technology in Web 3.0. Through investigating the existing applications and
components of Web 3.0, we propose an architectural framework for Web 3.0 from
the perspective of ecological application scenarios. We outline and divide the
ecology of Web 3.0 into four layers. The main functions of each layer are data
management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application
scenarios. Our investigation delves into the major challenges and issues
present in each of these layers. In this context, AI has shown its strong
potential to solve existing problems of Web 3.0. We illustrate the crucial role
of AI in the foundation and growth of Web 3.0. We begin by providing an
overview of AI, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning
techniques. Then, we thoroughly analyze the current state of AI technology
applications in the four layers of Web 3.0 and offer some insights into its
potential future development direction.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular depth estimation is an ill-posed problem as the same 2D image can
be projected from infinite 3D scenes. Although the leading algorithms in this
field have reported significant improvement, they are essentially geared to the
particular compound of pictorial observations and camera parameters (i.e.,
intrinsics and extrinsics), strongly limiting their generalizability in
real-world scenarios. To cope with this challenge, this paper proposes a novel
ground embedding module to decouple camera parameters from pictorial cues, thus
promoting the generalization capability. Given camera parameters, the proposed
module generates the ground depth, which is stacked with the input image and
referenced in the final depth prediction. A ground attention is designed in the
module to optimally combine ground depth with residual depth. Our ground
embedding is highly flexible and lightweight, leading to a plug-in module that
is amenable to be integrated into various depth estimation networks.
Experiments reveal that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on
popular benchmarks, and more importantly, renders significant generalization
improvement on a wide range of cross-domain tests.

<p class="mathjax">Communication efficiency is a major challenge in federated learning (FL). In
client-server schemes, the server constitutes a bottleneck, and while
decentralized setups spread communications, they do not necessarily reduce them
due to slower convergence. We propose Multi-Token Coordinate Descent (MTCD), a
communication-efficient algorithm for semi-decentralized vertical federated
learning, exploiting both client-server and client-client communications when
each client holds a small subset of features. Our multi-token method can be
seen as a parallel Markov chain (block) coordinate descent algorithm and it
subsumes the client-server and decentralized setups as special cases. We obtain
a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ for nonconvex objectives when tokens
roam over disjoint subsets of clients and for convex objectives when they roam
over possibly overlapping subsets. Numerical results show that MTCD improves
the state-of-the-art communication efficiency and allows for a tunable amount
of parallel communications.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: During discussions at the Data Science Roundtable meeting in Japan,
there were instances where the adoption of the BOIN design was declined,
attributed to the extension of study duration and increased sample size in
comparison to the 3+3 design. We introduce an accelerated BOIN design aimed at
completing a clinical phase I trial at a pace comparable to the 3+3 design.
Additionally, we introduce how we could have applied the BOIN design within our
company, which predominantly utilized the 3+3 design for most of its clinical
oncology dose escalation trials. Methods: The accelerated BOIN design is
adaptable by using efficiently designated stopping criterion for the existing
BOIN framework. Our approach is to terminate the dose escalation study if the
number of evaluable patients treated at the current dose reaches 6 and the
decision is to stay at the current dose for the next cohort of patients. In
addition, for lower dosage levels, considering a cohort size smaller than 3 may
be feasible when there are no safety concerns from non-clinical studies. We
demonstrate the accelerated BOIN design using a case study and subsequently
evaluate the performance of our proposed design through a simulation study.
Results: In the simulation study, the average difference in the percentage of
correct MTD selection between the accelerated BOIN design and the standard BOIN
design was -2.43%, the average study duration and the average sample size of
the accelerated BOIN design was reduced by 14.8 months and 9.22 months,
respectively, compared with the standard BOIN design. Conclusion: We conclude
that our proposed accelerated BOIN design not only provides superior operating
characteristics but also enables the study to be completed as fast as the 3+3
design.

<p class="mathjax">A resampling scheme provides a way to switch low-weight particles for
sequential Monte Carlo with higher-weight particles representing the objective
distribution. The less the variance of the weight distribution is, the more
concentrated the effective particles are, and the quicker and more accurate it
is to approximate the hidden Markov model, especially for the nonlinear case.
We propose a repetitive deterministic domain with median ergodicity for
resampling and have achieved the lowest variances compared to the other
resampling methods. As the size of the deterministic domain $M\ll N$ (the size
of population), given a feasible size of particles, our algorithm is faster
than the state of the art, which is verified by theoretical deduction and
experiments of a hidden Markov model in both the linear and non-linear cases.

<p class="mathjax">Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common type of neurodegenerative
dementia, and identification at the prodromal stage$-$i.e., mild cognitive
impairment due to Lewy bodies (MCI-LB)$-$is important for providing appropriate
care. However, MCI-LB is often underrecognized because of its diversity in
clinical manifestations and similarities with other conditions such as mild
cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). In this study, we
propose a machine learning-based automatic pipeline that helps identify MCI-LB
by exploiting balance measures acquired with an insole sensor during a 30-s
standing task. An experiment with 98 participants (14 MCI-LB, 38 MCI-AD, 46
cognitively normal) showed that the resultant models could discriminate MCI-LB
from the other groups with up to 78.0% accuracy (AUC: 0.681), which was 6.8%
better than the accuracy of a reference model based on demographic and clinical
neuropsychological measures. Our findings may open up a new approach for timely
identification of MCI-LB, enabling better care for patients.

<p class="mathjax">Jet tagging is a classification problem in high-energy physics experiments
that aims to identify the collimated sprays of subatomic particles, jets, from
particle collisions and tag them to their emitter particle. Advances in jet
tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard
Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in
complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep
learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld
from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet
that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this
representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural
network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been
demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in
GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial
improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future
studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in
high-energy physics experiments. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Key challenges in running a retail business include how to select products to
present to consumers (the assortment problem), and how to price products (the
pricing problem) to maximize revenue or profit. Instead of considering these
problems in isolation, we propose a joint approach to assortment-pricing based
on contextual bandits. Our model is doubly high-dimensional, in that both
context vectors and actions are allowed to take values in high-dimensional
spaces. In order to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a simple
yet flexible model that captures the interactions between covariates and
actions via a (near) low-rank representation matrix. The resulting class of
models is reasonably expressive while remaining interpretable through latent
factors, and includes various structured linear bandit and pricing models as
particular cases. We propose a computationally tractable procedure that
combines an exploration/exploitation protocol with an efficient low-rank matrix
estimator, and we prove bounds on its regret. Simulation results show that this
method has lower regret than state-of-the-art methods applied to various
standard bandit and pricing models. Real-world case studies on the
assortment-pricing problem, from an industry-leading instant noodles company to
an emerging beauty start-up, underscore the gains achievable using our method.
In each case, we show at least three-fold gains in revenue or profit by our
bandit method, as well as the interpretability of the latent factor models that
are learned.

credit portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) sensitivity to asset correlations with the
use of synthetic financial correlation matrices generated with deep learning

to demonstrate the generation of plausible correlation matrices, that capture
the essential characteristics observed in empirical correlation matrices
estimated on asset returns. Instead of GANs, we employ Variational Autoencoders

<p class="mathjax">Neutral Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) emerges as a promising hardware
platform primarily due to its long coherence times and scalability.
Additionally, NAQC offers computational advantages encompassing potential
long-range connectivity, native multi-qubit gate support, and the ability to
physically rearrange qubits with high fidelity. However, for the successful
operation of a NAQC processor, one additionally requires new software tools to
translate high-level algorithmic descriptions into a hardware executable
representation, taking maximal advantage of the hardware capabilities.
Realizing new software tools requires a close connection between tool
developers and hardware experts to ensure that the corresponding software tools
obey the corresponding physical constraints. This work aims to provide a basis
to establish this connection by investigating the broad spectrum of
capabilities intrinsic to the NAQC platform and its implications on the
compilation process. To this end, we first review the physical background of
NAQC and derive how it affects the overall compilation process by formulating
suitable constraints and figures of merit. We then provide a summary of the
compilation process and discuss currently available software tools in this
overview. Finally, we present selected case studies and employ the discussed
figures of merit to evaluate the different capabilities of NAQC and compare
them between two hardware setups.

<p class="mathjax">As a promising technique, extremely large-scale (XL)-arrays offer potential
solutions for overcoming the severe path loss in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and
TeraHertz (THz) channels, crucial for enabling 6G. Nevertheless, XL-arrays
introduce deviations in electromagnetic propagation compared to traditional
arrays, fundamentally challenging the assumption with the planar-wave model.
Instead, it ushers in the spherical-wave (SW) model to accurately represent the
near-field propagation characteristics, significantly increasing signal
processing complexity. Fortunately, the SW model shows remarkable benefits on
sensing and communications (S\&amp;C), e.g., improving communication multiplexing
capability, spatial resolution, and degrees of freedom. In this context, this
article first overviews hardware/algorithm challenges, fundamental potentials,
promising applications of near-field S\&amp;C enabled by XL-arrays. To overcome the
limitations of existing XL-arrays with dense uniform array layouts and improve
S\&amp;C applications, we introduce sparse arrays (SAs). Exploring their potential,
we propose XL-SAs for mmWave/THz systems using multi-subarray designs. Finally,
several applications, challenges and resarch directions are identified.

<p class="mathjax">Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract 'vocals', 'drums', 'bass' and
'other' tracks from a piece of mixed music. While deep learning methods have
shown impressive results, there is a trend toward larger models. In our paper,
we introduce a novel and lightweight architecture called DTTNet, which is based
on Dual-Path Module and Time-Frequency Convolutions Time-Distributed
Fully-connected UNet (TFC-TDF UNet). DTTNet achieves 10.12 dB cSDR on 'vocals'
compared to 10.01 dB reported for Bandsplit RNN (BSRNN) but with 86.7% fewer
parameters. We also assess pattern-specific performance and model
generalization for intricate audio patterns.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the safe best-arm identification framework with linear feedback,
where the agent is subject to some stage-wise safety constraint that linearly
depends on an unknown parameter vector. The agent must take actions in a
conservative way so as to ensure that the safety constraint is not violated
with high probability at each round. Ways of leveraging the linear structure
for ensuring safety has been studied for regret minimization, but not for
best-arm identification to the best our knowledge. We propose a gap-based
algorithm that achieves meaningful sample complexity while ensuring the
stage-wise safety. We show that we pay an extra term in the sample complexity
due to the forced exploration phase incurred by the additional safety
constraint. Experimental illustrations are provided to justify the design of
our algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in multimodal
applications, yet the convergence of textual and musical domains remains
relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we present MusiLingo, a novel
system for music caption generation and music-related query responses.
MusiLingo employs a single projection layer to align music representations from
the pre-trained frozen music audio model MERT with the frozen LLaMA language
model, bridging the gap between music audio and textual contexts. We train it
on an extensive music caption dataset and fine-tune it with instructional data.
Due to the scarcity of high-quality music Q&amp;A datasets, we created the
MusicInstruct (MI) dataset from MusicCaps, tailored for open-ended music
inquiries. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its competitive performance in
generating music captions and composing music-related Q&amp;A pairs. Our introduced
dataset enables notable advancements beyond previous ones.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting chemical function from structure is a major goal of the chemical
sciences, from the discovery and repurposing of novel drugs to the creation of
new materials. Recently, new machine learning algorithms are opening up the
possibility of general predictive models spanning many different chemical
functions. Here, we consider the challenge of applying large language models to
chemical patents in order to consolidate and leverage the information about
chemical functionality captured by these resources. Chemical patents contain
vast knowledge on chemical function, but their usefulness as a dataset has
historically been neglected due to the impracticality of extracting
high-quality functional labels. Using a scalable ChatGPT-assisted patent
summarization and word-embedding label cleaning pipeline, we derive a Chemical
Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100K molecules and their patent-derived
functional labels. The functional labels were validated to be of high quality,
allowing us to detect a strong relationship between functional label and
chemical structural spaces. Further, we find that the co-occurrence graph of
the functional labels contains a robust semantic structure, which allowed us in
turn to examine functional relatedness among the compounds. We then trained a
model on the CheF dataset, allowing us to assign new functional labels to
compounds. Using this model, we were able to retrodict approved Hepatitis C
antivirals, uncover an antiviral mechanism undisclosed in the patent, and
identify plausible serotonin-related drugs. The CheF dataset and associated
model offers a promising new approach to predict chemical functionality.

<p class="mathjax">The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well
established; however, surprisingly little knowledge has been systematically
translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide
insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model,
BioinspiredLLM, is reported. The model was finetuned with a corpus of over a
thousand peer-reviewed articles in the field of structural biological and
bio-inspired materials and can be prompted to actively and interactively recall
information, assist with research tasks, and function as an engine for
creativity. The model has proven by example that it is not only able to
accurately recall information about biological materials when queried but also
formulate biomaterials questions and answers that can evaluate its own
performance. BioinspiredLLM also has been shown to develop sound hypotheses
regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for materials that have
never been explicitly studied before. Lastly, the model showed impressive
promise in collaborating with other generative artificial intelligence models
in a workflow that can reshape the traditional materials design process. This
collaborative generative artificial intelligence method can stimulate and
enhance bio-inspired materials design workflows. Biological materials is at a
critical intersection of multiple scientific fields and models like
BioinspiredLLM help to connect knowledge domains.

<p class="mathjax">In language modeling based music generation, a generated waveform is
represented by a sequence of hierarchical token stacks that can be decoded
either in an auto-regressive manner or in parallel, depending on the codebook
patterns. In particular, flattening the codebooks represents the highest
quality decoding strategy, while being notoriously slow. To this end, we
propose a novel stack-and-delay style of decoding strategy to improve upon the
flat pattern decoding where generation speed is four times faster as opposed to
vanilla flat decoding. This brings the inference time close to that of the
delay decoding strategy, and allows for faster inference on GPU for small batch
sizes. For the same inference efficiency budget as the delay pattern, we show
that the proposed approach performs better in objective evaluations, almost
closing the gap with the flat pattern in terms of quality. The results are
corroborated by subjective evaluations which show that samples generated by the
new model are slightly more often preferred to samples generated by the
competing model given the same text prompts.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a first step toward multilingual end-to-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) by integrating knowledge about speech articulators. The key
idea is to leverage a rich set of fundamental units that can be defined
"universally" across all spoken languages, referred to as speech attributes,
namely manner and place of articulation. Specifically, several deterministic
attribute-to-phoneme mapping matrices are constructed based on the predefined
set of universal attribute inventory, which projects the knowledge-rich
articulatory attribute logits, into output phoneme logits. The mapping puts
knowledge-based constraints to limit inconsistency with acoustic-phonetic
evidence in the integrated prediction. Combined with phoneme recognition, our
phone recognizer is able to infer from both attribute and phoneme information.
The proposed joint multilingual model is evaluated through phoneme recognition.
In multilingual experiments over 6 languages on benchmark datasets LibriSpeech
and CommonVoice, we find that our proposed solution outperforms conventional
multilingual approaches with a relative improvement of 6.85% on average, and it
also demonstrates a much better performance compared to monolingual model.
Further analysis conclusively demonstrates that the proposed solution
eliminates phoneme predictions that are inconsistent with attributes.

method for intelligent machines is presented, via extracting main features of
environmental information and applying associated encoded stimuli to
memristors, we successfully obtain human-like ability in processing
unstructured environmental information, such as amplification (&gt;720%) and
adaptation (&lt;50%) of mechanical stimuli. The method also exhibits good
scalability and generalization, validated in two typical applications of
intelligent machines: object grasping and autonomous driving. In the former, a
robot hand experimentally realizes safe and stable grasping, through learning
unknown object features (e.g., sharp corner and smooth surface) with a single
memristor in 1 ms. In the latter, the decision-making information of 10
unstructured environments in autonomous driving (e.g., overtaking cars,
pedestrians) are accurately (94%) extracted with a 40x25 memristor array. By
mimicking the intrinsic nature of human low-level perception mechanisms in
electronic memristive neural circuits, the proposed method is adaptable to
diverse sensing technologies, helping intelligent machines to generate smart
high-level decisions in real world.

<p class="mathjax">Accelerated by the increasing attention drawn by 5G, 6G, and Internet of
Things applications, communication and sensing technologies have rapidly
evolved from millimeter-wave (mmWave) to terahertz (THz) in recent years.
Enabled by significant advancements in electromagnetic (EM) hardware, mmWave
and THz frequency regimes spanning 30 GHz to 300 GHz and 300 GHz to 3000 GHz,
respectively, can be employed for a host of applications. The main feature of
THz systems is high-bandwidth transmission, enabling ultra-high-resolution
imaging and high-throughput communications; however, challenges in both the
hardware and algorithmic arenas remain for the ubiquitous adoption of THz
technology. Spectra comprising mmWave and THz frequencies are well-suited for
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging at sub-millimeter resolutions for a wide
spectrum of tasks like material characterization and nondestructive testing
(NDT). This article provides a tutorial review of systems and algorithms for
THz SAR in the near-field with an emphasis on emerging algorithms that combine
signal processing and machine learning techniques. As part of this study, an
overview of classical and data-driven THz SAR algorithms is provided, focusing
on object detection for security applications and SAR image super-resolution.
We also discuss relevant issues, challenges, and future research directions for
emerging algorithms and THz SAR, including standardization of system and
algorithm benchmarking, adoption of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques,
signal processing-optimized machine learning, and hybrid data-driven signal
processing algorithms...

<p class="mathjax">Collecting audio-text pairs is expensive; however, it is much easier to
access text-only data. Unless using shallow fusion, end-to-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models require architecture modifications or additional
training schemes to use text-only data. Inspired by recent advances in
decoder-only language models (LMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM adopted for
speech-processing tasks, we propose using a decoder-only architecture for ASR
with simple text augmentation. To provide audio information, encoder features
compressed by CTC prediction are used as prompts for the decoder, which can be
regarded as refining CTC prediction using the decoder-only model. Because the
decoder architecture is the same as an autoregressive LM, it is simple to
enhance the model by leveraging external text data with LM training. An
experimental comparison using LibriSpeech and Switchboard shows that our
proposed models with text augmentation training reduced word error rates from
ordinary CTC by 0.3% and 1.4% on LibriSpeech test-clean and testother set,
respectively, and 2.9% and 5.0% on Switchboard and CallHome. The proposed model
had advantage on computational efficiency compared with conventional
encoder-decoder ASR models with a similar parameter setup, and outperformed
them on the LibriSpeech 100h and Switchboard training scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Shapley value is originally a concept in econometrics to fairly distribute
both gains and costs to players in a coalition game. In the recent decades, its
application has been extended to other areas such as marketing, engineering and
machine learning. For example, it produces reasonable solutions for problems in
sensitivity analysis, local model explanation towards the interpretable machine
learning, node importance in social network, attribution models, etc. However,
its heavy computational burden has been long recognized but rarely
investigated. Specifically, in a $d$-player coalition game, calculating a
Shapley value requires the evaluation of $d!$ or $2^d$ marginal contribution
values, depending on whether we are taking the permutation or combination
formulation of the Shapley value. Hence it becomes infeasible to calculate the
Shapley value when $d$ is reasonably large. A common remedy is to take a random
sample of the permutations to surrogate for the complete list of permutations.
We find an advanced sampling scheme can be designed to yield much more accurate
estimation of the Shapley value than the simple random sampling (SRS). Our
sampling scheme is based on combinatorial structures in the field of design of
experiments (DOE), particularly the order-of-addition experimental designs for
the study of how the orderings of components would affect the output. We show
that the obtained estimates are unbiased, and can sometimes deterministically
recover the original Shapley value. Both theoretical and simulations results
show that our DOE-based sampling scheme outperforms SRS in terms of estimation
accuracy. Surprisingly, it is also slightly faster than SRS. Lastly, real data
analysis is conducted for the C. elegans nervous system and the 9/11 terrorist
network.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) have stimulated exciting
developments in recent years. A PRSG, on a fixed initial (e.g., all-zero)
state, produces an output state that is computationally indistinguishable from
a Haar random state. However, pseudorandomness of the output state is not
guaranteed on other initial states. In fact, known PRSG constructions provably
fail on some initial state.
<br />In this work, we propose and construct quantum Pseudorandom State Scramblers
(PRSSs), which can produce a pseudorandom state on an arbitrary initial state.
In the information-theoretical setting, we obtain a scrambler which maps an
arbitrary initial state to a distribution of quantum states that is close to
Haar random in total variation distance. As a result, our PRSS exhibits a
dispersing property. Loosely, it can span an $\epsilon$-net of the state space.
This significantly strengthens what standard PRSGs can induce, as they may only
concentrate on a small region of the state space as long as the average output
state approximates a Haar random state in total variation distance.
<br />Our PRSS construction develops a parallel extension of the famous Kac's walk,
and we show that it mixes exponentially faster than the standard Kac's walk.
This constitutes the core of our proof. We also describe a few applications of
PRSSs. While our PRSS construction assumes a post-quantum one-way function,
PRSSs are potentially a weaker primitive and can be separated from one-way
functions in a relativized world similar to standard PRSGs.

<p class="mathjax">Enhancing speech signal quality in adverse acoustic environments is a
persistent challenge in speech processing. Existing deep learning based
enhancement methods often struggle to effectively remove background noise and
reverberation in real-world scenarios, hampering listening experiences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that uses pre-trained
generative methods to resynthesize clean, anechoic speech from degraded inputs.
This study leverages pre-trained vocoder or codec models to synthesize
high-quality speech while enhancing robustness in challenging scenarios.
Generative methods effectively handle information loss in speech signals,
resulting in regenerated speech that has improved fidelity and reduced
artifacts. By harnessing the capabilities of pre-trained models, we achieve
faithful reproduction of the original speech in adverse conditions.
Experimental evaluations on both simulated datasets and realistic samples
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods.
Especially by leveraging codec, we achieve superior subjective scores for both
simulated and realistic recordings. The generated speech exhibits enhanced
audio quality, reduced background noise, and reverberation. Our findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained generative techniques in speech
processing, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods falter. Demos
are available at https://whmrtm.github.io/SoundResynthesis.

contain which contests (card-style data, CSD) to ensure that each contest
receives adequate scrutiny, without examining more cards than necessary. RLAs
using CSD in this way can be substantially more efficient than RLAs that sample
indiscriminately from all cast cards. We describe an open-source Python

jurisdiction in the U.S., with over 1.8 million active voters. (Orange County
uses the Hart Verity system.) To audit the 181 contests in 2020 to a risk limit
of 5% without using CSD would have required a complete hand tally of all
3,094,308 cast ballot cards. With CSD, the estimated sample size is about
20,100 cards, 0.65% of the cards cast--including one tied contest that required
a complete hand count. To audit the 214 contests in 2022 to a risk limit of 5%

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field encompassing various
disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer engineering, and computer
science. Teaching quantum computing in a concise and effective manner can be
challenging, especially within the time constraints of a single course or a
short period, even for graduate students. This challenge is particularly
relevant in two-year MSc programs that include a thesis, which is a typical
structure in higher education systems in the USA and Europe. In this paper, the
author proposes an approach to teaching quantum computing and shares their
experience of conducting a course chapter on the subject within a two-week time
frame. The experience reported in this paper is integrated into the
"Technologies of Computing Systems" (TCS) course, with a total workload of 6
ECTS (in the context of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System,
one ECTS corresponds to 28 hours of work), conducted in one quarter, over seven
weeks. The structure of the course chapter is discussed, involving a series of
lectures that were accompanied by lab classes and a lab project, allowing
students to receive guidance while also engaging in hands-on learning and
independent study. The paper provides an overview of the quantum computing
topics covered, and their integration in the TSC course, and gives details
about how these topics are studied in the different types of classes. It also
discusses the evaluation procedure and presents the results obtained. It can be
concluded that the inclusion of the quantum computing component not only
significantly increased student interest in the course but also effectively
bridged the gap between classical and quantum computing for engineering
students within a short period of two weeks.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of sequential change detection, where the goal is to
design a scheme for detecting any changes in a parameter or functional $\theta$
of the data stream distribution that has small detection delay, but guarantees
control on the frequency of false alarms in the absence of changes. In this
paper, we describe a simple reduction from sequential change detection to
sequential estimation using confidence sequences: we begin a new
$(1-\alpha)$-confidence sequence at each time step, and proclaim a change when
the intersection of all active confidence sequences becomes empty. We prove
that the average run length is at least $1/\alpha$, resulting in a change
detection scheme with minimal structural assumptions~(thus allowing for
possibly dependent observations, and nonparametric distribution classes), but
strong guarantees. Our approach bears an interesting parallel with the
reduction from change detection to sequential testing of Lorden (1971) and the
e-detector of Shin et al. (2022).

<p class="mathjax">Consider the problem of estimating a random variable $X$ from noisy
observations $Y = X+ Z$, where $Z$ is standard normal, under the $L^1$ fidelity
criterion. It is well known that the optimal Bayesian estimator in this setting
is the conditional median. This work shows that the only prior distribution on
$X$ that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian.
<br />Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is
demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for
all $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we
consider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \in
[1,2]$, Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal
Bayesian estimator, and for $p \in (2,\infty)$, infinitely many prior
distributions on $X$ can induce linearity. Finally, extensions are provided to
encompass noise models leading to conditional distributions from certain
exponential families.

<p class="mathjax">Leachates from garbage dumps can significantly compromise their surrounding
area. Even if the distance between these and the populated areas could be
considerable, the risk of affecting the aquifers for public use is imminent in
most cases. For this reason, the delimitation and monitoring of the leachate
plume are of significant importance. Geoelectric data (resistivity and IP), and
surface methane measurements, are integrated and classified using an
unsupervised Neural Network to identify possible risk zones in areas
surrounding a landfill. The Neural Network used is a Kohonen type, which
generates; as a result, Self-Organizing Classification Maps or SOM
(Self-Organizing Map). Two graphic outputs were obtained from the training
performed in which groups of neurons that presented a similar behaviour were
selected. Contour maps corresponding to the location of these groups and the
individual variables were generated to compare the classification obtained and
the different anomalies associated with each of these variables. Two of the
groups resulting from the classification are related to typical values of
liquids percolated in the landfill for the parameters evaluated individually.
In this way, a precise delimitation of the affected areas in the studied
landfill was obtained, integrating the input variables via SOMs. The location
of the study area is not detailed for confidentiality reasons.

<p class="mathjax">The Riemann hypothesis (RH) is a long-standing open problem in mathematics.
It conjectures that non-trivial zeros of the zeta function all have real part
equal to 1/2. The extent of the consequences of RH is far-reaching and touches
a wide spectrum of topics including the distribution of prime numbers, the
growth of arithmetic functions, the growth of Euler totient, etc. In this note,
we revisit and extend an old analytic criterion of the RH known as the
Nyman-Beurling criterion which connects the RH to a minimization problem that

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel neural speaker diarization system using memory-aware
multi-speaker embedding with sequence-to-sequence architecture (NSD-MS2S),
which integrates the strengths of memory-aware multi-speaker embedding (MA-MSE)
and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, leading to improvement in both
efficiency and performance. Next, we further decrease the memory occupation of
decoding by incorporating input features fusion and then employ a multi-head
attention mechanism to capture features at different levels. NSD-MS2S achieved
a macro diarization error rate (DER) of 15.9% on the CHiME-7 EVAL set, which
signifies a relative improvement of 49% over the official baseline system, and
is the key technique for us to achieve the best performance for the main track
of CHiME-7 DASR Challenge. Additionally, we introduce a deep interactive module
(DIM) in MA-MSE module to better retrieve a cleaner and more discriminative
multi-speaker embedding, enabling the current model to outperform the system we
used in the CHiME-7 DASR Challenge. Our code will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Image denoising, one of the essential inverse problems, targets to remove
noise/artifacts from input images. In general, digital image denoising
algorithms, executed on computers, present latency due to several iterations
implemented in, e.g., graphics processing units (GPUs). While deep
learning-enabled methods can operate non-iteratively, they also introduce
latency and impose a significant computational burden, leading to increased
power consumption. Here, we introduce an analog diffractive image denoiser to
all-optically and non-iteratively clean various forms of noise and artifacts
from input images - implemented at the speed of light propagation within a thin
diffractive visual processor. This all-optical image denoiser comprises passive
transmissive layers optimized using deep learning to physically scatter the
optical modes that represent various noise features, causing them to miss the
output image Field-of-View (FoV) while retaining the object features of
interest. Our results show that these diffractive denoisers can efficiently
remove salt and pepper noise and image rendering-related spatial artifacts from
input phase or intensity images while achieving an output power efficiency of
~30-40%. We experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of this analog
denoiser architecture using a 3D-printed diffractive visual processor operating
at the terahertz spectrum. Owing to their speed, power-efficiency, and minimal
computational overhead, all-optical diffractive denoisers can be transformative
for various image display and projection systems, including, e.g., holographic
displays.

<p class="mathjax">The performance of deep learning models depends significantly on their
capacity to encode input features efficiently and decode them into meaningful
outputs. Better input and output representation has the potential to boost
models' performance and generalization. In the context of
acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion (SI) systems, we study the impact of
utilizing speech representations acquired via self-supervised learning (SSL)
models, such as HuBERT compared to conventional acoustic features.
Additionally, we investigate the incorporation of novel tract variables (TVs)
through an improved geometric transformation model. By combining these two
approaches, we improve the Pearson product-moment correlation (PPMC) scores
which evaluate the accuracy of TV estimation of the SI system from 0.7452 to
0.8141, a 6.9% increase. Our findings underscore the profound influence of rich
feature representations from SSL models and improved geometric transformations
with target TVs on the enhanced functionality of SI systems.

<p class="mathjax">The complete learning of an $n$-qubit quantum state requires samples
exponentially in $n$. Several works consider subclasses of quantum states that
can be learned in polynomial sample complexity such as stabilizer states or
high-temperature Gibbs states. Other works consider a weaker sense of learning,
such as PAC learning and shadow tomography. In this work, we consider learning
states that are close to neural network quantum states, which can efficiently
be represented by a graphical model called restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBMs). To this end, we exhibit robustness results for efficient provable
two-hop neighborhood learning algorithms for ferromagnetic and locally
consistent RBMs. We consider the $L_p$-norm as a measure of closeness,
including both total variation distance and max-norm distance in the limit. Our
results allow certain quantum states to be learned with a sample complexity
\textit{exponentially} better than naive tomography. We hence provide new
classes of efficiently learnable quantum states and apply new strategies to
learn them.

neural networks, focusing on the paradigmatic example of the perceptron
architecture with binary an continuous weights, in the classification setting.
I will review the Gardner's approach based on replica method and the derivation
of the SAT/UNSAT transition in the storage setting. Then, I discuss some recent
works that unveiled how the zero training error configurations are
geometrically arranged, and how this arrangement changes as the size of the
training set increases. I also illustrate how different regions of solution
space can be explored analytically and how the landscape in the vicinity of a
solution can be characterized. I give evidence how, in binary weight models,
algorithmic hardness is a consequence of the disappearance of a clustered
region of solutions that extends to very large distances. Finally, I
demonstrate how the study of linear mode connectivity between solutions can
give insights into the average shape of the solution manifold.

<p class="mathjax">Style voice conversion aims to transform the style of source speech to a
desired style according to real-world application demands. However, the current
style voice conversion approach relies on pre-defined labels or reference
speech to control the conversion process, which leads to limitations in style
diversity or falls short in terms of the intuitive and interpretability of
style representation. In this study, we propose PromptVC, a novel style voice
conversion approach that employs a latent diffusion model to generate a style
vector driven by natural language prompts. Specifically, the style vector is
extracted by a style encoder during training, and then the latent diffusion
model is trained independently to sample the style vector from noise, with this
process being conditioned on natural language prompts. To improve style
expressiveness, we leverage HuBERT to extract discrete tokens and replace them
with the K-Means center embedding to serve as the linguistic content, which
minimizes residual style information. Additionally, we deduplicate the same
discrete token and employ a differentiable duration predictor to re-predict the
duration of each token, which can adapt the duration of the same linguistic
content to different styles. The subjective and objective evaluation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.

defined by discrete-time control barrier function (DTCBF) certificates,
guarantee recursive feasibility in nonlinear MPC. Further, we introduce the
notion of quasi-DTCBF (qDTCBF) certificates. Compared to DTCBFs, qDTCBF
conditions can be satisfied with tighter control input bounds, which is highly
advantageous if only limited actuation is possible. Both certificates encourage
an earlier reaction of the control system and result in a lower cumulative MPC
cost. The methodology is applied to a lane merging problem in automated
driving, in which DTCBF and qDTCBF certificates subject to input constraints
form the terminal ingredients to guarantee recursive feasibility of the
nonlinear MPC scheme. A simulation study demonstrates the efficacy of the
concept.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explore a continuous modeling approach for
deep-learning-based speech enhancement, focusing on the denoising process. We
use a state variable to indicate the denoising process. The starting state is
noisy speech and the ending state is clean speech. The noise component in the
state variable decreases with the change of the state index until the noise
component is 0. During training, a UNet-like neural network learns to estimate
every state variable sampled from the continuous denoising process. In testing,
we introduce a controlling factor as an embedding, ranging from zero to one, to
the neural network, allowing us to control the level of noise reduction. This
approach enables controllable speech enhancement and is adaptable to various
application scenarios. Experimental results indicate that preserving a small
amount of noise in the clean target benefits speech enhancement, as evidenced
by improvements in both objective speech measures and automatic speech
recognition performance.

<p class="mathjax">The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral
chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider.
In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field
and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach
with $N_f=1+1$ dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the
imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate
chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.
However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at
specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. In addition
to this, we find that the behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not

<p class="mathjax">We consider a random geometric hypergraph model based on an underlying
bipartite graph. Nodes and hyperedges are sampled uniformly in a domain, and a
node is assigned to those hyperedges that lie with a certain radius. From a
modelling perspective, we explain how the model captures higher order
connections that arise in real data sets. Our main contribution is to study the
connectivity properties of the model. In an asymptotic limit where the number
of nodes and hyperedges grow in tandem we give a condition on the radius that

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in space telescopes have opened new avenues for gathering vast
amounts of data on exoplanet atmosphere spectra. However, accurately extracting
chemical and physical properties from these spectra poses significant
challenges due to the non-linear nature of the underlying physics.
<br />This paper presents novel machine learning models developed by the AstroAI
team for the Ariel Data Challenge 2023, where one of the models secured the top
position among 293 competitors. Leveraging Normalizing Flows, our models
predict the posterior probability distribution of atmospheric parameters under
different atmospheric assumptions.
<br />Moreover, we introduce an alternative model that exhibits higher performance
potential than the winning model, despite scoring lower in the challenge. These
findings highlight the need to reevaluate the evaluation metric and prompt
further exploration of more efficient and accurate approaches for exoplanet
atmosphere spectra analysis.
<br />Finally, we present recommendations to enhance the challenge and models,
providing valuable insights for future applications on real observational data.
These advancements pave the way for more effective and timely analysis of
exoplanet atmospheric properties, advancing our understanding of these distant
worlds.

<p class="mathjax">The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in computational
chemistry has led to significant advances in predicting molecular properties,
accelerating drug discovery, and material design. ML models can extract hidden
patterns and relationships from complex and large datasets, allowing for the
prediction of various chemical properties with high accuracy. The use of such
methods has enabled the discovery of molecules and materials that were
previously difficult to identify. This paper introduces a new ML model based on
deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder and decoder
architecture, for classification tasks. We demonstrate the opportunities
offered by our approach by applying it to various types of input data,
including organic and inorganic compounds. In particular, we developed and
tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include
crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds,
shedding light on the underlying patterns in molecular data. The models used in
this work exhibit a high degree of predictive power, underscoring the progress
that can be made with refined machine learning when applied to molecular and
material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average
accuracy of 96%, surpassing the previous best result by 10%. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/dmamur/elembert.

<p class="mathjax">Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for planning and
controlling dynamical systems due to its capacity for handling constraints and
taking advantage of preview information. Nevertheless, MPC performance is
highly dependent on the choice of cost function tuning parameters. In this
work, we demonstrate an approach for online automatic tuning of an MPC
controller with an example application to an ecological cruise control system
that saves fuel by using a preview of road grade. We solve the global fuel
consumption minimization problem offline using dynamic programming and find the
corresponding MPC cost function by solving the inverse optimization problem. A
neural network fitted to these offline results is used to generate the desired
MPC cost function weight during online operation. The effectiveness of the
proposed approach is verified in simulation for different road geometries.

<p class="mathjax">Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication paradigm that
uses molecules as information carriers, requiring unconventional transceivers
and modulation/detection techniques. Practical MC receivers (MC-Rxs) can be
implemented using field-effect transistor biosensor (bioFET) architectures,
where surface receptors reversibly react with ligands. The time-varying
concentration of ligand-bound receptors is translated into electrical signals
via field effect, which is used to decode the transmitted information. However,
ligand-receptor interactions do not provide an ideal molecular selectivity, as
similar ligand types, i.e., interferers, co-existing in the MC channel, can
interact with the same type of receptors. Overcoming this molecular cross-talk
in the time domain can be challenging, especially when Rx has no knowledge of
the interferer statistics or operates near saturation. Therefore, we propose a
frequency-domain detection (FDD) technique for bioFET-based MC-Rxs that
exploits the difference in binding reaction rates of different ligand types
reflected in the power spectrum of the ligand-receptor binding noise. We derive
the bit error probability (BEP) of the FDD technique and demonstrate its
effectiveness in decoding transmitted concentration signals under stochastic
molecular interference compared to a widely used time-domain detection (TDD)
technique. We then verified the analytical performance bounds of the FDD
through a particle-based spatial stochastic simulator simulating reactions on
the MC-Rx in microfluidic channels.

<p class="mathjax">Two-dimensional single-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT) provides a
detailed tissue map with high resolution allowing quantitative characterization
of relationships between health conditions and aging. However, longitudinal
analysis of body composition changes using these scans is difficult due to
positional variation between slices acquired in different years, which leading
to different organs/tissues captured. To address this issue, we propose
C-SliceGen, which takes an arbitrary axial slice in the abdominal region as a
condition and generates a pre-defined vertebral level slice by estimating
structural changes in the latent space. Our experiments on 2608 volumetric CT
data from two in-house datasets and 50 subjects from the 2015 Multi-Atlas
Abdomen Labeling Challenge dataset (BTCV) Challenge demonstrate that our model
can generate high-quality images that are realistic and similar. We further
evaluate our method's capability to harmonize longitudinal positional variation
on 1033 subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset,
which contains longitudinal single abdominal slices, and confirmed that our
method can harmonize the slice positional variance in terms of visceral fat
area. This approach provides a promising direction for mapping slices from
different vertebral levels to a target slice and reducing positional variance
for single-slice longitudinal analysis. The source code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Segmentation of the bronchovascular bundle within the lung parenchyma is a
key step for the proper analysis and planning of many pulmonary diseases. It
might also be considered the preprocessing step when the goal is to segment the
nodules from the lung parenchyma. We propose a segmentation pipeline for the
bronchovascular bundle based on the Computed Tomography images, returning
either binary or labelled masks of vessels and bronchi situated in the lung
parenchyma. The method consists of two modules, modeling of the bronchial tree
and vessels. The core revolves around a similar pipeline, the determination of
the initial perimeter by the GMM method, skeletonization, and hierarchical
analysis of the created graph. We tested our method on both low-dose CT and
standard-dose CT, with various pathologies, reconstructed with various slice
thicknesses, and acquired from various machines. We conclude that the method is
invariant with respect to the origin and parameters of the CT series. Our
pipeline is best suited for studies with healthy patients, patients with lung
nodules, and patients with emphysema.

following a time-varying distribution via the lens of online optimization.
Assuming that the loss function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition,
we apply online stochastic gradient descent and establish its dynamic regret
bound that is composed of cumulative distribution drifts and cumulative
gradient biases caused by stochasticity. The distribution metric we adopt here
is Wasserstein distance, which is well-defined without the absolute continuity
assumption or with a time-varying support set. We also establish a regret bound
of online stochastic proximal gradient descent when the objective function is
regularized. Moreover, we show that the above framework can be applied to the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) learning problem. Particularly, we improve an
existing proof on the discovery of the PL condition of the CVaR problem,
resulting in a regret bound of online stochastic gradient descent.

<p class="mathjax">Demosaicing and denoising of RAW images are crucial steps in the processing
pipeline of modern digital cameras. As only a third of the color information
required to produce a digital image is captured by the camera sensor, the
process of demosaicing is inherently ill-posed. The presence of noise further
exacerbates this problem. Performing these two steps sequentially may distort
the content of the captured RAW images and accumulate errors from one step to
another. Recent deep neural-network-based approaches have shown the
effectiveness of joint demosaicing and denoising to mitigate such challenges.
However, these methods typically require a large number of training samples and
do not generalize well to different types and intensities of noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint demosaicing and denoising method, dubbed
JDD-DoubleDIP, which operates directly on a single RAW image without requiring
any training data. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two popular
datasets -- Kodak and McMaster -- with various noises and noise intensities.
The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms other
compared methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and qualitative visual perception.

distance as to build a descriptor of sample complexity in classification
problems. The idea is to use the fact that the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance
is a metric in the space of measures that also takes into account the geometry
and topology of the underlying metric space. We associate to each class of
points a measure and thus study the geometrical information that we can obtain
from the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between those measures. We show that a
large Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between those measures allows to conclude
that there exists a 1-Lipschitz classifier that classifies well the classes of

<p class="mathjax">Multilingual intelligent assistants, such as ChatGPT, have recently gained
popularity. To further expand the applications of multilingual artificial
intelligence assistants and facilitate international communication, it is
essential to enhance the performance of multilingual speech recognition, which
is a crucial component of speech interaction. In this paper, we propose two
simple and parameter-efficient methods: language prompt tuning and frame-level
language adapter, to respectively enhance language-configurable and
language-agnostic multilingual speech recognition. Additionally, we explore the
feasibility of integrating these two approaches using parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance
improvements across seven languages using our proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive imaging
technique that can reveal high-resolution retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose an accurate and efficient neural network for retinal vessel
segmentation in OCTA images. The proposed network achieves accuracy comparable
to other SOTA methods, while having fewer parameters and faster inference speed
(e.g. 110x lighter and 1.3x faster than U-Net), which is very friendly for
industrial applications. This is achieved by applying the modified Recurrent
ConvNeXt Block to a full resolution convolutional network. In addition, we
create a new dataset containing 918 OCTA images and their corresponding vessel
annotations. The data set is semi-automatically annotated with the help of
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which greatly improves the annotation speed. For
the benefit of the community, our code and dataset can be obtained from

<p class="mathjax">Supervised deep learning offers great promise to automate analysis of medical
images from segmentation to diagnosis. However, their performance highly relies
on the quality and quantity of the data annotation. Meanwhile, curating large
annotated datasets for medical images requires a high level of expertise, which
is time-consuming and expensive. Recently, to quench the thirst for large data
sets with high-quality annotation, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods using
unlabeled domain-specific data, have attracted attention. Therefore, designing
an SSL method that relies on minimal quantities of labeled data has
far-reaching significance in medical images. This paper investigates the
feasibility of deploying the Masked Autoencoder for SSL (SSL-MAE) of TransUNet,
for segmenting bony regions from children's wrist ultrasound scans. We found
that changing the embedding and loss function in SSL-MAE can produce better
downstream results compared to the original SSL-MAE. In addition, we determined
that only pretraining TransUNet embedding and encoder with SSL-MAE does not
work as well as TransUNet without SSL-MAE pretraining on downstream
segmentation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in speech synthesis have leveraged GAN-based networks
like HiFi-GAN and BigVGAN to produce high-fidelity waveforms from
mel-spectrograms. However, these networks are computationally expensive and
parameter-heavy. iSTFTNet addresses these limitations by integrating inverse
short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) into the network, achieving both speed and
parameter efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an extension to iSTFTNet,
termed HiFTNet, which incorporates a harmonic-plus-noise source filter in the
time-frequency domain that uses a sinusoidal source from the fundamental
frequency (F0) inferred via a pre-trained F0 estimation network for fast
inference speed. Subjective evaluations on LJSpeech show that our model
significantly outperforms both iSTFTNet and HiFi-GAN, achieving
ground-truth-level performance. HiFTNet also outperforms BigVGAN-base on
LibriTTS for unseen speakers and achieves comparable performance to BigVGAN
while being four times faster with only $1/6$ of the parameters. Our work sets
a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality neural vocoding, paving the way for
real-time applications that demand high quality speech synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">State estimation of dynamical systems from noisy observations is a
fundamental task in many applications. It is commonly addressed using the
linear Kalman filter (KF), whose performance can significantly degrade in the
presence of outliers in the observations, due to the sensitivity of its convex
quadratic objective function. To mitigate such behavior, outlier detection
algorithms can be applied. In this work, we propose a parameter-free algorithm
which mitigates the harmful effect of outliers while requiring only a short
iterative process of the standard update step of the KF. To that end, we model
each potential outlier as a normal process with unknown variance and apply
online estimation through either expectation maximization or alternating
maximization algorithms. Simulations and field experiment evaluations
demonstrate competitive performance of our method, showcasing its robustness to
outliers in filtering scenarios compared to alternative algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Text language models have shown remarkable zero-shot capability in
generalizing to unseen tasks when provided with well-formulated instructions.
However, existing studies in speech processing primarily focus on limited or
specific tasks. Moreover, the lack of standardized benchmarks hinders a fair
comparison across different approaches. Thus, we present Dynamic-SUPERB, a
benchmark designed for building universal speech models capable of leveraging
instruction tuning to perform multiple tasks in a zero-shot fashion. To achieve
comprehensive coverage of diverse speech tasks and harness instruction tuning,
we invite the community to collaborate and contribute, facilitating the dynamic
growth of the benchmark. To initiate, Dynamic-SUPERB features 55 evaluation
instances by combining 33 tasks and 22 datasets. This spans a broad spectrum of
dimensions, providing a comprehensive platform for evaluation. Additionally, we
propose several approaches to establish benchmark baselines. These include the
utilization of speech models, text language models, and the multimodal encoder.
Evaluation results indicate that while these baselines perform reasonably on
seen tasks, they struggle with unseen ones. We also conducted an ablation study
to assess the robustness and seek improvements in the performance. We release
all materials to the public and welcome researchers to collaborate on the
project, advancing technologies in the field together.

propose a new hybrid classical-quantum method based on quantum Wasserstein GANs
that overcomes this limitation. It allows to learn the function governing the

<p class="mathjax">The possibility of dynamically modifying the computational load of neural
models at inference time is crucial for on-device processing, where
computational power is limited and time-varying. Established approaches for
neural model compression exist, but they provide architecturally static models.
In this paper, we investigate the use of early-exit architectures, that rely on
intermediate exit branches, applied to large-vocabulary speech recognition.
This allows for the development of dynamic models that adjust their
computational cost to the available resources and recognition performance.
Unlike previous works, besides using pre-trained backbones we also train the
model from scratch with an early-exit architecture. Experiments on public
datasets show that early-exit architectures from scratch not only preserve
performance levels when using fewer encoder layers, but also improve task
accuracy as compared to using single-exit models or using pre-trained models.
Additionally, we investigate an exit selection strategy based on posterior
probabilities as an alternative to frame-based entropy.

<p class="mathjax">Automated assessment of speech intelligibility in hearing aid (HA) devices is
of great importance. Our previous work introduced a non-intrusive
multi-branched speech intelligibility prediction model called MBI-Net, which
achieved top performance in the Clarity Prediction Challenge 2022. Based on the
promising results of the MBI-Net model, we aim to further enhance its
performance by leveraging Whisper embeddings to enrich acoustic features. In
this study, we propose two improved models, namely MBI-Net+ and MBI-Net++.
MBI-Net+ maintains the same model architecture as MBI-Net, but replaces
self-supervised learning (SSL) speech embeddings with Whisper embeddings to
deploy cross-domain features. On the other hand, MBI-Net++ further employs a
more elaborate design, incorporating an auxiliary task to predict frame-level
and utterance-level scores of the objective speech intelligibility metric HASPI
(Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index) and multi-task learning. Experimental
results confirm that both MBI-Net++ and MBI-Net+ achieve better prediction
performance than MBI-Net in terms of multiple metrics, and MBI-Net++ is better
than MBI-Net+.

<p class="mathjax">Majority voting is a simple mathematical function that returns the value that
appears most often in a set. As a popular decision fusion technique, the
majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where
a number of independent voters report their opinions on a classification
problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble
learning, data crowd-sourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for
blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multi-class classification
problem has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive a new upper bound on the
accuracy of the MVF for the multi-class classification problem. More
specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF
exponentially decays toward zero as the number of independent voters increases.
Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of
independent voters if these conditions are not met.
<br />We first explore the problem for independent and identically distributed
voters where we assume that every voter follows the same conditional
probability distribution of voting for different classes, given the true
classification of the data point. Next, we extend our results for the case
where the voters are independent but non-identically distributed. Using the
derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth
discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery
algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate
only when the MVF achieves a small error rate, and vice versa, achieve a large
error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. In the worst-case
scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may achieve a higher error rate than
the MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical
simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) is a cutting-edge
technology that promises to revolutionize wireless networks by providing an
unprecedentedly high spectral and energy efficiency. The enlarged array
aperture of UM-MIMO facilitates the accessibility of the near-field region,
thereby offering a novel degree of freedom for communications and sensing.
Nevertheless, the transceiver design for such systems is challenging because of
the enormous system scale, the complicated channel characteristics, and the
uncertainties in propagation environments. Therefore, it is critical to study
scalable, low-complexity, and robust algorithms that can efficiently
characterize and leverage the properties of the near-field channel. In this
article, we will advocate two general frameworks from an artificial
intelligence (AI)-native perspective, which are tailored for the algorithmic
design of near-field UM-MIMO transceivers. Specifically, the frameworks for
both iterative and non-iterative algorithms are discussed. Near-field beam
focusing and channel estimation are presented as two tutorial-style examples to
demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed AI-native frameworks in
terms of various key performance indicators.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a method that allows to further improve speech
enhancement obtained with recently introduced Deep Neural Network (DNN) models.
We propose a multi-channel refinement method of time-frequency masks obtained
with single-channel DNNs, which consists of an iterative Complex Gaussian
Mixture Model (CGMM) based algorithm, followed by optimum spatial filtration.
We validate our approach on time-frequency masks estimated with three recent
deep learning models, namely DCUnet, DCCRN, and FullSubNet. We show that our
method with the proposed mask refinement procedure allows to improve the
accuracy of estimated masks, in terms of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
measure, and as a consequence the overall speech quality of the enhanced speech
signal, as measured by PESQ improvement, and that the improvement is consistent
across all three DNN models.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have shown promising results in speech enhancement, using a
task-adapted diffusion process for the conditional generation of clean speech
given a noisy mixture. However, at test time, the neural network used for score
estimation is called multiple times to solve the iterative reverse process.
This results in a slow inference process and causes discretization errors that
accumulate over the sampling trajectory. In this paper, we address these
limitations through a two-stage training approach. In the first stage, we train
the diffusion model the usual way using the generative denoising score matching
loss. In the second stage, we compute the enhanced signal by solving the
reverse process and compare the resulting estimate to the clean speech target
using a predictive loss. We show that using this second training stage enables
achieving the same performance as the baseline model using only 5 function
evaluations instead of 60 function evaluations. While the performance of usual
generative diffusion algorithms drops dramatically when lowering the number of
function evaluations (NFEs) to obtain single-step diffusion, we show that our
proposed method keeps a steady performance and therefore largely outperforms
the diffusion baseline in this setting and also generalizes better than its
predictive counterpart.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have witnessed the huge success of deep neural networks (DNNs)
in various tasks of computer vision and text processing. Interestingly, these
DNNs with massive number of parameters share similar structural properties on
their feature representation and last-layer classifier at terminal phase of
training (TPT). Specifically, if the training data are balanced (each class
shares the same number of samples), it is observed that the feature vectors of
samples from the same class converge to their corresponding in-class mean
features and their pairwise angles are the same. This fascinating phenomenon is
known as Neural Collapse (N C), first termed by Papyan, Han, and Donoho in
2019. Many recent works manage to theoretically explain this phenomenon by
adopting so-called unconstrained feature model (UFM). In this paper, we study
the extension of N C phenomenon to the imbalanced data under cross-entropy loss
function in the context of unconstrained feature model. Our contribution is
multi-fold compared with the state-of-the-art results: (a) we show that the
feature vectors exhibit collapse phenomenon, i.e., the features within the same
class collapse to the same mean vector; (b) the mean feature vectors no longer
form an equiangular tight frame. Instead, their pairwise angles depend on the
sample size; (c) we also precisely characterize the sharp threshold on which
the minority collapse (the feature vectors of the minority groups collapse to
one single vector) will take place; (d) finally, we argue that the effect of
the imbalance in datasize diminishes as the sample size grows. Our results
provide a complete picture of the N C under the cross-entropy loss for the
imbalanced data. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Deep kernel machines (DKMs) are a recently introduced kernel method with the
flexibility of other deep models including deep NNs and deep Gaussian
processes. DKMs work purely with kernels, never with features, and are
therefore different from other methods ranging from NNs to deep kernel learning
and even deep Gaussian processes, which all use features as a fundamental
component. Here, we introduce convolutional DKMs, along with an efficient
inter-domain inducing point approximation scheme. Further, we develop and
experimentally assess a number of model variants, including 9 different types
of normalisation designed for the convolutional DKMs, two likelihoods, and two
different types of top-layer. The resulting models achieve around 99% test
accuracy on MNIST, 92% on CIFAR-10 and 71% on CIFAR-100, despite training in
only around 28 GPU hours, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than full NNGP / NTK /
Myrtle kernels, whilst achieving comparable performance.

<p class="mathjax">In the industrial technology domain, mathematical optimization is crucial
with its applications seen in areas like transportation engineering, robotics,
and machine learning. With the growth in data volume, there's an increased
demand for solutions to large-scale challenges, leading to the rise of
distributed optimization. This approach involves decentralized devices working
collectively to achieve system objectives. The focus of the study is on
distributed consensus optimization concerning convex set constraints in
networks. The paper introduces the self-adaptive Projection-based
Prediction-Correction Method (PPCM), inspired by the proximal method and
integrated with variational inequality. PPCM stands out as a contractive method
characterized by impressive convergence properties. Its decentralized nature
also fits networked settings aptly. Also the parameter selection is simple and
clear, without the hassle of parameter tuning. A thorough theoretical
evaluation confirms PPCM's effectiveness. Upon applying the method to
distributed linear least squares problems, it manifested a performance
superiority, registering an enhancement exceeding 55% compared to Python's
built-in functions. Overall, the research provides a robust distributed
optimization technique with significant theoretical and practical benefits.

<p class="mathjax">We present RECAP (REtrieval-Augmented Audio CAPtioning), a novel and
effective audio captioning system that generates captions conditioned on an
input audio and other captions similar to the audio retrieved from a datastore.
Additionally, our proposed method can transfer to any domain without the need
for any additional fine-tuning. To generate a caption for an audio sample, we
leverage an audio-text model CLAP to retrieve captions similar to it from a
replaceable datastore, which are then used to construct a prompt. Next, we feed
this prompt to a GPT-2 decoder and introduce cross-attention layers between the
CLAP encoder and GPT-2 to condition the audio for caption generation.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Clotho and AudioCaps, show that RECAP
achieves competitive performance in in-domain settings and significant
improvements in out-of-domain settings. Additionally, due to its capability to
exploit a large text-captions-only datastore in a \textit{training-free}
fashion, RECAP shows unique capabilities of captioning novel audio events never
seen during training and compositional audios with multiple events. To promote
research in this space, we also release 150,000+ new weakly labeled captions
for AudioSet, AudioCaps, and Clotho.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization aims to train models on multiple source domains so that
they can generalize well to unseen target domains. Among many domain
generalization methods, Fourier-transform-based domain generalization methods
have gained popularity primarily because they exploit the power of Fourier
transformation to capture essential patterns and regularities in the data,
making the model more robust to domain shifts. The mainstream
Fourier-transform-based domain generalization swaps the Fourier amplitude
spectrum while preserving the phase spectrum between the source and the target
images. However, it neglects background interference in the amplitude spectrum.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a soft-thresholding function in the
Fourier domain. We apply this newly designed algorithm to retinal fundus image
segmentation, which is important for diagnosing ocular diseases but the neural
network's performance can degrade across different sources due to domain
shifts. The proposed technique basically enhances fundus image augmentation by
eliminating small values in the Fourier domain and providing better
generalization. The innovative nature of the soft thresholding fused with
Fourier-transform-based domain generalization improves neural network models'
performance by reducing the target images' background interference
significantly. Experiments on public data validate our approach's effectiveness
over conventional and state-of-the-art methods with superior segmentation
metrics.

shallow water simulations has led to the question of whether they can be
beneficial in a 3D atmospheric model. In this paper, we take the first step
forward by evaluating the behavior of exponential time-integration methods in
the Navy's compressible deep-atmosphere nonhydrostatic global model
(NEPTUNE-Navy Environmental Prediction sysTem Utilizing a Nonhydrostatic
Engine). Simulations are conducted on a set of idealized test cases designed to
assess key features of a nonhydrostatic model and demonstrate that exponential
integrators capture the desired large and small-scale traits, yielding results
comparable to those found in the literature. We propose a new upper boundary
absorbing layer independent of reference state and shown to be effective in
both idealized and real-data simulations. A real-data forecast using an
exponential method with full physics is presented, providing a positive outlook
for using exponential integrators for NWP.

<p class="mathjax">Stacking regressions is an ensemble technique that forms linear combinations
of different regression estimators to enhance predictive accuracy. The
conventional approach uses cross-validation data to generate predictions from
the constituent estimators, and least-squares with nonnegativity constraints to
learn the combination weights. In this paper, we learn these weights
analogously by minimizing an estimate of the population risk subject to a
nonnegativity constraint. When the constituent estimators are linear
least-squares projections onto nested subspaces separated by at least three
dimensions, we show that thanks to a shrinkage effect, the resulting stacked
estimator has strictly smaller population risk than best single estimator among
them. Here ``best'' refers to a model that minimizes a selection criterion such
as AIC or BIC. In other words, in this setting, the best single estimator is
inadmissible. Because the optimization problem can be reformulated as isotonic
regression, the stacked estimator requires the same order of computation as the
best single estimator, making it an attractive alternative in terms of both
performance and implementation.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we investigate and fabricate a superdirective antenna array
composed of strip dipole elements operating at a frequency of 3.5 GHz. The
spacing, dimensions, and phase difference of the elements are optimized to
achieve a super realized gain antenna with a theoretical efficiency of 98.8%
and computed efficiency of 99.3%. By employing an element spacing of
0.2$\lambda$, the end-fire antenna array demonstrates a maximum theoretical

Significantly, our proposed superdirective antenna array distinguishes itself
from existing approaches by achieving high directivity, high radiation
efficiency, and impedance matching to 50 $\Omega$ solely through careful
adjustments in the strip dimensions and the inter-element phase. This
eliminates the need for additional impedance matching networks, amplifiers, or

<p class="mathjax">In a lumped hydrological model structure, the hydrological function of a
catchment is characterized by only a few parameters. Given a set of parameter
values, a numerical function useful for hydrological prediction is generated.
Thus, this study assumes that the hydrological function of a catchment can be
sufficiently well characterized by a small number of latent variables. By
specifying the variable values, a numerical function resembling the
hydrological function of a real-world catchment can be generated using a
generative model. In this study, a deep learning method is used to learn both
the generative model and the latent variable values of different catchments
directly from their climate forcing and runoff data, without using catchment
attributes. The generative models can be used similarly to a lumped model
structure, i.e., by estimating the optimal parameter or latent variable values
using a generic model calibration algorithm, an optimal numerical model can be
derived. In this study, generative models using eight latent variables were
learned from data from over 3,000 catchments worldwide, and the learned
generative models were applied to model over 700 different catchments using a
generic calibration algorithm. The quality of the resulting optimal models was
generally comparable to or better than that obtained using 36 different types
of lump model structures or using non-generative deep learning methods. In
summary, this study presents a data-driven approach for representing the
hydrological function of a catchment in low-dimensional space and a method for
reconstructing specific hydrological functions from the representations.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised visual clustering has recently received considerable attention.
It aims to explain distributions of unlabeled visual images by clustering them
via a parameterized appearance model. From a different perspective, the
clustering algorithms can be treated as assignment problems, often NP-hard.
They can be solved precisely for small instances on current hardware. Adiabatic
quantum computing (AQC) offers a solution, as it can soon provide a
considerable speedup on a range of NP-hard optimization problems. However,
current clustering formulations are unsuitable for quantum computing due to
their scaling properties. Consequently, in this work, we propose the first
clustering formulation designed to be solved with AQC. We employ an Ising model
representing the quantum mechanical system implemented on the AQC. Our approach
is competitive compared to state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches, even
using of-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Finally, we demonstrate that
our clustering problem is already solvable on the current generation of real
quantum computers for small examples and analyze the properties of the measured
solutions.

<p class="mathjax">The Ising $p$-spin glass and the random $k$-SAT models exhibit symmetric
multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP), an intricate geometrical property which
is a rigorous barrier against many important classes of algorithms. We
establish that for both models, the symmetric $m$-OGP undergoes a sharp phase
transition and we identify the phase transition point for each model: for any
$m\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $\gamma_m$ (depending on the model) such that
the model exhibits $m$-OGP for $\gamma&gt;\gamma_m$ and the $m$-OGP is provably
absent for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_m$, both with high probability, where $\gamma$ is
some natural parameter of the model. Our results for the Ising $p$-spin glass
model are valid for all large enough $p$ that remain constant as the number $n$
of spins grows, $p=O(1)$; our results for the random $k$-SAT are valid for all
$k$ that grow mildly in the number $n$ of Boolean variables, $k=\Omega(\ln n)$.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sharp phase transition
results regarding the $m$-OGP. Our proofs are based on an application of the
second moment method combined with a concentration property regarding a
suitable random variable. While a standard application of the second moment
method fails, we circumvent this issue by leveraging an elegant argument of
Frieze~\cite{frieze1990independence} together with concentration.

<p class="mathjax">By sampling from the latent space of an autoencoder and decoding the latent
space samples to the original data space, any autoencoder can simply be turned
into a generative model. For this to work, it is necessary to model the
autoencoder's latent space with a distribution from which samples can be
obtained. Several simple possibilities (kernel density estimates, Gaussian
distribution) and more sophisticated ones (Gaussian mixture models, copula
models, normalization flows) can be thought of and have been tried recently.
This study aims to discuss, assess, and compare various techniques that can be
used to capture the latent space so that an autoencoder can become a generative
model while striving for simplicity. Among them, a new copula-based method, the
Empirical Beta Copula Autoencoder, is considered. Furthermore, we provide
insights into further aspects of these methods, such as targeted sampling or
synthesizing new data with specific features.

<p class="mathjax">Much research effort is being applied to the task of compressing the
knowledge of self-supervised models, which are powerful, yet large and memory
consuming. In this work, we show that the original method of knowledge
distillation (and its more recently proposed extension, decoupled knowledge
distillation) can be applied to the task of distilling HuBERT. In contrast to
methods that focus on distilling internal features, this allows for more
freedom in the network architecture of the compressed model. We thus propose to
distill HuBERT's Transformer layers into an LSTM-based distilled model that
reduces the number of parameters even below DistilHuBERT and at the same time
shows improved performance in automatic speech recognition.

models on long-form audios. We study three categories of Automatic Speech

(2) convolutional with squeeze-and-excitation and (3) convolutional models with

The model from the category of self-attention with local attention and global

<p class="mathjax">Medical Imaging (MI) tasks, such as accelerated Parallel Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), often involve reconstructing an image from noisy or incomplete
measurements. This amounts to solving ill-posed inverse problems, where a
satisfactory closed-form analytical solution is not available. Traditional
methods such as Compressed Sensing (CS) in MRI reconstruction can be
time-consuming or prone to obtaining low-fidelity images. Recently, a plethora
of supervised and self-supervised Deep Learning (DL) approaches have
demonstrated superior performance in inverse-problem solving, surpassing
conventional methods. In this study, we propose vSHARP (variable Splitting
Half-quadratic ADMM algorithm for Reconstruction of inverse Problems), a novel
DL-based method for solving ill-posed inverse problems arising in MI. vSHARP
utilizes the Half-Quadratic Variable Splitting method and employs the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to unroll the optimization
process. For data consistency, vSHARP unrolls a differentiable gradient descent
process in the image domain, while a DL-based denoiser, such as a U-Net
architecture, is applied to enhance image quality. vSHARP also employs a
dilated-convolution DL-based model to predict the Lagrange multipliers for the
ADMM initialization. We evaluate the proposed model by applying it to the task
of accelerated Parallel MRI Reconstruction on two distinct datasets. We present
a comparative analysis of our experimental results with state-of-the-art
approaches, highlighting the superior performance of vSHARP.

<p class="mathjax">Cryoablation is a minimally invasive and efficient therapy option for liver
cancer. Liquid nitrogen was used to kill the unwanted cells via freezing. One
of the challenges of cryosurgery is to destroy the complete tumor without
damaging the surrounding healthy cells when the tumor is large. To overcome
this challenge, multi-cryoprobes were arranged in a polygonal pattern to create
a uniform cooling and optimum ablation zone in the tissue. Single, three, and
four cryoprobes were placed in the center, triangle, and square patterns to
analyze the temperature profile and ablation zone. The results showed that
tissue will freeze quickly when cryoprobes are placed in a square pattern.
After the treatment of 600 seconds, $99\%$, $96\%$, and $31\%$ of the tumor
were killed using four, three, and single cryoprobes, respectively. One of the
difficulties in the multi-probe technique is choosing the probe separation
distance and cooling time. The volume of the ablation zone, the thermal damage
to healthy cells, and the volume of tumor cells killed during the treatment for
different probe separation distances of 10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm are analyzed.
Compared to other settings, a multi-probe technique destroys the entire tumor
with the least harm to healthy cells when probes are arranged in a square
pattern with a 15 mm space between them.

<p class="mathjax">Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their simplicity in
construction and interpretability. However, as data sizes grow, traditional
methods for construction and retraining decision trees become increasingly
slow, scaling polynomially with the number of training examples. In this work,
we introduce a novel quantum algorithm, named $Des$-$q$, for constructing and
retraining decision trees in regression and binary classification tasks.
Assuming the data stream produces small increments of new training examples, we
demonstrate that our $Des$-$q$ algorithm significantly reduces the time
required for tree retraining, achieving a poly-logarithmic time complexity in
the number of training examples, even accounting for the time needed to load
the new examples into quantum-accessible memory. Our approach involves building
a decision tree algorithm to perform k-piecewise linear tree splits at each
internal node. These splits simultaneously generate multiple hyperplanes,
dividing the feature space into k distinct regions. To determine the k suitable
anchor points for these splits, we develop an efficient quantum-supervised
clustering method, building upon the q-means algorithm of Kerenidis $et$ $al$.
$Des$-$q$ first efficiently estimates each feature weight using a novel quantum
technique to estimate the Pearson correlation. Subsequently, we employ weighted
distance estimation to cluster the training examples in k disjoint regions and
then proceed to expand the tree using the same procedure. We benchmark the
performance of the simulated version of our algorithm against the
state-of-the-art classical decision tree for regression and binary
classification on multiple data sets with numerical features. Further, we
showcase that the proposed algorithm exhibits similar performance to the
state-of-the-art decision tree while significantly speeding up the periodic
tree retraining.
