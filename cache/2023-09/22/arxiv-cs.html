<p class="mathjax">The applications of personalized recommender systems are rapidly expanding:
encompassing social media, online shopping, search engine results, and more.
These systems offer a more efficient way to navigate the vast array of items
available. However, alongside this growth, there has been increased recognition
of the potential for algorithmic systems to exhibit and perpetuate biases,
risking unfairness in personalized domains. In this work, we explicate the
inherent tension between personalization and conventional implementations of
fairness. As an alternative, we propose equity to achieve fairness in the
context of epistemic utility. We provide a mapping between goals and practical
implementations and detail policy recommendations across key stakeholders to
forge a path towards achieving fairness in personalized systems.

<p class="mathjax">Enterprises often own large collections of structured data in the form of
large databases or an enterprise data lake. Such data collections come with
limited metadata and strict access policies that could limit access to the data
contents and, therefore, limit the application of classic retrieval and
analysis solutions. As a result, there is a need for solutions that can
effectively utilize the available metadata. In this paper, we study the problem
of matching table metadata to a business glossary containing data labels and
descriptions. The resulting matching enables the use of an available or curated
business glossary for retrieval and analysis without or before requesting
access to the data contents. One solution to this problem is to use
manually-defined rules or similarity measures on column names and glossary
descriptions (or their vector embeddings) to find the closest match. However,
such approaches need to be tuned through manual labeling and cannot handle many
business glossaries that contain a combination of simple as well as complex and
long descriptions. In this work, we leverage the power of large language models
(LLMs) to design generic matching methods that do not require manual tuning and
can identify complex relations between column names and glossaries. We propose
methods that utilize LLMs in two ways: a) by generating additional context for
column names that can aid with matching b) by using LLMs to directly infer if
there is a relation between column names and glossary descriptions. Our
preliminary experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed
methods.

<p class="mathjax">In digital advertising, the selection of the optimal item (recommendation)
and its best creative presentation (creative optimization) have traditionally
been considered separate disciplines. However, both contribute significantly to
user satisfaction, underpinning our assumption that it relies on both an item's
relevance and its presentation, particularly in the case of visual creatives.
In response, we introduce the task of {\itshape Generative Creative
Optimization (GCO)}, which proposes the use of generative models for creative
generation that incorporate user interests, and {\itshape AdBooster}, a model
for personalized ad creatives based on the Stable Diffusion outpainting
architecture. This model uniquely incorporates user interests both during
fine-tuning and at generation time. To further improve AdBooster's performance,
we also introduce an automated data augmentation pipeline. Through our
experiments on simulated data, we validate AdBooster's effectiveness in
generating more relevant creatives than default product images, showing its
potential of enhancing user engagement.

<p class="mathjax">Grading of exams is an important, labor intensive, subjective, repetitive and
frequently challenging task. The feasibility of autograding textual responses
has greatly increased thanks to the availability of large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and because of the substantial influx of data brought
about by digitalization. However, entrusting AI models with decision-making
roles raises ethical considerations, mainly stemming from potential biases and
issues related to generating false information. Thus, in this manuscript we
provide an evaluation of a large language model for the purpose of autograding,
while also highlighting how LLMs can support educators in validating their
grading procedures. Our evaluation is targeted towards automatic short textual
answers grading (ASAG), spanning various languages and examinations from two
distinct courses. Our findings suggest that while "out-of-the-box" LLMs provide
a valuable tool to provide a complementary perspective, their readiness for
independent automated grading remains a work in progress, necessitating human
oversight.

<p class="mathjax">The decision-making process in real-world implementations has been affected
by a growing reliance on data-driven models. We investigated the synergetic
pattern between the data-driven methods, empirical domain knowledge, and
first-principles simulations. We showed the potential risk of biased results
when using data-driven models without causal analysis. Using a case study
assessing the implication of several design solutions on the energy consumption
of a building, we proved the necessity of causal analysis during the
data-driven modeling process. We concluded that: (a) Data-driven models'
accuracy assessment or domain knowledge screening may not rule out biased and
spurious results; (b) Data-driven models' feature selection should involve
careful consideration of causal relationships, especially colliders; (c) Causal
analysis results can be used as an aid to first-principles simulation design
and parameter checking to avoid cognitive biases. We proved the benefits of
causal analysis when applied to data-driven models in building engineering.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, several studies have reported on the fine-tuning of foundation
models for image-text modeling in the field of medicine, utilizing images from
online data sources such as Twitter and PubMed. Foundation models are large,
deep artificial neural networks capable of learning the context of a specific
domain through training on exceptionally extensive datasets. Through
validation, we have observed that the representations generated by such models
exhibit inferior performance in retrieval tasks within digital pathology when
compared to those generated by significantly smaller, conventional deep

<p class="mathjax">With increasing frequency of high-profile privacy breaches in various online
platforms, users are becoming more concerned about their privacy. And
recommender system is the core component of online platforms for providing
personalized service, consequently, its privacy preservation has attracted
great attention. As the gold standard of privacy protection, differential
privacy has been widely adopted to preserve privacy in recommender systems.
However, existing differentially private recommender systems only consider
static and independent interactions, so they cannot apply to sequential
recommendation where behaviors are dynamic and dependent. Meanwhile, little
attention has been paid on the privacy risk of sensitive user features, most of
them only protect user feedbacks. In this work, we propose a novel
DIfferentially Private Sequential recommendation framework with a noisy Graph
Neural Network approach (denoted as DIPSGNN) to address these limitations. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in
sequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in
DIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user
features. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of
graph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this
noisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and
capture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private
recommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access
to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong
privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show
that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this
loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix
factorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the
user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix
that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.
<br />The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can
be applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical
item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)
publicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be
collectively utilized to fully leverage public data.
<br />Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that
using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between
private models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints
become more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for
recommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative
filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.

<p class="mathjax">Ad-load balancing is a critical challenge in online advertising systems,
particularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to
maximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user
experience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as
user satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing
rely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user
preferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that
leverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We
start by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,
highlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads
revenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the
dependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we
define the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed
fetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that
leverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and
Doubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline
collected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments
deployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million
sessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user
satisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.

<p class="mathjax">Stablecoins, which are primarily intended to function as a global reserve of
value are insubstantial in their design and present many failure points. The
primary mechanism to enable these coins to hold on to a fixed value is by
backing them with collateral. Fiat collateralized stablecoins require users to
trust a centralized entity, which breaks the total concept of decentralization.
Crypto collateralized stablecoins have issues involving high collateral
requirements and introduces risks of auto-liquidation. In this paper we aim to
propose an alternative architecture for the creation of a functional and secure
stablecoin.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer first appears in the field of natural language processing and is
later migrated to the computer vision domain, where it demonstrates excellent
performance in vision tasks. However, recently, Retentive Network (RetNet) has
emerged as an architecture with the potential to replace Transformer,
attracting widespread attention in the NLP community. Therefore, we raise the
question of whether transferring RetNet's idea to vision can also bring
outstanding performance to vision tasks. To address this, we combine RetNet and
Transformer to propose RMT. Inspired by RetNet, RMT introduces explicit decay
into the vision backbone, bringing prior knowledge related to spatial distances
to the vision model. This distance-related spatial prior allows for explicit
control of the range of tokens that each token can attend to. Additionally, to
reduce the computational cost of global modeling, we decompose this modeling
process along the two coordinate axes of the image. Abundant experiments have
demonstrated that our RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various
computer vision tasks. For example, RMT achieves 84.1% Top1-acc on ImageNet-1k
using merely 4.5G FLOPs. To the best of our knowledge, among all models, RMT
achieves the highest Top1-acc when models are of similar size and trained with
the same strategy. Moreover, RMT significantly outperforms existing vision
backbones in downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation,
and semantic segmentation. Our work is still in progress.

<p class="mathjax">Single-view novel view synthesis, the task of generating images from new
viewpoints based on a single reference image, is an important but challenging
task in computer vision. Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(DDPM) has become popular in this area due to its strong ability to generate
high-fidelity images. However, current diffusion-based methods directly rely on
camera pose matrices as viewing conditions, globally and implicitly introducing
3D constraints. These methods may suffer from inconsistency among generated
images from different perspectives, especially in regions with intricate
textures and structures. In this work, we present Light Field Diffusion (LFD),
a conditional diffusion-based model for single-view novel view synthesis.
Unlike previous methods that employ camera pose matrices, LFD transforms the
camera view information into light field encoding and combines it with the
reference image. This design introduces local pixel-wise constraints within the
diffusion models, thereby encouraging better multi-view consistency.
Experiments on several datasets show that our LFD can efficiently generate
high-fidelity images and maintain better 3D consistency even in intricate
regions. Our method can generate images with higher quality than NeRF-based
models, and we obtain sample quality similar to other diffusion-based models
but with only one-third of the model size.

<p class="mathjax">An important task in the field of sensor technology is the efficient
implementation of adaptation procedures of measurements from one sensor to
another sensor of identical design. One idea is to use the estimation of an
affine transformation between different systems, which can be improved by the
knowledge of experts. This paper presents an improved solution from Glacier
Research that was published back in 1973. It is shown that this solution can be
adapted for software calibration of sensors, implementation of expert-based

<p class="mathjax">This work describes the TrueLearn Python library, which contains a family of
online learning Bayesian models for building educational (or more generally,
informational) recommendation systems. This family of models was designed
following the "open learner" concept, using humanly-intuitive user
representations. For the sake of interpretability and putting the user in
control, the TrueLearn library also contains different representations to help
end-users visualise the learner models, which may in the future facilitate user
interaction with their own models. Together with the library, we include a
previously publicly released implicit feedback educational dataset with
evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the models. The extensive
documentation and coding examples make the library highly accessible to both
machine learning developers and educational data mining and learning analytic
practitioners. The library and the support documentation with examples are
available at https://truelearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest.

<p class="mathjax">Inductive link prediction -- where entities during training and inference
stages can be different -- has shown great potential for completing evolving
knowledge graphs in an entity-independent manner. Many popular methods mainly
focus on modeling graph-level features, while the edge-level interactions --
especially the semantic correlations between relations -- have been less
explored. However, we notice a desirable property of semantic correlations
between relations is that they are inherently edge-level and
entity-independent. This implies the great potential of the semantic
correlations for the entity-independent inductive link prediction task.
Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel subgraph-based method, namely
TACO, to model Topology-Aware COrrelations between relations that are highly
correlated to their topological structures within subgraphs. Specifically, we
prove that semantic correlations between any two relations can be categorized
into seven topological patterns, and then proposes Relational Correlation
Network (RCN) to learn the importance of each pattern. To further exploit the
potential of RCN, we propose Complete Common Neighbor induced subgraph that can
effectively preserve complete topological patterns within the subgraph.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TACO effectively unifies the graph-level
information and edge-level interactions to jointly perform reasoning, leading
to a superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods for the
inductive link prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">Quantization of deep neural networks (DNN) has become a key element in the
efforts of embedding such networks on end-user devices. However, current
quantization methods usually suffer from costly accuracy degradation. In this
paper, we propose a new method for Enhanced Post Training Quantization named
EPTQ. The method is based on knowledge distillation with an adaptive weighting
of layers. In addition, we introduce a new label-free technique for
approximating the Hessian trace of the task loss, named Label-Free Hessian.
This technique removes the requirement of a labeled dataset for computing the
Hessian. The adaptive knowledge distillation uses the Label-Free Hessian
technique to give greater attention to the sensitive parts of the model while
performing the optimization. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve
state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of models, tasks, and datasets,
including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for
semantic segmentation. We demonstrate the performance and compatibility of EPTQ
on an extended set of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, hybrid, and
MLP-only models.

require Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to transform scanned documents into
machine-readable text, a process that often produces errors. We develop a
pipeline for the generation of a synthetic ground truth/OCR dataset to correct
the OCR results of the astrophysics literature holdings of the NASA
Astrophysics Data System (ADS). By mining the arXiv we create, to the authors'
knowledge, the largest scientific synthetic ground truth/OCR post correction
dataset of 203,354,393 character pairs. We provide baseline models trained with
this dataset and find the mean improvement in character and word error rates of
7.71% and 18.82% for historical OCR text, respectively. When used to classify
parts of sentences as inline math, we find a classification F1 score of 77.82%.
Interactive dashboards to explore the dataset are available online:

<p class="mathjax">Neuromorphic computing is one of the few current approaches that have the
potential to significantly reduce power consumption in Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence. Imam &amp; Cleland presented an odour-learning algorithm
that runs on a neuromorphic architecture and is inspired by circuits described
in the mammalian olfactory bulb. They assess the algorithm's performance in
"rapid online learning and identification" of gaseous odorants and odorless
gases (short "gases") using a set of gas sensor recordings of different odour
presentations and corrupting them by impulse noise. We replicated parts of the
study and discovered limitations that affect some of the conclusions drawn.
First, the dataset used suffers from sensor drift and a non-randomised
measurement protocol, rendering it of limited use for odour identification
benchmarks. Second, we found that the model is restricted in its ability to
generalise over repeated presentations of the same gas. We demonstrate that the
task the study refers to can be solved with a simple hash table approach,
matching or exceeding the reported results in accuracy and runtime. Therefore,
a validation of the model that goes beyond restoring a learned data sample
remains to be shown, in particular its suitability to odour identification
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been a compelling approach for
achieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it
has been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A
main challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to
instantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from
humans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long
range tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained
natural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it
is easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is
flexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.
Our approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as
well as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space. Our work
presents a novel approach to combining human expert supervision with the
benefits and flexibility of reinforcement learning.

trained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and
8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models
by 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B
parameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context
performance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192
context length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama
dataset; aggressively tuned the \textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used
ALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.
<br />On Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that
users prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter
model to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an
important milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision
and takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access
to a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices. BTLM-3B-8K is
available under an Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face:

<p class="mathjax">While most modern video understanding models operate on short-range clips,
real-world videos are often several minutes long with semantically consistent
segments of variable length. A common approach to process long videos is
applying a short-form video model over uniformly sampled clips of fixed
temporal length and aggregating the outputs. This approach neglects the
underlying nature of long videos since fixed-length clips are often redundant
or uninformative. In this paper, we aim to provide a generic and adaptive
sampling approach for long-form videos in lieu of the de facto uniform
sampling. Viewing videos as semantically consistent segments, we formulate a
task-agnostic, unsupervised, and scalable approach based on Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS) for sampling and tokenizing long videos. We evaluate our
method on long-form video understanding tasks such as video classification and
temporal action localization, showing consistent gains over existing approaches
and achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-form video modeling.

<p class="mathjax">Background: The literature offers various methods for capturing software
architectural knowledge (AK), including views, viewpoints, and architecture
decision records (ADRs). In parallel, sustainability has gained prominence in
software engineering, especially concerning software architecture.
Nevertheless, practical industry reviews on these subjects seem to be lacking.
Aim: In this research we aim to understand the current practice in architecture
knowledge, and to explore where sustainability can be applied to address
sustainability in software architecture in the future. Method: We used a
survey, which utilized a questionnaire containing 34 questions and collected
responses from 45 architects working at a prominent bank in the Netherlands,
aimed to evaluate the practical representation and communication of
architectural knowledge and sustainability. Result: Our analysis yielded two
primary discoveries and several intriguing detailed results regarding how AK is
captured and conveyed to diverse stakeholders. Firstly, it seems crucial to
develop a new architectural element that connects various architectural
features and perspectives tailored for different stakeholders. Secondly,
providing clear guidance, references, and goals is essential to motivate
architects to adopt Sustainable Software Engineering practices. Conclusion:
After analysing the data collected through this survey, we have concluded that:
a) There are no established domain-specific AK methods/tools in the financial
domain. Most practitioners use domain-generic tools. b) A new architectural
element that links the various architectural features and viewpoints created
for various stakeholders appears to be necessary. c) There is sufficient
sustainability awareness and motivation among software architects. However,
what they lack are clear guidance, references, and goals to practice
sustainable software engineering.

<p class="mathjax">A crucial aspect of a rumor detection model is its ability to generalize,
particularly its ability to detect emerging, previously unknown rumors. Past
research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as
input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen
rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely
untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of
the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on
detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that
context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from
the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that
contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split
strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the
paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of
temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor
detection methods.

<p class="mathjax">Creating accurate 3D models of tree topology is an important task for tree
pruning. The 3D model is used to decide which branches to prune and then to
execute the pruning cuts. Previous methods for creating 3D tree models have
typically relied on point clouds, which are often computationally expensive to
process and can suffer from data defects, especially with thin branches. In
this paper, we propose a method for actively scanning along a primary tree
branch, detecting secondary branches to be pruned, and reconstructing their 3D
geometry using just an RGB camera mounted on a robot arm. We experimentally
validate that our setup is able to produce primary branch models with 4-5 mm
accuracy and secondary branch models with 15 degrees orientation accuracy with
respect to the ground truth model. Our framework is real-time and can run up to
10 cm/s with no loss in model accuracy or ability to detect secondary branches.

neural coreference resolution for English have been hampered by the lack of
singleton mention span data as well as other entity information. This paper
presents a coreference model that learns singletons as well as features such as

This approach achieves new state-of-the-art scores on the OntoGUM benchmark
(+2.7 points) and increases robustness on multiple out-of-domain datasets (+2.3
points on average), likely due to greater generalizability for mention

<p class="mathjax">The prevalence of ubiquitous location-aware devices and mobile Internet
enables us to collect massive individual-level trajectory dataset from users.
Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but
also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we
present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a
deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving
trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the
underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a
distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional
adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global
context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite
graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct
trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate
high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as
supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data
publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our
method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal
characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline
methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility
research using generative AI techniques and explores data ethics issues in
GIScience.

<p class="mathjax">By optimizing the predicted performance over a receding horizon, model
predictive control (MPC) provides the ability to enforce state and control
constraints. The present paper considers an extension of MPC for nonlinear
systems that can be written in pseudo-linear form with state- and
control-dependent coefficients. The main innovation is to apply quadratic
programming iteratively over the horizon, where the predicted state trajectory
is updated based on the updated control sequence. Output-feedback control is
facilitated by using the block-observable canonical form for linear,
time-varying dynamics. This control technique is illustrated on various
numerical examples, including the Kapitza pendulum with slider-crank actuation,
the nonholonomic integrator, the electromagnetically controlled oscillator, and
the triple integrator with control-magnitude saturation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, several approaches have emerged for generating neural
representations with multiple levels of detail (LODs). LODs can improve the
rendering by using lower resolutions and smaller model sizes when appropriate.
However, existing methods generally focus on a few discrete LODs which suffer
from aliasing and flicker artifacts as details are changed and limit their
granularity for adapting to resource limitations. In this paper, we propose a
method to encode light field networks with continuous LODs, allowing for finely
tuned adaptations to rendering conditions. Our training procedure uses
summed-area table filtering allowing efficient and continuous filtering at
various LODs. Furthermore, we use saliency-based importance sampling which
enables our light field networks to distribute their capacity, particularly
limited at lower LODs, towards representing the details viewers are most likely
to focus on. Incorporating continuous LODs into neural representations enables
progressive streaming of neural representations, decreasing the latency and
resource utilization for rendering.

<p class="mathjax">We study offline model-based optimization to maximize a black-box objective
function with a static dataset of designs and scores. These designs encompass a
variety of domains, including materials, robots and DNA sequences. A common
approach trains a proxy on the static dataset to approximate the black-box
objective function and performs gradient ascent to obtain new designs. However,
this often results in poor designs due to the proxy inaccuracies for
out-of-distribution designs. Recent studies indicate that: (a) gradient ascent
with a mean ensemble of proxies generally outperforms simple gradient ascent,
and (b) a trained proxy provides weak ranking supervision signals for design
selection. Motivated by (a) and (b), we propose \textit{parallel-mentoring} as
an effective and novel method that facilitates mentoring among parallel
proxies, creating a more robust ensemble to mitigate the out-of-distribution
issue. We focus on the three-proxy case and our method consists of two modules.
The first module, \textit{voting-based pairwise supervision}, operates on three
parallel proxies and captures their ranking supervision signals as pairwise
comparison labels. These labels are combined through majority voting to
generate consensus labels, which incorporate ranking supervision signals from
all proxies and enable mutual mentoring. However, label noise arises due to
possible incorrect consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce an
\textit{adaptive soft-labeling} module with soft-labels initialized as
consensus labels. Based on bi-level optimization, this module fine-tunes
proxies in the inner level and learns more accurate labels in the outer level
to adaptively mentor proxies, resulting in a more robust ensemble. Experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available here.

<p class="mathjax">Answer grounding is the task of locating relevant visual evidence for the
Visual Question Answering task. While a wide variety of attention methods have
been introduced for this task, they suffer from the following three problems:
designs that do not allow the usage of pre-trained networks and do not benefit
from large data pre-training, custom designs that are not based on
well-grounded previous designs, therefore limiting the learning power of the
network, or complicated designs that make it challenging to re-implement or
improve them. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural block, which we
term Sentence Attention Block, to solve these problems. The proposed block
re-calibrates channel-wise image feature-maps by explicitly modeling
inter-dependencies between the image feature-maps and sentence embedding. We
visually demonstrate how this block filters out irrelevant feature-maps
channels based on sentence embedding. We start our design with a well-known
attention method, and by making minor modifications, we improve the results to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. The flexibility of our method makes it easy
to use different pre-trained backbone networks, and its simplicity makes it
easy to understand and be re-implemented. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method on the TextVQA-X, VQS, VQA-X, and VizWiz-VQA-Grounding datasets. We
perform multiple ablation studies to show the effectiveness of our design
choices.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit social biases. Given LLMs'
increasing integration into workplace software, these biases may impact
workers' well-being and may disproportionately impact minoritized communities.
This short paper investigates how co-writing with an LLM impacts three measures
related to user's well-being: feelings of inclusion, control, and ownership
over their work. In an online experiment, participants wrote hypothetical job
promotion requests to their boss and using either hesitant or self-assured
auto-complete suggestions from an LLM. Afterward, participants reported their
feelings of inclusion, control, and ownership. We found that the style of the
AI model did not impact perceived inclusion. Furthermore, individuals with
higher perceived inclusion also perceived greater agency and ownership, an
effect more strongly impacting participants of minoritized genders. Lastly,
feelings of inclusion can mitigate a loss of control and agency when accepting
more AI suggestions. Future work should explore feelings of inclusion in
AI-written communication.

<p class="mathjax">Offline model-based optimization aims to find a design that maximizes a
property of interest using only an offline dataset, with applications in robot,
protein, and molecule design, among others. A prevalent approach is gradient
ascent, where a proxy model is trained on the offline dataset and then used to
optimize the design. This method suffers from an out-of-distribution issue,
where the proxy is not accurate for unseen designs. To mitigate this issue, we
explore using a pseudo-labeler to generate valuable data for fine-tuning the
proxy. Specifically, we propose \textit{\textbf{I}mportance-aware
\textbf{C}o-\textbf{T}eaching for Offline Model-based
Optimization}~(\textbf{ICT}). This method maintains three symmetric proxies
with their mean ensemble as the final proxy, and comprises two steps. The first
step is \textit{pseudo-label-driven co-teaching}. In this step, one proxy is
iteratively selected as the pseudo-labeler for designs near the current
optimization point, generating pseudo-labeled data. Subsequently, a co-teaching
process identifies small-loss samples as valuable data and exchanges them
between the other two proxies for fine-tuning, promoting knowledge transfer.
This procedure is repeated three times, with a different proxy chosen as the
pseudo-labeler each time, ultimately enhancing the ensemble performance. To
further improve accuracy of pseudo-labels, we perform a secondary step of
\textit{meta-learning-based sample reweighting}, which assigns importance
weights to samples in the pseudo-labeled dataset and updates them via
meta-learning. ICT achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
design-bench tasks, achieving the best mean rank of $3.1$ and median rank of
$2$, among $15$ methods. Our source code can be found here.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in generative modeling, namely Diffusion models, have
revolutionized generative modeling, enabling high-quality image generation
tailored to user needs. This paper proposes a framework for the generative
design of structural components. Specifically, we employ a Latent Diffusion
model to generate potential designs of a component that can satisfy a set of
problem-specific loading conditions. One of the distinct advantages our
approach offers over other generative approaches, such as generative
adversarial networks (GANs), is that it permits the editing of existing
designs. We train our model using a dataset of geometries obtained from
structural topology optimization utilizing the SIMP algorithm. Consequently,
our framework generates inherently near-optimal designs. Our work presents
quantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated
designs and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we
provide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel
domains with resolutions varying from $32^3$ to $128^3$. Our framework can be
used as a starting point for generating novel near-optimal designs similar to
topology-optimized designs.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI workflows heavily rely on data-centric tasks - such as
filtering samples by annotation fields, vector distances, or scores produced by
custom classifiers. At the same time, computer vision datasets are quickly
approaching petabyte volumes, rendering data wrangling difficult. In addition,
the iterative nature of data preparation necessitates robust dataset sharing
and versioning mechanisms, both of which are hard to implement ad-hoc. To solve
these challenges, we propose a "dataset factory" approach that separates the
storage and processing of samples from metadata and enables data-centric
operations at scale for machine learning teams and individual researchers.

<p class="mathjax">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been the subject of research for many
years, and recent studies have focused on improving its performance through
various techniques. In the past decade, deep learning studies have shown high
performance in various research areas, leading researchers to explore their
application to HCI. Convolutional neural networks can be used to recognize hand
gestures from images using deep architectures. In this study, we evaluated
pre-trained high-performance deep architectures on the HG14 dataset, which
consists of 14 different hand gesture classes. Among 22 different models,
versions of the VGGNet and MobileNet models attained the highest accuracy
rates. Specifically, the VGG16 and VGG19 models achieved accuracy rates of
94.64% and 94.36%, respectively, while the MobileNet and MobileNetV2 models
achieved accuracy rates of 96.79% and 94.43%, respectively. We performed hand
gesture recognition on the dataset using an ensemble learning technique, which
combined the four most successful models. By utilizing these models as base
learners and applying the Dirichlet ensemble technique, we achieved an accuracy
rate of 98.88%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep
ensemble learning technique for HCI and its potential applications in areas
such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and game technologies.

<p class="mathjax">With the proliferation of hate speech on social networks under different
formats, such as abusive language, cyberbullying, and violence, etc., people
have experienced a significant increase in violence, putting them in
uncomfortable situations and threats. Plenty of efforts have been dedicated in
the last few years to overcome this phenomenon to detect hate speech in
different structured languages like English, French, Arabic, and others.
However, a reduced number of works deal with Arabic dialects like Tunisian,
Egyptian, and Gulf, mainly the Algerian ones. To fill in the gap, we propose in
this work a complete approach for detecting hate speech on online Algerian
messages. Many deep learning architectures have been evaluated on the corpus we
created from some Algerian social networks (Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter).
This corpus contains more than 13.5K documents in Algerian dialect written in
Arabic, labeled as hateful or non-hateful. Promising results are obtained,
which show the efficiency of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Assigning repetitive and physically-demanding construction tasks to robots
can alleviate human workers's exposure to occupational injuries. Transferring
necessary dexterous and adaptive artisanal construction craft skills from
workers to robots is crucial for the successful delegation of construction
tasks and achieving high-quality robot-constructed work. Predefined motion
planning scripts tend to generate rigid and collision-prone robotic behaviors
in unstructured construction site environments. In contrast, Imitation Learning
(IL) offers a more robust and flexible skill transfer scheme. However, the
majority of IL algorithms rely on human workers to repeatedly demonstrate task
performance at full scale, which can be counterproductive and infeasible in the
case of construction work. To address this concern, this paper proposes an
immersive, cloud robotics-based virtual demonstration framework that serves two
primary purposes. First, it digitalizes the demonstration process, eliminating
the need for repetitive physical manipulation of heavy construction objects.
Second, it employs a federated collection of reusable demonstrations that are
transferable for similar tasks in the future and can thus reduce the
requirement for repetitive illustration of tasks by human agents. Additionally,
to enhance the trustworthiness, explainability, and ethical soundness of the
robot training, this framework utilizes a Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL)
model to decompose human manipulation skills into sequential and reactive
sub-skills. These two layers of skills are represented by deep generative
models, enabling adaptive control of robot actions. By delegating the physical
strains of construction work to human-trained robots, this framework promotes
the inclusion of workers with diverse physical capabilities and educational
backgrounds within the construction industry.

<p class="mathjax">Data analysis often involves the comparison of complex objects. With the ever
increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with
these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization
tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to
examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of
information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in
general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in
developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general
taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic
categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its
completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related
to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we
see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition,
superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power
of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general
understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of
more comparative visualization tools.

<p class="mathjax">Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely
known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances.
Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the
implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters
of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of
uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and
stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these
offline approaches for analysis, interval and set-based methods have also been
developed in recent years, which allow to solve the associated design tasks and
to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online. The latter
approaches include set-based model-predictive control, online parameter
adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping
controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper
provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous
practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have

movie, etc.) rather than short-form, such as music. Additionally, many do not
explore incorporating negative session-level feedback during training. In this
study, we investigate the use of transformer-based self-attentive architectures
to learn implicit session-level information for sequential music
recommendation. We additionally propose a contrastive learning task to
incorporate negative feedback (e.g skipped tracks) to promote positive hits and
penalize negative hits. This task is formulated as a simple loss term that can
be incorporated into a variety of deep learning architectures for sequential
recommendation. Our experiments show that this results in consistent
performance gains over the baseline architectures ignoring negative user
feedback.

<p class="mathjax">Novel view synthesis (NVS) of multi-human scenes imposes challenges due to
the complex inter-human occlusions. Layered representations handle the
complexities by dividing the scene into multi-layered radiance fields, however,
they are mainly constrained to per-scene optimization making them inefficient.
Generalizable human view synthesis methods combine the pre-fitted 3D human
meshes with image features to reach generalization, yet they are mainly
designed to operate on single-human scenes. Another drawback is the reliance on
multi-step optimization techniques for parametric pre-fitting of the 3D body
models that suffer from misalignment with the images in sparse view settings
causing hallucinations in synthesized views. In this work, we propose,
GenLayNeRF, a generalizable layered scene representation for free-viewpoint
rendering of multiple human subjects which requires no per-scene optimization
and very sparse views as input. We divide the scene into multi-human layers
anchored by the 3D body meshes. We then ensure pixel-level alignment of the
body models with the input views through a novel end-to-end trainable module
that carries out iterative parametric correction coupled with multi-view
feature fusion to produce aligned 3D models. For NVS, we extract point-wise
image-aligned and human-anchored features which are correlated and fused using
self-attention and cross-attention modules. We augment low-level RGB values
into the features with an attention-based RGB fusion module. To evaluate our
approach, we construct two multi-human view synthesis datasets; DeepMultiSyn
and ZJU-MultiHuman. The results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms
generalizable and non-human per-scene NeRF methods while performing at par with
layered per-scene methods without test time optimization.

<p class="mathjax">Vector graphics are an industry-standard way to represent and share visual
designs. Designers frequently source and incorporate styles from existing
designs into their own work. Unfortunately, popular design tools aren't well
suited for this task. We present VST, Vector Style Transfer, a novel design
tool for flexibly transferring visual styles between vector graphics. The core
of VST lies in leveraging automation while respecting designers' tastes and the
subjectivity inherent to style transfer. In VST, designers tune a cross-design
element correspondence and customize which style attributes to change. We
report results from a user study in which designers used VST to control style
transfer between several designs, including designs participants created with
external tools beforehand. VST shows that enabling design correspondence tuning
and customization is one way to support interactive, flexible style transfer.
We also find that someone using VST can significantly reduce the time and work
for style transfer compared to experienced designers using industry-standard
tools.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most common ways to represent and share visual designs is with
vector graphics. Designers working with vector graphics often explore layout
alternatives and generate them by moving and resizing elements. The motivation
for this can range from establishing a different visual flow, adapting a design
to a different aspect ratio, standardizing spacing, or redirecting the design's
visual emphasis. Existing designs can serve as a source of inspiration for
layout modification across these goals. However, generating these layout
alternatives still requires significant manual effort in rearranging large
groups of elements. We present VLT, short for Vector Layout Transfer, a novel
graphic design tool that enables flexible transfer of layouts between designs.
It provides designers with multiple levels of semantic layout editing controls,
powered by automatic graphics correspondence and layout optimization
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Planning time-optimal trajectories for quadrotors in cluttered environments
is a challenging, non-convex problem. This paper addresses minimizing the
traversal time of a given collision-free geometric path without violating
bounds on individual motor thrusts of the vehicle. Previous approaches have
either relied on convex relaxations that do not guarantee dynamic feasibility,
or have generated overly conservative time parametrizations. We propose
TOPPQuad, a time-optimal path parameterization algorithm for quadrotors which
explicitly incorporates quadrotor rigid body dynamics and constraints such as
bounds on inputs (including motor speeds) and state of the vehicle (including
the pose, linear and angular velocity and acceleration). We demonstrate the
ability of the planner to generate faster trajectories that respect hardware
constraints of the robot compared to several planners with relaxed notions of
dynamic feasibility. We also demonstrate how TOPPQuad can be used to plan
trajectories for quadrotors that utilize bidirectional motors. Overall, the
proposed approach paves a way towards maximizing the efficacy of autonomous
micro aerial vehicles while ensuring their safety.

<p class="mathjax">A sequential pattern with negation, or negative sequential pattern, takes the
form of a sequential pattern for which the negation symbol may be used in front
of some of the pattern's itemsets. Intuitively, such a pattern occurs in a
sequence if negated itemsets are absent in the sequence. Recent work has shown
that different semantics can be attributed to these pattern forms, and that
state-of-the-art algorithms do not extract the same sets of patterns. This
raises the important question of the interpretability of sequential pattern
with negation. In this study, our focus is on exploring how potential users
perceive negation in sequential patterns. Our aim is to determine whether
specific semantics are more "intuitive" than others and whether these align
with the semantics employed by one or more state-of-the-art algorithms. To
achieve this, we designed a questionnaire to reveal the semantics' intuition of
each user. This article presents both the design of the questionnaire and an
in-depth analysis of the 124 responses obtained. The outcomes indicate that two
of the semantics are predominantly intuitive; however, neither of them aligns
with the semantics of the primary state-of-the-art algorithms. As a result, we
provide recommendations to account for this disparity in the conclusions drawn.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive Social Structures (CSS) are multilayer social networks where each
layer corresponds to an individual's perception of the network. Traditional
analyses of CSSs have focused on identifying individuals' accurate (or
inaccurate) perceptions of a network or examining how these perceptions
correlate with behavior. Largely overlooked, however, has been the rich
information that CSSs contain about the possible correspondence between the
social and cognitive structure shared by the individuals within a network. How
does a person's social position, capturing how they are related to other
individuals, relate to their cognitive position, capturing how they view the
network? In this work, we study CSSs as three-dimensional tensors, applying
tensor decomposition methods to simultaneously capture the joint latent social
structure of how individuals are perceived as connected as well as the latent
cognitive structure of how different individuals view the connections. In
addition to modeling cognitively independent, dependent, and redundant
networks, we propose a specific model instance and related statistical test for
testing when there is social-cognitive agreement in a network: when the social
and cognitive spaces are equivalent. We employ low-rank nonnegative Tucker
decompositions (NNTuck) to approximate the CSS, a procedure closely related to
estimating a multilayer stochastic block model (SBM) from such data. We place a
particular emphasis on the NNTuck's latent cognitive space, proposing it as an
operationalization of sociological theories of social cognition and relational
schema. We use our approach to analyze four different CSSs and give insights
into the latent cognitive structures of those networks.

<p class="mathjax">Signal processing and Information theory are two disparate fields used for
characterizing signals for various scientific and engineering applications.
Spectral/Fourier analysis, a technique employed in signal processing, helps
estimation of power at different frequency components present in the signal.
Characterizing a time-series based on its average amount of information
(Shannon entropy) is useful for estimating its complexity and compressibility
(eg., for communication applications). Information theory doesn't deal with
spectral content while signal processing doesn't directly consider the
information content or compressibility of the signal. In this work, we attempt
to bring the fields of signal processing and information theory together by
using a lossless data compression algorithm to estimate the amount of
information or `compressibility' of time series at different scales. To this
end, we employ the Effort-to-Compress (ETC) algorithm to obtain what we call as
a Compression Spectrum. This new tool for signal analysis is demonstrated on
synthetically generated periodic signals, a sinusoid, chaotic signals (weak and
strong chaos) and uniform random noise. The Compression Spectrum is applied on
heart interbeat intervals (RR) obtained from real-world normal young and
elderly subjects. The compression spectrum of healthy young RR tachograms in
the log-log scale shows behaviour similar to $1/f$ noise whereas the healthy
old RR tachograms show a different behaviour. We envisage exciting
possibilities and future applications of the Compression Spectrum.

through the integration of an Attentive Residual Encoder (AREN) and a Residual
Pixel Attention layer. The objective of our research is to improve the
performance of VQVAE while maintaining practical parameter levels. The AREN
encoder is designed to operate effectively at multiple levels, accommodating
diverse architectural complexities. The key innovation is the integration of an
inter-pixel auto-attention mechanism into the AREN encoder. This approach
allows us to efficiently capture and utilize contextual information across
latent vectors. Additionally, our models uses additional encoding levels to
further enhance the model's representational power. Our attention layer employs
a minimal parameter approach, ensuring that latent vectors are modified only
when pertinent information from other pixels is available. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed modifications lead to significant improvements in
data representation and generation, making VQVAEs even more suitable for a wide

Neural Networks (NN) are susceptible to domain gap as they are primarily
trained with synthetic images due to the inaccessibility of space. OST aims to
close this gap by training a pose estimation NN online using incoming flight
images during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO). The pseudo-labels are
provided by adaptive unscented Kalman filter where the NN is used in the loop
as a measurement module. Specifically, the filter tracks the target's relative
orbital and attitude motion, and its accuracy is ensured by robust on-ground
training of the NN using only synthetic data. The experiments on real
hardware-in-the-loop trajectory images show that OST can improve the NN
performance on the target image domain given that OST is performed on images of

<p class="mathjax">Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disease characterized by
difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.
The severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face
unique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and
addressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In
recent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a
supplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential
drawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we
utilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant
traits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six
classification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also
study five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD
datasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate
the models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa
and log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six
selected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the
ASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As
almost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become
interested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing
some popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) &amp; Silhouette Coefficient
(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models. Our evaluation finds that
spectral clustering outperforms all other benchmarking clustering models in
terms of NMI &amp; ARI metrics and it also demonstrates comparability to the
optimal SC achieved by k-means.

<p class="mathjax">Cameras are rapidly becoming the choice for on-board sensors towards space
rendezvous due to their small form factor and inexpensive power, mass, and
volume costs. When it comes to docking, however, they typically serve a
secondary role, whereas the main work is done by active sensors such as lidar.
This paper documents the development of a proposed AI-based (artificial
intelligence) navigation algorithm intending to mature the use of on-board
visible wavelength cameras as a main sensor for docking and on-orbit servicing
(OOS), reducing the dependency on lidar and greatly reducing costs.
Specifically, the use of AI enables the expansion of the relative navigation
solution towards multiple classes of scenarios, e.g., in terms of targets or
illumination conditions, which would otherwise have to be crafted on a
case-by-case manner using classical image processing methods. Multiple
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone architectures are benchmarked on

Station (ISS), achieving position and attitude estimates close to 1%
range-normalised and 1 deg, respectively. The integration of the solution with
a physical prototype of the refuelling mechanism is validated in laboratory

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic
control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The
controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance
matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the
orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector
$\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at
time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem
formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an
infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic
control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a
simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural
network technology. For test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate
to within a fraction of one percent, and is computationally feasible in
dimensions up to at least $d=30$.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents
(CAs), especially in high-stakes domains, raises many privacy concerns.
Building ethical LLM-based CAs that respect user privacy requires an in-depth
understanding of the privacy risks that concern users the most. However,
existing research, primarily model-centered, does not provide insight into
users' perspectives. To bridge this gap, we analyzed sensitive disclosures in
real-world ChatGPT conversations and conducted semi-structured interviews with
19 LLM-based CA users. We found that users are constantly faced with trade-offs
between privacy, utility, and convenience when using LLM-based CAs. However,
users' erroneous mental models and the dark patterns in system design limited
their awareness and comprehension of the privacy risks. Additionally, the
human-like interactions encouraged more sensitive disclosures, which
complicated users' ability to navigate the trade-offs. We discuss practical
design guidelines and the needs for paradigmatic shifts to protect the privacy
of LLM-based CA users.

<p class="mathjax">Cloth manipulation is a category of deformable object manipulation of great
interest to the robotics community, from applications of automated
laundry-folding and home organizing and cleaning to textiles and flexible
manufacturing. Despite the desire for automated cloth manipulation, the
thin-shell dynamics and under-actuation nature of cloth present significant
challenges for robots to effectively interact with them. Many recent works omit
explicit modeling in favor of learning-based methods that may yield control
policies directly. However, these methods require large training sets that must
be collected and curated. In this regard, we create a framework for
differentiable modeling of cloth dynamics leveraging an Extended Position-based
Dynamics (XPBD) algorithm. Together with the desired control objective,
physics-aware regularization terms are designed for better results, including
trajectory smoothness and elastic potential energy. In addition, safety
constraints, such as avoiding obstacles, can be specified using signed distance
functions (SDFs). We formulate the cloth manipulation task with safety
constraints as a constrained optimization problem, which can be effectively
solved by mainstream gradient-based optimizers thanks to the end-to-end
differentiability of our framework. Finally, we assess the proposed framework
for manipulation tasks with various safety thresholds and demonstrate the
feasibility of result trajectories on a surgical robot. The effects of the
regularization terms are analyzed in an additional ablation study.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate deformable object manipulation (DOM) is essential for achieving
autonomy in robotic surgery, where soft tissues are being displaced, stretched,
and dissected. Many DOM methods can be powered by simulation, which ensures
realistic deformation by adhering to the governing physical constraints and
allowing for model prediction and control. However, real soft objects in
robotic surgery, such as membranes and soft tissues, have complex, anisotropic
physical parameters that a simulation with simple initialization from cameras
may not fully capture. To use the simulation techniques in real surgical tasks,
the "real-to-sim" gap needs to be properly compensated. In this work, we
propose an online, adaptive parameter tuning approach for simulation
optimization that (1) bridges the real-to-sim gap between a physics simulation
and observations obtained 3D perceptions through estimating a residual mapping
and (2) optimizes its stiffness parameters online. Our method ensures a small
residual gap between the simulation and observation and improves the
simulation's predictive capabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed
mechanism is evaluated in the manipulation of both a thin-shell and volumetric
tissue, representative of most tissue scenarios. This work contributes to the
advancement of simulation-based deformable tissue manipulation and holds
potential for improving surgical autonomy.

<p class="mathjax">We demonstrate the first algorithms for the problem of regression for
generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.
<br />We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.
<br />This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and
gave algorithms under restrictive assumptions.

<p class="mathjax">We study neural image compression based on the Sparse Visual Representation
(SVR), where images are embedded into a discrete latent space spanned by
learned visual codebooks. By sharing codebooks with the decoder, the encoder
transfers integer codeword indices that are efficient and cross-platform
robust, and the decoder retrieves the embedded latent feature using the indices
for reconstruction. Previous SVR-based compression lacks effective mechanism
for rate-distortion tradeoffs, where one can only pursue either high
reconstruction quality or low transmission bitrate. We propose a Masked
Adaptive Codebook learning (M-AdaCode) method that applies masks to the latent
feature subspace to balance bitrate and reconstruction quality. A set of
semantic-class-dependent basis codebooks are learned, which are weighted
combined to generate a rich latent feature for high-quality reconstruction. The
combining weights are adaptively derived from each input image, providing
fidelity information with additional transmission costs. By masking out
unimportant weights in the encoder and recovering them in the decoder, we can
trade off reconstruction quality for transmission bits, and the masking rate
controls the balance between bitrate and distortion. Experiments over the
standard JPEG-AI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our M-AdaCode
approach.

<p class="mathjax">Measuring presence is critical to improving user involvement and performance
in Mixed Reality (MR). \emph{Presence}, a crucial aspect of MR, is
traditionally gauged using subjective questionnaires, leading to a lack of
time-varying responses and susceptibility to user bias. Inspired by the
existing literature on the relationship between presence and human performance,
the proposed methodology systematically measures a user's reaction time to a
visual stimulus as they interact within a manipulated MR environment. We
explore the user reaction time as a quantity that can be easily measured using
the systemic tools available in modern MR devices. We conducted an exploratory
study (N=40) with two experiments designed to alter the users' sense of
presence by manipulating \emph{place illusion} and \emph{plausibility
illusion}. We found a significant correlation between presence scores and
reaction times with a correlation coefficient -0.65, suggesting that users with
a higher sense of presence responded more swiftly to stimuli. We develop a
model that estimates a user's presence level using the reaction time values
with high accuracy of up to 80\%. While our study suggests that reaction time
can be used as a measure of presence, further investigation is needed to
improve the accuracy of the model.

<p class="mathjax">Factorized Databases (FDBs) and the recently introduced Path Multiset
Representations (PMRs) both aim at compactly representing results of database
queries, and are quite different at first sight. FDBs were developed for the
relational database model and represent finite sets of tuples, all of which
have the same length. PMRs, on the other hand, were developed for the graph
database model and represent possibly infinite multisets of variable-length
paths. In this paper, we connect both representations to a common framework
that is rooted in formal language theory. In particular, we show why FDBs are a
special case of context-free grammars, which allows us to generalize FDBs
beyond the standard setting of database relations. Taking into account that
PMRs and finite automata are closely connected, this opens up a wide range of
questions about tradeoffs between their respective size and the efficiency of
query-plan operations on automata/grammar based representations. As a first
step, we present here first results on size trade-offs between fundamental
variants of automata-based and grammar-based compact representations.

<p class="mathjax">As 3D human pose estimation can now be achieved with very high accuracy in
the supervised learning scenario, tackling the case where 3D pose annotations
are not available has received increasing attention. In particular, several
methods have proposed to learn image representations in a self-supervised
fashion so as to disentangle the appearance information from the pose one. The
methods then only need a small amount of supervised data to train a pose
regressor using the pose-related latent vector as input, as it should be free
of appearance information. In this paper, we carry out in-depth analysis to
understand to what degree the state-of-the-art disentangled representation
learning methods truly separate the appearance information from the pose one.
First, we study disentanglement from the perspective of the self-supervised
network, via diverse image synthesis experiments. Second, we investigate
disentanglement with respect to the 3D pose regressor following an adversarial
attack perspective. Specifically, we design an adversarial strategy focusing on
generating natural appearance changes of the subject, and against which we
could expect a disentangled network to be robust. Altogether, our analyses show
that disentanglement in the three state-of-the-art disentangled representation
learning frameworks if far from complete, and that their pose codes contain
significant appearance information. We believe that our approach provides a
valuable testbed to evaluate the degree of disentanglement of pose from
appearance in self-supervised 3D human pose estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Resolving semantic ambiguity has long been recognised as a central challenge
in the field of machine translation. Recent work on benchmarking translation
performance on ambiguous sentences has exposed the limitations of conventional
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, which fail to capture many of these
cases. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative,
demonstrating comparable performance to traditional NMT models while
introducing new paradigms for controlling the target outputs. In this paper, we
study the capabilities of LLMs to translate ambiguous sentences containing
polysemous words and rare word senses. We also propose two ways to improve the
handling of such ambiguity through in-context learning and fine-tuning on
carefully curated ambiguous datasets. Experiments show that our methods can
match or outperform state-of-the-art systems such as DeepL and NLLB in four out
of five language directions. Our research provides valuable insights into
effectively adapting LLMs for disambiguation during machine translation.

<p class="mathjax">Datasets that pair Knowledge Graphs (KG) and text together (KG-T) can be used
to train forward and reverse neural models that generate text from KG and vice
versa. However models trained on datasets where KG and text pairs are not
equivalent can suffer from more hallucination and poorer recall. In this paper,
we verify this empirically by generating datasets with different levels of
noise and find that noisier datasets do indeed lead to more hallucination. We
argue that the ability of forward and reverse models trained on a dataset to
cyclically regenerate source KG or text is a proxy for the equivalence between
the KG and the text in the dataset. Using cyclic evaluation we find that
manually created WebNLG is much better than automatically created TeKGen and
T-REx. Guided by these observations, we construct a new, improved dataset
called LAGRANGE using heuristics meant to improve equivalence between KG and
text and show the impact of each of the heuristics on cyclic evaluation. We
also construct two synthetic datasets using large language models (LLMs), and
observe that these are conducive to models that perform significantly well on
cyclic generation of text, but less so on cyclic generation of KGs, probably
because of a lack of a consistent underlying ontology.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the effect of popularity degradation bias in the
context of local music recommendations. Specifically, we examine how accurate
two top-performing recommendation algorithms, Weight Relevance Matrix
Factorization (WRMF) and Multinomial Variational Autoencoder (Mult-VAE), are at
recommending artists as a function of artist popularity. We find that both
algorithms improve recommendation performance for more popular artists and, as
such, exhibit popularity degradation bias. While both algorithms produce a
similar level of performance for more popular artists, Mult-VAE shows better
relative performance for less popular artists. This suggests that this
algorithm should be preferred for local (long-tail) music artist
recommendation.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, we explore the efficacy and potential of Generative AI
models, specifically focusing on their application in role-playing simulations
exemplified through Spyfall, a renowned mafia-style game. By leveraging GPT-4's
advanced capabilities, the study aimed to showcase the model's potential in
understanding, decision-making, and interaction during game scenarios.
Comparative analyses between GPT-4 and its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo,
demonstrated GPT-4's enhanced adaptability to the game environment, with
significant improvements in posing relevant questions and forming human-like
responses. However, challenges such as the model;s limitations in bluffing and
predicting opponent moves emerged. Reflections on game development, financial
constraints, and non-verbal limitations of the study were also discussed. The
findings suggest that while GPT-4 exhibits promising advancements over earlier
models, there remains potential for further development, especially in
instilling more human-like attributes in AI.

<p class="mathjax">Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements
in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the
translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B
parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder
translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation
capabilities of these moderate LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this
study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically
designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant
parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our
approach consists of two fine-tuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual
data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel
data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as Advanced Language
Model-based trAnslator (ALMA). Based on LLaMA-2 as our underlying model, our
results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12
BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation
directions from the WMT'21 (2 directions) and WMT'22 (8 directions) test
datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even
superior to the NLLB-54B model and GPT-3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or
13B parameters. This method establishes the foundation for a novel training
paradigm in machine translation.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) addresses the need to create models based on
proprietary data in such a way that multiple clients retain exclusive control
over their data, while all benefit from improved model accuracy due to pooled
resources. Recently proposed Neural Graphical Models (NGMs) are Probabilistic
Graphical models that utilize the expressive power of neural networks to learn
complex non-linear dependencies between the input features. They learn to
capture the underlying data distribution and have efficient algorithms for
inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM
model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while
keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs,
avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like
Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our
global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where
clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global
distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global
NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM
is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited
communication bandwidth.

<p class="mathjax">Little research has investigated the design of conversational styles of voice
assistants (VA) for adults in their later adulthood with varying personalities.
In this Wizard of Oz experiment, 34 middle-aged (50 to 64 years old) and 24
older adults (65 to 80 years old) participated in a user study at a simulated
home, interacting with a VA using either formal or informal language. Older
adults with higher agreeableness perceived VA as being more likeable than
middle-aged adults. Middle-aged adults showed similar technology acceptance
toward the informal and formal VA, and older adults preferred using informal
VA, especially those with low agreeableness. Further, while both middle-aged
and older adults frequently anthropomorphized VAs by using human metaphors for
them, older adults compared formal VA with professionals (e.g., librarians,
teachers) and informal VA with their close ones (e.g., spouses, relatives).
Overall, the conversational style showed differential effects on the
perceptions of middle-aged and older adults, suggesting personalized design
implications.

<p class="mathjax">While training fair machine learning models has been studied extensively in
recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual screening of large compound libraries to identify potential hit
candidates is one of the earliest steps in drug discovery. As the size of
commercially available compound collections grows exponentially to the scale of
billions, brute-force virtual screening using traditional tools such as docking
becomes infeasible in terms of time and computational resources. Active
learning and Bayesian optimization has recently been proven as effective
methods of narrowing down the search space. An essential component in those
methods is a surrogate machine learning model that is trained with a small
subset of the library to predict the desired properties of compounds. Accurate
model can achieve high sample efficiency by finding the most promising
compounds with only a fraction of the whole library being virtually screened.
In this study, we examined the performance of pretrained transformer-based
language model and graph neural network in Bayesian optimization active
learning framework. The best pretrained models identifies 58.97% of the
top-50000 by docking score after screening only 0.6% of an ultra-large library
containing 99.5 million compounds, improving 8% over previous state-of-the-art
baseline. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that the superior performance
of pretrained models persists in both structure-based and ligand-based drug
discovery. Such model can serve as a boost to the accuracy and sample
efficiency of active learning based molecule virtual screening.

<p class="mathjax">While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in question-answering tasks, their performance is limited when the questions
require knowledge that is not included in the model's training data and can
only be acquired through direct observation or interaction with the real world.
Existing methods decompose reasoning tasks through the use of modules invoked
sequentially, limiting their ability to answer deep reasoning tasks. We
introduce a method, Recursion based extensible LLM (REBEL), which handles
open-world, deep reasoning tasks by employing automated reasoning techniques
like dynamic planning and forward-chaining strategies. REBEL allows LLMs to
reason via recursive problem decomposition and utilization of external tools.
The tools that REBEL uses are specified only by natural language description.
We further demonstrate REBEL capabilities on a set of problems that require a
deeply nested use of external tools in a compositional and conversational

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the problem of task-oriented grasp synthesis from
partial point cloud data using an eye-in-hand camera configuration. In
task-oriented grasp synthesis, a grasp has to be selected so that the object is
not lost during manipulation, and it is also ensured that adequate force/moment
can be applied to perform the task. We formalize the notion of a gross
manipulation task as a constant screw motion (or a sequence of constant screw
motions) to be applied to the object after grasping. Using this notion of task,
and a corresponding grasp quality metric developed in our prior work, we use a
neural network to approximate a function for predicting the grasp quality
metric on a cuboid shape. We show that by using a bounding box obtained from
the partial point cloud of an object, and the grasp quality metric mentioned
above, we can generate a good grasping region on the bounding box that can be
used to compute an antipodal grasp on the actual object. Our algorithm does not
use any manually labeled data or grasping simulator, thus making it very
efficient to implement and integrate with screw linear interpolation-based
motion planners. We present simulation as well as experimental results that
show the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">This paper plans to develop an Equitable and Responsible AI framework with
enabling techniques and algorithms for the Internet of Energy (IoE), in short,
RAI4IoE. The energy sector is going through substantial changes fueled by two
key drivers: building a zero-carbon energy sector and the digital
transformation of the energy infrastructure. We expect to see the convergence
of these two drivers resulting in the IoE, where renewable distributed energy
resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and
photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy
distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This
allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive
economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable
challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access,
privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at
the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not
only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly
sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled
responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions,
optimization and prioritization services, and automated management of flexible
resources. The vision of our project is to ensure equitable participation of
the community members and responsible use of their data in IoE so that it could
reap the benefits of advances in AI to provide safe, reliable and sustainable
energy services.

<p class="mathjax">News Discourse Profiling seeks to scrutinize the event-related role of each
sentence in a news article and has been proven useful across various downstream
applications. Specifically, within the context of a given news discourse, each
sentence is assigned to a pre-defined category contingent upon its depiction of
the news event structure. However, existing approaches suffer from an
inadequacy of available human-annotated data, due to the laborious and
time-intensive nature of generating discourse-level annotations. In this paper,
we present a novel approach, denoted as Intra-document Contrastive Learning
with Distillation (ICLD), for addressing the news discourse profiling task,
capitalizing on its unique structural characteristics. Notably, we are the
first to apply a semi-supervised methodology within this task paradigm, and
evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the presented approach.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses the problem of online exploration and visual sensor
coverage of unknown environments. We introduce a novel perception roadmap we
refer to as the Active Perception Network (APN) that serves as a hierarchical
topological graph describing how to traverse and perceive an incrementally
built spatial map of the environment. The APN state is incrementally updated to
expand a connected configuration space that extends throughout as much of the
known space as possible, using efficient difference-awareness techniques that
track the discrete changes of the spatial map to inform the updates. A
frontier-guided approach is presented for efficient evaluation of information
gain and covisible information, which guides view sampling and refinement to
ensure maximum coverage of the unmapped space is maintained within the APN. The
updated roadmap is hierarchically decomposed into subgraph regions which we use
to facilitate a non-myopic global view sequence planner. A comparative analysis
to several state-of-the-art approaches was conducted, showing significant
performance improvements in terms of total exploration time and surface
coverage, and demonstrating high computational efficiency that is scalable to
large and complex environments.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT3.5, have exhibited remarkable
proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language. However, their
unpersonalized generation paradigm may result in suboptimal user-specific
outcomes. Typically, users converse differently based on their knowledge and
preferences. This necessitates the task of enhancing user-oriented LLM which
remains unexplored. While one can fully train an LLM for this objective, the
resource consumption is unaffordable. Prior research has explored memory-based
methods to store and retrieve knowledge to enhance generation without
retraining for new queries. However, we contend that a mere memory module is
inadequate to comprehend a user's preference, and fully training an LLM can be
excessively costly. In this study, we propose a novel computational bionic
memory mechanism, equipped with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning schema, to
personalize LLMs. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. To encourage further
research into this area, we are releasing a new conversation dataset generated
entirely by LLM based on an open-source medical corpus, as well as our
implementation code.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a powerful tool for implicit scene
representations, allowing for differentiable rendering and the ability to make
predictions about previously unseen viewpoints. From a robotics perspective,
there has been growing interest in object and scene-based localisation using
NeRFs, with a number of recent works relying on sampling-based or Monte-Carlo
localisation schemes. Unfortunately, these can be extremely computationally
expensive, requiring multiple network forward passes to infer camera or object
pose. To alleviate this, a variety of sampling strategies have been applied,
many relying on keypoint recognition techniques from classical computer vision.
This work conducts a systematic empirical comparison of these approaches and
shows that in contrast to conventional feature matching approaches for
geometry-based localisation, sampling-based localisation using NeRFs benefits
significantly from stable features. Results show that rendering stable features
can result in a tenfold reduction in the number of forward passes required, a
significant speed improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing works on federated bandits take it for granted that all clients
are altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good
whenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance
and communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and
oftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over
self-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit
benefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect
the learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit
learning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this
under-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized
communication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate
clients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we
instantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose
the first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that
achieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost
guarantees. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across
various environments.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial to modern deep learning
applications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not
be tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have
made significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn
from static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to
real-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID
and OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in
real-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to
these dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we
propose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive
out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD
detection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving
distribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address
CAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt
diagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the
training process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance
over shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few
adaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the
effectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and
OOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims at identifying the contours
of primary foreground objects in videos without any prior knowledge. However,
previous methods do not fully use spatial-temporal context and fail to tackle
this challenging task in real-time. This motivates us to develop an efficient
Long-Short Temporal Attention network (termed LSTA) for unsupervised VOS task
from a holistic view. Specifically, LSTA consists of two dominant modules,
i.e., Long Temporal Memory and Short Temporal Attention. The former captures
the long-term global pixel relations of the past frames and the current frame,
which models constantly present objects by encoding appearance pattern.
Meanwhile, the latter reveals the short-term local pixel relations of one
nearby frame and the current frame, which models moving objects by encoding
motion pattern. To speedup the inference, the efficient projection and the
locality-based sliding window are adopted to achieve nearly linear time
complexity for the two light modules, respectively. Extensive empirical studies
on several benchmarks have demonstrated promising performances of the proposed
method with high efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Referenceless metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) use pretrained vision--language
models to assess image descriptions directly without costly ground-truth
reference texts. Such methods can facilitate rapid progress, but only if they
truly align with human preference judgments. In this paper, we introduce
ContextRef, a benchmark for assessing referenceless metrics for such alignment.
ContextRef has two components: human ratings along a variety of established
quality dimensions, and ten diverse robustness checks designed to uncover
fundamental weaknesses. A crucial aspect of ContextRef is that images and
descriptions are presented in context, reflecting prior work showing that
context is important for description quality. Using ContextRef, we assess a
variety of pretrained models, scoring functions, and techniques for
incorporating context. None of the methods is successful with ContextRef, but
we show that careful fine-tuning yields substantial improvements. ContextRef
remains a challenging benchmark though, in large part due to the challenge of
context dependence.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an effective approach to handle the
lack of annotations in the target domain for the semantic segmentation task. In
this work, we consider a more practical UDA setting where the target domain
contains sequential frames of the unlabeled videos which are easy to collect in
practice. A recent study suggests self-supervised learning of the object motion
from unlabeled videos with geometric constraints. We design a motion-guided
domain adaptive semantic segmentation framework (MoDA), that utilizes
self-supervised object motion to learn effective representations in the target
domain. MoDA differs from previous methods that use temporal consistency
regularization for the target domain frames. Instead, MoDA deals separately
with the domain alignment on the foreground and background categories using
different strategies. Specifically, MoDA contains foreground object discovery
and foreground semantic mining to align the foreground domain gaps by taking
the instance-level guidance from the object motion. Additionally, MoDA includes
background adversarial training which contains a background category-specific
discriminator to handle the background domain gaps. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of MoDA against existing
approaches in the domain adaptive image segmentation and domain adaptive video
segmentation. Moreover, MoDA is versatile and can be used in conjunction with
existing state-of-the-art approaches to further improve performance.

<p class="mathjax">The fine-grained medical action analysis task has received considerable
attention from pattern recognition communities recently, but it faces the
problems of data and algorithm shortage. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is
an essential skill in emergency treatment. Currently, the assessment of CPR
skills mainly depends on dummies and trainers, leading to high training costs
and low efficiency. For the first time, this paper constructs a vision-based
system to complete error action recognition and skill assessment in CPR.
Specifically, we define 13 types of single-error actions and 74 types of
composite error actions during external cardiac compression and then develop a
video dataset named CPR-Coach. By taking the CPR-Coach as a benchmark, this
paper thoroughly investigates and compares the performance of existing action
recognition models based on different data modalities. To solve the unavoidable
Single-class Training &amp; Multi-class Testing problem, we propose a
humancognition-inspired framework named ImagineNet to improve the model's
multierror recognition performance under restricted supervision. Extensive
experiments verify the effectiveness of the framework. We hope this work could
advance research toward fine-grained medical action analysis and skill
assessment. The CPR-Coach dataset and the code of ImagineNet are publicly
available on Github.

The only known attack, DETER (CCS'21), is manually discovered, and it remains
an open problem whether attacks other than DETER exist that disable the mempool
at an asymmetrically low cost.
<br />In this paper, we propose automatic exploit generation techniques to discover

pattern beyond DETER. By further leveraging attack synthesis techniques, we
generate exploits from the patterns to adaptively bypass defenses adopted in

the existing DETER attacks, they are vulnerable to the newly discovered attacks
that achieve high success rates (88% - 96%) and low costs (as low as zero

participants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,
participants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the
global model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their
individual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully
unless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data
quality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative
contributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive
mechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable
cooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we
introduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ
game-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by
utilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated
learning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism
becoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a
relaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false
data for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive
because it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,
which is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an
efficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only
aggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.
Extensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can
incentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it
reduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.

<p class="mathjax">The strategy for selecting candidate sets -- the set of items that the
recommendation system is expected to rank for each user -- is an important
decision in carrying out an offline top-$N$ recommender system evaluation. The
set of candidates is composed of the union of the user's test items and an
arbitrary number of non-relevant items that we refer to as decoys. Previous
studies have aimed to understand the effect of different candidate set sizes
and selection strategies on evaluation. In this paper, we extend this knowledge
by studying the specific interaction of candidate set selection strategies with
popularity bias, and use simulation to assess whether sampled candidate sets
result in metric estimates that are less biased with respect to the true metric

<p class="mathjax">Prosodic phrasing is crucial to the naturalness and intelligibility of
end-to-end Text-to-Speech (TTS). There exist both linguistic and emotional
prosody in natural speech. As the study of prosodic phrasing has been
linguistically motivated, prosodic phrasing for expressive emotion rendering
has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware prosodic
phrasing model, termed \textit{EmoPP}, to mine the emotional cues of utterance
accurately and predict appropriate phrase breaks. We first conduct objective
observations on the ESD dataset to validate the strong correlation between
emotion and prosodic phrasing. Then the objective and subjective evaluations
show that the EmoPP outperforms all baselines and achieves remarkable
performance in terms of emotion expressiveness. The audio samples and the code

<p class="mathjax">Text-based speech editing (TSE) techniques are designed to enable users to
edit the output audio by modifying the input text transcript instead of the
audio itself. Despite much progress in neural network-based TSE techniques, the
current techniques have focused on reducing the difference between the
generated speech segment and the reference target in the editing region,
ignoring its local and global fluency in the context and original utterance. To
maintain the speech fluency, we propose a fluency speech editing model, termed
\textit{FluentEditor}, by considering fluency-aware training criterion in the
TSE training. Specifically, the \textit{acoustic consistency constraint} aims
to smooth the transition between the edited region and its neighboring acoustic
segments consistent with the ground truth, while the \textit{prosody
consistency constraint} seeks to ensure that the prosody attributes within the
edited regions remain consistent with the overall style of the original
utterance. The subjective and objective experimental results on VCTK
demonstrate that our \textit{FluentEditor} outperforms all advanced baselines

<p class="mathjax">Programmers and researchers are increasingly developing surrogates of
programs, models of a subset of the observable behavior of a given program, to
solve a variety of software development challenges. Programmers train
surrogates from measurements of the behavior of a program on a dataset of input
examples. A key challenge of surrogate construction is determining what
training data to use to train a surrogate of a given program.
<br />We present a methodology for sampling datasets to train neural-network-based
surrogates of programs. We first characterize the proportion of data to sample
from each region of a program's input space (corresponding to different
execution paths of the program) based on the complexity of learning a surrogate
of the corresponding execution path. We next provide a program analysis to
determine the complexity of different paths in a program. We evaluate these
results on a range of real-world programs, demonstrating that complexity-guided
sampling results in empirical improvements in accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Robot person following (RPF) is a crucial capability in human-robot
interaction (HRI) applications, allowing a robot to persistently follow a
designated person. In practical RPF scenarios, the person often be occluded by
other objects or people. Consequently, it is necessary to re-identify the
person when he/she re-appears within the robot's field of view. Previous person
re-identification (ReID) approaches to person following rely on offline-trained
features and short-term experiences. Such an approach i) has a limited capacity
to generalize across scenarios; and ii) often fails to re-identify the person
when his re-appearance is out of the learned domain represented by the
short-term experiences. Based on this observation, in this work, we propose a
ReID framework for RPF that leverages long-term experiences. The experiences
are maintained by a loss-guided keyframe selection strategy, to enable online
continual learning of the appearance model. Our experiments demonstrate that
even in the presence of severe appearance changes and distractions from
visually similar people, the proposed method can still re-identify the person
more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Precision motion stages play a critical role in various manufacturing and
inspection equipment, for example, the wafer/reticle scanning in
photolithography scanners and positioning stages in wafer inspection systems.
To meet the growing demand for higher throughput in chip manufacturing and
inspection, it is critical to create new precision motion stages with higher
acceleration capability with high control bandwidth, which calls for the
development of lightweight precision stages. However, in today's precision
motion systems, only the rigid body motion of the system are under control, and
the flexible dynamic systems are in open loop. For these systems, the motion
control bandwidth is limited by the first structural resonance frequency of the
stage, which enforces a fundamental trade-off between the stage's bandwidth and
acceleration capability. Aiming to overcome this trade-off, we have introduced
a sequential structure and control design framework for lightweight stages with
the low-frequency flexible modes of the stage are under active control. To
facilitate the controller design, we further propose to minimize the resonance
frequency of the stage's mode being controlled and to maximize the resonance
frequency of the uncontrolled mode. The system's control bandwidth is placed in
between the resonance frequencies. This paper presents the design,
optimization, building, and experimental evaluations for a lightweight
magnetically levitated planar stage, which we call FleXstage, with first
flexible mode actively controlled via over-actuation. Simulations show the
proposed design is highly promising in enabling stages with lightweight without
sacrificing control bandwidth. We have some preliminary results now and are
still working on the experimental evaluations for the closed-loop system, and
will present the results in the oral presentation.

<p class="mathjax">The recommendation of appropriate development pathways, also known as
ecological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals
(namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for
promoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a
specific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully
consider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic
characteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of
computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity
related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,
which limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development
patterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called
User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the
high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue
of spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we
construct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures
the preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target
regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical
interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,
KGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a
maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.

protection issue of implicit 3D models. The algorithm involves embedding
watermarks into the images in the training set through an embedding network,
and subsequently utilizing the NeRF model for 3D modeling. A copyright verifier
is employed to generate a backdoor image by providing a secret perspective as
input to the neural radiation field. Subsequently, a watermark extractor is
devised using the hyperparameterization method of the neural network to extract
the embedded watermark image from that perspective. In a black box scenario, if
there is a suspicion that the 3D model has been used without authorization, the
verifier can extract watermarks from a secret perspective to verify network
copyright. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
effectively safeguards the copyright of 3D models. Furthermore, the extracted

<p class="mathjax">This study considers a UAV-assisted multi-user massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-mMIMO) systems, where a decode-and-forward (DF) relay in
the form of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) facilitates the transmission of
multiple data streams from a base station (BS) to multiple Internet-of-Things
(IoT) users. A joint optimization problem of hybrid beamforming (HBF), UAV
relay positioning, and power allocation (PA) to multiple IoT users to maximize
the total achievable rate (AR) is investigated. The study adopts a
geometry-based millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel model for both links and
proposes three different swarm intelligence (SI)-based algorithmic solutions to
optimize: 1) UAV location with equal PA; 2) PA with fixed UAV location; and 3)
joint PA with UAV deployment. The radio frequency (RF) stages are designed to
reduce the number of RF chains based on the slow time-varying angular
information, while the baseband (BB) stages are designed using the
reduced-dimension effective channel matrices. Then, a novel deep learning
(DL)-based low-complexity joint hybrid beamforming, UAV location and power
allocation optimization scheme (J-HBF-DLLPA) is proposed via fully-connected
deep neural network (DNN), consisting of an offline training phase, and an
online prediction of UAV location and optimal power values for maximizing the
AR. The illustrative results show that the proposed algorithmic solutions can
attain higher capacity and reduce average delay for delay-constrained
transmissions in a UAV-assisted MU-mMIMO IoT systems. Additionally, the
proposed J-HBF-DLLPA can closely approach the optimal capacity while
significantly reducing the runtime by 99%, which makes the DL-based solution a
promising implementation for real-time online applications in UAV-assisted
MU-mMIMO IoT systems.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate text and other
modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in
various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness
problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks
by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial
robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its
multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of
commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,
the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image
descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We
show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%
attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against
ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face
detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to
evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also
vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of
MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique for learning from trial and
error, but it often requires a large number of interactions to achieve good
performance. In some domains, such as sparse-reward tasks, an oracle that can
provide useful feedback or guidance to the agent during the learning process is
really of great importance. However, querying the oracle too frequently may be
costly or impractical, and the oracle may not always have a clear answer for
every situation. Therefore, we propose a novel method for interacting with the
oracle in a selective and efficient way, using a retrieval-based approach. We
assume that the interaction can be modeled as a sequence of templated questions
and answers, and that there is a large corpus of previous interactions
available. We use a neural network to encode the current state of the agent and
the oracle, and retrieve the most relevant question from the corpus to ask the
oracle. We then use the oracle's answer to update the agent's policy and value
function. We evaluate our method on an object manipulation task. We show that
our method can significantly improve the efficiency of RL by reducing the
number of interactions needed to reach a certain level of performance, compared
to baselines that do not use the oracle or use it in a naive way.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development of online static map element (a.k.a. HD Map)
construction algorithms has raised a vast demand for data with ground truth
annotations. However, available public datasets currently cannot provide
high-quality training data regarding consistency and accuracy. To this end, we
present CAMA: a vision-centric approach for Consistent and Accurate Map
Annotation. Without LiDAR inputs, our proposed framework can still generate
high-quality 3D annotations of static map elements. Specifically, the
annotation can achieve high reprojection accuracy across all surrounding
cameras and is spatial-temporal consistent across the whole sequence. We apply
our proposed framework to the popular nuScenes dataset to provide efficient and
highly accurate annotations. Compared with the original nuScenes static map
element, models trained with annotations from CAMA achieve lower reprojection
errors (e.g., 4.73 vs. 8.03 pixels).

<p class="mathjax">Recently, multi-modality models have been introduced because of the
complementary information from different sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. It
requires paired data along with precise calibrations for all modalities, the
complicated calibration among modalities hugely increases the cost of
collecting such high-quality datasets, and hinder it from being applied to
practical scenarios. Inherit from the previous works, we not only fuse the
information from multi-modality without above issues, and also exhaust the
information in the RGB modality. We introduced the 2D Detection Annotations
Transmittable Aggregation(\textbf{2DDATA}), designing a data-specific branch,
called \textbf{Local Object Branch}, which aims to deal with points in a
certain bounding box, because of its easiness of acquiring 2D bounding box
annotations. We demonstrate that our simple design can transmit bounding box
prior information to the 3D encoder model, proving the feasibility of large
multi-modality models fused with modality-specific data.

<p class="mathjax">In the analysis of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images,
the operation of segmenting specific targets is necessary. Existing methods
typically train on supervised datasets with limited samples (approximately a
few hundred), which can lead to overfitting. To address this, the low-rank
adaptation technique is adopted for foundation model fine-tuning and proposed
corresponding prompt point generation strategies to process various
segmentation tasks on OCTA datasets. This method is named SAM-OCTA and has been
experimented on the publicly available OCTA-500 dataset. While achieving
state-of-the-art performance metrics, this method accomplishes local vessel
segmentation as well as effective artery-vein segmentation, which was not
well-solved in previous works. The code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">This paper explicitly models a coarse and noisy quantization in a
communication system empowered by orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) for
cost and power efficiency. We first point out, with coarse quantization, the
effective channel is imbalanced and thus no longer able to circularly shift the
transmitted symbols along the delay-Doppler domain. Meanwhile, the effective
channel is non-isotropic, which imposes a significant loss to symbol detection
algorithms like the original approximate message passing (AMP). Although the
algorithm of generalized expectation consistent for signal recovery (GEC-SR)
can mitigate this loss, the complexity in computation is prohibitively high,
mainly due to an dramatic increase in the matrix size of OTFS. In this context,
we propose a low-complexity algorithm that incorporates into the GEC-SR a quick
inversion of quasi-banded matrices, reducing the complexity from a cubic order
to a linear order while keeping the performance at the same level.

(LLMs) on private datasets. This scenario poses privacy risks, as LLMs may leak
or regurgitate the private examples demonstrated in the prompt. We propose a
novel algorithm that generates synthetic few-shot demonstrations from the

zero-shot solutions. Our results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel adversarial model for authentication systems that use gait
patterns recorded by the inertial measurement unit (IMU) built into
smartphones. The attack idea is inspired by and named after the concept of a
dictionary attack on knowledge (PIN or password) based authentication systems.
In particular, this work investigates whether it is possible to build a
dictionary of IMUGait patterns and use it to launch an attack or find an
imitator who can actively reproduce IMUGait patterns that match the target's
IMUGait pattern. Nine physically and demographically diverse individuals walked
at various levels of four predefined controllable and adaptable gait factors
(speed, step length, step width, and thigh-lift), producing 178 unique IMUGait
patterns. Each pattern attacked a wide variety of user authentication models.
The deeper analysis of error rates (before and after the attack) challenges the
belief that authentication systems based on IMUGait patterns are the most
difficult to spoof; further research is needed on adversarial models and
associated countermeasures.

<p class="mathjax">Existing NeRF models for satellite images suffer from slow speeds, mandatory
solar information as input, and limitations in handling large satellite images.
In response, we present SatensoRF, which significantly accelerates the entire
process while employing fewer parameters for satellite imagery of large size.
Besides, we observed that the prevalent assumption of Lambertian surfaces in
neural radiance fields falls short for vegetative and aquatic elements. In
contrast to the traditional hierarchical MLP-based scene representation, we
have chosen a multiscale tensor decomposition approach for color, volume
density, and auxiliary variables to model the lightfield with specular color.
Additionally, to rectify inconsistencies in multi-date imagery, we incorporate
total variation loss to restore the density tensor field and treat the problem
as a denosing task.To validate our approach, we conducted assessments of
SatensoRF using subsets from the spacenet multi-view dataset, which includes
both multi-date and single-date multi-view RGB images. Our results clearly
demonstrate that SatensoRF surpasses the state-of-the-art Sat-NeRF series in
terms of novel view synthesis performance. Significantly, SatensoRF requires
fewer parameters for training, resulting in faster training and inference
speeds and reduced computational demands.

business data, medical data, banking data etc. In this research, block chain
technology is built with encryption algorithm for high level data security in
cloud storage. Medical data security seems critical aspect due to sensitivity
of patient information. Unauthorized access of medical data creates major issue
to patients. This article proposed block chain with hybrid encryption technique
for securing medical data stored in block chain model at cloud storage. New Two
fish encryption model is implemented based on RSA Multiple Precision
Arithmetic. MPA works by using library concept. The objective of using this
methodology is to enhance security performance with less execution time.
Patient data is processed by encryption algorithm and stored at blockchain
infrastructure using encrypted key. Access permission allows user to read or
write the medical data attached in block chain framework. The performance of
traditional cryptographic techniques is very less in providing security

<p class="mathjax">Extreme head postures pose a common challenge across a spectrum of facial
analysis tasks, including face detection, facial landmark detection (FLD), and
head pose estimation (HPE). These tasks are interdependent, where accurate FLD
relies on robust face detection, and HPE is intricately associated with these
key points. This paper focuses on the integration of these tasks, particularly
when addressing the complexities posed by large-angle face poses. The primary
contribution of this study is the proposal of a real-time multi-task detection
system capable of simultaneously performing joint detection of faces, facial
landmarks, and head poses. This system builds upon the widely adopted YOLOv8
detection framework. It extends the original object detection head by
incorporating additional landmark regression head, enabling efficient
localization of crucial facial landmarks. Furthermore, we conduct optimizations
and enhancements on various modules within the original YOLOv8 framework. To
validate the effectiveness and real-time performance of our proposed model, we
conduct extensive experiments on 300W-LP and AFLW2000-3D datasets. The results
obtained verify the capability of our model to tackle large-angle face pose
challenges while delivering real-time performance across these interconnected
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained remarkable success, for which
contrastive learning (CL) plays a key role. However, the recent development of
new non-CL frameworks has achieved comparable or better performance with high
improvement potential, prompting researchers to enhance these frameworks
further. Assimilating CL into non-CL frameworks has been thought to be
beneficial, but empirical evidence indicates no visible improvements. In view
of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional
direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional
contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL
aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to
prior SSL frameworks. DimCL has been found to be effective, and the
hardness-aware property is identified as a critical reason for its success.
Extensive experimental results reveal that assimilating DimCL into SSL
frameworks leads to performance improvement by a non-trivial margin on various
datasets and backbone architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach to leverage
limited labeled data in various domains by bridging the gap between fully
supervised methods and unsupervised techniques. Acquisition of strong
annotations for detecting sound events is prohibitively expensive, making
weakly supervised learning a more cost-effective and broadly applicable
alternative. In order to enhance the recognition rate of the learning of
detection of weakly-supervised sound events, we introduce a Frame Pairwise
Distance (FPD) loss branch, complemented with a minimal amount of synthesized
data. The corresponding sampling and label processing strategies are also
proposed. Two distinct distance metrics are employed to evaluate the proposed
approach. Finally, the method is validated on the standard DCASE dataset. The
obtained experimental results corroborated the efficacy of this approach.

<p class="mathjax">The conventional solutions for fault-detection, identification, and
reconstruction (FDIR) require centralized decision-making mechanisms which are
typically combinatorial in their nature, necessitating the design of an
efficient distributed FDIR mechanism that is suitable for multi-agent
applications. To this end, we develop a general framework for efficiently
reconstructing a sparse vector being observed over a sensor network via
nonlinear measurements. The proposed framework is used to design a distributed
multi-agent FDIR algorithm based on a combination of the sequential convex
programming (SCP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
optimization approaches. The proposed distributed FDIR algorithm can process a
variety of inter-agent measurements (including distances, bearings, relative
velocities, and subtended angles between agents) to identify the faulty agents
and recover their true states. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed
multi-agent FDIR approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example in
which the inter-agent distances are used to identify the faulty agents in a
multi-agent configuration, as well as reconstruct their error vectors.

<p class="mathjax">Wikipedia articles are hierarchically organized through categories and lists,
providing one of the most comprehensive and universal taxonomy, but its open
creation is causing redundancies and inconsistencies. Assigning DBPedia classes
to Wikipedia categories and lists can alleviate the problem, realizing a large
knowledge graph which is essential for categorizing digital contents through
entity linking and typing. However, the existing approach of CaLiGraph is
producing incomplete and non-fine grained mappings. In this paper, we tackle
the problem as ontology alignment, where structural information of knowledge
graphs and lexical and semantic features of ontology class names are utilized
to discover confident mappings, which are in turn utilized for finetuing
pretrained language models in a distant supervision fashion. Our method SLHCat
consists of two main parts: 1) Automatically generating training data by
leveraging knowledge graph structure, semantic similarities, and named entity
typing. 2) Finetuning and prompt-tuning of the pre-trained language model BERT
are carried out over the training data, to capture semantic and syntactic
properties of class names. Our model SLHCat is evaluated over a benchmark
dataset constructed by annotating 3000 fine-grained CaLiGraph-DBpedia mapping
pairs. SLHCat is outperforming the baseline model by a large margin of 25% in
accuracy, offering a practical solution for large-scale ontology mapping.

<p class="mathjax">The study of complex networks has significantly advanced our understanding of
community structures which serves as a crucial feature of real-world graphs.
Detecting communities in graphs is a challenging problem with applications in
sociology, biology, and computer science. Despite the efforts of an
interdisciplinary community of scientists, a satisfactory solution to this
problem has not yet been achieved. This review article delves into the topic of
community detection in graphs, which serves as a crucial role in understanding
the organization and functioning of complex systems. We begin by introducing
the concept of community structure, which refers to the arrangement of vertices
into clusters, with strong internal connections and weaker connections between
clusters. Then, we provide a thorough exposition of various community detection
methods, including a new method designed by us. Additionally, we explore
real-world applications of community detection in diverse networks. In
conclusion, this comprehensive review provides a deep understanding of
community detection in graphs. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers
and practitioners in multiple disciplines, offering insights into the
challenges, methodologies, and applications of community detection in complex
networks.

<p class="mathjax">Lidars and cameras are critical sensors that provide complementary
information for 3D detection in autonomous driving. While most prevalent
methods progressively downscale the 3D point clouds and camera images and then
fuse the high-level features, the downscaled features inevitably lose low-level
detailed information. In this paper, we propose Fine-Grained Lidar-Camera
Fusion (FGFusion) that make full use of multi-scale features of image and point
cloud and fuse them in a fine-grained way. First, we design a dual pathway
hierarchy structure to extract both high-level semantic and low-level detailed
features of the image. Second, an auxiliary network is introduced to guide
point cloud features to better learn the fine-grained spatial information.
Finally, we propose multi-scale fusion (MSF) to fuse the last N feature maps of
image and point cloud. Extensive experiments on two popular autonomous driving
benchmarks, i.e. KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p class="mathjax">In today's rapidly evolving job market, finding the right opportunity can be
a daunting challenge. With advancements in the field of AI, computers can now
recommend suitable jobs to candidates. However, the task of recommending jobs
is not same as recommending movies to viewers. Apart from must-have criteria,
like skills and experience, there are many subtle aspects to a job which can
decide if it is a good fit or not for a given candidate. Traditional approaches
can capture the quantifiable aspects of jobs and candidates, but a substantial
portion of the data that is present in unstructured form in the job
descriptions and resumes is lost in the process of conversion to structured
format. As of late, Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken over the AI field
by storm with extraordinary performance in fields where text-based data is
available. Inspired by the superior performance of LLMs, we leverage their
capability to understand natural language for capturing the information that
was previously getting lost during the conversion of unstructured data to
structured form. To this end, we compare performance of four different
approaches for job recommendations namely, (i) Content based deterministic,
(ii) LLM guided, (iii) LLM unguided, and (iv) Hybrid. In this study, we present
advantages and limitations of each method and evaluate their performance in
terms of time requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Material Network (DMN) has recently emerged as a data-driven surrogate
model for heterogeneous materials. Given a particular microstructural
morphology, the effective linear and nonlinear behaviors can be successfully
approximated by such physics-based neural-network like architecture. In this
work, a novel parametric DMN architecture is proposed for multiscale materials
with a varying microstructure characterized by several parameters. A
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is used to account for the dependence of
DMN fitting parameters on the microstructural ones. Micromechanical constraints
are prescribed both on the network architecture and on the output of this PINN.
The proposed PINN-DMN architecture is also recast in a multiphysics setting,
where physical properties other than the mechanical ones can also be predicted.
In the numerical simulations conducted on three parametric microstructures,
PINN-DMN demonstrates satisfying interpolative and extrapolative generalization
capabilities when morphology varies. The effective multiphysics behaviors of
such parametric multiscale materials can thus be predicted and encoded by
PINN-DMN with high accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is used in clinical psychology for couples'
relationship therapy, but physical isolation can make the relationship more
strained and inaccessible to LKM. Virtual reality (VR) can provide immersive
LKM activities for long-distance couples. However, no suitable commercial VR
applications for couples exist to engage in LKM activities of long-distance.
This paper organized a series of workshops with couples to build a prototype of
a couple-preferred LKM app. Through analysis of participants' design works and
semi-structured interviews, we derived design considerations for such VR apps
and created a prototype for couples to experience. We conducted a study with
couples to understand their experiences of performing LKM using the VR
prototype and a traditional video conferencing tool. Results show that LKM
session utilizing both tools has a positive effect on the intimate relationship
and the VR prototype is a more preferable tool for long-term use. We believe
our experience can inform future researchers.

<p class="mathjax">Information inequalities appear in many database applications such as query
output size bounds, query containment, and implication between data
dependencies. Recently Khamis et al. proposed to study the algorithmic aspects
of information inequalities, including the information inequality problem:
decide whether a linear inequality over entropies of random variables is valid.
While the decidability of this problem is a major open question, applications
often involve only inequalities that adhere to specific syntactic forms linked
to useful semantic invariance properties. This paper studies the information
inequality problem in different syntactic and semantic scenarios that arise
from database applications. Focusing on the boundary between tractability and
intractability, we show that the information inequality problem is
coNP-complete if restricted to normal polymatroids, and in polynomial time if
relaxed to monotone functions. We also examine syntactic restrictions related
to query output size bounds, and provide an alternative proof, through monotone
functions, for the polynomial-time computability of the entropic bound over
simple sets of degree constraints.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new method for two-material Lagrangian hydrodynamics, which
combines the Shifted Interface Method (SIM) with a high-order Finite Element
Method. Our approach relies on an exact (or sharp) material interface
representation, that is, it uses the precise location of the material
interface. The interface is represented by the zero level-set of a continuous
high-order finite element function that moves with the material velocity. This
strategy allows to evolve curved material interfaces inside curved elements. By
reformulating the original interface problem over a surrogate (approximate)
interface, located in proximity of the true interface, the SIM avoids cut cells
and the associated problematic issues regarding implementation, numerical
stability, and matrix conditioning. Accuracy is maintained by modifying the
original interface conditions using Taylor expansions. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithms on established numerical benchmarks in
one, two and three dimensions.

The proposed prior not only enhances the representation of embedding vectors

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant priority in text
understanding and generation. However, LLMs suffer from the risk of generating
harmful contents especially while being employed to applications. There are
several black-box attack methods, such as Prompt Attack, which can change the
behaviour of LLMs and induce LLMs to generate unexpected answers with harmful
contents. Researchers are interested in Prompt Attack and Defense with LLMs,
while there is no publicly available dataset to evaluate the abilities of
defending prompt attack. In this paper, we introduce a Chinese Prompt Attack
Dataset for LLMs, called CPAD. Our prompts aim to induce LLMs to generate
unexpected outputs with several carefully designed prompt attack approaches and
widely concerned attacking contents. Different from previous datasets involving
safety estimation, We construct the prompts considering three dimensions:
contents, attacking methods and goals, thus the responses can be easily
evaluated and analysed. We run several well-known Chinese LLMs on our dataset,
and the results show that our prompts are significantly harmful to LLMs, with
around 70% attack success rate. We will release CPAD to encourage further
studies on prompt attack and defense.

<p class="mathjax">This PhD dissertation investigates garbage-free reversible computing systems
from abstract design to physical gate-level implementation. Designed in
reversible logic, we propose a ripple-block carry adder and work towards a
reversible circuit for general multiplication. At a higher-level, abstract
designs are proposed for reversible systems, such as a small von Neumann
architecture that can execute programs written in a simple reversible
two-address instruction set, a novel reversible arithmetic logic unit, and a
linear cosine transform. To aid the design of reversible logic circuits we have
designed two reversible functional hardware description languages: a
linear-typed higher-level language and a gate-level point-free combinator
language. We suggest a garbage-free design flow, where circuits are described
in the higher-level language and then translated to the combinator language,
from which methods to place-and-route of CMOS gates can be applied. We have
also made standard cell layouts of the reversible gates in complementary
pass-gate CMOS logic and used these to fabricate the ALU design. In total, this
dissertation has shown that it is possible to design non-trivial reversible
computing systems without garbage and that support from languages (computer
aided design) can make this process easier.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a pre-configured error pattern ordered statistics
decoding (PEPOSD) algorithm and discuss its application to short cyclic
redundancy check (CRC)-polar codes. Unlike the traditional OSD that changes the
most reliable independent symbols, we regard the decoding process as testing
the error patterns, like guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND). Also,
the pre-configurator referred from ordered reliability bits (ORB) GRAND can
better control the range and testing order of EPs. Offline-online structure can
accelerate the decoding process. Additionally, we also introduce two orders to
optimize the search order for testing EPs. Compared with CRC-aided OSD and list
decoding, PEPOSD can achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and
complexity.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT for document-grounded response generation in the context of
information-seeking dialogues. For evaluation, we use the MultiDoc2Dial corpus
of task-oriented dialogues in four social service domains previously used in
the DialDoc 2022 Shared Task. Information-seeking dialogue turns are grounded
in multiple documents providing relevant information. We generate dialogue
completion responses by prompting a ChatGPT model, using two methods:
Chat-Completion and LlamaIndex. ChatCompletion uses knowledge from ChatGPT
model pretraining while LlamaIndex also extracts relevant information from
documents. Observing that document-grounded response generation via LLMs cannot
be adequately assessed by automatic evaluation metrics as they are
significantly more verbose, we perform a human evaluation where annotators rate
the output of the shared task winning system, the two Chat-GPT variants
outputs, and human responses. While both ChatGPT variants are more likely to
include information not present in the relevant segments, possibly including a
presence of hallucinations, they are rated higher than both the shared task
winning system and human responses.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal unsupervised domain adaptation (MM-UDA) for 3D semantic
segmentation is a practical solution to embed semantic understanding in
autonomous systems without expensive point-wise annotations. While previous
MM-UDA methods can achieve overall improvement, they suffer from significant
class-imbalanced performance, restricting their adoption in real applications.
This imbalanced performance is mainly caused by: 1) self-training with
imbalanced data and 2) the lack of pixel-wise 2D supervision signals. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Prior Aided (MoPA) domain adaptation to improve
the performance of rare objects. Specifically, we develop Valid Ground-based
Insertion (VGI) to rectify the imbalance supervision signals by inserting prior
rare objects collected from the wild while avoiding introducing artificial
artifacts that lead to trivial solutions. Meanwhile, our SAM consistency loss
leverages the 2D prior semantic masks from SAM as pixel-wise supervision
signals to encourage consistent predictions for each object in the semantic
mask. The knowledge learned from modal-specific prior is then shared across
modalities to achieve better rare object segmentation. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging
MM-UDA benchmark. Code will be available at https://github.com/AronCao49/MoPA.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new generalization of the $k$-core decomposition for temporal
networks that respects temporal dynamics. In contrast to the standard
definition and previous core-like decompositions for temporal graphs, our
$(k,\Delta)$-core decomposition is an edge-based decomposition founded on the
new notion of $\Delta$-degree. The $\Delta$-degree of an edge is defined as the
minimum number of edges incident to one of its endpoints that have a temporal
distance of at most~$\Delta$. Moreover, we define a new notion of temporal
connectedness leading to an efficiently computable equivalence relation between
so-called $\Delta$-connected components of the temporal network. We provide
efficient algorithms for the $(k,\Delta)$-core decomposition and
$\Delta$-connectedness, and apply them to solve community search problems,
where we are given a query node and want to find a densely connected community
containing the query node. Such a community is an edge-induced temporal
subgraph representing densely connected groups of nodes with frequent
interactions, which also captures changes over time. We provide an efficient
algorithm for community search for the case without restricting the number of
nodes. If the number of nodes is restricted, we show that the decision version
is NP-complete. In our evaluation, we show how in a real-world social network,
the inner $(k,\Delta)$-cores contain only the spreading of misinformation and
that the $\Delta$-connected components of the cores are highly edge-homophilic,
i.e., the majorities of the edges in the $\Delta$-connected components
represent either misinformation or fact-checking. Moreover, we demonstrate how
our algorithms for $\Delta$-community search successfully and efficiently
identify informative structures in collaboration networks.

<p class="mathjax">Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher
requirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the
information of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.
We observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such
as the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data
is inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which
proceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information
is important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and
inter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature
independently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of
temporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this
motivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for
Acoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal
information via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a
temporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data
into multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the
temporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their
edges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in
intra-modal and inter-modal. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate
TMac outperforms other SOTA models in performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MGitHubL/TMac.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a new approach for high-quality multi-exposure
image fusion (MEF). We show that the fusion weights of an exposure can be
encoded into a 1D lookup table (LUT), which takes pixel intensity value as
input and produces fusion weight as output. We learn one 1D LUT for each
exposure, then all the pixels from different exposures can query 1D LUT of that
exposure independently for high-quality and efficient fusion. Specifically, to
learn these 1D LUTs, we involve attention mechanism in various dimensions
including frame, channel and spatial ones into the MEF task so as to bring us
significant quality improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA). In addition,
we collect a new MEF dataset consisting of 960 samples, 155 of which are
manually tuned by professionals as ground-truth for evaluation. Our network is
trained by this dataset in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed
components, and results show that our approach outperforms the SOTA in our and
another representative dataset SICE, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Moreover, our 1D LUT approach takes less than 4ms to run a 4K image on a PC
GPU. Given its high quality, efficiency and robustness, our method has been
shipped into millions of Android mobiles across multiple brands world-wide.

the teacher and the learner. With a shortage of human teachers, such a teaching
mode faces the challenge of scaling up. Robots, with their replicable nature
and physical capabilities, offer a solution. In this work, we present
TeachingBot, a robotic system designed for teaching handwriting to human
learners. We tackle two primary challenges in this teaching task: the
adaptation to each learner's unique style and the creation of an engaging
learning experience. TeachingBot captures the learner's style using a
probabilistic learning approach based on the learner's handwriting. Then, based
on the learned style, it provides physical guidance to human learners with
variable impedance to make the learning experience engaging. Results from
human-subject experiments based on 15 human subjects support the effectiveness
of TeachingBot, demonstrating improved human learning outcomes compared to
baseline methods. Additionally, we illustrate how TeachingBot customizes its
teaching approach for individual learners, leading to enhanced overall
engagement and effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores predicting suitable prosodic features for fine-grained
emotion analysis from the discourse-level text. To obtain fine-grained
emotional prosodic features as predictive values for our model, we extract a
phoneme-level Local Prosody Embedding sequence (LPEs) and a Global Style
Embedding as prosodic speech features from the speech with the help of a style
transfer model. We propose a Discourse-level Multi-scale text Prosodic Model
(D-MPM) that exploits multi-scale text to predict these two prosodic features.
The proposed model can be used to analyze better emotional prosodic features
and thus guide the speech synthesis model to synthesize more expressive speech.
To quantitatively evaluate the proposed model, we contribute a new and
large-scale Discourse-level Chinese Audiobook (DCA) dataset with more than
13,000 utterances annotated sequences to evaluate the proposed model.
Experimental results on the DCA dataset show that the multi-scale text
information effectively helps to predict prosodic features, and the
discourse-level text improves both the overall coherence and the user
experience. More interestingly, although we aim at the synthesis effect of the
style transfer model, the synthesized speech by the proposed text prosodic
analysis model is even better than the style transfer from the original speech
in some user evaluation indicators.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, end-to-end object detectors have gained significant attention from
the research community due to their outstanding performance. However, DETR
typically relies on supervised pretraining of the backbone on ImageNet, which
limits the practical application of DETR and the design of the backbone,
affecting the model's potential generalization ability. In this paper, we
propose a new training method called step-by-step training. Specifically, in
the first stage, the one-to-many pre-trained YOLO detector is used to
initialize the end-to-end detector. In the second stage, the backbone and
encoder are consistent with the DETR-like model, but only the detector needs to
be trained from scratch. Due to this training method, the object detector does
not need the additional dataset (ImageNet) to train the backbone, which makes
the design of the backbone more flexible and dramatically reduces the training
cost of the detector, which is helpful for the practical application of the
object detector. At the same time, compared with the DETR-like model, the
step-by-step training method can achieve higher accuracy than the traditional
training method of the DETR-like model. With the aid of this novel training
method, we propose a brand-new end-to-end real-time object detection model
called DEYOv3. DEYOv3-N achieves 41.1% on COCO val2017 and 270 FPS on T4 GPU,
while DEYOv3-L achieves 51.3% AP and 102 FPS. Without the use of additional
training data, DEYOv3 surpasses all existing real-time object detectors in
terms of both speed and accuracy. It is worth noting that for models of N, S,
and M scales, the training on the COCO dataset can be completed using a single
24GB RTX3090 GPU.

<p class="mathjax">We explore a knowledge sanitization approach to mitigate the privacy concerns
associated with large language models (LLMs). LLMs trained on a large corpus of
Web data can memorize and potentially reveal sensitive or confidential
information, raising critical security concerns. Our technique fine-tunes these
models, prompting them to generate harmless responses such as ``I don't know''
when queried about specific information. Experimental results in a closed-book
question-answering task show that our straightforward method not only minimizes
particular knowledge leakage but also preserves the overall performance of LLM.
These two advantages strengthen the defense against extraction attacks and
reduces the emission of harmful content such as hallucinations.

<p class="mathjax">Relation triple extraction (RTE) is an essential task in information
extraction and knowledge graph construction. Despite recent advancements,
existing methods still exhibit certain limitations. They just employ
generalized pre-trained models and do not consider the specificity of RTE
tasks. Moreover, existing tagging-based approaches typically decompose the RTE
task into two subtasks, initially identifying subjects and subsequently
identifying objects and relations. They solely focus on extracting relational
triples from subject to object, neglecting that once the extraction of a
subject fails, it fails in extracting all triples associated with that subject.
To address these issues, we propose BitCoin, an innovative Bidirectional
tagging and supervised Contrastive learning based joint relational triple
extraction framework. Specifically, we design a supervised contrastive learning
method that considers multiple positives per anchor rather than restricting it
to just one positive. Furthermore, a penalty term is introduced to prevent
excessive similarity between the subject and object. Our framework implements
taggers in two directions, enabling triples extraction from subject to object
and object to subject. Experimental results show that BitCoin achieves
state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets and significantly improves
the F1 score on Normal, SEO, EPO, and multiple relation extraction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, significant progress has been made in video instance
segmentation (VIS), with many offline and online methods achieving
state-of-the-art performance. While offline methods have the advantage of
producing temporally consistent predictions, they are not suitable for
real-time scenarios. Conversely, online methods are more practical, but
maintaining temporal consistency remains a challenging task. In this paper, we
propose a novel online method for video instance segmentation, called TCOVIS,
which fully exploits the temporal information in a video clip. The core of our
method consists of a global instance assignment strategy and a spatio-temporal
enhancement module, which improve the temporal consistency of the features from
two aspects. Specifically, we perform global optimal matching between the
predictions and ground truth across the whole video clip, and supervise the
model with the global optimal objective. We also capture the spatial feature
and aggregate it with the semantic feature between frames, thus realizing the
spatio-temporal enhancement. We evaluate our method on four widely adopted VIS
benchmarks, namely YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and OVIS, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks without bells-and-whistles. For
instance, on YouTube-VIS 2021, TCOVIS achieves 49.5 AP and 61.3 AP with
ResNet-50 and Swin-L backbones, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/jun-long-li/TCOVIS.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, linear computed tomography (LCT) systems have actively attracted
attention. To weaken projection truncation and image the region of interest
(ROI) for LCT, the backprojection filtration (BPF) algorithm is an effective
solution. However, in BPF for LCT, it is difficult to achieve stable interior
reconstruction, and for differentiated backprojection (DBP) images of LCT,
multiple rotation-finite inversion of Hilbert transform (Hilbert
filtering)-inverse rotation operations will blur the image. To satisfy multiple
reconstruction scenarios for LCT, including interior ROI, complete object, and
exterior region beyond field-of-view (FOV), and avoid the rotation operations
of Hilbert filtering, we propose two types of reconstruction architectures. The
first overlays multiple DBP images to obtain a complete DBP image, then uses a
network to learn the overlying Hilbert filtering function, referred to as the
Overlay-Single Network (OSNet). The second uses multiple networks to train
different directional Hilbert filtering models for DBP images of multiple
linear scannings, respectively, and then overlays the reconstructed results,
i.e., Multiple Networks Overlaying (MNetO). In two architectures, we introduce
a Swin Transformer (ST) block to the generator of pix2pixGAN to extract both
local and global features from DBP images at the same time. We investigate two
architectures from different networks, FOV sizes, pixel sizes, number of
projections, geometric magnification, and processing time. Experimental results
show that two architectures can both recover images. OSNet outperforms BPF in
various scenarios. For the different networks, ST-pix2pixGAN is superior to
pix2pixGAN and CycleGAN. MNetO exhibits a few artifacts due to the differences
among the multiple models, but any one of its models is suitable for imaging
the exterior edge in a certain direction.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud providers handle substantial number of requests to create and delete
virtual machines (VMs) on a daily basis, where the unknown sequence of requests
eventually leads to resource fragmentation. To mitigate this issue, periodic
consolidation of VMs into fewer number of physical hosts is an important
cost-saving procedure, closely related to the vector bin-packing problem. In
this paper, we propose the BalCon algorithm for consolidation that steadily
reduces the number of active hosts and keeps migration costs low. BalCon
classifies the cluster's state and selects one of three heuristics to balance
resources for superior consolidation. To evaluate BalCon's performance with
respect to optimality, we introduce integer programming models. BalCon finds
99.7% of the optimal solutions for over 750 problem instances. This outstanding
result was achieved due to the Force Step of our algorithm, which is the key
improvement detail for common heuristics. We compare BalCon with a modified
Sercon heuristic using Huawei and synthetic datasets with two resources for
allocation.

<p class="mathjax">Modern data-driven applications require that databases support fast
cross-model analytical queries. Achieving fast analytical queries in a database
system is challenging since they are usually scan-intensive (i.e., they need to
intensively scan over a large number of records) which results in huge I/O and
memory costs. And it becomes tougher when the analytical queries are
cross-model. It is hard to accelerate cross-model analytical queries in
existing databases due to the lack of appropriate storage layout and efficient
query processing techniques. In this paper, we present QUEST (QUery Evaluation
Scheme Towards scan-intensive cross-model analysis) to push scan-intensive
queries down to unified columnar storage layout and seamlessly deliver payloads
across different data models. QUEST employs a columnar data layout to unify the
representation of multi-model data. Then, a novel index structure named
Skip-Tree is developed for QUEST to enable the query evaluation more efficient.
With the help of two pairwise bitset-based operations coupled with Skip-Tree,
the scan of most irrelevant instances can be pruned so as to avoid the giant
intermediate result, thus reducing query response latency and saving the
computational resources significantly when evaluating scan-intensive
cross-model analysis. The proposed methods are implemented on an open-source
platform. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that QUEST improves the performance by 3.7x - 178.2x compared to
state-of-the-art multi-model databases when evaluating scan-intensive
cross-model analytical queries.

<p class="mathjax">We present an open digital ecosystem based on web-framework with a functional
back-end server in user-centric energy retrofits. This data-driven web
framework is proposed for building energy renovation benchmarking as part of an
energy advisory service development for the V\"asterbotten region, Sweden. A
4-tiers architecture is developed and programmed to achieve users' interactive
design and visualization via a web browser. Six data-driven methods are
integrated into this framework as backend server functions. Based on those
functions the users can be supported by this decision-making system when they
want to know if it needs to be renovated or not. Meanwhile, influential factors
(input values) from databases that affect energy usage in buildings are to be
analyzed via quantitative analysis, i.e., sensitive analysis. The contributions
to this open ecosystem platform in energy renovation are: 1) A systematic
framework that can be applied to energy efficiency with data-driven approaches,
2) A user-friendly web-based platform that is easy and flexible to use, and 3)
integrated quantitative analysis into the framework to obtain the importance
among all the relevant factors. This computational framework is designed for
stakeholders who would like to get preliminary information in energy advisory.
The improved energy advisor service enabled by the developed platform can
significantly reduce the cost of decision-making, enabling decision-makers to
participate in such professional knowledge-required decisions in a deliberate
and efficient manner. This work is funded by the AURORAL project, which
integrates an open and interoperable digital platform, demonstrated through
regional large-scale pilots in different countries of Europe by
interdisciplinary applications.

<p class="mathjax">We revisit the familiar scenario involving two parties in relative motion, in
which Alice stays at rest while Bob goes on a journey at speed $ \beta c $
along an arbitrary trajectory and reunites with Alice after a certain period of
time. It is a well-known consequence of special relativity that the time that
passes until they meet again is different for the two parties and is shorter in
Bob's frame by a factor of $ \sqrt{1-\beta^2} $. We investigate how this
asymmetry manifests from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Assuming that
Alice and Bob transmit signals of equal average power to each other during the
whole journey, and that additive white Gaussian noise is present on both sides,
we show that the maximum number of bits per second that Alice can transmit
reliably to Bob is always higher than the one Bob can transmit to Alice.
Equivalently, the energy per bit invested by Alice is lower than that invested
by Bob, meaning that the traveler is less efficient from the communication
perspective, as conjectured by Jarett and Cover.

<p class="mathjax">While language is a complex adaptive system, most work on syntactic variation
observes a few individual constructions in isolation from the rest of the
grammar. This means that the grammar, a network which connects thousands of
structures at different levels of abstraction, is reduced to a few disconnected
variables. This paper quantifies the impact of such reductions by
systematically modelling dialectal variation across 49 local populations of
English speakers in 16 countries. We perform dialect classification with both
an entire grammar as well as with isolated nodes within the grammar in order to
characterize the syntactic differences between these dialects. The results
show, first, that many individual nodes within the grammar are subject to
variation but, in isolation, none perform as well as the grammar as a whole.
This indicates that an important part of syntactic variation consists of
interactions between different parts of the grammar. Second, the results show
that the similarity between dialects depends heavily on the sub-set of the
grammar being observed: for example, New Zealand English could be more similar
to Australian English in phrasal verbs but at the same time more similar to UK
English in dative phrases.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud services must be continuously monitored to guarantee that misbehaviors
can be timely revealed, compensated, and fixed. While simple applications can
be easily monitored and controlled, monitoring non-trivial cloud systems with
dynamic behavior requires the operators to be able to rapidly adapt the set of
collected indicators. Although the currently available monitoring frameworks
are equipped with a rich set of probes to virtually collect any indicator, they
do not provide the automation capabilities required to quickly and easily
change (i.e., deploy and undeploy) the probes used to monitor a target system.
Indeed, changing the collected indicators beyond standard platform-level
indicators can be an error-prone and expensive process, which often requires
manual intervention. This paper presents a Monitoring-as-a-Service framework
that provides the capability to automatically deploy and undeploy arbitrary
probes based on a user-provided set of indicators to be collected. The
life-cycle of the probes is fully governed by the framework, including the
detection and resolution of the erroneous states at deployment time. The
framework can be used jointly with existing monitoring technologies, without
requiring the adoption of a specific probing technology. We experimented our
framework with cloud systems based on containers and virtual machines,
obtaining evidence of the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed
solution.

<p class="mathjax">Since the advent of mobile devices, both end-users and the IT industry have
been longing for direct device-to-device (D2D) communication capabilities,
expecting new kinds of interactive, personalized, and collaborative services.
Fifteen years later, many D2D solutions have been implemented and deployed, but
their availability and functionality are underwhelming. Arguably, the most
widely-adopted D2D use case covers the pairing of accessories with smartphones;
however, many other use cases-such as mobile media sharing-did not progress.
Pervasive computing and cyber-physical convergence need local communication
paradigms to scale. For inherently local use cases, they are even more
appealing than ever: eschewing third-parties simultaneously fosters
environmental sustainability, privacy and network resiliency. This paper
proposes a survey on D2D communication, investigates its deployment and
adoption, with the objective of easing the creation and adoption of modern D2D
frameworks. We present the results of an online poll that estimates end-users'
utilisation of D2D processes, and review enabling technologies and security
models.

<p class="mathjax">Prior works on near-field beam training have mostly assumed dedicated
polar-domain codebook and on-grid range estimation, which, however, may suffer
long training overhead and degraded estimation accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose in this paper new and efficient beam training schemes with
off-grid range estimation by using conventional discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) codebook. Specifically, we first analyze the received beam pattern at the
user when far-field beamforming vectors are used for beam scanning, and show an
interesting result that this beam pattern contains useful user angle and range
information. Then, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly estimate the
user angle and range with the DFT codebook. The first scheme estimates the user
angle based on a defined angular support and resolves the user range by
leveraging an approximated angular support width, while the second scheme
estimates the user range by minimizing a power ratio mean square error (MSE) to
improve the range estimation accuracy. Finally, numerical simulations show that
our proposed schemes greatly reduce the near-field beam training overhead and
improve the range estimation accuracy as compared to various benchmark schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models trained with structural health monitoring data have
become a powerful tool for system identification. This paper presents a
physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) model for Timoshenko beam elements. The
model is constructed as a multi-output GP with covariance and cross-covariance
kernels analytically derived based on the differential equations for
deflections, rotations, strains, bending moments, shear forces and applied
loads. Stiffness identification is performed in a Bayesian format by maximising
a posterior model through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, yielding a
stochastic model for the structural parameters. The optimised GP model is
further employed for probabilistic predictions of unobserved responses.
Additionally, an entropy-based method for physics-informed sensor placement
optimisation is presented, exploiting heterogeneous sensor position information
and structural boundary conditions built into the GP model. Results demonstrate
that the proposed approach is effective at identifying structural parameters
and is capable of fusing data from heterogeneous and multi-fidelity sensors.
Probabilistic predictions of structural responses and internal forces are in
closer agreement with measured data. We validate our model with an experimental
setup and discuss the quality and uncertainty of the obtained results. The
proposed approach has potential applications in the field of structural health
monitoring (SHM) for both mechanical and structural systems.

<p class="mathjax">Contrastive learning, which is a powerful technique for learning image-level
representations from unlabeled data, leads a promising direction to dealing
with the dilemma between large-scale pre-training and limited labeled data.
However, most existing contrastive learning strategies are designed mainly for
downstream tasks of natural images, therefore they are sub-optimal and even
worse than learning from scratch when directly applied to medical images whose
downstream tasks are usually segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel
asymmetric contrastive learning framework named JCL for medical image
segmentation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, (1) A novel
asymmetric contrastive learning strategy is proposed to pre-train both encoder
and decoder simultaneously in one-stage to provide better initialization for
segmentation models. (2) A multi-level contrastive loss is designed to take the
correspondence among feature-level, image-level and pixel-level projections,
respectively into account to make sure multi-level representations can be
learned by the encoder and decoder during pre-training. (3) Experiments on
multiple medical image datasets indicate our JCL framework outperforms existing
SOTA contrastive learning strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Video memorability is a measure of how likely a particular video is to be
remembered by a viewer when that viewer has no emotional connection with the
video content. It is an important characteristic as videos that are more
memorable are more likely to be shared, viewed, and discussed. This paper
presents results of a series of experiments where we improved the memorability
of a video by selectively cropping frames based on image saliency. We present
results of a basic fixed cropping as well as the results from dynamic cropping
where both the size of the crop and the position of the crop within the frame,
move as the video is played and saliency is tracked. Our results indicate that
especially for videos of low initial memorability, the memorability score can
be improved.

<p class="mathjax">Over the last decades, ample achievements have been made on Structure from
motion (SfM). However, the vast majority of them basically work in an offline
manner, i.e., images are firstly captured and then fed together into a SfM
pipeline for obtaining poses and sparse point cloud. In this work, on the
contrary, we present an on-the-fly SfM: running online SfM while image
capturing, the newly taken On-the-Fly image is online estimated with the
corresponding pose and points, i.e., what you capture is what you get.
Specifically, our approach firstly employs a vocabulary tree that is
unsupervised trained using learning-based global features for fast image
retrieval of newly fly-in image. Then, a robust feature matching mechanism with
least squares (LSM) is presented to improve image registration performance.
Finally, via investigating the influence of newly fly-in image's connected
neighboring images, an efficient hierarchical weighted local bundle adjustment
(BA) is used for optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
on-the-fly SfM can meet the goal of robustly registering the images while
capturing in an online way.

<p class="mathjax">This study, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, delves into the
spatiotemporal dynamics of Bitcoin transactions, shedding light on the scaling
laws governing its geographic usage. Leveraging a dataset of IP addresses and
Bitcoin addresses spanning from October 2013 to December 2013, we explore the
geospatial patterns unique to Bitcoin. Motivated by the needs of cryptocurrency
businesses, regulatory clarity, and network science inquiries, we make several
contributions. Firstly, we empirically characterize Bitcoin transactions'
spatiotemporal scaling laws, providing insights into its spending behaviours.
Secondly, we introduce a Markovian model that effectively approximates
Bitcoin's observed spatiotemporal patterns, revealing economic connections
among user groups in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our measurements and model shed
light on the inhomogeneous structure of the network: although Bitcoin is
designed to be decentralized, there are significant geographical differences in
the distribution of user activity, which has consequences for all participants
and possible (regulatory) control over the system.

<p class="mathjax">The last decade's market has been characterized by wearable devices, mainly
smartwatches, edge, and cloud computing. A possible application of these
technologies is to improve the safety of dangerous activities, especially
driving motor vehicles. Common enabling technologies, such as system-on-chip,
ultra-low-power computational platforms, and wide-band wireless connectivity,
push all these trends. On the one hand, wearable devices, thanks to the
continuous contact with the user's body, can measure physiological parameters.
On the other hand, edge computing and machine learning techniques, alongside
cameras, allow the implementation of contactless computer vision systems
capable of providing information about the user's current behavior. Another
trend is the usage of RADARs in automotive applications, both for collision
avoidance and monitoring driver behavior. These technologies can be combined to
develop systems designed to aid the driver. For the sake of this paper, we are
focusing on warning drivers, allowing them to know whenever they are drowsy and
hence risking a sleep onset or are not paying attention to the road. Developing
such systems poses many challenges, such as automatic classification of
physiological signal patterns, facial expression recognition, head movements
and eye gaze detection. These challenges have been individually addressed in
the literature. Anyway, we noticed a need for more description on implementing
data fusion. Two main reasons for adopting the fusion approach are to improve
the quality of the overall representation (increasing accuracy and specificity
against drowsy) and make a more reliable system due to redundancy.

<p class="mathjax">Low latency communication is one of the fundamental requirements for 5G
wireless networks and beyond. In this paper, a novel approach for joint
caching, user scheduling and resource allocation is proposed for minimizing the
queuing latency in serving user's requests in cloud-aided wireless networks.
Due to the slow temporal variations in user requests, a time-scale separation
technique is used to decouple the joint caching problem from user scheduling
and radio resource allocation problems. To serve the spatio-temporal user
requests under storage limitations, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach is
used to optimize the caching strategy at the small cell base stations by
minimizing the content fetching cost. A spectral clustering algorithm is
proposed to speed-up the convergence of the RL algorithm for a large content
caching problem by clustering contents based on user requests. Meanwhile, a
dynamic mechanism is proposed to locally group coupled base stations based on
user requests to collaboratively optimize the caching strategies. To further
improve the latency in fetching and serving user requests, a dynamic matching
algorithm is proposed to schedule users and to allocate users to radio
resources based on user requests and queue lengths under probabilistic latency
constraints. Simulation results show the proposed approach significantly
reduces the average delay from 21% to 90% compared to random caching strategy,
random resource allocation and random scheduling baselines.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the performance of wireless communications empowered
by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RISs) over Nakagami-m fading channels.
We consider two phase configuration designs for the RIS, one random and another
one based on coherent phase shifting. For both phase configuration cases, we
present single-integral expressions for the outage probability and the bit
error rate of binary modulation schemes, which can be efficiently evaluated
numerically. In addition, we propose accurate closed-form approximations for
the ergodic capacity of the considered system. For all considered metrics, we
have also derived simple analytical expressions that become tight for large
numbers of RIS reflecting elements. Numerically evaluated results compared with
Monte Carlo simulations are presented in order to verify the correctness of the
proposed analysis and showcase the impact of various system settings.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are often deployed in resource-sharing
clouds as Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) to provide inference
services.To steal model architectures that are of valuable intellectual
properties, a class of attacks has been proposed via different side-channel
leakage, posing a serious security challenge to MLaaS.
<br />Also targeting MLaaS, we propose a new end-to-end attack, DeepTheft, to
accurately recover complex DNN model architectures on general processors via
the RAPL-based power side channel. However, an attacker can acquire only a low
sampling rate (1 KHz) of the time-series energy traces from the RAPL interface,
rendering existing techniques ineffective in stealing large and deep DNN
models. To this end, we design a novel and generic learning-based framework
consisting of a set of meta-models, based on which DeepTheft is demonstrated to
have high accuracy in recovering a large number (thousands) of models
architectures from different model families including the deepest ResNet152.
Particularly, DeepTheft has achieved a Levenshtein Distance Accuracy of 99.75%
in recovering network structures, and a weighted average F1 score of 99.60% in
recovering diverse layer-wise hyperparameters. Besides, our proposed learning
framework is general to other time-series side-channel signals. To validate its
generalization, another existing side channel is exploited, i.e., CPU
frequency. Different from RAPL, CPU frequency is accessible to unprivileged
users in bare-metal OSes. By using our generic learning framework trained
against CPU frequency traces, DeepTheft has shown similarly high attack
performance in stealing model architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Audio classification plays a crucial role in speech and sound processing
tasks with a wide range of applications. There still remains a challenge of
striking the right balance between fitting the model to the training data
(avoiding overfitting) and enabling it to generalise well to a new domain.
Leveraging the transferability of contrastive learning, we introduce Audio
Contrastive-based Fine-tuning (AudioConFit), an efficient approach
characterised by robust generalisability. Empirical experiments on a variety of
audio classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art results in various settings.

<p class="mathjax">Although pre-trained large language models (PLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, they lack understanding of subtle
expressions of implicit hate speech. Such nuanced and implicit hate is often
misclassified as non-hate. Various attempts have been made to enhance the
detection of (implicit) hate content by augmenting external context or
enforcing label separation via distance-based metrics. We combine these two
approaches and introduce FiADD, a novel Focused Inferential Adaptive Density
Discrimination framework. FiADD enhances the PLM finetuning pipeline by
bringing the surface form of an implicit hate speech closer to its implied form
while increasing the inter-cluster distance among various class labels. We test
FiADD on three implicit hate datasets and observe significant improvement in
the two-way and three-way hate classification tasks. We further experiment on
the generalizability of FiADD on three other tasks, namely detecting sarcasm,
irony, and stance, in which surface and implied forms differ, and observe
similar performance improvement. We analyze the generated latent space to
understand its evolution under FiADD, which corroborates the advantage of
employing FiADD for implicit hate speech detection.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring propeller failures is vital to maintain the safe and reliable
operation of quadrotor UAVs. The simulation-to-reality UAV fault diagnosis
technique offer a secure and economical approach to identify faults in
propellers. However, classifiers trained with simulated data perform poorly in
real flights due to the wind disturbance in outdoor scenarios. In this work, we
propose an uncertainty-based fault classifier (UFC) to address the challenge of
sim-to-real UAV fault diagnosis in windy scenarios. It uses the ensemble of
difference-based deep convolutional neural networks (EDDCNN) to reduce model
variance and bias. Moreover, it employs an uncertainty-based decision framework
to filter out uncertain predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
UFC can achieve 100% fault-diagnosis accuracy with a data usage rate of 33.6%
in the windy outdoor scenario.

<p class="mathjax">Radio environment maps (REMs) hold a central role in optimizing wireless
network deployment, enhancing network performance, and ensuring effective
spectrum management. Conventional REM prediction methods are either excessively
time-consuming, e.g., ray tracing, or inaccurate, e.g., statistical models,
limiting their adoption in modern inherently dynamic wireless networks.
Deep-learning-based REM prediction has recently attracted considerable
attention as an appealing, accurate, and time-efficient alternative. However,
existing works on REM prediction using deep learning are either confined to 2D
maps or use a limited dataset. In this paper, we introduce a runtime-efficient
REM prediction framework based on u-nets, trained on a large-scale 3D maps
dataset. In addition, data preprocessing steps are investigated to further
refine the REM prediction accuracy. The proposed u-net framework, along with
preprocessing steps, are evaluated in the context of the 2023 IEEE ICASSP
Signal Processing Grand Challenge, namely, the First Pathloss Radio Map
Prediction Challenge. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves an average normalized root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.045
with an average of 14 milliseconds (ms) runtime. Finally, we position our
achieved REM prediction accuracy in the context of a relevant cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) use case. We demonstrate that one can
obviate consuming energy on large-scale fading measurements and rely on
predicted REM instead to decide on which sleep access points (APs) to switch on
in a CF-mMIMO network that adopts a minimum propagation loss AP switch ON/OFF
strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised training of deep learning models for medical imaging applications
requires a significant amount of labeled data. This is posing a challenge as
the images are required to be annotated by medical professionals. To address
this limitation, we introduce the Adaptive Locked Agnostic Network (ALAN), a
concept involving self-supervised visual feature extraction using a large
backbone model to produce anatomically robust semantic self-segmentation. In
the ALAN methodology, this self-supervised training occurs only once on a large
and diverse dataset. Due to the intuitive interpretability of the segmentation,
downstream models tailored for specific tasks can be easily designed using
white-box models with few parameters. This, in turn, opens up the possibility
of communicating the inner workings of a model with domain experts and
introducing prior knowledge into it. It also means that the downstream models
become less data-hungry compared to fully supervised approaches. These
characteristics make ALAN particularly well-suited for resource-scarce
scenarios, such as costly clinical trials and rare diseases. In this paper, we
apply the ALAN approach to three publicly available echocardiography datasets:
EchoNet-Dynamic, CAMUS, and TMED-2. Our findings demonstrate that the
self-supervised backbone model robustly identifies anatomical subregions of the
heart in an apical four-chamber view. Building upon this, we design two
downstream models, one for segmenting a target anatomical region, and a second
for echocardiogram view classification.

<p class="mathjax">In Time-Triggered (TT) or time-sensitive networks, the transmission of a TT
frame is required to be scheduled at a precise time instant for industrial
distributed real-time control systems. Other (or {\em best-effort} (BE)) frames
are forwarded in a BE manner. Under this scheduling strategy, the transmission
of a TT frame must wait until its scheduled instant even if it could have been
transmitted sooner. On the other hand, BE frames are transmitted whenever
possible but may miss deadlines or may even be dropped due to congestion. As a
result, TT transmission and BE delivery are incompatible with each other.
<br />To remedy this incompatibility, we propose a synergistic switch architecture
(SWA) for TT transmission with BE delivery to dynamically improve the
end-to-end (e2e) latency of TT frames by opportunistically exploiting BE
delivery. Given a TT frame, the SWA generates and transmits a cloned copy with
BE delivery. The first frame arriving at the receiver device is delivered with
a configured jitter and the other copy ignored. So, the SWA achieves shorter
latency and controllable jitter, the best of both worlds. We have implemented
SWA using FPGAs in an industry-strength TT switches and used four test
scenarios to demonstrate SWA's improvements of e2e latency and controllable
jitter over the state-of-the-art TT transmission scheme.

<p class="mathjax">The continuous development of computer network technology has accelerated the
pace of informatization, and at the same time, network security issues are
becoming increasingly prominent. Networking technology with different network
topologies is one of the important means to solve network security problems.
The security of VPN is based on the division of geographical boundaries, but
the granularity is relatively coarse, which is difficult to cope with the
dynamic changes of the security situation. Zero trust network solves the VPN
problem through peer to peer authorization and continuous verification, but
most of the solutions use a central proxy device, resulting in the central node
becoming the bottleneck of the network. This paper put forward the hard-Nat
traversal formula based on the birthday paradox, which solves the long-standing
problem of hard NAT traversal. A full mesh networking mechanism with variable
parameter full-dimensional spatial peer-to-peer grid topology was proposed,
which covers all types of networking schemes and achieve peer-2-peer resource
interconnection on both methodological and engineering level.

<p class="mathjax">Safety controllers is widely used to achieve safe reinforcement learning.
Most methods that apply a safety controller are using handcrafted safety
constraints to construct the safety controller. However, when the environment
dynamics are sophisticated, handcrafted safety constraints become unavailable.
Therefore, it worth to research on constructing safety controllers by learning
algorithms. We propose a three-stage architecture for safe reinforcement
learning, namely TU-Recovery Architecture. A safety critic and a recovery
policy is learned before task training. They form a safety controller to ensure
safety in task training. Then a phenomenon induced by disagreement between task
policy and recovery policy, called adversarial phenomenon, which reduces
learning efficiency and model performance, is described. Auxiliary reward is
proposed to mitigate adversarial phenomenon, while help the task policy to
learn to recover from high-risk states. A series of experiments are conducted
in a robot navigation environment. Experiments demonstrate that TU-Recovery
outperforms unconstrained counterpart in both reward gaining and constraint
violations during task training, and auxiliary reward further improve
TU-Recovery in reward-to-cost ratio by significantly reduce constraint
violations.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple interval graphs are a well-known generalization of interval graphs
introduced in the 1970s to deal with situations arising naturally in scheduling
and allocation. A $d$-interval is the union of $d$ intervals on the real line,
and a graph is a $d$-interval graph if it is the intersection graph of
$d$-intervals. In particular, it is a unit $d$-interval graph if it admits a
$d$-interval representation where every interval has unit length.
<br />Whereas it has been known for a long time that recognizing 2-interval graphs
and other related classes such as 2-track interval graphs is NP-complete, the
complexity of recognizing unit 2-interval graphs remains open. Here, we settle
this question by proving that the recognition of unit 2-interval graphs is also
NP-complete. Our proof technique uses a completely different approach from the
other hardness results of recognizing related classes. Furthermore, we extend
the result for unit $d$-interval graphs for any $d\geq 2$, which does not
follow directly in graph recognition problems --as an example, it took almost
20 years to close the gap between $d=2$ and $d&gt; 2$ for the recognition of
$d$-track interval graphs. Our result has several implications, including that
recognizing $(x, \dots, x)$ $d$-interval graphs and depth $r$ unit 2-interval
graphs is NP-complete for every $x\geq 11$ and every $r\geq 4$.

<p class="mathjax">The development of emotion recognition in dialogue (ERC) has been
consistently hindered by the complexity of pipeline designs, leading to ERC
models that often overfit to specific datasets and dialogue patterns. In this
study, we propose a novel approach, namely
<br />InstructERC, to reformulates the ERC task from a discriminative framework to
a generative framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) . InstructERC has
two significant contributions: Firstly, InstructERC introduces a simple yet
effective retrieval template module, which helps the model explicitly integrate
multi-granularity dialogue supervision information by concatenating the
historical dialog content, label statement, and emotional domain demonstrations
with high semantic similarity. Furthermore, we introduce two additional emotion
alignment tasks, namely speaker identification and emotion prediction tasks, to
implicitly model the dialogue role relationships and future emotional
tendencies in conversations. Our LLM-based plug-and-play plugin framework
significantly outperforms all previous models and achieves comprehensive SOTA
on three commonly used ERC datasets. Extensive analysis of parameter-efficient
and data-scaling experiments provide empirical guidance for applying
InstructERC in practical scenarios. Our code will be released after blind
review.

of E, we prove that the endomorphism ring of E can be computed in classical
time about disc(Z[$\alpha$])^1/4 , and in quantum subexponential time, assuming
the generalised Riemann hypothesis. Previous results either had higher
complexities, or relied on heuristic assumptions. Along the way, we prove that
the Primitivisation problem can be solved in polynomial time (a problem
previously believed to be hard), and we prove that the action of smooth ideals
on oriented elliptic curves can be computed in polynomial time (previous
results of this form required the ideal to be powersmooth, i.e., not divisible
by any large prime power). Following the attacks on SIDH, isogenies in high

<p class="mathjax">Location knowledge in indoor environment using Indoor Positioning Systems
(IPS) has become very useful and popular in recent years. Indoor wireless
localization suffers from severe multi-path fading and non-line-of-sight
conditions. This paper presents a novel indoor localization framework based on
sensor fusion of Zigbee Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) using Received Signal
Strength (RSS). The unknown position is equipped with two or more mobile nodes.
The range between two mobile nodes is fixed as priori. The attitude (roll,
pitch, and yaw) of the mobile node are measured by inertial sensors (ISs). Then
the angle and the range between any two nodes can be obtained, and thus the
path between the two nodes can be modeled as a curve. Through an efficient
cooperation between two or more mobile nodes, this framework effectively
exploits the RSS techniques. This constraint help improve the positioning
accuracy. Theoretical analysis on localization distortion and Monte Carlo
simulations shows that the proposed cooperative strategy of multiple nodes with
extended Kalman filter (EKF) achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy
than the existing systems, especially in heavily obstructed scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Text-guided image generation aimed to generate desired images conditioned on
given texts, while text-guided image manipulation refers to semantically edit
parts of a given image based on specified texts. For these two similar tasks,
the key point is to ensure image fidelity as well as semantic consistency. Many
previous approaches require complex multi-stage generation and adversarial
training, while struggling to provide a unified framework for both tasks. In
this work, we propose TextCLIP, a unified framework for text-guided image
generation and manipulation without adversarial training. The proposed method
accepts input from images or random noise corresponding to these two different
tasks, and under the condition of the specific texts, a carefully designed
mapping network that exploits the powerful generative capabilities of StyleGAN
and the text image representation capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) generates images of up to $1024\times1024$ resolution that
can currently be generated. Extensive experiments on the Multi-modal CelebA-HQ
dataset have demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, both on text-guided generation tasks and manipulation
tasks.

proof-of-work protocols [3] and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the
preferred tool for finding optimal strategies in Bitcoin [4, 10] and similar
linear chain protocols [12]. Protocols increasingly adopt non-sequential chain
structures [11], for which MDP analysis is more involved [2]. To date,
researchers have tailored specific attack spaces for each protocol [2, 4, 5, 7,
10, 12]. Assumptions differ, and validating and comparing results is difficult.
To overcome this, we propose a generic attack space that supports the wide
class of DAG protocols that provide a total ordering of blocks [11], e. g.,
Ethereum, Fruitchains, and Parallel Proof-of-Work. Our approach is modular: we
specify each protocol as one program, and then derive the Selfish Mining MDPs
automatically.

<p class="mathjax">Early advances in the field of quantum computing have provided new
opportunities to tackle intricate problems in areas as diverse as mathematics,
physics, or healthcare. However, the technology required to construct such
systems where different pieces of quantum and classical software collaborate is
currently lacking. For this reason, significant advancements in quantum
service-oriented computing are necessary to enable developers to create and
operate quantum services and microservices comparable to their classical
counterparts. Therefore, the core objective of this work is to establish the
necessary technological infrastructure that enables the application of the
benefits and lessons learned from service-oriented computing to the domain of
quantum software engineering. To this end, we propose a pipeline for the
continuous deployment of services. Additionally, we have validated the proposal
by making use of a modification of the OpenAPI specification, the GitHub
Actions, and AWS.

a video sequence with a small set of repeated shooting locations (such as in
television series) using artificial neural networks. The basic idea of the
presented approach is to select a set of frames from each scene, transform them
by a pre-trained singleimage pre-processing convolutional network, and classify
the scene location with subsequent layers of the neural network. The considered
networks have been tested and compared on a dataset obtained from The Big Bang
Theory television series. We have investigated different neural network layers
to combine individual frames, particularly AveragePooling, MaxPooling, Product,
Flatten, LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM layers. We have observed that only some
of the approaches are suitable for the task at hand.

<p class="mathjax">In open-world semi-supervised learning, a machine learning model is tasked
with uncovering novel categories from unlabeled data while maintaining
performance on seen categories from labeled data. The central challenge is the
substantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns
the former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we
introduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,
which encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to
synchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which
pulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output
space, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,
whereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving
a remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to
the prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning the
self-supervised pre-trained backbone significantly boosts performance over the
default in prior literature. After our paper is accepted, we will release the
code.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has positively revolutionized
the field of Artificial Intelligence by promoting the joint design of
resource-constrained IoT hardware devices and their learning-based software
architectures. TinyML carries an essential role within the fourth and fifth
industrial revolutions in helping societies, economies, and individuals employ
effective AI-infused computing technologies (e.g., smart cities, automotive,
and medical robotics). Given its multidisciplinary nature, the field of TinyML
has been approached from many different angles: this comprehensive survey
wishes to provide an up-to-date overview focused on all the learning algorithms
within TinyML-based solutions. The survey is based on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodological flow,
allowing for a systematic and complete literature survey. In particular,
firstly we will examine the three different workflows for implementing a
TinyML-based system, i.e., ML-oriented, HW-oriented, and co-design. Secondly,
we propose a taxonomy that covers the learning panorama under the TinyML lens,
examining in detail the different families of model optimization and design, as
well as the state-of-the-art learning techniques. Thirdly, this survey will
present the distinct features of hardware devices and software tools that
represent the current state-of-the-art for TinyML intelligent edge
applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions.

<p class="mathjax">Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting the object in
video referred by a natural language query. Existing methods mainly rely on
sophisticated pipelines to tackle such cross-modal task, and do not explicitly
model the object-level spatial context which plays an important role in
locating the referred object. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end RVOS
framework completely built upon transformers, termed \textit{Fully
Transformer-Equipped Architecture} (FTEA), which treats the RVOS task as a mask
sequence learning problem and regards all the objects in video as candidate
objects. Given a video clip with a text query, the visual-textual features are
yielded by encoder, while the corresponding pixel-level and word-level features
are aligned in terms of semantic similarity. To capture the object-level
spatial context, we have developed the Stacked Transformer, which individually
characterizes the visual appearance of each candidate object, whose feature map
is decoded to the binary mask sequence in order directly. Finally, the model
finds the best matching between mask sequence and text query. In addition, to
diversify the generated masks for candidate objects, we impose a diversity loss
on the model for capturing more accurate mask of the referred object. Empirical
studies have shown the superiority of the proposed method on three benchmarks,
e.g., FETA achieves 45.1% and 38.7% in terms of mAP on A2D Sentences (3782
videos) and J-HMDB Sentences (928 videos), respectively; it achieves 56.6% in
terms of $\mathcal{J\&amp;F}$ on Ref-YouTube-VOS (3975 videos and 7451 objects).
Particularly, compared to the best candidate method, it has a gain of 2.1% and
3.2% in terms of P$@$0.5 on the former two, respectively, while it has a gain
of 2.9% in terms of $\mathcal{J}$ on the latter one.

reproducibility and the evaluation of the precision or accuracy of the recorded
trajectories. With this objective in mind, we proposed the Robotic Total
Stations Ground Truthing dataset (RTS-GT) dataset to support localization
research with the generation of six-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) ground truth
trajectories. This novel dataset includes six-DOF ground truth trajectories
generated using a system of three Robotic Total Stations (RTSs) tracking moving
robotic platforms. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the RTS-based
system to a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based setup. The dataset
comprises around sixty experiments conducted in various conditions over a
period of 17 months, and encompasses over 49 kilometers of trajectories, making
it the most extensive dataset of RTS-based measurements to date. Additionally,
we provide the precision of all poses for each experiment, a feature not found
in the current state-of-the-art datasets. Our results demonstrate that RTSs
provide measurements that are 22 times more stable than GNSS in various
environmental settings, making them a valuable resource for SLAM benchmark
development.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating the efficiency of human-AI interactions is challenging, including
subjective and objective quality aspects. With the focus on the human
experience of the explanations, evaluations of explanation methods have become
mostly subjective, making comparative evaluations almost impossible and highly
linked to the individual user. However, it is commonly agreed that one aspect
of explanation quality is how effectively the user can detect if the
predictions are trustworthy and correct, i.e., if the explanations can increase
the user's appropriate trust in the model. This paper starts with the
definitions of appropriate trust from the literature. It compares the
definitions with model performance evaluation, showing the strong similarities
between appropriate trust and model performance evaluation. The paper's main
contribution is a novel approach to evaluating appropriate trust by taking
advantage of the likenesses between definitions. The paper offers several
straightforward evaluation methods for different aspects of user performance,
including suggesting a method for measuring uncertainty and appropriate trust
in regression.

<p class="mathjax">With the ever increasing importance of web services and the Cloud as a
reliable commodity to provide business value as well as consolidate IT
infrastructure, electronic contracts have become very important. WS-Agreement
has itself established as a well accepted container format for describing such
contracts. However, the semantic interpretation of the terms contained in these
contracts, as well as the process of agreeing to contracts when multiple
options have to be considered (negotiation), are still pretty much dealt with
on a case by case basis. In this paper we address the issues of diverging
contracts and varying contract negotiation protocols by introducing the concept
of a contract aware marketplace, which abstracts from the heterogeneous offers
of different services providers. This allows for the automated consumption of
services solely based on preferences, instead of additional restrictions such
as understanding of contract terms and/or negotiation protocols. We also
contribute an evaluation of several existing negotiation concepts/protocols. We
think that reducing the complexity for automated contract negotiation and thus
service consumption is a key for the success of future service and Cloud
infrastructures.

<p class="mathjax">Reachability analysis is a powerful tool for computing the set of states or
outputs reachable for a system. While previous work has focused on systems
described by state-space models, we present the first methods to compute
reachable sets of ARMAX models - one of the most common input-output models
originating from data-driven system identification. The first approach we
propose can only be used with dependency-preserving set representations such as
symbolic zonotopes, while the second one is valid for arbitrary set
representations but relies on a reformulation of the ARMAX model. By analyzing
the computational complexities, we show that both approaches scale
quadratically with respect to the time horizon of the reachability problem when
using symbolic zonotopes. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a
third approach that scales linearly with respect to the time horizon when using
set representations that are closed under Minkowski addition and linear
transformation and that satisfy that the computational complexity of the
Minkowski sum is independent of the representation size of the operands. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate that the reachable sets of ARMAX models are
tighter than the reachable sets of equivalent state space models in case of
unknown initial states. Therefore, this methodology has the potential to
significantly reduce the conservatism of various verification techniques.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a sharp interface formulation for the multi-phase Mullins-Sekerka
flow. The flow is characterized by a network of curves evolving such that the
total surface energy of the curves is reduced, while the areas of the enclosed
phases are conserved. Making use of a variational formulation, we introduce a
fully discrete finite element method. Our discretization features a parametric
approximation of the moving interfaces that is independent of the
discretization used for the equations in the bulk. The scheme can be shown to
be unconditionally stable and to satisfy an exact volume conservation property.
Moreover, an inherent tangential velocity for the vertices on the discrete
curves leads to asymptotically equidistributed vertices, meaning no remeshing
is necessary in practice. Several numerical examples, including a convergence
experiment for the three-phase Mullins-Sekerka flow, demonstrate the
capabilities of the introduced method.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state
Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed
information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The
receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the
reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling
and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states
of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication
process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it
with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with
respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time
reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a
new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we
formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the
optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation
error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling
generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms
all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain
conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy
performs better only when the source is slowly varying.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the
last few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful
image representations without labels. These methods are trained using
backpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the
forward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two
forward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network
without backpropagation.
<br />In this study, for the first time, we study the performance of
forward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning
and provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark
employs four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and
three commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely
rotation, flip and jigsaw.
<br />Our main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs
comparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer
performance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This
may be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for
each layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the
forward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward
algorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information
unnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.
Further investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the
forward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the
datasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.

<p class="mathjax">Continuous detection of human activities and presence is essential for
developing a pervasive interactive smart space. Existing literature lacks
robust wireless sensing mechanisms capable of continuously monitoring multiple
users' activities without prior knowledge of the environment. Developing such a
mechanism requires simultaneous localization and tracking of multiple subjects.
In addition, it requires identifying their activities at various scales, some
being macro-scale activities like walking, squats, etc., while others are
micro-scale activities like typing or sitting, etc. In this paper, we develop a
holistic system called MARS using a single Commercial off the-shelf (COTS)
Millimeter Wave (mmWave) radar, which employs an intelligent model to sense
both macro and micro activities. In addition, it uses a dynamic spatial time
sharing approach to sense different subjects simultaneously. A thorough
evaluation of MARS shows that it can infer activities continuously with a
weighted F1-Score of &gt; 94% and an average response time of approx 2 sec, with 5
subjects and 19 different activities.

VMs do not offer any guarantee on their performance. Cloud platforms are known
to be affected by performance variability, but a better understanding is still

multi-faceted study on the performance variability of VMs. Unlike previous
studies, our assessment covers a wide range of factors: 16 VM types from 4
well-known cloud providers, 10 benchmarks, and 28 different metrics. We present
four new contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite (VMBS) that
let researchers and practitioners systematically collect a diverse set of
performance data. Second, we present a new indicator, called Variability
Indicator, that allows for measuring variability in the performance of VMs.
Third, we illustrate an analysis of the collected data across four different
dimensions: resources, isolation, time, and cost. Fourth, we present multiple
predictive models based on Machine Learning that aim to forecast future
performance and detect time patterns. Our experiments provide important
insights on the resource variability of VMs, highlighting differences and
similarities between various cloud providers. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the widest analysis ever conducted on the topic.

<p class="mathjax">We present Ego3DPose, a highly accurate binocular egocentric 3D pose
reconstruction system. The binocular egocentric setup offers practicality and
usefulness in various applications, however, it remains largely under-explored.
It has been suffering from low pose estimation accuracy due to viewing
distortion, severe self-occlusion, and limited field-of-view of the joints in
egocentric 2D images. Here, we notice that two important 3D cues, stereo
correspondences, and perspective, contained in the egocentric binocular input
are neglected. Current methods heavily rely on 2D image features, implicitly
learning 3D information, which introduces biases towards commonly observed
motions and leads to low overall accuracy. We observe that they not only fail
in challenging occlusion cases but also in estimating visible joint positions.
To address these challenges, we propose two novel approaches. First, we design
a two-path network architecture with a path that estimates pose per limb
independently with its binocular heatmaps. Without full-body information
provided, it alleviates bias toward trained full-body distribution. Second, we
leverage the egocentric view of body limbs, which exhibits strong perspective
variance (e.g., a significantly large-size hand when it is close to the
camera). We propose a new perspective-aware representation using trigonometry,
enabling the network to estimate the 3D orientation of limbs. Finally, we
develop an end-to-end pose reconstruction network that synergizes both
techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Ego3DPose
outperforms state-of-the-art models by a pose estimation error (i.e., MPJPE)
reduction of 23.1% in the UnrealEgo dataset. Our qualitative results highlight
the superiority of our approach across a range of scenarios and challenges.

<p class="mathjax">This study introduces a novel hierarchical divisive clustering approach with
stochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in
multi-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has
the unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit
information, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of
hierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their
discriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs
a binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated
on 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and
rocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach
significantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a
third of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,
respectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features
and HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)
score show consistent significance, variations are observed with different
splitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising
strategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in
multi-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring
different splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well
as applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data. The source
code is made openly available to facilitate reproducibility and further
exploration of the method.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the coordination control of discrete event systems in
the presence of combined sensor and actuator attacks. Discrete event systems
are modeled as automata, and sensor attacks are defined using specific attack
languages. The approach involves employing multiple local supervisors to
control the system. The primary objective is to devise these local supervisors
to ensure the system's safety, even when facing sensor and actuator attacks.
The paper establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of such supervisors in terms of conditional decomposability,
CA-controllability, and CA-observability. Furthermore, a methodology is
developed to compute local state estimates when sensor attacks occur. Based on
the local state estimates, local supervisors are designed to ensure the safety
of a system even under cyber attacks.

<p class="mathjax">We present NeuralLabeling, a labeling approach and toolset for annotating a
scene using either bounding boxes or meshes and generating segmentation masks,
affordance maps, 2D bounding boxes, 3D bounding boxes, 6DOF object poses, depth
maps and object meshes. NeuralLabeling uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as
renderer, allowing labeling to be performed using 3D spatial tools while
incorporating geometric clues such as occlusions, relying only on images
captured from multiple viewpoints as input. To demonstrate the applicability of
NeuralLabeling to a practical problem in robotics, we added ground truth depth
maps to 30000 frames of transparent object RGB and noisy depth maps of glasses
placed in a dishwasher captured using an RGBD sensor, yielding the
Dishwasher30k dataset. We show that training a simple deep neural network with
supervision using the annotated depth maps yields a higher reconstruction
performance than training with the previously applied weakly supervised
approach.

<p class="mathjax">Relevance of research on telecommunications networks is predicated upon the
implementations which it explicitly claims or implicitly subsumes. This paper
supports researchers through a survey of Communications Service Providers
current implementations within the metro area, and trends that are expected to
shape the next-generation metro area network. The survey is composed of a
quantitative component, complemented by a qualitative component carried out
among field experts. Among the several findings, it has been found that service
providers with large subscriber base sizes, are less agile in their response to
technological change than those with smaller subscriber base sizes: thus,
copper media are still an important component in the set of access network
technologies. On the other hand, service providers with large subscriber base
sizes are strongly committed to deploying distributed access architectures,
notably using remote access nodes like remote OLT and remote MAC-PHY. This
study also shows that the extent of remote node deployment for multi-access
edge computing is about the same as remote node deployment for distributed
access architectures, indicating that these two aspects of metro area networks
are likely to be co-deployed.

<p class="mathjax">Shared resources synchronization is a well studied problem, in both shared
memory environment or distributed memory environment. Many synchronization
mechanisms are proposed, with their own way to reach certain consistency level.
This thesis further found that there is no perfect synchronization mechanism.
Each of them has its properties at different level. For example, to enforce
strong consistency, writers may loose writing freedom or it would take more
time to coordinate. This thesis proposes a framework to generalize all
synchronization mechanism in a formal way for better reasoning on properties,
from the perspective of multi-writer to single-writer convergence. Therefore,
limitations prevent a synchronization mechanism from achieving every property
at its optimal level. CAP and ROLL were proposed in previous works to explain
such. CAP theorem states that it can only achieve two of Consistency,
Availability and Partition tolerance properties. ROLL Theorem uses a framework
to model leaderless SMR protocol and states quorum size and fault tolerance are
trading off. The thesis covers five properties in a more understandable way and
improves existed mechanisms by analyzing with the framework.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, eight different troubled cell indicators (shock detectors) are
reviewed for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws using
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and a WENO limiter. Extensive simulations
using one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems for various orders on the
hyperbolic system of Euler equations are used to compare these troubled cell
indicators. For one-dimensional problems, the performance of Fu and Shu
indicator and the modified KXRCF indicator is better than other indicators. For
two-dimensional problems, the performance of the artificial neural network
(ANN) indicator of Ray and Hesthaven is quite good and the Fu and Shu and the
modified KXRCF indicators are also good. These three indicators are suitable
candidates for applications of DGM using WENO limiters though it should be
noted that the ANN indicator is quite expensive and requires a lot of training.

<p class="mathjax">As machine learning models become more general, we need to characterise them
in richer, more meaningful ways. We describe a method to infer the cognitive
profile of a system from diverse experimental data. To do so, we introduce
measurement layouts that model how task-instance features interact with system
capabilities to affect performance. These features must be triangulated in
complex ways to be able to infer capabilities from non-populational data -- a
challenge for traditional psychometric and inferential tools. Using the
Bayesian probabilistic programming library PyMC, we infer different cognitive
profiles for agents in two scenarios: 68 actual contestants in the AnimalAI
Olympics and 30 synthetic agents for O-PIAAGETS, an object permanence battery.
We showcase the potential for capability-oriented evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis aims to clone any unseen speaker's
voice without adaptation parameters. By quantizing speech waveform into
discrete acoustic tokens and modeling these tokens with the language model,
recent language model-based TTS models show zero-shot speaker adaptation
capabilities with only a 3-second acoustic prompt of an unseen speaker.
However, they are limited by the length of the acoustic prompt, which makes it
difficult to clone personal speaking style. In this paper, we propose a novel
zero-shot TTS model with the multi-scale acoustic prompts based on a neural
codec language model VALL-E. A speaker-aware text encoder is proposed to learn
the personal speaking style at the phoneme-level from the style prompt
consisting of multiple sentences. Following that, a VALL-E based acoustic
decoder is utilized to model the timbre from the timbre prompt at the
frame-level and generate speech. The experimental results show that our
proposed method outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness and speaker
similarity, and can achieve better performance by scaling out to a longer style
prompt.

<p class="mathjax">In the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), the unprecedented
progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP)
offers an opportunity to revisit the entire approach of traditional metrics of
machine intelligence, both in form and content. As the realm of machine
cognitive evaluation has already reached Imitation, the next step is an
efficient Language Acquisition and Understanding. Our paper proposes a paradigm
shift from the established Turing Test towards an all-embracing framework that
hinges on language acquisition, taking inspiration from the recent advancements
in LLMs. The present contribution is deeply tributary of the excellent work

<p class="mathjax">Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is commonly adopted for sequence
modeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order
between the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to
deterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and
sparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when
compared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a
variational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more
generalizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two
versions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the
first being that the variational latent variables at each time step are
conditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are
Markovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the
variational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present
computationally tractable forms for implementing them.

<p class="mathjax">Choosing an appropriate representation of the environment for the underlying
decision-making process of the \gls{RL} agent is not always straightforward.
The state representation should be inclusive enough to allow the agent to
informatively decide on its actions and compact enough to increase sample
efficiency for policy training. Given this outlook, this work examines the
effect of various state representations in incentivizing the agent to solve a
specific robotic task: antipodal and planar object grasping. A continuum of
state representation abstractions is defined, starting from a model-based
approach with complete system knowledge, through hand-crafted numerical, to
image-based representations with decreasing level of induced task-specific
knowledge. We examine the effects of each representation in the ability of the
agent to solve the task in simulation and the transferability of the learned
policy to the real robot. The results show that RL agents using numerical
states can perform on par with non-learning baselines. Furthermore, we find
that agents using image-based representations from pre-trained environment
embedding vectors perform better than end-to-end trained agents, and
hypothesize that task-specific knowledge is necessary for achieving convergence
and high success rates in robot control. Supplementary material can be found at

Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the corresponding nonlinear eigenvector problem.
The method combines the high-accuracy properties of numerical homogenisation
methods with a novel super-localisation approach for the calculation of the
basis functions. A rigorous numerical analysis demonstrates superconvergence of
the approach compared to classical polynomial and multiscale finite element
methods, even in low regularity regimes. Numerical tests reveal the method's
competitiveness with spectral methods, particularly in capturing critical
physical effects in extreme conditions, such as vortex lattice formation in
fast-rotating potential traps. The method's potential is further highlighted
through a dynamic simulation of a phase transition from Mott insulator to

<p class="mathjax">As robotic systems increasingly encounter complex and unconstrained
real-world scenarios, there is a demand to recognize diverse objects. The
state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods rely on object-specific
training and therefore do not generalize to unseen objects. Recent novel object
pose estimation methods are solving this issue using task-specific fine-tuned
CNNs for deep template matching. This adaptation for pose estimation still
requires expensive data rendering and training procedures. MegaPose for example
is trained on a dataset consisting of two million images showing 20,000
different objects to reach such generalization capabilities. To overcome this
shortcoming we introduce ZS6D, for zero-shot novel object 6D pose estimation.
Visual descriptors, extracted using pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), are
used for matching rendered templates against query images of objects and for
establishing local correspondences. These local correspondences enable deriving
geometric correspondences and are used for estimating the object's 6D pose with
RANSAC-based PnP. This approach showcases that the image descriptors extracted
by pre-trained ViTs are well-suited to achieve a notable improvement over two
state-of-the-art novel object 6D pose estimation methods, without the need for
task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments are performed on LMO, YCBV, and TLESS.
In comparison to one of the two methods we improve the Average Recall on all
three datasets and compared to the second method we improve on two datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Post-hoc explainability methods aim to clarify predictions of black-box
machine learning models. However, it is still largely unclear how well users
comprehend the provided explanations and whether these increase the users
ability to predict the model behavior. We approach this question by conducting
a user study to evaluate comprehensibility and predictability in two widely
used tools: LIME and SHAP. Moreover, we investigate the effect of
counterfactual explanations and misclassifications on users ability to
understand and predict the model behavior. We find that the comprehensibility
of SHAP is significantly reduced when explanations are provided for samples
near a model's decision boundary. Furthermore, we find that counterfactual
explanations and misclassifications can significantly increase the users
understanding of how a machine learning model is making decisions. Based on our
findings, we also derive design recommendations for future post-hoc
explainability methods with increased comprehensibility and predictability.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-based mobile robot navigation systems in arable fields are mostly
limited to in-row navigation. The process of switching from one crop row to the
next in such systems is often aided by GNSS sensors or multiple camera setups.
This paper presents a novel vision-based crop row-switching algorithm that
enables a mobile robot to navigate an entire field of arable crops using a
single front-mounted camera. The proposed row-switching manoeuvre uses deep
learning-based RGB image segmentation and depth data to detect the end of the
crop row, and re-entry point to the next crop row which would be used in a
multi-state row switching pipeline. Each state of this pipeline use visual
feedback or wheel odometry of the robot to successfully navigate towards the
next crop row. The proposed crop row navigation pipeline was tested in a real
sugar beet field containing crop rows with discontinuities, varying light
levels, shadows and irregular headland surfaces. The robot could successfully
exit from one crop row and re-enter the next crop row using the proposed
pipeline with absolute median errors averaging at 19.25 cm and 6.77{\deg} for
linear and rotational steps of the proposed manoeuvre.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in game informatics have enabled us to find strong strategies
across a diverse range of games. However, these strategies are usually
difficult for humans to interpret. On the other hand, research in Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has seen a notable surge in scholarly activity.
Interpreting strong or near-optimal strategies or the game itself can provide
valuable insights. In this paper, we propose two methods to quantify the
feature importance using Shapley values: one for the game itself and another
for individual AIs. We empirically show that our proposed methods yield
intuitive explanations that resonate with and augment human understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) hold significant
importance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive
efforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the
development of proficient model-assisted selection methods. However, generating
high-quality solutions is a prerequisite for selection. The fundamental
paradigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within
SAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality
of offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not
gained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated
solutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed
to identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions
without evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two
tailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the
unevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on
two test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over
regression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the
surrogate-selected unevaluated solutions with high potential have been shown to
significantly enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.

scenarios is increasingly important due to their widespread use in various
applications. In this paper, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset
containing one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs.
This dataset is collected from 210K unique IP addresses in the wild on our
Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website. We offer an overview of the dataset's
content, including its curation process, basic statistics, and topic
distribution, highlighting its diversity, originality, and scale. We
demonstrate its versatility through four use cases: developing content
moderation models that perform similarly to GPT-4, building a safety benchmark,
training instruction-following models that perform similarly to Vicuna, and
creating challenging benchmark questions. We believe that this dataset will
serve as a valuable resource for understanding and advancing LLM capabilities.

addresses this gap. The first survey delineated correlations between robot
behavioral and physical attributes, perceived occupation suitability, and
gender attributions, suggesting that both design and perceived gender

<p class="mathjax">Perceiving and mapping the surroundings are essential for enabling autonomous
navigation in any robotic platform. The algorithm class that enables accurate
mapping while correcting the odometry errors present in most robotics systems
is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Today, fully onboard mapping
is only achievable on robotic platforms that can host high-wattage processors,
mainly due to the significant computational load and memory demands required
for executing SLAM algorithms. For this reason, pocket-size
hardware-constrained robots offload the execution of SLAM to external
infrastructures. To address the challenge of enabling SLAM algorithms on
resource-constrained processors, this paper proposes NanoSLAM, a lightweight
and optimized end-to-end SLAM approach specifically designed to operate on
centimeter-size robots at a power budget of only 87.9 mW. We demonstrate the
mapping capabilities in real-world scenarios and deploy NanoSLAM on a
nano-drone weighing 44 g and equipped with a novel commercial RISC-V low-power
parallel processor called GAP9. The algorithm is designed to leverage the
parallel capabilities of the RISC-V processing cores and enables mapping of a
general environment with an accuracy of 4.5 cm and an end-to-end execution time
of less than 250 ms.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised representation learning for human action recognition has
developed rapidly in recent years. Most of the existing works are based on
skeleton data while using a multi-modality setup. These works overlooked the
differences in performance among modalities, which led to the propagation of
erroneous knowledge between modalities while only three fundamental modalities,
i.e., joints, bones, and motions are used, hence no additional modalities are
explored.
<br />In this work, we first propose an Implicit Knowledge Exchange Module (IKEM)
which alleviates the propagation of erroneous knowledge between low-performance
modalities. Then, we further propose three new modalities to enrich the
complementary information between modalities. Finally, to maintain efficiency
when introducing new modalities, we propose a novel teacher-student framework
to distill the knowledge from the secondary modalities into the mandatory
modalities considering the relationship constrained by anchors, positives, and
negatives, named relational cross-modality knowledge distillation. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, unlocking
the efficient use of skeleton-based multi-modality data. Source code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/desehuileng0o0/IKEM.

<p class="mathjax">Topology optimization (TO) has experienced a dramatic development over the
last decades aided by the arising of metamaterials and additive manufacturing
(AM) techniques, and it is intended to achieve the current and future
challenges. In this paper we propose an extension for linear orthotropic
materials of a three-dimensional TO algorithm which directly operates on the
six elastic properties -- three longitudinal and shear moduli, having fixed
three Poisson ratios -- of the finite element (FE) discretization of certain
analysis domain. By performing a gradient-descent-alike optimization on these
properties, the standard deviation of a strain-energy measurement is minimized,
thus coming up with optimized, strain-homogenized structures with variable
longitudinal and shear stiffness in their different material directions. To
this end, an orthotropic formulation with two approaches -- direct or
strain-based and complementary or stress-based -- has been developed for this
optimization problem, being the stress-based more efficient as previous works
on this topic have shown.
<br />The key advantages that we propose are: (1) the use of orthotropic ahead of
isotropic materials, which enables a more versatile optimization process since
the design space is increased by six times, and (2) no constraint needs to be
imposed (such as maximum volume) in contrast to other methods widely used in
this field such as Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP), all of
this by setting one unique hyper-parameter. Results of four designed load cases
show that this orthotropic-TO algorithm outperforms the isotropic case, both
for the similar algorithm from which this is an extension and for a SIMP run in
a FE commercial software, presenting a comparable computational cost. We remark
that it works particularly effectively on pure shear or shear-governed problems
such as torsion loading.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous wheel loading involves selecting actions that maximize the total
performance over many repetitions. The actions should be well adapted to the
current state of the pile and its future states. Selecting the best actions is
difficult since the pile states are consequences of previous actions and thus
are highly unknown. To aid the selection of actions, this paper investigates
data-driven models to predict the loaded mass, time, work, and resulting pile
state of a loading action given the initial pile state. Deep neural networks
were trained on data using over 10,000 simulations to an accuracy of 91-97,%
with the pile state represented either by a heightmap or by its slope and
curvature. The net outcome of sequential loading actions is predicted by
repeating the model inference at five milliseconds per loading. As errors
accumulate during the inferences, long-horizon predictions need to be combined
with a physics-based model.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new approach to stabilizing high-order Runge-Kutta discontinuous
Galerkin (RKDG) schemes using weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)
reconstructions in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws. In contrast to
RKDG schemes that overwrite finite element solutions with WENO reconstructions,
our approach employs the reconstruction-based smoothness sensor presented by
Kuzmin and Vedral (J. Comput. Phys. 487:112153, 2023) to control the amount of
added numerical dissipation. Incorporating a dissipation-based WENO
stabilization term into a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization, the
proposed methodology achieves high-order accuracy while effectively capturing
discontinuities in the solution. As such, our approach offers an attractive
alternative to WENO-based slope limiters for DG schemes. The reconstruction
procedure that we use performs Hermite interpolation on stencils composed of a
mesh cell and its neighboring cells. The amount of numerical dissipation is
determined by the relative differences between the partial derivatives of
reconstructed candidate polynomials and those of the underlying finite element
approximation. The employed smoothness sensor takes all derivatives into
account to properly assess the local smoothness of a high-order DG solution.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our scheme to capture
discontinuities sharply. Optimal convergence rates are obtained for all
polynomial degrees.

<p class="mathjax">In the film industry, movie posters have been an essential part of
advertising and marketing for many decades, and continue to play a vital role
even today in the form of digital posters through online, social media and OTT
platforms. Typically, movie posters can effectively promote and communicate the
essence of a film, such as its genre, visual style/ tone, vibe and storyline
cue/ theme, which are essential to attract potential viewers. Identifying the
genres of a movie often has significant practical applications in recommending
the film to target audiences. Previous studies on movie genre identification
are limited to subtitles, plot synopses, and movie scenes that are mostly
accessible after the movie release. Posters usually contain pre-release
implicit information to generate mass interest. In this paper, we work for
automated multi-label genre identification only from movie poster images,
without any aid of additional textual/meta-data information about movies, which
is one of the earliest attempts of its kind. Here, we present a deep
transformer network with a probabilistic module to identify the movie genres
exclusively from the poster. For experimental analysis, we procured 13882
number of posters of 13 genres from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), where
our model performances were encouraging and even outperformed some major
contemporary architectures.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization under a knapsack
constraint ($\kSMK$) over the ground set size $n$ has been raised in many
applications in machine learning, such as data summarization, information
propagation, etc. However, existing algorithms for the problem are facing
questioning of how to overcome the non-monotone case and how to fast return a
good solution in case of the big size of data. This paper introduces two
deterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively
improve the query complexity of existing algorithms.
<br />Our first algorithm, $\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within
$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\RLA$, improves the approximation
ratio to $1/5-\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\epsilon$ is an input
parameter.
<br />Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios
within only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,
therefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a
factor of $\Omega(\log n)$.
<br />Besides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with
several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor
Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure
theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques and significantly reduce the
number of queries.

<p class="mathjax">Building segmentation is essential in infrastructure development, population
management, and geological observations. This article targets shallow models
due to their interpretable nature to assess the presence of LiDAR data for
supervised segmentation. The benchmark data used in this article are published
in NORA MapAI competition for deep learning model. Shallow models are compared
with deep learning models based on Intersection over Union (IoU) and Boundary
Intersection over Union (BIoU). In the proposed work, boundary masks from the
original mask are generated to improve the BIoU score, which relates to
building shapes' borderline. The influence of LiDAR data is tested by training
the model with only aerial images in task 1 and a combination of aerial and
LiDAR data in task 2 and then compared. shallow models outperform deep learning
models in IoU by 8% using aerial images (task 1) only and 2% in combined aerial
images and LiDAR data (task 2). In contrast, deep learning models show better
performance on BIoU scores. Boundary masks improve BIoU scores by 4% in both
tasks. Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) performs better than RF and
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to
predict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic
conditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex
spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from
satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it
comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing
non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of
message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails
to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph
Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise
relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model
dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by
aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture
high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an
interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood
interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a
holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal
pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive
experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing
baselines.

<p class="mathjax">To integrate action recognition methods into autonomous robotic systems, it
is crucial to consider adverse situations involving target occlusions. Such a
scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower robots
with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective
method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means
clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar
samples. Next, we employ K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) to fill in missing skeleton
data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton
sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant
benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised models. Meanwhile, building
on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce
an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework. This
enhancement utilizes Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) for better use of
high-quality, intact skeletons. The effectiveness of our imputation methods is
verified on the challenging occluded versions of the NTURGB+D 60 and NTURGB+D
120. The source code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/cyfml/OPSTL.

<p class="mathjax">In response to the limitations of manual online ad production, significant
research has been conducted in the field of automatic ad text generation (ATG).
However, comparing different methods has been challenging because of the lack
of benchmarks encompassing the entire field and the absence of well-defined
problem sets with clear model inputs and outputs. To address these challenges,
this paper aims to advance the field of ATG by introducing a redesigned task
and constructing a benchmark. Specifically, we defined ATG as a
cross-application task encompassing various aspects of the Internet
advertising. As part of our contribution, we propose a first benchmark dataset,
CA Multimodal Evaluation for Ad Text GeneRAtion (CAMERA), carefully designed
for ATG to be able to leverage multi-modal information and conduct an
industry-wise evaluation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our
proposed benchmark through evaluation experiments using multiple baseline
models, which vary in terms of the type of pre-trained language model used and
the incorporation of multi-modal information. We also discuss the current state
of the task and the future challenges.

total weighted completion time. For a single machine several $2$-approximation
algorithms are known, which are based on linear programming and network flows.
We show that the same ratio is achieved by a simple weighted round-robin rule.
Moreover, for preemptive scheduling on identical parallel machines, we give a
strongly polynomial $3$-approximation, which computes processing rates by
solving a sequence of parametric flow problems. This matches the best known
constant performance guarantee, previously attained only by a weakly polynomial
LP-based algorithm. Our algorithms are both also applicable in non-clairvoyant
scheduling, where processing times are initially unknown. In this setting, our
performance guarantees improve upon the best competitive ratio of $8$ known so
far.

<p class="mathjax">Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.

simultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a
person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by
introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles
face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training
on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various
poses and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we
encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of
latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face
attributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the
remaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art
models.

<p class="mathjax">The field of visual object tracking is dominated by methods that combine
simple tracking algorithms and ad hoc schemes. Probabilistic tracking
algorithms, which are leading in other fields, are surprisingly absent from the
leaderboards. We found that accounting for distance in target kinematics,
exploiting detector confidence and modelling non-uniform clutter
characteristics is critical for a probabilistic tracker to work in visual
tracking. Previous probabilistic methods fail to address most or all these
aspects, which we believe is why they fall so far behind current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (there are no probabilistic trackers in the
MOT17 top 100). To rekindle progress among probabilistic approaches, we propose
a set of pragmatic models addressing these challenges, and demonstrate how they
can be incorporated into a probabilistic framework. We present BASE (Bayesian
Approximation Single-hypothesis Estimator), a simple, performant and easily
extendible visual tracker, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MOT17 and
MOT20, without using Re-Id. Code will be made available at

<p class="mathjax">Despite the growing popularity of machine-learning techniques in
decision-making, the added value of causal-oriented strategies with respect to
pure machine-learning approaches has rarely been quantified in the literature.
These strategies are crucial for practitioners in various domains, such as
marketing, telecommunications, health care and finance. This paper presents a
comprehensive treatment of the subject, starting from firm theoretical
foundations and highlighting the parameters that influence the performance of
the uplift and predictive approaches. The focus of the paper is on a binary
outcome case and a binary action, and the paper presents a theoretical analysis
of uplift modeling, comparing it with the classical predictive approach. The
main research contributions of the paper include a new formulation of the
measure of profit, a formal proof of the convergence of the uplift curve to the
measure of profit ,and an illustration, through simulations, of the conditions
under which predictive approaches still outperform uplift modeling. We show
that the mutual information between the features and the outcome plays a
significant role, along with the variance of the estimators, the distribution
of the potential outcomes and the underlying costs and benefits of the
treatment and the outcome.

In this paper, we present a novel method for online learning of grasp
predictions for robotic bin picking in a principled way. Existing grasp
prediction approaches are mostly based on offline learning, while, ignored the
exploratory grasp learning during online adaptation to new picking scenarios,
i.e., unseen object portfolio, camera and bin settings etc. In this paper, we
present a novel method for online learning of grasp predictions for robotic bin
picking in a principled way. Specifically, the online learning algorithm with
an effective exploration strategy can significantly improve its adaptation
performance to unseen environment settings. To this end, we first propose to
formulate online grasp learning as a RL problem that will allow to adapt both
grasp reward prediction and grasp poses. We propose various uncertainty
estimation schemes based on Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and
Distributional Ensembles. We carry out evaluations on real-world bin picking
scenes of varying difficulty. The objects in the bin have various challenging
physical and perceptual characteristics that can be characterized by semi- or
total transparency, and irregular or curved surfaces. The results of our
experiments demonstrate a notable improvement in the suggested approach
compared to conventional online learning methods which incorporate only naive
exploration strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Privacy-preserving learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) has
the potential for strong utility-privacy tradeoffs for tabular data, such as
census data or medical meta data: classical GBDT learners can extract
non-linear patterns from small sized datasets. The state-of-the-art notion for
provable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the
impact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel
differentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve
the utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach
with tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to
prior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for
$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\'enyi filters to our method to
learn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative
training process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a
natural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We
incorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy
budget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.
Our evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($&lt;4k$ training data points) a
$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only
achieved for $\varepsilon=10.0$. On the Adult dataset ($50k$ training data
points) we achieve test error of $18.7\,\%$ for $\varepsilon=0.07$ which the
closest prior work only achieved for $\varepsilon=1.0$. For the Abalone dataset
for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve $R^2$-score of $0.47$ which is very close to
the $R^2$-score of $0.54$ for the nonprivate version of GBDT. For the Adult
dataset for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve test error $17.1\,\%$ which is very
close to the test error $13.7\,\%$ of the nonprivate version of GBDT.

<p class="mathjax">For improving image composition and aesthetic quality, most existing methods
modulate the captured images by striking out redundant content near the image
borders. However, such image cropping methods are limited in the range of image
views. Some methods have been suggested to extrapolate the images and predict
cropping boxes from the extrapolated image. Nonetheless, the synthesized
extrapolated regions may be included in the cropped image, making the image
composition result not real and potentially with degraded image quality. In
this paper, we circumvent this issue by presenting a joint framework for both
unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition (i.e., UNIC). In
this way, the cropped image is a sub-image of the image acquired by the
predicted camera view, and thus can be guaranteed to be real and consistent in
image quality. Specifically, our framework takes the current camera preview
frame as input and provides a recommendation for view adjustment, which
contains operations unlimited by the image borders, such as zooming in or out
and camera movement. To improve the prediction accuracy of view adjustment
prediction, we further extend the field of view by feature extrapolation. After
one or several times of view adjustments, our method converges and results in
both a camera view and a bounding box showing the image composition
recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the datasets constructed
upon existing image cropping datasets, showing the effectiveness of our UNIC in
unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition. The source code,
dataset, and pretrained models is available at
https://github.com/liuxiaoyu1104/UNIC.

<p class="mathjax">Existing time-resolved non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging methods reconstruct
hidden scenes by inverting the optical paths of indirect illumination measured
at visible relay surfaces. These methods are prone to reconstruction artifacts
due to inversion ambiguities and capture noise, which are typically mitigated
through the manual selection of filtering functions and parameters. We
introduce a fully-differentiable end-to-end NLOS inverse rendering pipeline
that self-calibrates the imaging parameters during the reconstruction of hidden
scenes, using as input only the measured illumination while working both in the
time and frequency domains. Our pipeline extracts a geometric representation of
the hidden scene from NLOS volumetric intensities and estimates the
time-resolved illumination at the relay wall produced by such geometric
information using differentiable transient rendering. We then use gradient
descent to optimize imaging parameters by minimizing the error between our
simulated time-resolved illumination and the measured illumination. Our
end-to-end differentiable pipeline couples diffraction-based volumetric NLOS
reconstruction with path-space light transport and a simple ray marching
technique to extract detailed, dense sets of surface points and normals of
hidden scenes. We demonstrate the robustness of our method to consistently
reconstruct geometry and albedo, even under significant noise levels.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient routing algorithms based on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) play
an important role in emerging intelligent transportation systems. This highly
dynamic topology faces a number of wireless communication service challenges.
In this paper, we propose a protocol based on reinforcement learning and
vehicle node clustering, the protocol is called Qucts, solve
vehicle-to-fixed-destination or V2V messaging problems. Improve message
delivery rates with minimal hops and latency, link stability is also taken into
account. The agreement is divided into three levels, first cluster the
vehicles, each cluster head broadcasts its own coordinates and speed, to get
more cluster members. Also when a cluster member receives another cluster head
broadcast message, the cluster head generates a list of surrounding clusters,
find the best cluster to the destination as the next cluster during message
passing. Second, the protocol constructs a Q-value table based on the state
after clustering, used to participate in the selection of messaging clusters.
Finally, we introduce parameters that express the stability of the vehicle
within the cluster, for communication node selection. This protocol hierarchy
makes Qucts an offline and online solution. In order to distinguish unstable
nodes within a cluster, Coding of each road, will have vehicles with planned
routes, For example, car hailing and public bus. Compare the overlap with other
planned paths vehicles in the cluster, low overlap is labeled as unstable
nodes. Vehicle path overlap rate without a planned path is set to the mean
value. Comparing Qucts with existing routing protocols through simulation, Our
proposed Qucts scheme provides large improvements in both data delivery rate
and end-to-end delay reduction.

localized Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for Arabic, a language with
unique cultural characteristics that are not adequately addressed by current
mainstream models like ChatGPT. Key concerns additionally arise when
considering cultural sensitivity and local values. To this end, the paper
outlines a packaged solution, including further pre-training with Arabic texts,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using native Arabic instructions and GPT-4

a reward model that is sensitive to local culture and values. The objective is
to train culturally aware and value-aligned Arabic LLMs that can serve the
diverse application-specific needs of Arabic-speaking communities.
<br />Extensive evaluations demonstrated that the resulting LLM called
`\textbf{AceGPT}' is the SOTA open Arabic LLM in various benchmarks, including

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents BELT, a novel model and learning framework for the
pivotal topic of brain-to-language translation research. The translation from
noninvasive brain signals into readable natural language has the potential to
promote the application scenario as well as the development of brain-computer
interfaces (BCI) as a whole. The critical problem in brain signal decoding or
brain-to-language translation is the acquisition of semantically appropriate
and discriminative EEG representation from a dataset of limited scale and
quality. The proposed BELT method is a generic and efficient framework that
bootstraps EEG representation learning using off-the-shelf large-scale
pretrained language models (LMs). With a large LM's capacity for understanding
semantic information and zero-shot generalization, BELT utilizes large LMs
trained on Internet-scale datasets to bring significant improvements to the
understanding of EEG signals.
<br />In particular, the BELT model is composed of a deep conformer encoder and a
vector quantization encoder. Semantical EEG representation is achieved by a
contrastive learning step that provides natural language supervision. We
achieve state-of-the-art results on two featuring brain decoding tasks
including the brain-to-language translation and zero-shot sentiment
classification. Specifically, our model surpasses the baseline model on both
tasks by 5.45% and over 10% and archives a 42.31% BLEU-1 score and 67.32%
precision on the main evaluation metrics for translation and zero-shot
sentiment classification respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a group of peptides that exhibite
antineoplastic properties. The utilization of ACPs in cancer prevention can
present a viable substitute for conventional cancer therapeutics, as they
possess a higher degree of selectivity and safety. Recent scientific
advancements generate an interest in peptide-based therapies which offer the
advantage of efficiently treating intended cells without negatively impacting
normal cells. However, as the number of peptide sequences continues to increase
rapidly, developing a reliable and precise prediction model becomes a
challenging task. In this work, our motivation is to advance an efficient model
for categorizing anticancer peptides employing the consolidation of word
embedding and deep learning models. First, Word2Vec and FastText are evaluated
as word embedding techniques for the purpose of extracting peptide sequences.
Then, the output of word embedding models are fed into deep learning approaches
CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM. To demonstrate the contribution of proposed framework,
extensive experiments are carried on widely-used datasets in the literature,
ACPs250 and Independent. Experiment results show the usage of proposed model
enhances classification accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art studies.
The proposed combination, FastText+BiLSTM, exhibits 92.50% of accuracy for
ACPs250 dataset, and 96.15% of accuracy for Independent dataset, thence
determining new state-of-the-art.

and dynamic nature of the game, as well as the interactions between players.
This article provides a comprehensive overview of this task divided into action
recognition, spotting, and spatio-temporal action localization, with a
particular emphasis on the modalities used and multimodal methods. We explore
the publicly available data sources and metrics used to evaluate models'
performance. The article reviews recent state-of-the-art methods that leverage
deep learning techniques and traditional methods. We focus on multimodal
methods, which integrate information from multiple sources, such as video and
audio data, and also those that represent one source in various ways. The
advantages and limitations of methods are discussed, along with their potential
for improving the accuracy and robustness of models. Finally, the article
highlights some of the open research questions and future directions in the
field of soccer action recognition, including the potential for multimodal
methods to advance this field. Overall, this survey provides a valuable

interact with computers, allowing the construction of complex questions and the
ability to reason over a sequence of statements, their use is restricted due to
the need for dedicated hardware for execution. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of LLMs based on the 7 and 13 billion LLaMA models, subjected to a
quantization process and run on home hardware. The models considered were
Alpaca, Koala, and Vicuna. To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, we
developed a database containing 1,006 questions from the ENEM (Brazilian
National Secondary School Exam). Our analysis revealed that the best performing
models achieved an accuracy of approximately 46% for the original texts of the
Portuguese questions and 49% on their English translations. In addition, we
evaluated the computational efficiency of the models by measuring the time
required for execution. On average, the 7 and 13 billion LLMs took
approximately 20 and 50 seconds, respectively, to process the queries on a
machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600x processor

<p class="mathjax">Prompt Tuning is emerging as a scalable and cost-effective method to
fine-tune Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). This study benchmarks the
performance and computational efficiency of Prompt Tuning and baseline methods
on a multi-label text classification task. This is applied to the use case of
classifying companies into an investment firm's proprietary industry taxonomy,
supporting their thematic investment strategy. Text-to-text classification with
PLMs is frequently reported to outperform classification with a classification
head, but has several limitations when applied to a multi-label classification
problem where each label consists of multiple tokens: (a) Generated labels may
not match any label in the industry taxonomy; (b) During fine-tuning, multiple
labels must be provided in an arbitrary order; (c) The model provides a binary
decision for each label, rather than an appropriate confidence score.
Limitation (a) is addressed by applying constrained decoding using Trie Search,
which slightly improves classification performance. All limitations (a), (b),
and (c) are addressed by replacing the PLM's language head with a
classification head. This improves performance significantly, while also
reducing computational costs during inference. The results indicate the
continuing need to adapt state-of-the-art methods to domain-specific tasks,
even in the era of PLMs with strong generalization abilities.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of learning multiple tasks in a continual learning
setting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a
streaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called
"catastrophic forgetting problem", in which the performance of the learner in
an "old task" decreases when subsequently trained on a "new task". Existing
continual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)
and Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by
minimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for
previous tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task
changes, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need
to provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online
clustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or
gradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of
the hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which
the problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach
by applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,
which lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">How to realize high-level autonomy of individuals is one of key technical
issues to promote swarm intelligence of multi-agent (node) systems with
collective tasks, while the fully distributed design is a potential way to
achieve this goal. This paper works on the fully distributed state estimation
and cooperative stabilization problem of linear time-invariant (LTI) plants
with multiple nodes communicating over general directed graphs, and is aimed to
provide a fully distributed framework for each node to perform cooperative
stabilization tasks. First, by incorporating a novel adaptive law, a
consensus-based estimator is designed for each node to obtain the plant state
based on its local measurement and local interaction with neighbors, without
using any global information of the communication topology. Subsequently, a
local controller is developed for each node to stabilize the plant
collaboratively with performance guaranteed under mild conditions.
Specifically, the proposed method only requires that the communication graph be
strongly connected, and the plant be collectively controllable and observable.
Further, the proposed method can be applied to pure fully distributed state
estimation scenarios and modified for noise-bounded LTI plants. Finally, two
numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical
results.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown great potential in medical image
analysis, improving the generalizability of the learned features and the
performance in individual tasks. However, most of the work on MTL focuses on
either architecture design or gradient manipulation, while in both scenarios,
features are learned in a competitive manner. In this work, we propose to
formulate MTL as a multi/bi-level optimization problem, and therefore force
features to learn from each task in a cooperative approach. Specifically, we
update the sub-model for each task alternatively taking advantage of the
learned sub-models of the other tasks. To alleviate the negative transfer
problem during the optimization, we search for flat minima for the current
objective function with regard to features from other tasks. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, we validate our method on three
publicly available datasets. The proposed method shows the advantage of
cooperative learning, and yields promising results when compared with the
state-of-the-art MTL approaches. The code will be available online.

<p class="mathjax">We describe SemEval-2022 Task 7, a shared task on rating the plausibility of
clarifications in instructional texts. The dataset for this task consists of
manually clarified how-to guides for which we generated alternative
clarifications and collected human plausibility judgements. The task of
participating systems was to automatically determine the plausibility of a
clarification in the respective context. In total, 21 participants took part in
this task, with the best system achieving an accuracy of 68.9%. This report
summarizes the results and findings from 8 teams and their system descriptions.
Finally, we show in an additional evaluation that predictions by the top
participating team make it possible to identify contexts with multiple
plausible clarifications with an accuracy of 75.2%.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a one-dimensional singularly perturbed 4th order problem with the
additional feature of a shift term. An expansion into a smooth term, boundary
layers and an inner layer yields a formal solution decomposition, and together
with a stability result we have estimates for the subsequent numerical
analysis. With classical layer adapted meshes we present a numerical method,
that achieves supercloseness and optimal convergence orders in the associated
energy norm. We also consider coarser meshes in view of the weak layers. Some
numerical examples conclude the paper and support the theory.

<p class="mathjax">Encoder-decoder networks become a popular choice for various medical image
segmentation tasks. When they are trained with a standard loss function, these
networks are not explicitly enforced to preserve the shape integrity of an
object in an image. However, this ability of the network is important to obtain
more accurate results, especially when there is a low-contrast difference
between the object and its surroundings. In response to this issue, this work
introduces a new shape-aware loss function, which we name FourierLoss. This
loss function relies on quantifying the shape dissimilarity between the ground
truth and the predicted segmentation maps through the Fourier descriptors
calculated on their objects, and penalizing this dissimilarity in network
training. Different than the previous studies, FourierLoss offers an adaptive
loss function with trainable hyperparameters that control the importance of the
level of the shape details that the network is enforced to learn in the
training process. This control is achieved by the proposed adaptive loss update
mechanism, which end-to-end learns the hyperparameters simultaneously with the
network weights by backpropagation. As a result of using this mechanism, the
network can dynamically change its attention from learning the general outline
of an object to learning the details of its contour points, or vice versa, in
different training epochs. Working on 2879 computed tomography images of 93
subjects, our experiments revealed that the proposed adaptive shape-aware loss
function led to statistically significantly better results for liver
segmentation, compared to its counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel efficient and robust Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Finite
Element Method (WEMsFEM) motivated by \cite{MR3980476,GL18} to solve the
singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations. The main idea is to first
establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local
bubble part and local Harmonic extension part, and then derive a global
splitting by means of Partition of Unity. This facilitates a representation of
the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global Harmonic
extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To
approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space
locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a
guaranteed approximation rate without higher regularity requirement on the
solution. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable
convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size or the regularity of
the solution. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of
freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d
numerical tests.

<p class="mathjax">In this era of large language models (LLMs), the traditional training of
models has become increasingly unimaginable for regular users and institutions.
The exploration of efficient fine-tuning for high-resource languages on these
models is an undeniable trend that is gradually gaining popularity. However,
there has been very little exploration for various low-resource languages, such
as Tibetan. Research in Tibetan NLP is inherently scarce and limited. While
there is currently no existing large language model for Tibetan due to its
low-resource nature, that day will undoubtedly arrive. Therefore, research on
efficient fine-tuning for low-resource language models like Tibetan is highly
necessary. Our research can serve as a reference to fill this crucial gap.
Efficient fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained language models (PLMs) in
Tibetan have seen minimal exploration. We conducted three types of efficient
fine-tuning experiments on the publicly available TNCC-title dataset:
"prompt-tuning," "Adapter lightweight fine-tuning," and "prompt-tuning +
Adapter fine-tuning." The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements using these methods, providing valuable insights for advancing
Tibetan language applications in the context of pre-trained models.

<p class="mathjax">Many applications of cross-modal music retrieval are related to connecting
sheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this
is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates
short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate
similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy
are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the
inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music
snippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we
address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network
that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of
corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it
only requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the
recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations
between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic
and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method
leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Although the uncertainties of the workers can be addressed by the standard
Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) framework in existing proposals through
a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, we may not have sufficient
budget to enable the trade-off among the individual workers, especially when
the number of the workers is huge while the budget is limited. Moreover, the
standard CMAB usually assumes the workers always stay in the system, whereas
the workers may join in or depart from the system over time, such that what we
have learnt for an individual worker cannot be applied after the worker leaves.
To address the above challenging issues, in this paper, we first propose an
off-line Context-Aware CMAB-based Incentive (CACI) mechanism. We innovate in
leveraging the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a elaborately partitioned
context space instead of the individual workers, to effectively incentivize the
massive unknown workers with very limited budget. We also extend the above
basic idea to the on-line setting where unknown workers may join in or depart
from the systems dynamically, and propose an on-line version of the CACI
mechanism. Specifically, by the exploitation-exploration trade-off in the
context space, we learn to estimate the sensing ability of any unknown worker
(even it never appeared in the system before) according to its context
information. We perform rigorous theoretical analysis to reveal the upper
bounds on the regrets of our CACI mechanisms and to prove their truthfulness
and individual rationality, respectively. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets are also conducted to verify the efficacy of our
mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">While videoconferencing is prevalent, concurrent participation channels are
limited. People experience challenges keeping up with the discussion, and
misunderstanding frequently occurs. Through a formative study, we probed into
the design space of providing real-time transcripts as an extra communication
space for video meeting attendees. We then present MeetScript, a system that
provides parallel participation channels through real-time interactive
transcripts. MeetScript visualizes the discussion through a chat-alike
interface and allows meeting attendees to make real-time collaborative
annotations. Over time, MeetScript gradually hides extraneous content to retain
the most essential information on the transcript, with the goal of reducing the
cognitive load required on users to process the information in real time. In an
experiment with 80 users in 22 teams, we compared MeetScript with two baseline
conditions where participants used Zoom alone (business-as-usual), or Zoom with
an adds-on transcription service (Otter.ai). We found that MeetScript
significantly enhanced people's non-verbal participation and recollection of
their teams' decision-making processes compared to the baselines. Users liked
that MeetScript allowed them to easily navigate the transcript and
contextualize feedback and new ideas with existing ones.

<p class="mathjax">Instructional texts for specific target groups should ideally take into
account the prior knowledge and needs of the readers in order to guide them
efficiently to their desired goals. However, targeting specific groups also
carries the risk of reflecting disparate social norms and subtle stereotypes.
In this paper, we investigate the extent to which how-to guides from one
particular platform, wikiHow, differ in practice depending on the intended
audience. We conduct two case studies in which we examine qualitative features
of texts written for specific audiences. In a generalization study, we
investigate which differences can also be systematically demonstrated using
computational methods. The results of our studies show that guides from
wikiHow, like other text genres, are subject to subtle biases. We aim to raise
awareness of these inequalities as a first step to addressing them in future
work.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years face recognition systems have been brought to the mainstream
due to development in hardware and software. Consistent efforts are being made
to make them better and more secure. This has also brought developments in 3D
face recognition systems at a rapid pace. These 3DFR systems are expected to
overcome certain vulnerabilities of 2DFR systems. One such problem that the
domain of 2DFR systems face is face image morphing. A substantial amount of
research is being done for generation of high quality face morphs along with
detection of attacks from these morphs. Comparatively the understanding of
vulnerability of 3DFR systems against 3D face morphs is less. But at the same
time an expectation is set from 3DFR systems to be more robust against such
attacks. This paper attempts to research and gain more information on this
matter. The paper describes a couple of methods that can be used to generate 3D
face morphs. The face morphs that are generated using this method are then
compared to the contributing faces to obtain similarity scores. The highest
MMPMR is obtained around 40% with RMMR of 41.76% when 3DFRS are attacked with
look-a-like morphs.

<p class="mathjax">Software is often abandoned or shut down, for one reason or another, and
whilst research on academic open source software is sparse, there seems little
reason to assume it is any different. While some reasons may be
straightforward, e.g. a sole maintainer has moved on, or grant funding has
ceased - some projects are able to withstand these barriers and may remain
active and maintained despite adversity. This study monitored open source
projects over the period of a year, measuring common performance indicators,
using both subjective and qualitative measures (participant surveys), as well
as using scripts to analyse indicators associated with these projects' online
source control codebases. We find that these health indicators can not be used
as cross project benchmarks, due to the significant variation in context for
each project. They can, however, often be useful in signifying changes in a
single project's health, providing they are not used to compare between
different unrelated projects.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks have become a prominent approach to solve inverse problems in
recent years. While a plethora of such methods was developed to solve inverse
problems empirically, we are still lacking clear theoretical guarantees for
these methods. On the other hand, many works proved convergence to optimal
solutions of neural networks in a more general setting using
overparametrization as a way to control the Neural Tangent Kernel. In this work
we investigate how to bridge these two worlds and we provide deterministic
convergence and recovery guarantees for the class of unsupervised feedforward
multilayer neural networks trained to solve inverse problems. We also derive
overparametrization bounds under which a two-layers Deep Inverse Prior network
with smooth activation function will benefit from our guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents an unprecedented
opportunity to automate construction contract management, reducing human errors
and saving significant time and costs. However, LLMs may produce convincing yet
inaccurate and misleading content due to a lack of domain expertise. To address
this issue, expert-driven contract knowledge can be represented in a structured
manner to constrain the automatic contract management process. This paper
introduces the Nested Contract Knowledge Graph (NCKG), a knowledge
representation approach that captures the complexity of contract knowledge
using a nested structure. It includes a nested knowledge representation
framework, a NCKG ontology built on the framework, and an implementation
method. Furthermore, we present the LLM-assisted contract review pipeline
enhanced with external knowledge in NCKG. Our pipeline achieves a promising
performance in contract risk reviewing, shedding light on the combination of
LLM and KG towards more reliable and interpretable contract management.

<p class="mathjax">Linking sheet music images to audio recordings remains a key problem for the
development of efficient cross-modal music retrieval systems. One of the
fundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding
space via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio
and sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical
content affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval
scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation
with self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large
amount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly
augmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.
Through a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that
pre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all
scenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we
employ the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece
identification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval
configurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves
from 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by
arguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for
alleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.

<p class="mathjax">While resources for English language are fairly sufficient to understand
content on social media, similar resources in Arabic are still immature. The
main reason that the resources in Arabic are insufficient is that Arabic has
many dialects in addition to the standard version (MSA). Arabs do not use MSA
in their daily communications; rather, they use dialectal versions.
Unfortunately, social users transfer this phenomenon into their use of social
media platforms, which in turn has raised an urgent need for building suitable
AI models for language-dependent applications. Existing machine translation
(MT) systems designed for MSA fail to work well with Arabic dialects. In light
of this, it is necessary to adapt to the informal nature of communication on
social networks by developing MT systems that can effectively handle the
various dialects of Arabic. Unlike for MSA that shows advanced progress in MT
systems, little effort has been exerted to utilize Arabic dialects for MT
systems. While few attempts have been made to build translation datasets for
dialectal Arabic, they are domain dependent and are not OSN cultural-language
friendly. In this work, we attempt to alleviate these limitations by proposing
an online social network-based multidialect Arabic dataset that is crafted by
contextually translating English tweets into four Arabic dialects: Gulf,
Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine. To perform the translation, we followed our
proposed guideline framework for content translation, which could be
universally applicable for translation between foreign languages and local
dialects. We validated the authenticity of our proposed dataset by developing
neural MT models for four Arabic dialects. Our results have shown a superior
performance of our NMT models trained using our dataset. We believe that our
dataset can reliably serve as an Arabic multidialectal translation dataset for
informal MT tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Benchmarking, standards and certification are closely related processes.
Standards can provide normative requirements that robotics and AI systems may
or may not conform to. Certification generally relies upon conformance with one
or more standards as the key determinant of granting a certificate to operate.
And benchmarks are sets of standardised tests against which robots and AI
systems can be measured. Benchmarks therefore can be thought of as informal
standards. In this paper we will develop these themes with examples from
benchmarking, standards and certification, and argue that these three linked
processes are not only useful but vital to the broader practice of Responsible
Innovation.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of 3D object detection systems for self-driving cars
has significantly improved accuracy. However, these systems struggle to
generalize across diverse driving environments, which can lead to
safety-critical failures in detecting traffic participants. To address this, we
propose a method that utilizes unlabeled repeated traversals of multiple
locations to adapt object detectors to new driving environments. By
incorporating statistics computed from repeated LiDAR scans, we guide the
adaptation process effectively. Our approach enhances LiDAR-based detection
models using spatial quantized historical features and introduces a lightweight
regression head to leverage the statistics for feature regularization.
Additionally, we leverage the statistics for a novel self-training process to
stabilize the training. The framework is detector model-agnostic and
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements,
achieving up to a 20-point performance gain, especially in detecting
pedestrians and distant objects. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We present here a new splitting method to solve Lyapunov equations in a
Kronecker product form. Although this resulting matrix is of order $n^2$, each
iteration demands two operations with the matrix $A$: a multiplication of the
form $(A-\sigma I) \tilde{B}$ and a inversion of the form $(A-\sigma
I)^{-1}\tilde{B}$. We see that for some choice of a parameter the iteration
matrix is such that all their eigenvalues are in absolute value less than 1.
Moreover we present a theorem that enables us to get a good starting vector for
the method.

architecture of artificial neural network used for black-box modelling of
dynamic systems with time delays has been addressed in this paper. The proposed
algorithm is based on a well-known NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies
(NEAT) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm has been adjusted by allowing additional
connections within an artificial neural network and developing original
specialised evolutionary operators. This resulted in a compromise between the
size of neural network and its accuracy in capturing the response of the
mathematical model under which it has been learnt. The research involved an
extended validation study based on data generated from a mathematical model of
an exemplary system as well as the fast processes occurring in a pressurised
water nuclear reactor. The obtaining simulation results demonstrate the high
effectiveness of the devised neural (black-box) models of dynamic systems with
time delays.

<p class="mathjax">Similarity caching allows requests for an item to be served by a similar
item. Applications include recommendation systems, multimedia retrieval, and
machine learning. Recently, many similarity caching policies have been
proposed, like SIM-LRU and RND-LRU, but the performance analysis of their hit
rate is still wanting. In this paper, we show how to extend the popular
time-to-live approximation in classic caching to similarity caching. In
particular, we propose a method to estimate the hit rate of the similarity
caching policy RND-LRU. Our method, the RND-TTL approximation, introduces the
RND-TTL cache model and then tunes its parameters in such a way to mimic the
behavior of RND-LRU. The parameter tuning involves solving a fixed point system
of equations for which we provide an algorithm for numerical resolution and
sufficient conditions for its convergence. Our approach for approximating the
hit rate of RND-LRU is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces.

<p class="mathjax">A range of applications of multi-modal music information retrieval is centred
around the problem of connecting large collections of sheet music (images) to
corresponding audio recordings, that is, identifying pairs of audio and score
excerpts that refer to the same musical content. One of the typical and most
recent approaches to this task employs cross-modal deep learning architectures
to learn joint embedding spaces that link the two distinct modalities - audio
and sheet music images. While there has been steady improvement on this front
over the past years, a number of open problems still prevent large-scale
employment of this methodology. In this article we attempt to provide an
insightful examination of the current developments on audio-sheet music
retrieval via deep learning methods. We first identify a set of main challenges
on the road towards robust and large-scale cross-modal music retrieval in real
scenarios. We then highlight the steps we have taken so far to address some of
these challenges, documenting step-by-step improvement along several
dimensions. We conclude by analysing the remaining challenges and present ideas
for solving these, in order to pave the way to a unified and robust methodology
for cross-modal music retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">Information Forensics and Security (IFS) is an active R&amp;D area whose goal is
to ensure that people use devices, data, and intellectual properties for
authorized purposes and to facilitate the gathering of solid evidence to hold
perpetrators accountable. For over a quarter century since the 1990s, the IFS
research area has grown tremendously to address the societal needs of the
digital information era. The IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) has emerged
as an important hub and leader in this area, and the article below celebrates
some landmark technical contributions. In particular, we highlight the major
technological advances on some selected focus areas in the field developed in
the last 25 years from the research community and present future trends.

<p class="mathjax">Flow control aims at modifying a natural flow state to reach an other flow
state considered as advantageous. In this paper, active feedback flow
separation control is investigated with two different closed-loop control
strategies, involving a reference signal tracking architecture. Firstly, a
data-driven control law, leading to a linear (integral) controller is employed.
Secondly, a phenomenological/model-driven approach, leading to a non-linear
positive (integral) control strategy is investigated. While the former benefits
of a tuning simplicity, the latter prevents undesirable effects and formally
guarantees closed-loop stability. Both control approaches were validated
through wind tunnel experiments of flow separation over a movable NACA 4412
plain flap. These control laws were designed with respect to hot film
measurements, performed over the flap for different deflection angles. Both
control approaches proved efficient in avoiding flow separation. The main
contribution of this work is to provide practitioners simple but yet efficient
ways to design a flow separation controller. In addition, a complete validation
campaign data-set is provided.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality conversational datasets are integral to the successful
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that employ a Large Language
Model (LLM) backend. These datasets, when used to fine-tune the LLM backend,
significantly enhance the quality of interactions between students and ITS. A
common strategy for developing these datasets involves generating synthetic
student-teacher dialogues using advanced GPT-4 models. However, challenges
arise when these dialogues demand complex calculations, common in subjects like
physics. Despite its advanced capabilities, GPT-4's performance falls short in
reliably handling even simple multiplication tasks, marking a significant
limitation in its utility for these subjects. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces an innovative stateful prompt design. Our approach generates a
mock conversation between a student and a tutorbot, both roles simulated by
GPT-4. Each student response triggers a soliloquy (an inner monologue) in the
GPT-tutorbot, which assesses whether its response would necessitate
calculations. If so, it proceeds to script the required code in Python and then
uses the resulting output to construct its response to the student. Our
approach notably enhances the quality of synthetic conversation datasets,
especially for subjects that are calculation-intensive. Our findings show that
our Higgs model -- a LLaMA finetuned with datasets generated through our novel
stateful prompt design -- proficiently utilizes Python for computations.
Consequently, finetuning with our datasets enriched with code soliloquies
enhances not just the accuracy but also the computational reliability of Higgs'
responses.

<p class="mathjax">To exploit the expressivity of being able to refer to the type of types, such
as for large elimination, dependent type systems will either employ a universe
hierarchy or else contend with an inconsistent type-in-type rule. However,
these are not be the only possible options. Taking inspiration from Stratified
System F, we introduce Stratified Type Theory (StraTT), where rather than
stratifying universes by levels, we stratify typing judgements and restrict the
domain of dependent function types to some fixed level strictly lower than that
of the overall type. Even in the presence of type-in-type, this restriction
suffices to enforce consistency of the system.
<br />We explore the expressivity of several extensions atop this design. First,
the subsystem subStraTT employs McBride's crude-but-effective stratification
(also known as displacement) as a simple form of level polymorphism where
top-level definitions can be displaced uniformly to any higher level as needed,
which is valid due to level cumulativity and plays well with stratified
judgements. Second, to recover some expressivity lost due to the restriction on
dependent function domains, the full StraTT system includes a separate
nondependent function type with floating domains, whose level instead matches
that of the overall type. Finally, we have implemented a prototype type checker
for StraTT extended with datatypes along with a small type checked core
library.
<br />While it's possible to show that the subsystem is consistent, showing
consistency for the full system with floating nondependent functions remains
open. Nevertheless, we believe that the full system is also consistent and have
mechanized a syntactic proof of subject reduction. Furthermore, we use our
implementation to investigate various well-known type-theoretic type-in-type
paradoxes. These examples all fail to type check in expected ways as evidence
towards consistency.

<p class="mathjax">WebAssembly (Wasm) is a bytecode format originally serving as a compilation
target for Web applications. It has recently been used increasingly on the
server side, e.g., providing a safer, faster, and more portable alternative to
Linux containers. With the popularity of server-side Wasm applications, it is
essential to study performance issues (i.e., abnormal latency) in Wasm
runtimes, as they may cause a significant impact on server-side applications.
However, there is still a lack of attention to performance issues in
server-side Wasm runtimes. In this paper, we design a novel differential
testing approach WarpDiff to identify performance issues in server-side Wasm
runtimes. The key insight is that in normal cases, the execution time of the
same test case on different Wasm runtimes should follow an oracle ratio. We
identify abnormal cases where the execution time ratio significantly deviates
from the oracle ratio and subsequently locate the Wasm runtimes that cause the
performance issues. We apply WarpDiff to test five popular server-side Wasm
runtimes using 123 test cases from the LLVM test suite and demonstrate the top
10 abnormal cases we identified. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of
these abnormal cases and summarize seven performance issues, all of which have
been confirmed by the developers. We hope our work can inspire future
investigation on improving Wasm runtime implementation and thus promoting the
development of server-side Wasm applications.

<p class="mathjax">Data transformation is an essential step in data science. While experts
primarily use programming to transform their data, there is an increasing need
to support non-programmers with user interface-based tools. With the rapid
development in interaction techniques and computing environments, we report our
empirical findings about the effects of interaction techniques and environments
on performing data transformation tasks. Specifically, we studied the potential
benefits of direct interaction and virtual reality (VR) for data
transformation. We compared gesture interaction versus a standard WIMP user
interface, each on the desktop and in VR. With the tested data and tasks, we
found time performance was similar between desktop and VR. Meanwhile, VR
demonstrates preliminary evidence to better support provenance and sense-making
throughout the data transformation process. Our exploration of performing data
transformation in VR also provides initial affirmation for enabling an
iterative and fully immersive data science workflow.

user interactions and build a system which predicts - in real-time - the action
a user is most likely going to take next. For this, a recurrent neural network

<p class="mathjax">The field of drug discovery has experienced a remarkable transformation with
the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
technologies. However, as these AI and ML models are becoming more complex,
there is a growing need for transparency and interpretability of the models.
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a novel approach that addresses
this issue and provides a more interpretable understanding of the predictions
made by machine learning models. In recent years, there has been an increasing
interest in the application of XAI techniques to drug discovery. This review
article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in
XAI for drug discovery, including various XAI methods, their application in
drug discovery, and the challenges and limitations of XAI techniques in drug
discovery. The article also covers the application of XAI in drug discovery,
including target identification, compound design, and toxicity prediction.
Furthermore, the article suggests potential future research directions for the
application of XAI in drug discovery. The aim of this review article is to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of XAI in drug
discovery and its potential to transform the field.

<p class="mathjax">In 3D human shape and pose estimation from a monocular video, models trained
with limited labeled data cannot generalize well to videos with occlusion,
which is common in the wild videos. The recent human neural rendering
approaches focusing on novel view synthesis initialized by the off-the-shelf
human shape and pose methods have the potential to correct the initial human
shape. However, the existing methods have some drawbacks such as, erroneous in
handling occlusion, sensitive to inaccurate human segmentation, and ineffective
loss computation due to the non-regularized opacity field. To address these
problems, we introduce ORTexME, an occlusion-robust temporal method that
utilizes temporal information from the input video to better regularize the
occluded body parts. While our ORTexME is based on NeRF, to determine the
reliable regions for the NeRF ray sampling, we utilize our novel average
texture learning approach to learn the average appearance of a person, and to
infer a mask based on the average texture. In addition, to guide the
opacity-field updates in NeRF to suppress blur and noise, we propose the use of
human body mesh. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method
achieves significant improvement on the challenging multi-person 3DPW dataset,
where our method achieves 1.8 P-MPJPE error reduction. The SOTA rendering-based
methods fail and enlarge the error up to 5.6 on the same dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Object rearrangement is pivotal in robotic-environment interactions,
representing a significant capability in embodied AI. In this paper, we present
SG-Bot, a novel rearrangement framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine scheme
with a scene graph as the scene representation. Unlike previous methods that
rely on either known goal priors or zero-shot large models, SG-Bot exemplifies
lightweight, real-time, and user-controllable characteristics, seamlessly
blending the consideration of commonsense knowledge with automatic generation
capabilities. SG-Bot employs a three-fold procedure--observation, imagination,
and execution--to adeptly address the task. Initially, objects are discerned
and extracted from a cluttered scene during the observation. These objects are
first coarsely organized and depicted within a scene graph, guided by either
commonsense or user-defined criteria. Then, this scene graph subsequently
informs a generative model, which forms a fine-grained goal scene considering
the shape information from the initial scene and object semantics. Finally, for
execution, the initial and envisioned goal scenes are matched to formulate
robotic action policies. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-Bot
outperforms competitors by a large margin.

<p class="mathjax">We analyse conservatism and regret of stochastic model predictive control
(SMPC) when using moment-based ambiguity sets for modeling unknown
uncertainties. To quantify the conservatism, we compare the deterministic
constraint tightening while taking a distributionally robust approach against
the optimal tightening when the exact distributions of the stochastic
uncertainties are known. Furthermore, we quantify the regret by comparing the
performance when the distributions of the stochastic uncertainties are known
and unknown. Analysing the accumulated sub-optimality of SMPC due to the lack
of knowledge about the true distributions of the uncertainties marks the novel

<p class="mathjax">Data has transformative potential to empower people with Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities (IDD). However, conventional data visualizations
often rely on complex cognitive processes, and existing approaches for
day-to-day analysis scenarios fail to consider neurodivergent capabilities,
creating barriers for people with IDD to access data and leading to even
further marginalization. We argue that visualizations could be an equalizer for
people with IDD to participate in data-driven conversations. Drawing on
preliminary research findings and our experiences working with people with IDD
and their data, we introduce and expand on the concept of cognitively
accessible visualizations, unpack its meaning and roles in increasing IDD
individuals' access to data, and discuss two immediate research objectives.
Specifically, we argue that cognitively accessible visualizations should
support people with IDD in personal data storytelling for effective
self-advocacy and self-expression, and balance novelty and familiarity in data
design to accommodate cognitive diversity and promote inclusivity.

localization performance with data collected from Android smartphones. We
represent pseudorange bias using a pragmatic satellite-wise Multiple Layer
Perceptron (MLP), the inputs of which are six
satellite-receiver-context-related features derived from Android raw Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. To supervise the training
process, we carefully calculate the target values of pseudorange bias using
location ground truth and smoothing techniques and optimize a loss function
containing the estimation residuals of smartphone clock bias. During the
inference process, we employ model-based localization engines to compute
locations with pseudoranges corrected by the neural network. Consequently, this
hybrid pipeline can attend to both pseudorange bias and noise. We evaluate the
framework on an open dataset and consider four application scenarios for
investigating fingerprinting and cross-trace localization in rural and urban
areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms model-based and state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have emerged as tools to facilitate the
management of software dependencies, vulnerabilities, licenses, and the supply
chain. While significant effort has been devoted to increasing SBOM awareness
and developing SBOM formats and tools, recent studies have shown that SBOMs are
still an early technology not yet adequately adopted in practice. Expanding on
previous research, this paper reports a comprehensive study that investigates
the current challenges stakeholders encounter when creating and using SBOMs.
The study surveyed 138 practitioners belonging to five stakeholder groups
(practitioners familiar with SBOMs, members of critical open source projects,
AI/ML, cyber-physical systems, and legal practitioners) using differentiated
questionnaires, and interviewed 8 survey respondents to gather further insights
about their experience. We identified 12 major challenges facing the creation
and use of SBOMs, including those related to the SBOM content, deficiencies in
SBOM tools, SBOM maintenance and verification, and domain-specific challenges.
We propose and discuss 4 actionable solutions to the identified challenges and
present the major avenues for future research and development.

trained to perform end-to-end symbolic regression of Boolean functions. First,
we show that it can predict compact formulas for complex functions which were

demonstrate its ability to find approximate expressions when provided
incomplete and noisy observations. We evaluate the Boolformer on a broad set of
real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an
interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we
apply it to the widespread task of modelling the dynamics of gene regulatory

<p class="mathjax">Trace finite element methods have become a popular option for solving surface
partial differential equations, especially in problems where surface and bulk
effects are coupled. In such methods a surface mesh is formed by approximately
intersecting the continuous surface on which the PDE is posed with a
three-dimensional (bulk) tetrahedral mesh. In classical $H^1$-conforming trace
methods, the surface finite element space is obtained by restricting a bulk
finite element space to the surface mesh. It is not clear how to carry out a
similar procedure in order to obtain other important types of finite element
spaces such as $H({\rm div})$-conforming spaces. Following previous work of
Olshanskii, Reusken, and Xu on $H^1$-conforming methods, we develop a
``quasi-trace'' mixed method for the Laplace-Beltrami problem. The finite
element mesh is taken to be the intersection of the surface with a regular
tetrahedral bulk mesh as previously described, resulting in a surface
triangulation that is highly unstructured and anisotropic but satisfies a
classical maximum angle condition. The mixed method is then employed on this
mesh. Optimal error estimates with respect to the bulk mesh size are proved
along with superconvergent estimates for the projection of the scalar error and
a postprocessed scalar approximation.

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces Physics-informed State-space neural network Models
(PSMs), a novel solution to achieving real-time optimization, flexibility, and
fault tolerance in autonomous systems, particularly in transport-dominated
systems such as chemical, biomedical, and power plants. Traditional data-driven
methods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass
conservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with
sensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable
forward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel
and a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate
approach than purely data-driven models.
<br />Beyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this
work, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller
through a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a
diagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former
demonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent
constraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and
fault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for
Digital Twins, constantly updated digital representations of physical systems.

<p class="mathjax">Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) is a superconducting logic with
extremely high energy efficiency. By employing the distinct polarity of current
to denote logic `0' and `1', AQFP devices serve as excellent carriers for
binary neural network (BNN) computations. Although recent research has made
initial strides toward developing an AQFP-based BNN accelerator, several
critical challenges remain, preventing the design from being a comprehensive
solution. In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN
acceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to
eventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.
Specifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and
analyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently
formulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN
computation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware
performance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a
clocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our
SupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing
it with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,
and superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our
design achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher
than that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of
model accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based
counterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude
higher energy efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Photovoltaic (PV) energy is crucial for the decarbonization of energy
systems. Due to the lack of centralized data, remote sensing of rooftop PV
installations is the best option to monitor the evolution of the rooftop PV
installed fleet at a regional scale. However, current techniques lack
reliability and are notably sensitive to shifts in the acquisition conditions.
To overcome this, we leverage the wavelet scale attribution method (WCAM),
which decomposes a model's prediction in the space-scale domain. The WCAM
enables us to assess on which scales the representation of a PV model rests and
provides insights to derive methods that improve the robustness to acquisition
conditions, thus increasing trust in deep learning systems to encourage their
use for the safe integration of clean energy in electric systems.

<p class="mathjax">Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design
models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Session-based recommendation, aiming at making the prediction of the user's
next item click based on the information in a single session only even in the
presence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem. This complex
problem requires a high-capability model of predicting the user's next action.
Most (if not all) existing models follow the encoder-predictor paradigm where
all studies focus on how to optimize the encoder module extensively in the
paradigm but they ignore how to optimize the predictor module. In this paper,
we discover the existing critical issue of the low-capability predictor module
among existing models. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework called
\emph{\underline{S}ession-based \underline{R}ecommendation with
\underline{Pred}ictor \underline{A}dd-\underline{O}n} (SR-PredictAO). In this
framework, we propose a high-capability predictor module which could alleviate
the effect of random user's behavior for prediction. It is worth mentioning
that this framework could be applied to any existing models, which could give
opportunities for further optimizing the framework. Extensive experiments on
two real benchmark datasets for three state-of-the-art models show that
\emph{SR-PredictAO} out-performs the current state-of-the-art model by up to
2.9\% in HR@20 and 2.3\% in MRR@20. More importantly, the improvement is
consistent across almost all the existing models on all datasets, which could
be regarded as a significant contribution in the field.

<p class="mathjax">In surgery, the application of appropriate force levels is critical for the
success and safety of a given procedure. While many studies are focused on
measuring in situ forces, little attention has been devoted to relating these
observed forces to surgical techniques. Answering questions like "Can certain
changes to a surgical technique result in lower forces and increased safety
margins?" could lead to improved surgical practice, and importantly, patient
outcomes. However, such studies would require a large number of trials and
professional surgeons, which is generally impractical to arrange. Instead, we
show how robots can learn several variations of a surgical technique from a
smaller number of surgical demonstrations and interpolate learnt behaviour via
a parameterised skill model. This enables a large number of trials to be
performed by a robotic system and the analysis of surgical techniques and their
downstream effects on tissue. Here, we introduce a parameterised model of the
elliptical excision skill and apply a Bayesian optimisation scheme to optimise
the excision behaviour with respect to expert ratings, as well as individual
characteristics of excision forces. Results show that the proposed framework
can successfully align the generated robot behaviour with subjects across
varying levels of proficiency in terms of excision forces.

<p class="mathjax">While user authentication happens before initiating or resuming a login
session, de-authentication detects the absence of a previously-authenticated
user to revoke her currently active login session. The absence of proper
de-authentication can lead to well-known lunchtime attacks, where a nearby
adversary takes over a carelessly departed user's running login session. The
existing solutions for automatic de-authentication have distinct practical
limitations, e.g., extraordinary deployment requirements or high initial cost
of external equipment.
<br />In this paper, we propose "DE-authentication using Ambient Light sensor"
(DEAL), a novel, inexpensive, fast, and user-friendly de-authentication
approach. DEAL utilizes the built-in ambient light sensor of a modern computer
to determine if the user is leaving her work-desk. DEAL, by design, is
resilient to natural shifts in lighting conditions and can be configured to
handle abrupt changes in ambient illumination (e.g., due to toggling of room
lights). We collected data samples from 4800 sessions with 120 volunteers in 4
typical workplace settings and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate
the quality of our proposed approach thoroughly. Our results show that DEAL can
de-authenticate a departing user within 4 seconds with a hit rate of 89.15% and
a fall-out of 7.35%. Finally, bypassing DEAL to launch a lunchtime attack is
practically infeasible as it requires the attacker to either take the user's
position within a few seconds or manipulate the sensor readings sophisticatedly
in real-time.

<p class="mathjax">The increase in the availability of online videos has transformed the way we
access information and knowledge. A growing number of individuals now prefer
instructional videos as they offer a series of step-by-step procedures to
accomplish particular tasks. The instructional videos from the medical domain
may provide the best possible visual answers to first aid, medical emergency,
and medical education questions. Toward this, this paper is focused on
answering health-related questions asked by the public by providing visual
answers from medical videos. The scarcity of large-scale datasets in the
medical domain is a key challenge that hinders the development of applications
that can help the public with their health-related questions. To address this
issue, we first proposed a pipelined approach to create two large-scale
datasets: HealthVidQA-CRF and HealthVidQA-Prompt. Later, we proposed monomodal
and multimodal approaches that can effectively provide visual answers from
medical videos to natural language questions. We conducted a comprehensive
analysis of the results, focusing on the impact of the created datasets on
model training and the significance of visual features in enhancing the
performance of the monomodal and multi-modal approaches. Our findings suggest
that these datasets have the potential to enhance the performance of medical
visual answer localization tasks and provide a promising future direction to
further enhance the performance by using pre-trained language-vision models.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental shortcoming of the concept of Nash equilibrium is its
computational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form
games is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,
we introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\sigma$. In a $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their
best deviation to a $\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does
not put too much mass (as parametrized by $\sigma$) on any fixed action. We
distinguish two variants of $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong
$\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play
$\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\sigma$-smooth
Nash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.
<br />We show that both weak and strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have
superior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\sigma$ as well as
an approximation parameter $\epsilon$ and the number of players are all
constants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak
$\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.
In the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic
algorithm to find a strong $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the
optimal algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which
cannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds
by showing that when either $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,
finding a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes
computationally intractable.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we present synchronous bilingual Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC), an innovative framework that leverages dual CTC to bridge
the gaps of both modality and language in the speech translation (ST) task.
Utilizing transcript and translation as concurrent objectives for CTC, our
model bridges the gap between audio and text as well as between source and
target languages. Building upon the recent advances in CTC application, we
develop an enhanced variant, BiL-CTC+, that establishes new state-of-the-art
performances on the MuST-C ST benchmarks under resource-constrained scenarios.
Intriguingly, our method also yields significant improvements in speech
recognition performance, revealing the effect of cross-lingual learning on
transcription and demonstrating its broad applicability. The source code is

<p class="mathjax">Calibration measures and reliability diagrams are two fundamental tools for
measuring and interpreting the calibration of probabilistic predictors.
Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability
diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most
common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures --
binning and ECE -- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We
show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the
observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of
bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the
sense of (B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023a) -- a consistent
calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the
reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the
SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE.
<br />We also provide a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free methods for
measuring and plotting calibration: `pip install relplot\`.

<p class="mathjax">Presentation attack (spoofing) detection (PAD) typically operates alongside
biometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.
Even though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of
reliable biometric verification, they address different detection tasks and are
hence typically evaluated separately. Evidence shows that this approach is
suboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions
operating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem
detection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate
(t-EER) is parameter free. The combination of two classifiers nonetheless leads
to a \emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are
equal and also dependent upon the prevalence of attacks. We therefore introduce
the \emph{concurrent} t-EER, a unique operating point which is invariable to
the prevalence of attacks. Using both modality (and even application) agnostic
simulated scores, as well as real scores for a voice biometrics application, we
demonstrate application of the t-EER to a wide range of biometric system
evaluations under attack. The proposed approach is a strong candidate metric
for the tandem evaluation of PAD systems and biometric comparators.

<p class="mathjax">The past decade has seen rapid growth of distributed stream data processing
systems. Under these systems, a stream application is realized as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of operators, where the level of parallelism of each
operator has a substantial impact on its overall performance. However, finding
optimal levels of parallelism remains challenging. Most existing methods are
heavily coupled with the topological graph of operators, unable to efficiently
tune under-provisioned jobs. They either insufficiently use previous tuning
experience by treating successively tuning independently, or explore the
configuration space aggressively, violating the Service Level Agreements (SLA).
<br />To address the above problems, we propose ContTune, a continuous tuning
system for stream applications. It is equipped with a novel Big-small
algorithm, in which the Big phase decouples the tuning from the topological
graph by decomposing the job tuning problem into sub-problems that can be
solved concurrently. We propose a conservative Bayesian Optimization (CBO)
technique in the Small phase to speed up the tuning process by utilizing the
previous observations. It leverages the state-of-the-art (SOTA) tuning method
as conservative exploration to avoid SLA violations. Experimental results show
that ContTune reduces up to 60.75% number of reconfigurations under synthetic
workloads and up to 57.5% number of reconfigurations under real workloads,
compared to the SOTA method DS2.

<p class="mathjax">In this manuscript we study properties of multidimensional shifts. More
precisely, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for a shift to be
sofic, i.e. the boundary between sofic shifts and effective ones. To this end,
we use different versions of algorithmic complexity (a.k.a. Kolmogorov
complexity). In the first part of the work we suggest new necessary conditions
of soficness for multidimensional shift. These conditions are expressed in
terms of Kolmogorov complexity with bounded ressources. We discuss several
applications of this technique. In particular, we construct an example of a
two-dimensional effective and non sofic shift that has a very low combinatorial
complexity : the number of global admissible N x N patterns grows only
polynomially in N. We also show that the technique developed by S.Kass and
K.Madden is equivalent to a special case of our method. In the second part, we
discuss properties of subshifts defined in terms of density of letters. More
specifically, we study two-dimensional subshifts $S(\rho)$ in the binary
alphabet (white and black cells) where a configuration is admissible if every
pattern of size N x N contains at most $N^\rho$ black cells. We show that
$S(^\rho)$ is sofic for every $\rho&lt;1$. Moreover, all effectif subshifts of
these shifts are also sofic. The proof of this result is principally based on
the construction of a self-simulating point-fixed tile set, with several new
ingredients: an ad hoc model of computation based on a non deterministic
cellular automaton (which allows to implement efficiently massively parallel
calculations) and some properties of flows in a specific type of planar graphs.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, datasets of paired audio and captions have enabled
remarkable success in automatically generating descriptions for audio clips,
namely Automated Audio Captioning (AAC). However, it is labor-intensive and
time-consuming to collect a sufficient number of paired audio and captions.
Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
(CLAP), we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train an AAC model assuming
only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired
target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text
embeddings in CLAP. During training, we learn to reconstruct the text from the
CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio
embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings
we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We
evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its
ability to achieve a relative performance of up to ~$83\%$ compared to fully
supervised approaches trained with paired target data.

<p class="mathjax">Children typically learn to identify and express emotions through sharing
their stories and feelings with others, particularly their family. However, it
is challenging for parents or siblings to have emotional communication with
children since children are still developing their communication skills. We
present ChaCha, a chatbot that encourages and guides children to share personal
events and associated emotions. ChaCha combines a state machine and large
language models (LLMs) to keep the dialogue on track while carrying on
free-form conversations. Through an exploratory study with 20 children (aged
8-12), we examine how ChaCha prompts children to share personal events and
guides them to describe associated emotions. Participants perceived ChaCha as a
close friend and shared their stories on various topics, such as family trips
and personal achievements. Based on the quantitative and qualitative findings,
we discuss opportunities for leveraging LLMs to design child-friendly chatbots
to support children in sharing their emotions.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting fake news requires both a delicate sense of diverse clues and a
profound understanding of the real-world background, which remains challenging
for detectors based on small language models (SLMs) due to their knowledge and
capability limitations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could
help with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an
empirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could
generally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales
but still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis
attributes such a gap to the LLM's inability to select and integrate rationales
properly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may
not substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor
for SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate
this proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news
detection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis
from the LLMs' rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by
distillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without
inquiring LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and
ARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based,
LLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluation of QA systems is very challenging and expensive, with the most
reliable approach being human annotations of correctness of answers for
questions. Recent works (AVA, BEM) have shown that transformer LM encoder based
similarity metrics transfer well for QA evaluation, but they are limited by the
usage of a single correct reference answer. We propose a new evaluation metric:
SQuArE (Sentence-level QUestion AnsweRing Evaluation), using multiple reference
answers (combining multiple correct and incorrect references) for sentence-form
QA. We evaluate SQuArE on both sentence-level extractive (Answer Selection) and
generative (GenQA) QA systems, across multiple academic and industrial
datasets, and show that it outperforms previous baselines and obtains the
highest correlation with human annotations.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile manipulators have been employed in many applications which are usually
performed by multiple fixed-base robots or a large-size system, thanks to the
mobility of the mobile base. However, the mobile base also brings redundancies
to the system, which makes trajectory planning more challenging. One class of
problems recently arising from mobile 3D printing is the trajectory-continuous
tasks, in which the end-effector is required to follow a designed continuous
trajectory (time-parametrized path) in task space. This paper formulates and
solves the optimal trajectory planning problem for mobile manipulators under
end-effector trajectory continuity constraint, which allows considerations of
other constraints and trajectory optimization. To demonstrate our method, a
discrete optimal trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve mobile 3D
printing tasks in multiple experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations, have long suffered from slow training due to their
inherent sequential nature. For many years this bottleneck has persisted, as
many thought sequential models could not be parallelized. We challenge this
long-held belief with our parallel algorithm that accelerates GPU evaluation of
sequential models by up to 3 orders of magnitude faster without compromising
output accuracy. The algorithm does not need any special structure in the
sequential models' architecture, making it applicable to a wide range of
architectures. Using our method, training sequential models can be more than 10
times faster than the common sequential method without any meaningful
difference in the training results. Leveraging this accelerated training, we
discovered the efficacy of the Gated Recurrent Unit in a long time series
classification problem with 17k time samples. By overcoming the training
bottleneck, our work serves as the first step to unlock the potential of
non-linear sequential models for long sequence problems.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce an extension to the CLRS algorithmic learning benchmark,
prioritizing scalability and the utilization of sparse representations. Many
algorithms in CLRS require global memory or information exchange, mirrored in
its execution model, which constructs fully connected (not sparse) graphs based
on the underlying problem. Despite CLRS's aim of assessing how effectively
learned algorithms can generalize to larger instances, the existing execution
model becomes a significant constraint due to its demanding memory requirements
and runtime (hard to scale). However, many important algorithms do not demand a
fully connected graph; these algorithms, primarily distributed in nature, align
closely with the message-passing paradigm employed by Graph Neural Networks.
Hence, we propose SALSA-CLRS, an extension of the current CLRS benchmark
specifically with scalability and sparseness in mind. Our approach includes
adapted algorithms from the original CLRS benchmark and introduces new problems
from distributed and randomized algorithms. Moreover, we perform a thorough
empirical evaluation of our benchmark. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jkminder/SALSA-CLRS.

<p class="mathjax">This work investigates a case study of using physical-based sonification of
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, optimized by the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The VQE approximates the
solution of the problem by using an iterative loop between the quantum computer
and a classical optimization routine. This work explores the intermediary
statevectors found in each VQE iteration as the means of sonifying the
optimization process itself. The implementation was realised in the form of a
musical interface prototype named Variational Quantum Harmonizer (VQH),
providing potential design strategies for musical applications, focusing on
chords, chord progressions, and arpeggios. The VQH can be used both to enhance
data visualization or to create artistic pieces. The methodology is also
relevant in terms of how an artist would gain intuition towards achieving a
desired musical sound by carefully designing QUBO cost functions. Flexible
mapping strategies could supply a broad portfolio of sounds for QUBO and
quantum-inspired musical compositions, as demonstrated in a case study
composition, "Dependent Origination" by Peter Thomas and Paulo Itaborai.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a widely used optimization algorithm in
deep learning, is often limited to converging to local optima due to the
non-convex nature of the problem. Leveraging these local optima to improve
model performance remains a challenging task. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, the simple arithmetic averaging of the obtained local optima
models in undesirable results. This paper proposes a {\em soft merging} method
that facilitates rapid merging of multiple models, simplifies the merging of
specific parts of neural networks, and enhances robustness against malicious
models with extreme values. This is achieved by learning gate parameters
through a surrogate of the $l_0$ norm using hard concrete distribution without
modifying the model weights of the given local optima models. This merging
process not only enhances the model performance by converging to a better local
optimum, but also minimizes computational costs, offering an efficient and
explicit learning process integrated with stochastic gradient descent. Thorough
experiments underscore the effectiveness and superior performance of the merged
neural networks.

abstraction) call-by-value evaluation for the lambda-calculus. Recently,
Accattoli et al. proposed a form of call-by-value strong evaluation for the
lambda-calculus, the external strategy, and proved it reasonable for time.
Here, we study the external strategy using a semantical tool, namely Ehrhard's
call-by-value multi types, a variant of intersection types. We show that the
external strategy terminates exactly when a term is typable with so-called
shrinking multi types, mimicking similar results for strong call-by-name.
Additionally, the external strategy is normalizing in the untyped setting, that
is, it reaches the normal form whenever it exists.
<br />We also consider the call-by-extended-value approach to strong evaluation
shown reasonable for time by Biernacka et al. The two approaches turn out to
not be equivalent: terms may be externally divergent but terminating for
call-by-extended-value.

<p class="mathjax">Prompt Tuning is a popular parameter-efficient finetuning method for
pre-trained large language models (PLMs). Recently, based on experiments with
RoBERTa, it has been suggested that Prompt Tuning activates specific neurons in
the transformer's feed-forward networks, that are highly predictive and
selective for the given task. In this paper, we study the robustness of Prompt
Tuning in relation to these "skill neurons", using RoBERTa and T5. We show that
prompts tuned for a specific task are transferable to tasks of the same type
but are not very robust to adversarial data, with higher robustness for T5 than
RoBERTa. At the same time, we replicate the existence of skill neurons in
RoBERTa and further show that skill neurons also seem to exist in T5.
Interestingly, the skill neurons of T5 determined on non-adversarial data are
also among the most predictive neurons on the adversarial data, which is not
the case for RoBERTa. We conclude that higher adversarial robustness may be
related to a model's ability to activate the relevant skill neurons on
adversarial data.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized how we train deep neural networks
by enabling decentralized collaboration while safeguarding sensitive data and
improving model performance. However, FL faces two crucial challenges: the
diverse nature of data held by individual clients and the vulnerability of the
FL system to security breaches. This paper introduces an innovative solution
named Estimated Mean Aggregation (EMA) that not only addresses these challenges
but also provides a fundamental reference point as a $\mathsf{baseline}$ for
advanced aggregation techniques in FL systems. EMA's significance lies in its
dual role: enhancing model security by effectively handling malicious outliers
through trimmed means and uncovering data heterogeneity to ensure that trained
models are adaptable across various client datasets. Through a wealth of
experiments, EMA consistently demonstrates high accuracy and area under the
curve (AUC) compared to alternative methods, establishing itself as a robust
baseline for evaluating the effectiveness and security of FL aggregation
methods. EMA's contributions thus offer a crucial step forward in advancing the
efficiency, security, and versatility of decentralized deep learning in the

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC), a corpus for legal AI research.
It consists of over 250 000 court cases from the UK. Most cases are from the
21st century, but the corpus includes cases as old as the 16th century. This
paper presents the first release of the corpus, containing the raw text and
meta-data. Together with the corpus, we provide annotations on case outcomes
for 638 cases, done by legal experts. Using our annotated data, we have trained
and evaluated case outcome extraction with GPT-3, GPT-4 and RoBERTa models to
provide benchmarks. We include an extensive legal and ethical discussion to
address the potentially sensitive nature of this material. As a consequence,
the corpus will only be released for research purposes under certain
restrictions.

<p class="mathjax">Rapid and accurate identification of Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a severe
cardiovascular condition including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
embolism (PE), is important for effective treatment. Leveraging Natural
Language Processing (NLP) on radiology reports, automated methods have shown
promising advancements in identifying VTE events from retrospective data
cohorts or aiding clinical experts in identifying VTE events from radiology
reports. However, effectively training Deep Learning (DL) and the NLP models is
challenging due to limited labeled medical text data, the complexity and
heterogeneity of radiology reports, and data imbalance. This study proposes
novel method combinations of DL methods, along with data augmentation, adaptive
pre-trained NLP model selection, and a clinical expert NLP rule-based
classifier, to improve the accuracy of VTE identification in unstructured
(free-text) radiology reports. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's
efficacy, achieving an impressive 97\% accuracy and 97\% F1 score in predicting
DVT, and an outstanding 98.3\% accuracy and 98.4\% F1 score in predicting PE.
These findings emphasize the model's robustness and its potential to
significantly contribute to VTE research.

<p class="mathjax">Arbitrary-precision integer multiplication is the core kernel of many
applications in simulation, cryptography, etc. Existing acceleration of
arbitrary-precision integer multiplication includes CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and
ASICs. Among these accelerators, FPGAs are promised to provide both good energy
efficiency and flexibility. Surprisingly, in our implementations, FPGA has the
lowest energy efficiency, i.e., 0.29x of the CPU and 0.17x of the GPU with the
same generation fabrication. Therefore, key questions arise: Where do the
energy efficiency gains of CPUs and GPUs come from? Can reconfigurable
computing do better? If can, how to achieve that?
<br />We identify that the biggest energy efficiency gains of the CPUs and GPUs
come from the dedicated vector units. FPGA uses DSPs and lookup tables to
compose the needed computation, which incurs overhead when compared to using
vector units directly. New reconfigurable computing, e.g., 'FPGA+vector units'
is a novel and feasible solution to improve energy efficiency. In this paper,
we propose to map arbitrary-precision integer multiplication onto such a
heterogeneous platform, i.e., AMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture. Designing on
Versal ACAP incurs several challenges and we propose AIM: Arbitrary-precision
Integer Multiplication on Versal ACAP to automate and optimize the design. AIM
framework includes design space exploration and AIM automatic code generation
to facilitate the system design and verification. We deploy the AIM framework
on three different applications, including large integer multiplication (LIM),
RSA, and Mandelbrot, on the AMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP VCK190 evaluation board. Our
experimental results show that AIM achieves up to 12.6x, and 2.1x energy
efficiency gains over the Intel Xeon Ice Lake 6346 CPU, and NVidia A5000 GPU
respectively, which brings reconfigurable computing the most energy-efficient
platform among CPUs and GPUs.

real-time creation and modification of interactive Mixed Reality experiences
using LLMs. LLMR leverages novel strategies to tackle difficult cases where
ideal training data is scarce, or where the design goal requires the synthesis

framework relies on text interaction and the Unity game engine. By
incorporating techniques for scene understanding, task planning,
self-debugging, and memory management, LLMR outperforms the standard GPT-4 by
4x in average error rate. We demonstrate LLMR's cross-platform interoperability
with several example worlds, and evaluate it on a variety of creation and
modification tasks to show that it can produce and edit diverse objects, tools,

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated dominating performance in many
NLP tasks, especially on generative tasks. However, they often fall short in
some information extraction tasks, particularly those requiring domain-specific
knowledge, such as Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER). In this paper,
inspired by Chain-of-thought, we leverage the LLM to solve the Biomedical NER
step-by-step: break down the NER task into entity span extraction and entity
type determination. Additionally, for entity type determination, we inject
entity knowledge to address the problem that LLM's lack of domain knowledge
when predicting entity category. Experimental results show a significant
improvement in our two-step BioNER approach compared to previous few-shot LLM
baseline. Additionally, the incorporation of external knowledge significantly
enhances entity category determination performance.

<p class="mathjax">Initialization of neural network weights plays a pivotal role in determining
their performance. Feature Imitating Networks (FINs) offer a novel strategy by
initializing weights to approximate specific closed-form statistical features,
setting a promising foundation for deep learning architectures. While the
applicability of FINs has been chiefly tested in biomedical domains, this study
extends its exploration into other time series datasets. Three different
experiments are conducted in this study to test the applicability of imitating
Tsallis entropy for performance enhancement: Bitcoin price prediction, speech
emotion recognition, and chronic neck pain detection. For the Bitcoin price
prediction, models embedded with FINs reduced the root mean square error by
around 1000 compared to the baseline. In the speech emotion recognition task,
the FIN-augmented model increased classification accuracy by over 3 percent.
Lastly, in the CNP detection experiment, an improvement of about 7 percent was
observed compared to established classifiers. These findings validate the broad
utility and potency of FINs in diverse applications.

<p class="mathjax">Generating multi-instrument music from symbolic music representations is an
important task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). A central but still
largely unsolved problem in this context is musically and acoustically informed
control in the generation process. As the main contribution of this work, we
propose enhancing control of multi-instrument synthesis by conditioning a
generative model on a specific performance and recording environment, thus
allowing for better guidance of timbre and style. Building on state-of-the-art
diffusion-based music generative models, we introduce performance conditioning
- a simple tool indicating the generative model to synthesize music with style
and timbre of specific instruments taken from specific performances. Our
prototype is evaluated using uncurated performances with diverse
instrumentation and achieves state-of-the-art FAD realism scores while allowing
novel timbre and style control. Our project page, including samples and

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have pushed the limits of natural language
understanding and exhibited excellent problem-solving ability. Despite the
great success, most existing open-source LLMs (\eg, LLaMA-2) are still far away
from satisfactory for solving mathematical problem due to the complex reasoning
procedures. To bridge this gap, we propose \emph{MetaMath}, a fine-tuned
language model that specializes in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we
start by bootstrapping mathematical questions by rewriting the question from
multiple perspectives without extra knowledge, which results in a new dataset
called {MetaMathQA}. Then we fine-tune the LLaMA-2 models on MetaMathQA.
Experimental results on two popular benchmarks (\ie, GSM8K and MATH) for
mathematical reasoning demonstrate that MetaMath outperforms a suite of
open-source LLMs by a significant margin. Our MetaMath-7B model achieves
$66.4\%$ on GSM8K and $19.4\%$ on MATH, exceeding the state-of-the-art models
of the same size by $11.5\%$ and $8.7\%$. Particularly, {MetaMath-70B} achieves
an accuracy of $82.3\%$ on {GSM8K}, slightly better than {GPT-3.5-Turbo}. We
release the {MetaMathQA} dataset, the {MetaMath} models with different model
sizes and the training code for public use.

<p class="mathjax">We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large
language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is
B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A".
This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz
was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to
answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the
likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a
random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do
not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B''
occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal
Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah
Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to
correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is
robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data
augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about
real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee
Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly
answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the
latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused
by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Despite large advances in recent years, real-time capable motion planning for
autonomous road vehicles remains a huge challenge. In this work, we present a
decision module that is based on set-based reachability analysis: First, we
identify all possible driving corridors by computing the reachable set for the
longitudinal position of the vehicle along the lanelets of the road network,
where lane changes are modeled as discrete events. Next, we select the best
driving corridor based on a cost function that penalizes lane changes and
deviations from a desired velocity profile. Finally, we generate a reference
trajectory inside the selected driving corridor, which can be used to guide or
warm start low-level trajectory planners. For the numerical evaluation we
combine our decision module with a motion-primitive-based and an
optimization-based planner and evaluate the performance on 2000 challenging
CommonRoad traffic scenarios as well in the realistic CARLA simulator. The
results demonstrate that our decision module is real-time capable and yields
significant speed-ups compared to executing a motion planner standalone without
a decision module.

obtained from $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes by introducing two related

perform a straightforward analysis of the Schur product between their codewords
and determine the linearity of the respective Gray code. This work expands on
earlier contributions from the literature, where the linearity was established
with respect to the kernel of a code and/or operations on $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$.
The $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes we apply the Gray map and check the

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language generation. However, their output quality can be inconsistent,
posing challenges for generating natural language from logical forms (LFs).
This task requires the generated outputs to embody the exact semantics of LFs,
without missing any LF semantics or creating any hallucinations. In this work,
we tackle this issue by proposing a novel generate-and-rerank approach. Our
approach involves initially generating a set of candidate outputs by prompting
an LLM and subsequently reranking them using a task-specific reranker model. In
addition, we curate a manually collected dataset to evaluate the alignment
between different ranking metrics and human judgements. The chosen ranking
metrics are utilized to enhance the training and evaluation of the reranker
model. By conducting extensive experiments on three diverse datasets, we
demonstrate that the candidates selected by our reranker outperform those
selected by baseline methods in terms of semantic consistency and fluency, as
measured by three comprehensive metrics. Our findings provide strong evidence
for the effectiveness of our approach in improving the quality of generated
outputs.

<p class="mathjax">Human drivers can seamlessly adapt their driving decisions across
geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,
left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous
driving have been thus far only deployed within restricted operational domains,
i.e., without accounting for varying driving behaviors across locations or
model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware
conditional imitation learning (CIL) model that can efficiently learn from
heterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental,
traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a
high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively
adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions
in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our
proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data
distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.
Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop
evaluation and 30% in closed-loop testing on CARLA.

<p class="mathjax">Equipping multi-fingered robots with tactile sensing is crucial for achieving
the precise, contact-rich, and dexterous manipulation that humans excel at.
However, relying solely on tactile sensing fails to provide adequate cues for
reasoning about objects' spatial configurations, limiting the ability to
correct errors and adapt to changing situations. In this paper, we present
Tactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances
tactile-based dexterity by optimizing dexterous policies using vision-based
rewards. First, we use a contrastive-based objective to learn visual
representations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual
representations through optimal-transport based matching on one human
demonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to
optimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six
challenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping
slender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered
Allegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies
using tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without
tactile observational input. Robot videos are best viewed on our project

<p class="mathjax">We tackle the problem of robust novelty detection, where we aim to detect
novelties in terms of semantic content while being invariant to changes in
other, irrelevant factors. Specifically, we operate in a setup with multiple
environments, where we determine the set of features that are associated more
with the environments, rather than to the content relevant for the task. Thus,
we propose a method that starts with a pretrained embedding and a multi-env
setup and manages to rank the features based on their environment-focus. First,
we compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution variance
between envs. Next, we show that by dropping the highly scored ones, we manage
to remove spurious correlations and improve the overall performance by up to
6%, both in covariance and sub-population shift cases, both for a real and a
synthetic benchmark, that we introduce for this task.

<p class="mathjax">Vector graphics are widely used in digital art and valued by designers for
their scalability and layer-wise topological properties. However, the creation
and editing of vector graphics necessitate creativity and design expertise,
leading to a time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline
that generates high-quality customized vector graphics based on textual prompts
while preserving the properties and layer-wise information of a given exemplar
SVG. Our method harnesses the capabilities of large pre-trained text-to-image
models. By fine-tuning the cross-attention layers of the model, we generate
customized raster images guided by textual prompts. To initialize the SVG, we
introduce a semantic-based path alignment method that preserves and transforms
crucial paths from the exemplar SVG. Additionally, we optimize path parameters
using both image-level and vector-level losses, ensuring smooth shape
deformation while aligning with the customized raster image. We extensively
evaluate our method using multiple metrics from vector-level, image-level, and
text-level perspectives. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our pipeline in generating diverse customizations of vector graphics with
exceptional quality. The project page is

<p class="mathjax">Panoramic videos contain richer spatial information and have attracted
tremendous amounts of attention due to their exceptional experience in some
fields such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. However, existing
datasets for video segmentation only focus on conventional planar images. To
address the challenge, in this paper, we present a panoramic video dataset,
PanoVOS. The dataset provides 150 videos with high video resolutions and
diverse motions. To quantify the domain gap between 2D planar videos and
panoramic videos, we evaluate 15 off-the-shelf video object segmentation (VOS)
models on PanoVOS. Through error analysis, we found that all of them fail to
tackle pixel-level content discontinues of panoramic videos. Thus, we present a
Panoramic Space Consistency Transformer (PSCFormer), which can effectively
utilize the semantic boundary information of the previous frame for pixel-level
matching with the current frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
compared with the previous SOTA models, our PSCFormer network exhibits a great
advantage in terms of segmentation results under the panoramic setting. Our
dataset poses new challenges in panoramic VOS and we hope that our PanoVOS can
advance the development of panoramic segmentation/tracking.

<p class="mathjax">The objective of this work is the effective extraction of spatial and dynamic
features for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). To accomplish this,
we utilise a two-pathway SlowFast network, where each pathway operates at
distinct temporal resolutions to separately capture spatial (hand shapes,
facial expressions) and dynamic (movements) information. In addition, we
introduce two distinct feature fusion methods, carefully designed for the
characteristics of CSLR: (1) Bi-directional Feature Fusion (BFF), which
facilitates the transfer of dynamic semantics into spatial semantics and vice
versa; and (2) Pathway Feature Enhancement (PFE), which enriches dynamic and
spatial representations through auxiliary subnetworks, while avoiding the need
for extra inference time. As a result, our model further strengthens spatial
and dynamic representations in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art performance on popular CSLR
datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily.

whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. Previous works
have dealt with the task by exploring network architectures while learning
effective representations has been less explored. In this work, we propose
TalkNCE, a novel talk-aware contrastive loss. The loss is only applied to part
of the full segments where a person on the screen is actually speaking. This
encourages the model to learn effective representations through the natural
correspondence of speech and facial movements. Our loss can be jointly
optimized with the existing objectives for training ASD models without the need
for additional supervision or training data. The experiments demonstrate that
our loss can be easily integrated into the existing ASD frameworks, improving
their performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on

<p class="mathjax">We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the
context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited
computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is
computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU
resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x
computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we
speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,
although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the
model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The
proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading
to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with
vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of
code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we
revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.
Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise
of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong
empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.
LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a
single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their
original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like
FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a
dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long
context question-answer pairs.

<p class="mathjax">Interpersonal conflict is an uncomfortable but unavoidable fact of life.
Navigating conflict successfully is a skill -- one that can be learned through
deliberate practice -- but few have access to effective training or feedback.
To expand this access, we introduce Rehearsal, a system that allows users to
rehearse conflicts with a believable simulated interlocutor, explore
counterfactual "what if?" scenarios to identify alternative conversational
paths, and learn through feedback on how and when to apply specific conflict
strategies. Users can utilize Rehearsal to practice handling a variety of
predefined conflict scenarios, from office disputes to relationship issues, or
they can choose to create their own. To enable Rehearsal, we develop IRP
prompting, a method of conditioning output of a large language model on the
influential Interest-Rights-Power (IRP) theory from conflict resolution.
Rehearsal uses IRP to generate utterances grounded in conflict resolution
theory, guiding users towards counterfactual conflict resolution strategies
that help de-escalate difficult conversations. In a between-subjects
evaluation, 40 participants engaged in an actual conflict with a confederate
after training. Compared to a control group with lecture material covering the
same IRP theory, participants with simulated training from Rehearsal
significantly improved their performance in the unaided conflict: they reduced
their use of escalating competitive strategies by an average of 67%, while
doubling their use of cooperative strategies. Overall, Rehearsal highlights the
potential effectiveness of language models as tools for learning and practicing
interpersonal skills.

in a 3D scene. The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations
among the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision. Our method does
not require any labeled training data and can generalize to novel 3D scenes and
arbitrary text queries. We evaluate LLM-Grounder on the ScanRefer benchmark and
demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding accuracy. Our findings
indicate that LLMs significantly improve the grounding capability, especially
for complex language queries, making LLM-Grounder an effective approach for 3D
vision-language tasks in robotics. Videos and interactive demos can be found on
the project website https://chat-with-nerf.github.io/ .

<p class="mathjax">We present ForceSight, a system for text-guided mobile manipulation that
predicts visual-force goals using a deep neural network. Given a single RGBD
image combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector
pose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force
goal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has
demonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals
can enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to
manipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in
these systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an
eye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,
drawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen
environments with object instances that differed significantly from the
training data. In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing
and ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,
demonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance. The
appendix, videos, code, and trained models are available at
https://force-sight.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal distillation method, called
TinyCLIP, for large-scale language-image pre-trained models. The method
introduces two core techniques: affinity mimicking and weight inheritance.
Affinity mimicking explores the interaction between modalities during
distillation, enabling student models to mimic teachers' behavior of learning
cross-modal feature alignment in a visual-linguistic affinity space. Weight
inheritance transmits the pre-trained weights from the teacher models to their
student counterparts to improve distillation efficiency. Moreover, we extend
the method into a multi-stage progressive distillation to mitigate the loss of
informative weights during extreme compression. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of TinyCLIP, showing that it can reduce the size of
the pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 by 50%, while maintaining comparable zero-shot
performance. While aiming for comparable performance, distillation with weight
inheritance can speed up the training by 1.4 - 7.8 $\times$ compared to
training from scratch. Moreover, our TinyCLIP ViT-8M/16, trained on YFCC-15M,
achieves an impressive zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 41.1% on ImageNet,
surpassing the original CLIP ViT-B/16 by 3.5% while utilizing only 8.9%
parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the good transferability of TinyCLIP in
various downstream tasks. Code and models will be open-sourced at
https://aka.ms/tinyclip.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel framework integrating the principles of active
stereo in standard passive camera systems without a physical pattern projector.
We virtually project a pattern over the left and right images according to the
sparse measurements obtained from a depth sensor. Any such devices can be
seamlessly plugged into our framework, allowing for the deployment of a virtual
active stereo setup in any possible environment, overcoming the limitation of
pattern projectors, such as limited working range or environmental conditions.
Experiments on indoor/outdoor datasets, featuring both long and close-range,
support the seamless effectiveness of our approach, boosting the accuracy of
both stereo algorithms and deep networks.

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing high resolution whole slide images (WSIs) with regard to
information across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital
pathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with
high resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller
image patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single
scale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale
information that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we
propose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale
relationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The
contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)
algorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale
relationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological
features is created and released to examine and visualize differential
cross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public
datasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/CS-MIL.

<p class="mathjax">Determining the maximum number of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with no
pairwise inner product exceeding $\alpha$ is a fundamental problem in geometry
and coding theory. In 1955, Rankin resolved this problem for all $\alpha \leq
0$ and in this paper, we show that the maximum is $(2+o(1))r$ for all $0 \leq
\alpha \ll r^{-2/3}$, answering a question of Bukh and Cox. Moreover, the
exponent $-2/3$ is best possible. As a consequence, we conclude that when $j
\ll r^{1/3}$, a $q$-ary code with block length $r$ and distance $(1-1/q)r - j$
has size at most $(2 + o(1))(q-1)r$, which is tight up to the multiplicative
factor $2(1 - 1/q) + o(1)$ for any prime power $q$ and infinitely many $r$.
When $q = 2$, this resolves a conjecture of Tiet\"av\"ainen from 1980 in a
strong form and the exponent $1/3$ is best possible. Finally, using a recently
discovered connection to $q$-ary codes, we obtain analogous results for
set-coloring Ramsey numbers.

<p class="mathjax">Social science often relies on surveys of households and individuals. Dozens
of such surveys are regularly administered by the U.S. government. However,
they field independent, unconnected samples with specialized questions,
limiting research questions to those that can be answered by a single survey.
The fusionACS project seeks to integrate data from multiple U.S. household
surveys by statistically "fusing" variables from "donor" surveys onto American
Community Survey (ACS) microdata. This results in an integrated microdataset of
household attributes and well-being dimensions that can be analyzed to address
research questions in ways that are not currently possible. The presented data
comprise the fusion onto the ACS of select donor variables from the Residential
Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) of 2015, the National Household Transportation
Survey (NHTS) of 2017, the American Housing Survey (AHS) of 2019, and the
Consumer Expenditure Survey - Interview (CEI) for the years 2015-2019. The
underlying statistical techniques are included in an open-source $R$ package,
fusionModel, that provides generic tools for the creation, analysis, and
validation of fused microdata.

<p class="mathjax">The viral propagation of fake posts on online social networks (OSNs) has
become an alarming concern. The paper aims to design control mechanisms for
fake post detection while negligibly affecting the propagation of real posts.
Towards this, a warning mechanism based on crowd-signals was recently proposed,
where all users actively declare the post as real or fake. In this paper, we
consider a more realistic framework where users exhibit different adversarial
or non-cooperative behaviour: (i) they can independently decide whether to
provide their response, (ii) they can choose not to consider the warning signal
while providing the response, and (iii) they can be real-coloring adversaries
who deliberately declare any post as real. To analyze the post-propagation
process in this complex system, we propose and study a new branching process,
namely total-current population-dependent branching process with multiple death
types. At first, we compare and show that the existing warning mechanism
significantly under-performs in the presence of adversaries. Then, we design
new mechanisms which remarkably perform better than the existing mechanism by
cleverly eliminating the influence of the responses of the adversaries.
Finally, we propose another enhanced mechanism which assumes minimal knowledge
about the user-specific parameters. The theoretical results are validated using
Monte-Carlo simulations.

<p class="mathjax">A set of vertices of a graph $G$ is said to be decycling if its removal
leaves an acyclic subgraph. The size of a smallest decycling set is the
decycling number of $G$. Generally, at least $\lceil(n+2)/4\rceil$ vertices
have to be removed in order to decycle a cubic graph on $n$ vertices. In 1979,
Payan and Sakarovitch proved that the decycling number of a cyclically
$4$-edge-connected cubic graph of order $n$ equals $\lceil (n+2)/4\rceil$. In
addition, they characterised the structure of minimum decycling sets and their
complements. If $n\equiv 2\pmod4$, then $G$ has a decycling set which is
independent and its complement induces a tree. If $n\equiv 0\pmod4$, then one
of two possibilities occurs: either $G$ has an independent decycling set whose
complement induces a forest of two trees, or the decycling set is
near-independent (which means that it induces a single edge) and its complement
induces a tree. In this paper we strengthen the result of Payan and Sakarovitch
by proving that the latter possibility (a near-independent set and a tree) can
always be guaranteed. Moreover, we relax the assumption of cyclic
$4$-edge-connectivity to a significantly weaker condition expressed through the
canonical decomposition of 3-connected cubic graphs into cyclically
$4$-edge-connected ones. Our methods substantially use a surprising and
seemingly distant relationship between the decycling number and the maximum
genus of a cubic graph.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for
the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing
classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,
quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating
the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure
satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side
information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of
quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data
complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from
the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the
state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about
quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine
learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss
simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the
paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we
provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical
learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.
Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning
by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide
extensive pointers to the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of
near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational
quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used
as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that
they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features
(RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under
which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational
quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make
concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures
which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum
advantage via PQC based optimization.

approximately solve optimal transport problems on a finite set. This paper is
concerned with regularized optimal transport problems via Bregman divergence.
We introduce the required properties for Bregman divergences, provide a

<p class="mathjax">Monte Carlo (MC) approximation has been used as the standard computation
approach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable
expectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in
terms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class
of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that
rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of
QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between
probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically
verify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,
including Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral
points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud
interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud
autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and
RQSW variants.

<p class="mathjax">There is a correlation between adjacent channels of electroencephalogram
(EEG), and how to represent this correlation is an issue that is currently
being explored. In addition, due to inter-individual differences in EEG
signals, this discrepancy results in new subjects need spend a amount of
calibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order
to solve the above problems, we propose a Dynamic Domain Adaptation Based Deep
Learning Network (DADL-Net). First, the EEG data is mapped to the
three-dimensional geometric space and its temporal-spatial features are learned
through the 3D convolution module, and then the spatial-channel attention
mechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module
can further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to
account for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic
domain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by
introducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification
layer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the
performance of the proposed method on BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI
datasets. Under the intra-subject experiment, the accuracy rates of 70.42% and
73.91% were achieved on the OpenBMI and BCIC IV 2a datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Current speaker recognition systems primarily rely on supervised approaches,
constrained by the scale of labeled datasets. To boost the system performance,
researchers leverage large pretrained models such as WavLM to transfer learned
high-level features to the downstream speaker recognition task. However, this
approach introduces extra parameters as the pretrained model remains in the
inference stage. Another group of researchers directly apply self-supervised
methods such as DINO to speaker embedding learning, yet they have not explored
its potential on large-scale in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we present
the effectiveness of DINO training on the large-scale WenetSpeech dataset and
its transferability in enhancing the supervised system performance on the
CNCeleb dataset. Additionally, we introduce a confidence-based data filtering
algorithm to remove unreliable data from the pretraining dataset, leading to
better performance with less training data. The associated pretrained models,
confidence files, pretraining and finetuning scripts will be made available in
the Wespeaker toolkit.

<p class="mathjax">We study mean-field control problems in discrete-time under the infinite
horizon average cost optimality criteria. We focus on both the finite
population and the infinite population setups. We show the existence of the
average cost optimality equation (ACOE) and the existence of optimal stationary
Markov policies for finite population problems under (i) a minorization
condition that provides geometric ergodicity on the collective state process of
the agents, and (ii) under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions on the
stage-wise cost and transition function of the agents when the Lipschitz
constant of the transition function satisfies a certain bound. Furthermore, we
provide a relative value iteration algorithm that approximates the optimal
solution of the problem. For the infinite population problem, we establish the
existence of the ACOE, and the existence of optimal policies under the
continuity assumptions on the cost and the transition functions, and we provide
a convergent relative value iteration method for the infinite population
problem as well. Finally, we prove that the optimal value of the finite
population problem converges to the optimal value of the infinite population
problem as the number of agents grows to infinity. This result has been proven
for finite horizon and infinite horizon discounted cost problems, however, it
is the first result for the average cost optimality criteria to our knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has
significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One
major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging
monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop
a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables
controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise
and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent
advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression
accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the
iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an
exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct
experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the
superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and
Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease
Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from
35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%
of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our
best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression
images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical
research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to
model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and
improve patient outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">Whisper is a powerful automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Nevertheless,
its zero-shot performance on low-resource speech requires further improvement.
Child speech, as a representative type of low-resource speech, is leveraged for
adaptation. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in NLP was shown
to be comparable and even better than full fine-tuning, while only needing to
tune a small set of trainable parameters. However, current PEFT methods have
not been well examined for their effectiveness on Whisper. In this paper, only
parameter composition types of PEFT approaches such as LoRA and Bitfit are
investigated as they do not bring extra inference costs. Different popular PEFT
methods are examined. Particularly, we compare LoRA and AdaLoRA and figure out
the learnable rank coefficient is a good design. Inspired by the sparse rank
distribution allocated by AdaLoRA, a novel PEFT approach Sparsely Shared LoRA
(S2-LoRA) is proposed. The two low-rank decomposed matrices are globally
shared. Each weight matrix only has to maintain its specific rank coefficients
that are constrained to be sparse. Experiments on low-resource Chinese child
speech show that with much fewer trainable parameters, S2-LoRA can achieve
comparable in-domain adaptation performance to AdaLoRA and exhibit better
generalization ability on out-of-domain data. In addition, the rank
distribution automatically learned by S2-LoRA is found to have similar patterns
to AdaLoRA's allocation.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based speech recognition (ASR) model with deep layers exhibited
significant performance improvement. However, the model is inefficient for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Layer pruning (LP) is a commonly
used compression method to remove redundant layers. Previous studies on LP
usually identify the redundant layers according to a task-specific evaluation
metric. They are time-consuming for models with a large number of layers, even
in a greedy search manner. To address this problem, we propose CoMFLP, a fast
search LP algorithm based on correlation measure. The correlation between
layers is computed to generate a correlation matrix, which identifies the
redundancy among layers. The search process is carried out in two steps: (1)
coarse search: to determine top $K$ candidates by pruning the most redundant
layers based on the correlation matrix; (2) fine search: to select the best
pruning proposal among $K$ candidates using a task-specific evaluation metric.
Experiments on an ASR task show that the pruning proposal determined by CoMFLP
outperforms existing LP methods while only requiring constant time complexity.
The code is publicly available at https://github.com/louislau1129/CoMFLP.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a parallel (distributed) version of the spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (SPOD) technique. The parallel SPOD algorithm distributes the
spatial dimension of the dataset preserving time. This approach is adopted to
preserve the non-distributed fast Fourier transform of the data in time,
thereby avoiding the associated bottlenecks. The parallel SPOD algorithm is
implemented in the PySPOD (https://github.com/MathEXLab/PySPOD) library and
makes use of the standard message passing interface (MPI) library, implemented
in Python via mpi4py (https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). An extensive
performance evaluation of the parallel package is provided, including strong
and weak scalability analyses. The open-source library allows the analysis of
large datasets of interest across the scientific community. Here, we present
applications in fluid dynamics and geophysics, that are extremely difficult (if
not impossible) to achieve without a parallel algorithm. This work opens the
path toward modal analyses of big quasi-stationary data, helping to uncover new

<p class="mathjax">Wireless communications at high-frequency bands with large antenna arrays
face challenges in beam management, which can potentially be improved by
multimodality sensing information from cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS. In this
paper, we present a multimodal transformer deep learning framework for
sensing-assisted beam prediction. We employ a convolutional neural network to
extract the features from a sequence of images, point clouds, and radar raw
data sampled over time. At each convolutional layer, we use transformer
encoders to learn the hidden relations between feature tokens from different
modalities and time instances over abstraction space and produce encoded
vectors for the next-level feature extraction. We train the model on a
combination of different modalities with supervised learning. We try to enhance
the model over imbalanced data by utilizing focal loss and exponential moving
average. We also evaluate data processing and augmentation techniques such as
image enhancement, segmentation, background filtering, multimodal data
flipping, radar signal transformation, and GPS angle calibration. Experimental
results show that our solution trained on image and GPS data produces the best
distance-based accuracy of predicted beams at 78.44%, with effective
generalization to unseen day scenarios near 73% and night scenarios over 84%.
This outperforms using other modalities and arbitrary data processing
techniques, which demonstrates the effectiveness of transformers with feature
fusion in performing radio beam prediction from images and GPS. Furthermore,
our solution could be pretrained from large sequences of multimodality wireless
data, on fine-tuning for multiple downstream radio network tasks.

to cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is essential to improve
patient prognosis and survival rates. Despite advances in medical imaging
techniques, pancreatic cancer remains a challenging disease to detect.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most effective diagnostic tool for detecting
pancreatic cancer. However, it requires expert interpretation of complex
ultrasound images to complete a reliable patient scan. To obtain complete
imaging of the pancreas, practitioners must learn to guide the endoscope into
multiple "EUS stations" (anatomical locations), which provide different views
of the pancreas. This is a difficult skill to learn, involving over 225
proctored procedures with the support of an experienced doctor. We build an
AI-assisted tool that utilizes deep learning techniques to identify these
stations of the stomach in real time during EUS procedures. This
computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) will help train doctors more efficiently.
Historically, the challenge faced in developing such a tool has been the amount
of retrospective labeling required by trained clinicians. To solve this, we
developed an open-source user-friendly labeling web app that streamlines the
process of annotating stations during the EUS procedure with minimal effort
from the clinicians. Our research shows that employing only 43 procedures with
no hyperparameter fine-tuning obtained a balanced accuracy of 90%, comparable
to the current state of the art. In addition, we employ Grad-CAM, a
visualization technology that provides clinicians with interpretable and
explainable visualizations.

<p class="mathjax">The current speech anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) show excellent
performance on specific datasets. However, removing the silence of test speech
through Voice Activity Detection (VAD) can severely degrade performance. In
this paper, the impact of silence on speech anti-spoofing is analyzed. First,
the reasons for the impact are explored, including the proportion of silence
duration and the content of silence. The proportion of silence duration in
spoof speech generated by text-to-speech (TTS) algorithms is lower than that in
bonafide speech. And the content of silence generated by different waveform
generators varies compared to bonafide speech. Then the impact of silence on
model prediction is explored. Even after retraining, the spoof speech generated
by neural network based end-to-end TTS algorithms suffers a significant rise in
error rates when the silence is removed. To demonstrate the reasons for the
impact of silence on CMs, the attention distribution of a CM is visualized
through class activation mapping (CAM). Furthermore, the implementation and
analysis of the experiments masking silence or non-silence demonstrates the
significance of the proportion of silence duration for detecting TTS and the
importance of silence content for detecting voice conversion (VC). Based on the
experimental results, improving the robustness of CMs against unknown spoofing
attacks by masking silence is also proposed. Finally, the attacks on
anti-spoofing CMs through concatenating silence, and the mitigation of VAD and
silence attack through low-pass filtering are introduced.

<p class="mathjax">We consider three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite
Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these
spatial models, the connection probability between two nodes depends on their
spatial distance and on their expected degrees. Motivated by awareness or
time-limitations of nodes to pass information or an infection along, we study a
version of first-passage percolation on these graphs where the transmission
time between two connected nodes is non-iid, but instead increases by a penalty
factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Beyond the Markov case, we also
allow a wide range of transmission time distributions $L$ across edges, where
the growth behaviour we see depends on the cumulative distribution function of
$L$ at $0$. We show that the transmission time between two far away vertices
can be either linear, polynomial, or polylogarithmic in their geometric
distance, based on a few parameters of the model such as the tail of the degree
distribution, the long-range parameter, and the penalty function. In this paper
we present the proofs of the upper bounds. This complements results from a
companion paper in which we show matching lower bounds in the polynomial and
linear regimes.
<br />Together with the companion paper and previous work, our results imply that
the transmission time undergoes three phase transitions as the penalty exponent
increases, yielding phases in which transmission times are linear in the
Euclidean distance, or polynomial but sublinear, or at most polylogarithmic but
unbounded, or bounded (called explosive regime).

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning methods for communications over unknown nonlinear channels have
attracted considerable interest recently. In this paper, we consider
semi-supervised learning methods, which are based on variational inference, for
decoding unknown nonlinear channels. These methods, which include Monte Carlo
expectation maximization and a variational autoencoder, make efficient use of
few pilot symbols and the payload data. The best semi-supervised learning
results are achieved with a variational autoencoder. For sufficiently many
payload symbols, the variational autoencoder also has lower error rate compared
to meta learning that uses the pilot data of the present as well as previous
transmission blocks.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient training of large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs) has been
studied with a specific focus on reducing their memory consumption. Work by Liu
et al. (2022) proposed extreme activation compression (EXACT) which
demonstrated drastic reduction in memory consumption by performing quantization
of the intermediate activation maps down to using INT2 precision. They showed
little to no reduction in performance while achieving large reductions in GPU
memory consumption. In this work, we present an improvement to the EXACT
strategy by using block-wise quantization of the intermediate activation maps.
We experimentally analyze different block sizes and show further reduction in
memory consumption (&gt;15%), and runtime speedup per epoch (about 5%) even when
performing extreme extents of quantization with similar performance trade-offs
as with the original EXACT. Further, we present a correction to the assumptions
on the distribution of intermediate activation maps in EXACT (assumed to be
uniform) and show improved variance estimations of the quantization and
dequantization steps.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation
on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is
non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected
degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it
increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice
is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the underlying graph models
we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so
that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite)
Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these
spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on
their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We identify the
parameter-regimes where the transmission time between two far away vertices
$x,y$ are respectively polynomial ($\Theta(|x-y|^{\eta_0})$ for some
$\eta_0&lt;1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. In this
paper we present proofs of lower bounds and the upper bound for the linear
regime. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in
our companion paper. Together with the companion paper and other work, our
results imply that the transmission time between $x,y$ undergoes three phase
transitions as the penalty exponent increases. The four phases are: bounded
(explosive), at most polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear, and linear
transmission times. We conjecture universality of this phenomenon across
models.

<p class="mathjax">Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are an emerging technology
that offer advantages over traditional shutter and frame-based cameras,
including high temporal resolution, low power consumption, and selective data
acquisition. In this study, we propose to harnesses the capabilities of
event-based cameras to capture subtle changes in the surface of the skin caused
by the pulsatile flow of blood in the wrist region. We investigate whether an
event camera could be used for continuous noninvasive monitoring of heart rate
(HR). Event camera video data from 25 participants, comprising varying age
groups and skin colours, was collected and analysed. Ground-truth HR
measurements obtained using conventional methods were used to evaluate of the
accuracy of automatic detection of HR from event camera data. Our experimental
results and comparison to the performance of other non-contact HR measurement
methods demonstrate the feasibility of using event cameras for pulse detection.
We also acknowledge the challenges and limitations of our method, such as
light-induced flickering and the sub-conscious but naturally-occurring tremors
of an individual during data capture.

<p class="mathjax">Learned video compression (LVC) has witnessed remarkable advancements in
recent years. Similar as the traditional video coding, LVC inherits motion
estimation/compensation, residual coding and other modules, all of which are
implemented with neural networks (NNs). However, within the framework of NNs
and its training mechanism using gradient backpropagation, most existing works
often struggle to consistently generate stable motion information, which is in
the form of geometric features, from the input color features. Moreover, the
modules such as the inter-prediction and residual coding are independent from
each other, making it inefficient to fully reduce the spatial-temporal
redundancy. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel
Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Video Compression (STT-VC) framework. It
contains a Relaxed Deformable Transformer (RDT) with Uformer based offsets
estimation for motion estimation and compensation, a Multi-Granularity
Prediction (MGP) module based on multi-reference frames for prediction
refinement, and a Spatial Feature Distribution prior based Transformer (SFD-T)
for efficient temporal-spatial joint residual compression. Specifically, RDT is
developed to stably estimate the motion information between frames by
thoroughly investigating the relationship between the similarity based
geometric motion feature extraction and self-attention. MGP is designed to fuse
the multi-reference frame information by effectively exploring the
coarse-grained prediction feature generated with the coded motion information.
SFD-T is to compress the residual information by jointly exploring the spatial
feature distributions in both residual and temporal prediction to further
reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method achieves the best result with 13.5% BD-Rate saving over VTM.

<p class="mathjax">Both passive and active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be
deployed in complex environments to enhance wireless network coverage by
creating multiple blockage-free cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) links. In this
paper, we study a multi-passive/active-IRS (PIRS/AIRS) aided wireless network
with a multi-antenna base station (BS) in a given region. First, we divide the
region into multiple non-overlapping cells, each of which may contain one
candidate location that can be deployed with a single PIRS or AIRS. Then, we
show several trade-offs between minimizing the total IRS deployment cost and
enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance over all cells via
direct/cascaded LoS transmission with the BS. To reconcile these trade-offs, we
formulate a joint multi-PIRS/AIRS deployment problem to select an optimal
subset of all candidate locations for deploying IRS and also optimize the
number of passive/active reflecting elements deployed at each selected location
to satisfy a given SNR target over all cells, such that the total deployment
cost is minimized. However, due to the combinatorial optimization involved, the
formulated problem is difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this
difficulty, we first optimize the reflecting element numbers with given
PIRS/AIRS deployed locations via sequential refinement, followed by a partial
enumeration to determine the PIRS/AIRS locations. Simulation results show that
our proposed algorithm achieves better cost-performance trade-offs than other
baseline deployment strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have become widely adopted in various domains, but their
performance heavily relies on a vast amount of data. Datasets often contain a
large number of irrelevant or redundant samples, which can lead to
computational inefficiencies during the training. In this work, we introduce,
for the first time in the context of the audio domain, the k-means clustering
as a method for efficient data pruning. K-means clustering provides a way to
group similar samples together, allowing the reduction of the size of the
dataset while preserving its representative characteristics. As an example, we
perform clustering analysis on the keyword spotting (KWS) dataset. We discuss
how k-means clustering can significantly reduce the size of audio datasets
while maintaining the classification performance across neural networks (NNs)
with different architectures. We further comment on the role of scaling
analysis in identifying the optimal pruning strategies for a large number of
samples. Our studies serve as a proof-of-principle, demonstrating the potential
of data selection with distance-based clustering algorithms for the audio
domain and highlighting promising research avenues.

effect occurs whether exposed or not. We derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for non-immunity and $\epsilon$-bounded immunity, i.e. the
probability of immunity is zero and $\epsilon$-bounded, respectively. The
former allows us to estimate the probability of benefit (i.e., the effect
occurs if and only if exposed) from a randomized controlled trial, and the
latter allows us to produce bounds of the probability of benefit that are
tighter than the existing ones. We also introduce the concept of indirect
immunity (i.e., through a mediator) and repeat our previous analysis for it.
Finally, we propose a method for sensitivity analysis of the probability of
immunity under unmeasured confounding.

theory, such as the well-known uncertainty principle. Roughly speaking, two
objects are said to be complementary if being certain about one of them
necessarily forbids useful knowledge about the other. Two quantum measurements
that do not commute form an example of complementary measurements, and this
phenomenon can also be defined for ensembles of states. Although a key quantum
feature, it is unclear whether complementarity can be understood more
operationally, as a necessary resource in some quantum information task. Here
we show this is the case, and relates to a novel task which we term
$\eta$-unambiguous exclusion. As well as giving complementarity a clear
operational definition, this also uncovers the foundational underpinning of
unambiguous exclusion tasks for the first time. We further show that a special
type of measurement complementarity is equivalent to advantages in certain
encryption tasks. Finally, our analysis suggest that complementarity of
measurement and state ensemble can be interpreted as strong forms of
measurement incompatibility and quantum steering, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Previous methods for predicting room acoustic parameters and speech quality
metrics have focused on the single-channel case, where room acoustics and Mean
Opinion Score (MOS) are predicted for a single recording device. However,
quality-based device selection for rooms with multiple recording devices may
benefit from a multi-channel approach where the descriptive metrics are
predicted for multiple devices in parallel. Following our hypothesis that a
model may benefit from multi-channel training, we develop a multi-channel model
for joint MOS and room acoustics prediction (MOSRA) for five channels in
parallel. The lack of multi-channel audio data with ground truth labels
necessitated the creation of simulated data using an acoustic simulator with
room acoustic labels extracted from the generated impulse responses and labels
for MOS generated in a student-teacher setup using a wav2vec2-based MOS
prediction model. Our experiments show that the multi-channel model improves
the prediction of the direct-to-reverberation ratio, clarity, and speech
transmission index over the single-channel model with roughly 5$\times$ less
computation while suffering minimal losses in the performance of the other
metrics.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of big data and computing devices, low-latency
automatic trading platforms based on real-time information acquisition have
become the main components of the stock trading market, so the topic of
quantitative trading has received widespread attention. And for non-strongly
efficient trading markets, human emotions and expectations always dominate
market trends and trading decisions. Therefore, this paper starts from the
theory of emotion, taking East Money as an example, crawling user comment
titles data from its corresponding stock bar and performing data cleaning.
Subsequently, a natural language processing model BERT was constructed, and the
BERT model was fine-tuned using existing annotated data sets. The experimental
results show that the fine-tuned model has different degrees of performance
improvement compared to the original model and the baseline model.
Subsequently, based on the above model, the user comment data crawled is
labeled with emotional polarity, and the obtained label information is combined
with the Alpha191 model to participate in regression, and significant
regression results are obtained. Subsequently, the regression model is used to
predict the average price change for the next five days, and use it as a signal
to guide automatic trading. The experimental results show that the
incorporation of emotional factors increased the return rate by 73.8\% compared
to the baseline during the trading period, and by 32.41\% compared to the
original alpha191 model. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of incorporating emotional factors into quantitative trading, and give possible
directions for further research in the future.

parameterized linear matrix inequalities (PLMIs) that are formulated as nested
fuzzy summations. Such PLMIs are commonly encountered in stability analysis and
control design problems for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. Utilizing the

methodology enables us to efficiently handle the product of membership

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are recognized as promising technologies for
area coverage due to the flexibility and adaptability. However, the ability of
a single UAV is limited, and as for the large-scale three-dimensional (3D)
scenario, UAV swarms can establish seamless wireless communication services.
Hence, in this work, we consider a scenario of UAV swarm deployment and
trajectory to satisfy 3D coverage considering the effects of obstacles. In
detail, we propose a hierarchical swarm framework to efficiently serve the
large-area users. Then, the problem is formulated to minimize the total
trajectory loss of the UAV swarm. However, the problem is intractable due to
the non-convex property, and we decompose it into smaller issues of users
clustering, UAV swarm hovering points selection, and swarm trajectory
determination. Moreover, we design a Q-learning based algorithm to accelerate
the solution efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to verify
the proposed mechanisms, and the designed algorithm outperforms other referred
methods.

identified early, it is possible to alter the prognosis of the patient, one
could use imaging exams to help in the diagnostic confirmation. Performing and
interpreting the exams as soon as possible is vital for a good treatment, with
the most common exam for this pathology being chest X-ray. The objective of
this study was to develop a software that identify the presence or absence of
pneumonia in chest radiographs. The software was developed as a computational
model based on machine learning using transfer learning technique. For the
training process, images were collected from a database available online with
children's chest X-rays images taken at a hospital in China. After training,
the model was then exposed to new images, achieving relevant results on
identifying such pathology, reaching 98% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity for
the sample used for testing. It can be concluded that it is possible to develop
a software that identifies pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

<p class="mathjax">Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection is a critical task and
has received increasing attentions in the remote sensing community. However,
existing SAR change detection methods are mainly based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), with limited consideration of global attention mechanism. In
this letter, we explore Transformer-like architecture for SAR change detection
to incorporate global attention. To this end, we propose a convolution and
attention mixer (CAMixer). First, to compensate the inductive bias for
Transformer, we combine self-attention with shift convolution in a parallel
way. The parallel design effectively captures the global semantic information
via the self-attention and performs local feature extraction through shift
convolution simultaneously. Second, we adopt a gating mechanism in the
feed-forward network to enhance the non-linear feature transformation. The
gating mechanism is formulated as the element-wise multiplication of two
parallel linear layers. Important features can be highlighted, leading to
high-quality representations against speckle noise. Extensive experiments
conducted on three SAR datasets verify the superior performance of the proposed
CAMixer. The source codes will be publicly available at
https://github.com/summitgao/CAMixer .

<p class="mathjax">This study investigates mask-based beamformers (BFs), which estimate filters
to extract target speech using time-frequency masks. Although several BF
methods have been proposed, the following aspects are yet to be comprehensively
investigated. 1) Which BF can provide the best extraction performance in terms
of the closeness of the BF output to the target speech? 2) Is the optimal mask
for the best performance common for all BFs? 3) Is the ideal ratio mask (IRM)
identical to the optimal mask? Accordingly, we investigate these issues
considering four mask-based BFs: the maximum signal-to-noise ratio BF, two
variants of this, and the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) BF. To obtain the
optimal mask corresponding to the peak performance for each BF, we employ an
approach that minimizes the mean square error between the BF output and target
speech for each utterance. Via the experiments with the CHiME-3 dataset, we
verify that the four BFs have the same peak performance as the upper bound
provided by the ideal MWF BF, whereas the optimal mask depends on the adopted
BF and differs from the IRM. These observations differ from the conventional
idea that the optimal mask is common for all BFs and that peak performance
differs for each BF. Hence, this study contributes to the design of mask-based
BFs.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of radar signals without assistance from the radar transmitter is a
crucial requirement for emerging and future shared-spectrum wireless networks
like Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS). In this paper, we propose a
supervised deep learning-based spectrum sensing approach called RadYOLOLet that
can detect low-power radar signals in the presence of interference and estimate
the radar signal parameters. The core of RadYOLOLet is two different
convolutional neural networks (CNN), RadYOLO and Wavelet-CNN, that are trained
independently. RadYOLO operates on spectrograms and provides most of the
capabilities of RadYOLOLet. However, it suffers from low radar detection
accuracy in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We develop Wavelet-CNN
specifically to deal with this limitation of RadYOLO. Wavelet-CNN operates on
continuous Wavelet transform of the captured signals, and we use it only when
RadYOLO fails to detect any radar signal. We thoroughly evaluate RadYOLOLet
using different experiments corresponding to different types of interference
signals. Based on our evaluations, we find that RadYOLOLet can achieve 100%
radar detection accuracy for our considered radar types up to 16 dB SNR, which
cannot be guaranteed by other comparable methods. RadYOLOLet can also function
accurately under interference up to 16 dB SINR.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.

<p class="mathjax">Tumor segmentation in medical imaging is crucial and relies on precise
delineation. Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) is
widely used in clinical practice to detect metabolically active tumors.
However, FDG-PET scans may misinterpret irregular glucose consumption in
healthy or benign tissues as cancer. Combining PET with Computed Tomography
(CT) can enhance tumor segmentation by integrating metabolic and anatomic
information. FDG-PET/CT scans are pivotal for cancer staging and reassessment,
utilizing radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose to highlight metabolically active
regions. Accurately distinguishing tumor-specific uptake from physiological
uptake in normal tissues is a challenging aspect of precise tumor segmentation.
The AutoPET challenge addresses this by providing a dataset of 1014 FDG-PET/CT
studies, encouraging advancements in accurate tumor segmentation and analysis
within the FDG-PET/CT domain. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Neural network approaches to single-channel speech enhancement have received
much recent attention. In particular, mask-based architectures have achieved
significant performance improvements over conventional methods. This paper
proposes a multiscale autoencoder (MSAE) for mask-based end-to-end neural
network speech enhancement. The MSAE performs spectral decomposition of an
input waveform within separate band-limited branches, each operating with a
different rate and scale, to extract a sequence of multiscale embeddings. The
proposed framework features intuitive parameterization of the autoencoder,
including a flexible spectral band design based on the Constant-Q transform.
Additionally, the MSAE is constructed entirely of differentiable operators,
allowing it to be implemented within an end-to-end neural network, and be
discriminatively trained. The MSAE draws motivation both from recent multiscale
network topologies and from traditional multiresolution transforms in speech
processing. Experimental results show the MSAE to provide clear performance
benefits relative to conventional single-branch autoencoders. Additionally, the
proposed framework is shown to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art
enhancement systems, both in terms of objective speech quality metrics and
automatic speech recognition accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Global challenges like climate change may be considered as collective action
problems that require sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms, soon
enough to be effective. Socio-political polarization is a barrier to collective
action. Prior agent-based models of behavioural change on structured networks
in a shared socio-political environment have shown that polarization emerges
naturally in such systems and that the speed of consensus formation is limited
by the rate at which polarized clusters can be dissolved. Here we study how
guided social link rewiring affects the speed of network depolarization. We
investigate rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, introduction by
mutual acquaintances, and bridging between socially distant communities. We
find that building lasting links between polarized individuals and communities
can accelerate consensus formation when the sociopolitical environment is
favourable. This strengthens the evidence that promoting connection between
polarized communities could accelerate collective action on urgent global
challenges.

<p class="mathjax">We study batched bandit experiments and consider the problem of inference
conditional on the realized stopping time, assignment probabilities, and target
parameter, where all of these may be chosen adaptively using information up to
the last batch of the experiment. Absent further restrictions on the
experiment, we show that inference using only the results of the last batch is
optimal. When the adaptive aspects of the experiment are known to be
location-invariant, in the sense that they are unchanged when we shift all
batch-arm means by a constant, we show that there is additional information in
the data, captured by one additional linear function of the batch-arm means. In
the more restrictive case where the stopping time, assignment probabilities,
and target parameter are known to depend on the data only through a collection
of polyhedral events, we derive computationally tractable and optimal
conditional inference procedures.

to be implemented in future generations of quantum computers. The
renormalisation decoders introduced by Duclos-Cianci and Poulin exhibit one of
the best trade-offs between efficiency and speed, but one question that was
left open is how they handle worst-case or adversarial errors, i.e. what is the
order of magnitude of the smallest weight of an error pattern that will be
wrongly decoded. We initiate such a study involving a simple hard-decision and
deterministic version of a renormalisation decoder. We exhibit an uncorrectable
error pattern whose weight scales like $d^{1/2}$ and prove that the decoder
corrects all error patterns of weight less than $\frac{5}{6}
d^{\log_{2}(6/5)}$, where $d$ is the minimum distance of the toric code.

<p class="mathjax">Brain tumors are collections of abnormal cells that can develop into masses
or clusters. Because they have the potential to infiltrate other tissues, they
pose a risk to the patient. The main imaging technique used, MRI, may be able
to identify a brain tumor with accuracy. The fast development of Deep Learning
methods for use in computer vision applications has been facilitated by a vast
amount of training data and improvements in model construction that offer
better approximations in a supervised setting. The need for these approaches
has been the main driver of this expansion. Deep learning methods have shown
promise in improving the precision of brain tumor detection and classification
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study on the use of deep learning
techniques, especially ResNet50, for brain tumor identification is presented in
this abstract. As a result, this study investigates the possibility of
automating the detection procedure using deep learning techniques. In this
study, I utilized five transfer learning models which are VGG16, VGG19,
DenseNet121, ResNet50 and YOLO V4 where ResNet50 provide the best or highest
accuracy 99.54%. The goal of the study is to guide researchers and medical
professionals toward powerful brain tumor detecting systems by employing deep
learning approaches by way of this evaluation and analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Indoor localization is getting increasing demands for various cutting-edged
technologies, like Virtual/Augmented reality and smart home. Traditional
model-based localization suffers from significant computational overhead, so
fingerprint localization is getting increasing attention, which needs lower
computation cost after the fingerprint database is built. However, the accuracy
of indoor localization is limited by the complicated indoor environment which
brings the multipath signal refraction. In this paper, we provided a scheme to
improve the accuracy of indoor fingerprint localization from the frequency
domain by predicting the channel state information (CSI) values from another
transmitting channel and spliced the multi-band information together to get
more precise localization results. We tested our proposed scheme on COST 2100
simulation data and real time orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
WiFi data collected from an office scenario.

<p class="mathjax">Electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression is necessary for wireless
recording applications to reduce the amount of data that needs to be
transmitted. In this paper, an asymmetrical sparse autoencoder with a discrete
cosine transform (DCT) layer is proposed to compress EEG signals. The encoder
module of the autoencoder has a combination of a fully connected linear layer
and the DCT layer to reduce redundant data using hard-thresholding
nonlinearity. Furthermore, the DCT layer includes trainable hard-thresholding
parameters and scaling layers to give emphasis or de-emphasis on individual DCT
coefficients. Finally, the one-by-one convolutional layer generates the latent
space. The sparsity penalty-based cost function is employed to keep the feature
map as sparse as possible in the latent space. The latent space data is
transmitted to the receiver. The decoder module of the autoencoder is designed
using the inverse DCT and two fully connected linear layers to improve the
accuracy of data reconstruction. In comparison to other state-of-the-art
methods, the proposed method significantly improves the average quality score
in various data compression experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Schizophrenia (SZ) is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of SZ include hallucinations,
illusions, delusions, lack of motivation, and difficulties in concentration.
Diagnosing SZ involves employing various tools, including clinical interviews,
physical examinations, psychological evaluations, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and neuroimaging techniques.
Electroencephalography (EEG) recording is a significant functional neuroimaging
modality that provides valuable insights into brain function during SZ.
However, EEG signal analysis poses challenges for neurologists and scientists
due to the presence of artifacts, long-term recordings, and the utilization of
multiple channels. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, encompassing conventional machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, to aid in SZ diagnosis. This
study reviews papers focused on SZ diagnosis utilizing EEG signals and AI
methods. The introduction section provides a comprehensive explanation of SZ
diagnosis methods and intervention techniques. Subsequently, review papers in
this field are discussed, followed by an introduction to the AI methods
employed for SZ diagnosis and a summary of relevant papers presented in tabular
form. Additionally, this study reports on the most significant challenges
encountered in SZ diagnosis, as identified through a review of papers in this
field. Future directions to overcome these challenges are also addressed. The
discussion section examines the specific details of each paper, culminating in
the presentation of conclusions and findings.

<p class="mathjax">Objective: The objective of the study is to efficiently increase the
expressivity of surface electromyography-based (sEMG) gesture recognition
systems. Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions
were subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist
directions and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we
train models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate
to the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.
We collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in
which subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and
conducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier
algorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the
proposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation
approach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear
classifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in
increasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration
time. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and
prosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.
The proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to
demonstrate all combination gesture classes. Our results may be extended to
larger gesture vocabularies and more complicated model architectures.

proposed model is highly versatile and it can be used with any kind of

optimization problems, where each agent computes an optimal solution of the
problem locally without any central computation or coordination, while
communicating with its immediate, one-hop neighbors over a communication

average conjugate direction across the network, computed via a dynamic
consensus approach. Our algorithm enables the agents to use uncoordinated
step-sizes. We prove convergence of the local variable of each agent to the
optimal solution of the aggregate optimization problem, without requiring

<p class="mathjax">Biomedical image datasets can be imbalanced due to the rarity of targeted
diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this
imbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.
It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range
of features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the
training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic
images can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode
collapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate
diversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and
inter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are
investigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray
images is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the
benefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep
Convolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse
problems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and
training a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the
model is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results
demonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image
normalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as
evidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.

<p class="mathjax">A rigidity circuit (in 2D) is a minimal dependent set in the rigidity
matroid, i.e. a minimal graph supporting a non-trivial stress in any generic
placement of its vertices in $\mathbb R^2$. Any rigidity circuit on $n\geq 5$
vertices can be obtained from rigidity circuits on a fewer number of vertices
by applying the combinatorial resultant (CR) operation. The inverse operation
is called a combinatorial resultant decomposition (CR-decomp). Any rigidity
circuit on $n\geq 5$ vertices can be successively decomposed into smaller
circuits, until the complete graphs $K_4$ are reached. This sequence of
CR-decomps has the structure of a rooted binary tree called the combinatorial
resultant tree (CR-tree).
<br />A CR-tree encodes an elimination strategy for computing circuit polynomials
via Sylvester resultants. Different CR-trees lead to elimination strategies
that can vary greatly in time and memory consumption. It is an open problem to
establish criteria for optimal CR-trees, or at least to characterize those
CR-trees that lead to good elimination strategies. In [12] we presented an
algorithm for enumerating CR-trees where we give the algorithms for decomposing
3-connected rigidity circuits in polynomial time. In this paper we focus on
those circuits that are not 3-connected, which we simply call 2-connected.
<br />In order to enumerate CR-decomps of 2-connected circuits $G$, a brute force
exp-time search has to be performed among the subgraphs induced by the subsets
of $V(G)$. This exp-time bottleneck is not present in the 3-connected case. In
this paper we will argue that we do not have to account for all possible
CR-decomps of 2-connected rigidity circuits to find a good elimination
strategy; we only have to account for those CR-decomps that are a 2-split, all
of which can be enumerated in polynomial time. We present algorithms and
computational evidence in support of this heuristic.
