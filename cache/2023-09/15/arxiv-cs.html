<p class="mathjax">The importance of improving the FAIRness (findability, accessibility,
interoperability, reusability) of research data is undeniable, especially in
the face of large, complex datasets currently being produced by omics
technologies. Facilitating the integration of a dataset with other types of
data increases the likelihood of reuse, and the potential of answering novel
research questions. Ontologies are a useful tool for semantically tagging
datasets as adding relevant metadata increases the understanding of how data
was produced and increases its interoperability. Ontologies provide concepts
for a particular domain as well as the relationships between concepts. By
tagging data with ontology terms, data becomes both human and machine
interpretable, allowing for increased reuse and interoperability. However, the
task of identifying ontologies relevant to a particular research domain or
technology is challenging, especially within the diverse realm of fundamental
plant research. In this review, we outline the ontologies most relevant to the
fundamental plant sciences and how they can be used to annotate data related to
plant-specific experiments within metadata frameworks, such as
Investigation-Study-Assay (ISA). We also outline repositories and platforms
most useful for identifying applicable ontologies or finding ontology terms.

<p class="mathjax">Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to describe a variety of
physical phenomena. Often these equations do not have analytical solutions and
numerical approximations are used instead. One of the common methods to solve
PDEs is the finite element method. Computing derivative information of the
solution with respect to the input parameters is important in many tasks in
scientific computing. We extend JAX automatic differentiation library with an
interface to Firedrake finite element library. High-level symbolic
representation of PDEs allows bypassing differentiating through low-level
possibly many iterations of the underlying nonlinear solvers. Differentiating
through Firedrake solvers is done using tangent-linear and adjoint equations.
This enables the efficient composition of finite element solvers with arbitrary
differentiable programs. The code is available at
github.com/IvanYashchuk/jax-firedrake.

<p class="mathjax">Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by
providing on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management
is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand
scenarios. In this paper, we present VertiSync, a centralized traffic
management policy for on-demand UAM networks. VertiSync schedules the aircraft
for either servicing trip requests or rebalancing in the network subject to
aircraft safety margins and separation requirements during takeoff and landing.
We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the
demand threshold at which travel times transition from being stabilized to
being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy is able to
maximize the throughput for sufficiently large fleet sizes. We demonstrate the
performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles. We
show that VertiSync significantly reduces travel times compared to a first-come
first-serve scheduling policy.

<p class="mathjax">Maximizing influences in complex networks is a practically important but
computationally challenging task for social network analysis, due to its NP-
hard nature. Most current approximation or heuristic methods either require
tremendous human design efforts or achieve unsatisfying balances between
effectiveness and efficiency. Recent machine learning attempts only focus on
speed but lack performance enhancement. In this paper, different from previous
attempts, we propose an effective deep reinforcement learning model that
achieves superior performances over traditional best influence maximization
algorithms. Specifically, we design an end-to-end learning framework that
combines graph neural network as the encoder and reinforcement learning as the
decoder, named DREIM. Trough extensive training on small synthetic graphs,
DREIM outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on very large synthetic
and real-world networks on solution quality, and we also empirically show its
linear scalability with regard to the network size, which demonstrates its
superiority in solving this problem.

<p class="mathjax">Line outage identification in distribution grids is essential for sustainable
grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection
approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating
the need for costly phase angles or power flow data. Given the sensor data,
many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior
knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage
scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven
method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient
descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues.
To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence
constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates
the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove
that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via
leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate
our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load
profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and
localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without
assuming a prior knowledge of outage patterns.

<p class="mathjax">As recently demonstrated, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), usually trained using
single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work
using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have
attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of
formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32
numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the
accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely
used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the
inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs
are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of
bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands
have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order
to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the
architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is
advantageous with respect to the uncompressed one.

<p class="mathjax">Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for
goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and
transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as
they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously
discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this work, we propose a
developmental mechanism for subgoal discovery via an emergent representation
that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have
similar roles in the task. We create a HRL algorithm that gradually learns this
representation along with the policies and evaluate it on navigation tasks to
show the learned representation is interpretable and results in data
efficiency.

the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,
cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.
<br />We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the
Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of
Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate
simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden
variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a
non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means
clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts
to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data
point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden
variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of
the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a
random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive
bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) were trained. Over the tropical dataset, the best performing
classifier was able to identify non-storm and storm clouds with over 80%
accuracy in each class for a held-out test set. Over the non-tropical dataset,
the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over
90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of
classifiers were shown to be resilient to instrument noise.

<p class="mathjax">Hurricanes present major challenges in the U.S. due to their devastating
impacts. Mitigating these risks is important, and the insurance industry is
central in this effort, using intricate statistical models for risk assessment.
However, these models often neglect key temporal and spatial hurricane patterns
and are limited by data scarcity. This study introduces a refined approach
combining the ARIMA model and K-MEANS to better capture hurricane trends, and
an Autoencoder for enhanced hurricane simulations. Our experiments show that
this hybrid methodology effectively simulate historical hurricane behaviors
while providing detailed projections of potential future trajectories and
intensities. Moreover, by leveraging a comprehensive yet selective dataset, our
simulations enrich the current understanding of hurricane patterns and offer
actionable insights for risk management strategies.

<p class="mathjax">In consequential domains, it is often impossible to compel individuals to
take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to
enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic
monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Pushing the boundaries of machine learning often requires exploring different
hardware and software combinations. However, the freedom to experiment across
different tooling stacks can be at odds with the drive for efficiency, which
has produced increasingly specialized AI hardware and incentivized
consolidation around a narrow set of ML frameworks. Exploratory research can be
restricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to
stray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.
While this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine
learning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been
quantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software
frameworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML
frameworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable
picture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported
to other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in
their performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.
Collectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of
hardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of
hardware impedes innovation in machine learning research.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of long-tailed image
recognition. Previous long-tailed recognition approaches mainly focus on data
augmentation or re-balancing strategies for the tail classes to give them more
attention during model training. However, these methods are limited by the
small number of training images for the tail classes, which results in poor
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose the Latent
Categories based long-tail Recognition (LCReg) method. Our hypothesis is that
common latent features shared by head and tail classes can be used to improve
feature representation. Specifically, we learn a set of class-agnostic latent
features shared by both head and tail classes, and then use semantic data
augmentation on the latent features to implicitly increase the diversity of the
training sample. We conduct extensive experiments on five long-tailed image
recognition datasets, and the results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Chlorophyll concentration can well reflect the nutritional status and algal
blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water
quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great
significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a
complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors
affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear
features contained in the data. This paper proposes a time-series decomposition
adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model.
Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic
component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional
neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter
embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign
weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the
relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state
information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update
relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time
convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The
validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city
Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better
than other methods. It can be used as a scientific resource for environmental
management decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning algorithms perform reasonably well on independent and
identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly
from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many
research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings
indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data.
In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous
environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs
is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data.
Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for
effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme
encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.
Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the
global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it
does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we
evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated
learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and
Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of
LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.

<p class="mathjax">Directly sending audio signals from a transmitter to a receiver across a
noisy channel may absorb consistent bandwidth and be prone to errors when
trying to recover the transmitted bits. On the contrary, the recent semantic
communication approach proposes to send the semantics and then regenerate
semantically consistent content at the receiver without exactly recovering the
bitstream. In this paper, we propose a generative audio semantic communication
framework that faces the communication problem as an inverse problem, therefore
being robust to different corruptions. Our method transmits lower-dimensional
representations of the audio signal and of the associated semantics to the
receiver, which generates the corresponding signal with a particular focus on
its meaning (i.e., the semantics) thanks to the conditional diffusion model at
its core. During the generation process, the diffusion model restores the
received information from multiple degradations at the same time including
corruption noise and missing parts caused by the transmission over the noisy
channel. We show that our framework outperforms competitors in a real-world
scenario and with different channel conditions. Visit the project page to

<p class="mathjax">As one of the important tools for spatial feature extraction, graph
convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow
prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot
guarantee spatio-temporal consistency in a long period. The ignorance of
correlational dynamics, convolutional locality and temporal comprehensiveness
would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve
traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions
of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract
characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created
to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel
emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to
reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public
datasets show our work better than state-of-the-art baselines, and case studies
of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.

<p class="mathjax">The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model
updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach
avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once
the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside
their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to
dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,
adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye
getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then
later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs
(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly
unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine
its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft
adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the
back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the
malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using
three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the
effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto
Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini &amp; Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta
constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the
Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge. Our code is
available to the research community at https://github.com/queyrusi/Pelta.

<p class="mathjax">Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic
systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems
at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps
required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference
process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and
models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information
Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which
aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency
information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error.
Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal
representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics
of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing
time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.

<p class="mathjax">We develop an optimization-based method to model smocking, a surface
embroidery technique that provides decorative geometric texturing while
maintaining stretch properties of the fabric. During smocking, multiple pairs
of points on the fabric are stitched together, creating non-manifold geometric
features and visually pleasing textures. Designing smocking patterns is
challenging, because the outcome of stitching is unpredictable: the final
texture is often revealed only when the whole smocking process is completed,
necessitating painstaking physical fabrication and time consuming
trial-and-error experimentation. This motivates us to seek a digital smocking
design method. Straightforward attempts to compute smocked fabric geometry
using surface deformation or cloth simulation methods fail to produce realistic
results, likely due to the intricate structure of the designs, the large number
of contacts and high-curvature folds. We instead formulate smocking as a graph
embedding and shape deformation problem. We extract a coarse graph representing
the fabric and the stitching constraints, and then derive the graph structure
of the smocked result. We solve for the 3D embedding of this graph, which in
turn reliably guides the deformation of the high-resolution fabric mesh. Our
optimization based method is simple, efficient, and flexible, which allows us
to build an interactive system for smocking pattern exploration. To demonstrate
the accuracy of our method, we compare our results to real fabrications on a
large set of smocking patterns

<p class="mathjax">With California's ambitious goal to achieve decarbonization of the electrical
grid by the year 2045, significant challenges arise in power system investment
planning. Existing modeling methods and software focus on computational
efficiency, which is currently achieved by simplifying the associated unit
commitment formulation. This may lead to unjustifiable inaccuracies in the cost
and constraints of gas-fired generation operations, and may affect both the
timing and the extent of investment in new resources, such as renewable energy
and energy storage.
<br />To address this issue, this paper develops a more detailed and rigorous
mixed-integer model, and more importantly, a solution methodology utilizing
surrogate level-based Lagrangian relaxation to overcome the combinatorial
complexity that results from the enhanced level of model detail. This allows us
to optimize a model with approximately 12 million binary and 100 million total
variables in under 48 hours. The investment plan is compared with those
produced by E3's RESOLVE software, which is currently employed by the
California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission. Our
model produces an investment plan that differs substantially from that of the
existing method and saves California over 12 billion dollars over the
investment horizon.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce EarthPT -- an Earth Observation (EO) pretrained transformer.
EarthPT is a 700 million parameter decoding transformer foundation model
trained in an autoregressive self-supervised manner and developed specifically
with EO use-cases in mind. We demonstrate that EarthPT is an effective
forecaster that can accurately predict future pixel-level surface reflectances
across the 400-2300 nm range well into the future. For example, forecasts of
the evolution of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have a
typical error of approximately 0.05 (over a natural range of -1 -&gt; 1) at the
pixel level over a five month test set horizon, out-performing simple
phase-folded models based on historical averaging. We also demonstrate that
embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could
be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use
classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us
with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume
that EarthPT follows neural scaling laws akin to those derived for Large
Language Models (LLMs), there is currently no data-imposed limit to scaling
EarthPT and other similar `Large Observation Models.'

<p class="mathjax">Modern cloud services are prone to failures due to their complex
architecture, making diagnosis a critical process. Site Reliability Engineers
(SREs) spend hours leveraging multiple sources of data, including the alerts,
error logs, and domain expertise through past experiences to locate the root
cause(s). These experiences are documented as natural language text in outage
reports for previous outages. However, utilizing the raw yet rich
semi-structured information in the reports systematically is time-consuming.
Structured information, on the other hand, such as alerts that are often used
during fault diagnosis, is voluminous and requires expert knowledge to discern.
Several strategies have been proposed to use each source of data separately for
root cause analysis. In this work, we build a diagnostic service called ESRO
that recommends root causes and remediation for failures by utilizing
structured as well as semi-structured sources of data systematically. ESRO
constructs a causal graph using alerts and a knowledge graph using outage
reports, and merges them in a novel way to form a unified graph during
training. A retrieval-based mechanism is then used to search the unified graph
and rank the likely root causes and remediation techniques based on the alerts
fired during an outage at inference time. Not only the individual alerts, but
their respective importance in predicting an outage group is taken into account
during recommendation. We evaluated our model on several cloud service outages
of a large SaaS enterprise over the course of ~2 years, and obtained an average
improvement of 27% in rouge scores after comparing the likely root causes
against the ground truth over state-of-the-art baselines. We further establish
the effectiveness of ESRO through qualitative analysis on multiple real outage
examples.

<p class="mathjax">An immediate need in the transmission system is to find alternative solutions
that improve system operation and defer the need for new transmission lines.
This study comprehensively evaluates the performance and economic benefits of
using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as virtual transmission (VT) to
promote power transfer cross distant regions. Specifically, this work
implements various day-ahead energy scheduling models to analyze the impact of
VT on system operation cost, network congestion, model computational time, and
market performance. The performance of VT is compared with three alternative
network congestion mitigation methods, including building new high-voltage
physical transmission lines, cost-driven battery energy storage systems, and
network reconfiguration, as well as combinations of two of aforementioned
methods. The benchmark day-ahead scheduling model is a traditional
security-constrained unit commitment model without system upgrades or other
network congestion mitigation. Numerical simulations conducted on the IEEE
24-bus system demonstrate that among all the examined schemes, VT is the only
one comparable to physical transmission lines that can provide satisfying
congestion relief and operation cost reduction without sacrificing computing
time and load payment significantly.

<p class="mathjax">We present LInKs, a novel unsupervised learning method to recover 3D human
poses from 2D kinematic skeletons obtained from a single image, even when
occlusions are present. Our approach follows a unique two-step process, which
involves first lifting the occluded 2D pose to the 3D domain, followed by
filling in the occluded parts using the partially reconstructed 3D coordinates.
This lift-then-fill approach leads to significantly more accurate results
compared to models that complete the pose in 2D space alone. Additionally, we
improve the stability and likelihood estimation of normalising flows through a
custom sampling function replacing PCA dimensionality reduction previously used
in prior work. Furthermore, we are the first to investigate if different parts
of the 2D kinematic skeleton can be lifted independently which we find by
itself reduces the error of current lifting approaches. We attribute this to
the reduction of long-range keypoint correlations. In our detailed evaluation,
we quantify the error under various realistic occlusion scenarios, showcasing
the versatility and applicability of our model. Our results consistently
demonstrate the superiority of handling all types of occlusions in 3D space
when compared to others that complete the pose in 2D space. Our approach also
exhibits consistent accuracy in scenarios without occlusion, as evidenced by a
7.9% reduction in reconstruction error compared to prior works on the Human3.6M
dataset. Furthermore, our method excels in accurately retrieving complete 3D
poses even in the presence of occlusions, making it highly applicable in
situations where complete 2D pose information is unavailable.

<p class="mathjax">Inertia-dominated mechanical systems can achieve net displacement by 1)
periodically changing their shape (known as kinematic gait) and 2) adjusting
their inertia distribution to utilize the existing nonzero net momentum (known
as momentum gait). Therefore, finding the gait that most effectively utilizes
the two types of locomotion in terms of the magnitude of the net momentum is a
significant topic in the study of locomotion. For kinematic locomotion with
zero net momentum, the geometry of optimal gaits is expressed as the equilibria
of system constraint curvature flux through the surface bounded by the gait,
and the cost associated with executing the gait in the metric space. In this
paper, we identify the geometry of optimal gaits with nonzero net momentum
effects by lifting the gait description to a time-parameterized curve in
shape-time space. We also propose the variational gait optimization algorithm
corresponding to the lifted geometric structure, and identify two distinct
patterns in the optimal motion, determined by whether or not the kinematic and
momentum gaits are concentric. The examples of systems with and without
fluid-added mass demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve
forward and turning locomotion gaits in the presence of nonzero net momentum.
At any given momentum and effort limit, the proposed optimal gait that takes
into account both momentum and kinematic effects outperforms the reference
gaits that each only considers one of these effects.

<p class="mathjax">Despite their impressive performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to encode worrying-levels of gender
bias. Prior work has proposed debiasing methods that require human labelled
examples, data augmentation and fine-tuning of the LLMs, which are
computationally costly. Moreover, one might not even have access to the
internal parameters for performing debiasing such as in the case of
commercially available LLMs such as GPT-4. To address this challenge we propose
bias suppression, a novel alternative to debiasing that does not require access
to model parameters. We show that text-based preambles, generated from manually
designed templates covering counterfactual statements, can accurately suppress
gender biases in LLMs. Moreover, we find that descriptive sentences for
occupations can further suppress gender biases. Interestingly, we find that
bias suppression has a minimal adverse effect on downstream task performance,
while effectively mitigating the gender biases.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid expansion of TAVR to younger, low-risk patients raises concerns
regarding device durability. Necessarily, extended stent lifetime will become
more critical for new generation devices. In vitro methods commonly used for
TAVR stent fatigue testing exclude the effects of the beating heart. We present
a more realistic in silico stent fatigue analysis utilizing a beating heart
model in which TAVR stents experience complex, nonuniform dynamic loading.
Virtual TAVR deployments were simulated in the SIMULIA Living Heart Human Model
of a beating heart using stent models of the self-expandable nitinol 26-mm
CoreValve and Evolut R devices, and a 27-mm PolyV-2. Stent deformation was
monitored over three cardiac cycles, and fatigue resistance was evaluated for
the nitinol stents using finite element analysis via ABAQUS/Explicit. In all
models, there were elements in which strains exceeded fatigue failure. The
PolyV-2 stent had far fewer failing elements since its struts were optimized to
reduce the strain in stent joints, achieving better fatigue resistance in the
stent crown and waist elements. Different stent sections showed markedly
different fatigue resistance due to the varying loading conditions. This study
demonstrates the utility of advanced in silico analysis of devices deployed
within a beating heart that mimics in vivo loading, offering a cost-effective
alternative to human or animal trials and establishing a platform to assess the
impact of device design on device durability. The limited fatigue life of TAVR
stents indicated here highlights a clinical complication that may eventually
develop as younger, lower-risk TAVR patients, age.

high-quality images, their tendency to `replicate' training data raises privacy
concerns. Although recent research suggests that this replication may stem from
the insufficient generalization of training data captions and duplication of
training images, effective mitigation strategies remain elusive. To address
this gap, our paper first introduces a generality score that measures the
caption generality and employ large language model (LLM) to generalize training
captions. Subsequently, we leverage generalized captions and propose a novel
dual fusion enhancement approach to mitigate the replication of diffusion

<p class="mathjax">Automatic static cost analysis infers information about the resources used by
programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such
information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for
logic programs (and other languages) are based on setting up recurrence
relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and
solving them to find closed-form functions that are equivalent to (or a bound
on) them. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the
recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current
solvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for
different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a
challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,
constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression
techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an
SMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of
the recurrence. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it with
recurrences generated by a cost analysis system (the one in CiaoPP). The
experimental results are quite promising, showing that our approach can find
closed-form solutions, in a reasonable time, for classes of recurrences that
cannot be solved by such a system, nor by current CASs.

faster lap time and show improved numerical convergence. In the last part of
the paper we devise a novel method to compute racelines in dense obstacle
fields using the non-Euclidean approach.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a version of the classical group testing problem motivated by PCR
testing for COVID-19. In the so-called tropical group testing model, the
outcome of a test is the lowest cycle threshold (Ct) level of the individuals
pooled within it, rather than a simple binary indicator variable. We introduce
the tropical counterparts of three classical non-adaptive algorithms (COMP, DD
and SCOMP), and analyse their behaviour through both simulations and bounds on
error probabilities. By comparing the results of the tropical and classical
algorithms, we gain insight into the extra information provided by learning the
outcomes (Ct levels) of the tests. We show that in a limiting regime the
tropical COMP algorithm requires as many tests as its classical counterpart,
but that for sufficiently dense problems tropical DD can recover more
information with fewer tests, and can be viewed as essentially optimal in
certain regimes.

<p class="mathjax">The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture supports intelligent
network control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven
applications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)
functions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature
to solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the
benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms
in real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow
convergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment
and when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address
these challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the
training and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of
O-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided
approach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL
methods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.
We conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including
real VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also
propose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided
DRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:
7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the
percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance
while maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared
with the baselines.

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces a multi-camera tracking dataset consisting of 234 hours
of video data recorded concurrently from 234 overlapping HD cameras covering a
4.2 mile stretch of 8-10 lane interstate highway near Nashville, TN. The video
is recorded during a period of high traffic density with 500+ objects typically
visible within the scene and typical object longevities of 3-15 minutes. GPS
trajectories from 270 vehicle passes through the scene are manually corrected
in the video data to provide a set of ground-truth trajectories for
recall-oriented tracking metrics, and object detections are provided for each
camera in the scene (159 million total before cross-camera fusion). Initial
benchmarking of tracking-by-detection algorithms is performed against the GPS
trajectories, and a best HOTA of only 9.5% is obtained (best recall 75.9% at
IOU 0.1, 47.9 average IDs per ground truth object), indicating the benchmarked
trackers do not perform sufficiently well at the long temporal and spatial

computational biology. ELBA is the state-of-the-art distributed-memory parallel
algorithm for overlap detection and layout simplification steps of $\textit{De

alignment.
<br />In this work, we introduce 3 GPU schedulers for ELBA to accommodate multiple

processes to perform computation on GPUs in a round-robin fashion. Both strong
and weak scaling experiments show that 3 schedulers are able to significantly
improve the performance of baseline while there is a trade-off between
parallelism and GPU scheduler overhead. For the best performance
implementation, the one-to-one scheduler achieves $\sim$7-8$\times$ speed-up
using 25 MPI processes compared with the baseline vanilla ELBA GPU scheduler.

<p class="mathjax">Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is being provided to the
variety of end-users demands, thereby providing a better and improved
management of services is crucial. Therefore, Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
are essential and play a key role to manage the provided services among the
network entities. This survey identifies the state of the art covering
concepts, approaches and open problems of the SLAs establishment, deployment
and management. This paper is organised in a way that the reader can access a
variety of proposed SLA methods and models addressed and provides an overview
of the SLA actors and elements. It also describes SLAs' characteristics and
objectives. SLAs' existing methodologies are explained and categorised followed
by the Service Quality Categories (SQD) and Quality-Based Service Descriptions
(QSD). SLA modelling and architectures are discussed, and open research
problems and future research directions are introduced. The establishment of a
reliable, safe and QoE-aware computer networking needs a group of services that
goes beyond pure networking services. Therefore, within the paper this broader
set of services are taken into consideration and for each Service Level
Objective (SLO) the related services domains will be indicated. The purpose of
this survey is to identify existing research gaps in utilising SLA elements to
develop a generic methodology, considering all quality parameters beyond the
Quality of Service (QoS) and what must or can be taken into account to define,
establish and deploy an SLA. This study is still an active research on how to
specify and develop an SLA to achieve the win-win agreements among all actors.

<p class="mathjax">Object search is a challenging task because when given complex language
descriptions (e.g., "find the white cup on the table"), the robot must move its
camera through the environment and recognize the described object. Previous
works map language descriptions to a set of fixed object detectors with
predetermined noise models, but these approaches are challenging to scale
because new detectors need to be made for each object. In this work, we bridge
the gap in realistic object search by posing the search problem as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP) where the object detector and visual
sensor noise in the observation model is determined by a single Deep Neural
Network conditioned on complex language descriptions. We incorporate the neural
network's outputs into our language-conditioned observation model (LCOM) to
represent dynamically changing sensor noise. With an LCOM, any language
description of an object can be used to generate an appropriate object detector
and noise model, and training an LCOM only requires readily available
supervised image-caption datasets. We empirically evaluate our method by
comparing against a state-of-the-art object search algorithm in simulation, and
demonstrate that planning with our observation model yields a significantly
higher average task completion rate (from 0.46 to 0.66) and more efficient and
quicker object search than with a fixed-noise model. We demonstrate our method
on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot, enabling it to handle complex natural language
object descriptions and efficiently find objects in a room-scale environment.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved widespread popularity due to
their unprecedented image generation capability. In particular, their ability
to synthesize and modify human faces has spurred research into using generated
face images in both training data augmentation and model performance
assessments. In this paper, we study the efficacy and shortcomings of
generative models in the context of face generation. Utilizing a combination of
qualitative and quantitative measures, including embedding-based metrics and
user studies, we present a framework to audit the characteristics of generated
faces conditioned on a set of social attributes. We applied our framework on
faces generated through state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. We
identify several limitations of face image generation that include faithfulness
to the text prompt, demographic disparities, and distributional shifts.
Furthermore, we present an analytical model that provides insights into how
training data selection contributes to the performance of generative models.

vector operations and real-world applications. Through two meticulously
designed experiments, the study explores the potential of the CKKS scheme in
Super Computing and its implications for data privacy and computational
efficiency. The first experiment reveals the promising applicability of CKKS to
matrix multiplication, indicating marginal differences in Euclidean distance
and near-to-zero mean square error across various matrix sizes. The second
experiment, applied to a wildfire dataset, illustrates the feasibility of using
encrypted machine learning models without significant loss in accuracy. The
insights gleaned from the research set a robust foundation for future
innovations, including the potential for GPU acceleration in CKKS computations
within TenSEAL. Challenges such as noise budget computation, accuracy loss in
multiplication, and the distinct characteristics of arithmetic operations in
the context of CKKS are also discussed. The paper serves as a vital step

<p class="mathjax">Pointwise divergence free velocity field approximations of the Stokes system
are gaining popularity due to their necessity in precise modelling of physical
flow phenomena. Several methods have been designed to satisfy this requirement;
however, these typically come at a greater cost when compared with standard
conforming methods, for example, because of the complex implementation and
development of specialized finite element bases. Motivated by the desire to
mitigate these issues for 2D simulations, we present a $C^0$-interior penalty
Galerkin (IPG) discretization of the Stokes system in the stream function
formulation. In order to preserve a spatially varying viscosity this approach
does not yield the standard and well known biharmonic problem. We further
employ the so-called robust interior penalty Galerkin (RIPG) method; stability
and convergence analysis of the proposed scheme is undertaken. The former,
which involves deriving a bound on the interior penalty parameter is
particularly useful to address the $\mathcal{O}(h^{-4})$ growth in the
condition number of the discretized operator. Numerical experiments confirming
the optimal convergence of the proposed method are undertaken. Comparisons with
thermally driven buoyancy mantle convection model benchmarks are presented.

<p class="mathjax">We designed and tested a system for real-time control of a user interface by
extracting surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity from eight electrodes in a
wrist-band configuration. sEMG data were streamed into a machine-learning
algorithm that classified hand gestures in real-time. After an initial model
calibration, participants were presented with one of three types of feedback
during a human-learning stage: veridical feedback, in which predicted
probabilities from the gesture classification algorithm were displayed without
alteration, modified feedback, in which we applied a hidden augmentation of
error to these probabilities, and no feedback. User performance was then
evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use
eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental
results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition
led to significantly improved accuracy and improved gesture class separation.
These findings suggest that real-time feedback in a gamified user interface
with manipulation of feedback may enable intuitive, rapid, and accurate task
acquisition for sEMG-based gesture recognition applications.

<p class="mathjax">Scientific workflow has become essential in software engineering because it
provides a structured approach to designing, executing, and analyzing
scientific experiments. Software developers and researchers have developed
hundreds of scientific workflow management systems so scientists in various
domains can benefit from them by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing
collaboration, and ensuring the reproducibility of their results. However, even
for expert users, workflow creation is a complex task due to the dramatic
growth of tools and data heterogeneity. Thus, scientists attempt to reuse
existing workflows shared in workflow repositories. Unfortunately, several
challenges prevent scientists from reusing those workflows. In this study, we
thus first attempted to identify those reusability challenges. We also offered
an action list and evidence-based guidelines to promote the reusability of
scientific workflows. Our intensive manual investigation examined the
reusability of existing workflows and exposed several challenges. The
challenges preventing reusability include tool upgrading, tool support
unavailability, design flaws, incomplete workflows, failure to load a workflow,

composers to create better workflows with enhanced reusability. In the future,

<p class="mathjax">Global pandemic due to the spread of COVID-19 has post challenges in a new
dimension on facial recognition, where people start to wear masks. Under such
condition, the authors consider utilizing machine learning in image inpainting
to tackle the problem, by complete the possible face that is originally covered
in mask. In particular, autoencoder has great potential on retaining important,
general features of the image as well as the generative power of the generative
adversarial network (GAN). The authors implement a combination of the two
models, context encoders and explain how it combines the power of the two
models and train the model with 50,000 images of influencers faces and yields a
solid result that still contains space for improvements. Furthermore, the
authors discuss some shortcomings with the model, their possible improvements,
as well as some area of study for future investigation for applicative
perspective, as well as directions to further enhance and refine the model.

<p class="mathjax">RGB-T saliency detection has emerged as an important computer vision task,
identifying conspicuous objects in challenging scenes such as dark
environments. However, existing methods neglect the characteristics of
cross-modal features and rely solely on network structures to fuse RGB and
thermal features. To address this, we first propose a Multi-Modal Hybrid loss
(MMHL) that comprises supervised and self-supervised loss functions. The
supervised loss component of MMHL distinctly utilizes semantic features from
different modalities, while the self-supervised loss component reduces the
distance between RGB and thermal features. We further consider both spatial and
channel information during feature fusion and propose the Hybrid Fusion Module
to effectively fuse RGB and thermal features. Lastly, instead of jointly
training the network with cross-modal features, we implement a sequential
training strategy which performs training only on RGB images in the first stage
and then learns cross-modal features in the second stage. This training
strategy improves saliency detection performance without computational
overhead. Results from performance evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate
the superior performance achieved by the proposed method compared with the
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes a methodology for defining an executable abstract
interpreter from a formal description of the semantics of a programming
language. Our approach is based on Skeletal Semantics and an abstract
interpretation of its semantic meta-language. The correctness of the derived
abstract interpretation can be established by compositionality provided that
correctness properties of the core language-specific constructs are
established. We illustrate the genericness of our method by defining a Value
Analysis for a small imperative language based on its skeletal semantics.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we review the actor-based language, Timed Rebeca, with a focus
on its formal semantics and formal verification techniques. Timed Rebeca can be
used to model systems consisting of encapsulated components which communicate
by asynchronous message passing. Messages are put in the message buffer of the
receiver actor and can be seen as events. Components react to these
messages/events and execute the corresponding message/event handler. Real-time
features, like computation delay, network delay and periodic behavior, can be
modeled in the language. We explain how both Floating-Time Transition System
(FTTS) and common Timed Transition System (TTS) can be used as the semantics of
such models and the basis for model checking. We use FTTS when we are
interested in event-based properties, and it helps in state space reduction.
For checking the properties based on the value of variables at certain point in
time, we use the TTS semantics. The model checking toolset supports
schedulability analysis, deadlock and queue-overflow check, and assertion based
verification of Timed Rebeca models. TCTL model checking based on TTS is also
possible but is not integrated in the tool.

<p class="mathjax">To celebrate the 30th edition of EXPRESS and the 20th edition of SOS we
overview how session types can be expressed in a type theory for the standard
$\pi$-calculus by means of a suitable encoding. The encoding allows one to
reuse results about the $\pi$-calculus in the context of session-based
communications, thus deepening the understanding of sessions and reducing
redundancies in their theoretical foundations. Perhaps surprisingly, the
encoding has practical implications as well, by enabling refined forms of
deadlock analysis as well as allowing session type inference by means of a
conventional type inference algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">This position paper on the (meta-)theory of Structural Operational Semantic
(SOS) is motivated by the following two questions: (1) Is the (meta-)theory of
SOS dying out as a research field? (2) If so, is it possible to rejuvenate this
field with a redefined purpose?
<br />In this article, we will consider possible answers to those questions by
first analysing the history of the EXPRESS/SOS workshops and the data
concerning the authors and the presentations featured in the editions of those
workshops as well as their subject matters.
<br />The results of our quantitative and qualitative analyses all indicate a
diminishing interest in the theory of SOS as a field of research. Even though
`all good things must come to an end', we strive to finish this position paper
on an upbeat note by addressing our second motivating question with some
optimism. To this end, we use our personal reflections and an analysis of
recent trends in two of the flagship conferences in the field of Programming
Languages (namely POPL and PDLI) to draw some conclusions on possible future
directions that may rejuvenate research on the (meta-)theory of SOS. We hope
that our musings will entice members of the research community to breathe new
life into a field of research that has been kind to three of the authors of
this article.

<p class="mathjax">We show a cancellation property for probabilistic choice. If distributions mu
+ rho and nu + rho are branching probabilistic bisimilar, then distributions mu
and nu are also branching probabilistic bisimilar. We do this in the setting of
a basic process language involving non-deterministic and probabilistic choice
and define branching probabilistic bisimilarity on distributions. Despite the
fact that the cancellation property is very elegant and concise, we failed to
provide a short and natural combinatorial proof. Instead we provide a proof
using metric topology. Our major lemma is that every distribution can be
unfolded into an equivalent stable distribution, where the topological
arguments are required to deal with uncountable branching.

<p class="mathjax">Locks are a classic data structure for concurrent programming. We introduce a
type system to ensure that names of the asynchronous pi-calculus are used as
locks. Our calculus also features a construct to deallocate a lock once we know
that it will never be acquired again. Typability guarantees two properties:
deadlock-freedom, that is, no acquire operation on a lock waits forever; and
leak-freedom, that is, all locks are eventually deallocated.
<br />We leverage the simplicity of our typing discipline to study the induced
typed behavioural equivalence. After defining barbed equivalence, we introduce
a sound labelled bisimulation, which makes it possible to establish equivalence
between programs that manipulate and deallocate locks.

In previous work, we proved the pendant of this theorem in a setting with
interaction: the set of processes given by a pushdown automaton coincides with
the set of processes given by a finite guarded recursive specification over a
process algebra with actions, choice, sequencing and guarded recursion, if and
only if we add sequential value passing. In this paper, we look what happens if
we consider parallel pushdown automata instead of pushdown automata, and a
process algebra with parallelism instead of sequencing.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a formal notion of masking fault-tolerance between probabilistic
transition systems using stochastic games. These games are inspired in
bisimulation games, but they also take into account the possible faulty
behavior of systems. When no faults are present, these games boil down to
probabilistic bisimulation games. Since these games could be infinite, we
propose a symbolic way of representing them so that they can be solved in
polynomial time. In particular, we use this notion of masking to quantify the
level of masking fault-tolerance exhibited by almost-sure failing systems,
i.e., those systems that eventually fail with probability 1. The level of
masking fault-tolerance of almost-sure failing systems can be calculated by
solving a collection of functional equations. We produce this metric in a
setting in which one of the player behaves in a strong fair way (mimicking the
idea of fair environments).

<p class="mathjax">We present a reversible intermediate language with concurrency for
translating a high-level concurrent programming language to another lower-level
concurrent programming language, keeping reversibility. Intermediate languages
are commonly used in compiling a source program to an object code program
closer to the machine code, where an intermediate language enables behavioral
analysis and optimization to be decomposed in steps. We propose CRIL
(Concurrent Reversible Intermediate Language) as an extension of RIL used by
Mogensen for a functional reversible language, incorporating a multi-thread
process invocation and the synchronization primitives based on the P-V
operations. We show that the operational semantics of CRIL enjoy the properties
of reversibility, including the causal safety and causal liveness proposed by
Lanese et al., checking the axiomatic properties. The operational semantics is
defined by composing the bidirectional control flow with the dependency
information on updating the memory, called annotation DAG. We show a simple
example of `airline ticketing' to illustrate how CRIL preserves the causality
for reversibility in imperative programs with concurrency.

<p class="mathjax">Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behavior
and features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into model
behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training
process. In this paper, we present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked
language models (MLMs). Our findings demonstrate how analyzing the evolution of
interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of
emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS),
a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend
to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in
training when models abruptly acquire SAS and find that this window is
concurrent with a steep drop in loss. Moreover, SAS precipitates the subsequent
acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS
by introducing a regularizer to manipulate SAS during training, and demonstrate
that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We
further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits and capabilities
during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS can improve model quality.
These findings reveal a real-world example of the relationship between
disadvantageous simplicity bias and interpretable breakthrough training
dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Audio super-resolution is a fundamental task that predicts high-frequency
components for low-resolution audio, enhancing audio quality in digital
applications. Previous methods have limitations such as the limited scope of
audio types (e.g., music, speech) and specific bandwidth settings they can
handle (e.g., 4kHz to 8kHz). In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based
generative model, AudioSR, that is capable of performing robust audio
super-resolution on versatile audio types, including sound effects, music, and
speech. Specifically, AudioSR can upsample any input audio signal within the
bandwidth range of 2kHz to 16kHz to a high-resolution audio signal at 24kHz
bandwidth with a sampling rate of 48kHz. Extensive objective evaluation on
various audio super-resolution benchmarks demonstrates the strong result
achieved by the proposed model. In addition, our subjective evaluation shows
that AudioSR can acts as a plug-and-play module to enhance the generation
quality of a wide range of audio generative models, including AudioLDM,
Fastspeech2, and MusicGen. Our code and demo are available at
https://audioldm.github.io/audiosr.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language
processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the
inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is
illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a
hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic
representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly
connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual
embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter
GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early
layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature
of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we
present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes
that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes $\texttt{NePhi}$, a neural deformation model which results
in approximately diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to the predominant
voxel-based approaches, $\texttt{NePhi}$ represents deformations functionally
which allows for memory-efficient training and inference. This is of particular
importance for large volumetric registrations. Further, while medical image
registration approaches representing transformation maps via multi-layer
perceptrons have been proposed, $\texttt{NePhi}$ facilitates both pairwise
optimization-based registration $\textit{as well as}$ learning-based
registration via predicted or optimized global and local latent codes. Lastly,
as deformation regularity is a highly desirable property for most medical image
registration tasks, $\texttt{NePhi}$ makes use of gradient inverse consistency
regularization which empirically results in approximately diffeomorphic
transformations. We show the performance of $\texttt{NePhi}$ on two 2D
synthetic datasets as well as on real 3D lung registration. Our results show
that $\texttt{NePhi}$ can achieve similar accuracies as voxel-based
representations in a single-resolution registration setting while using less
memory and allowing for faster instance-optimization.

<p class="mathjax">5G cellular networks are envisioned to support a wide range of emerging
delay-oriented services with different delay requirements (e.g., 20ms for
VR/AR, 40ms for cloud gaming, and 100ms for immersive video streaming).
However, due to the highly variable and unpredictable nature of 5G access
links, existing end-to-end (e2e) congestion control (CC) schemes perform poorly
for them. In this paper, we demonstrate that properly blending
non-deterministic exploration techniques with straightforward proactive and
reactive measures is sufficient to design a simple yet effective e2e CC scheme
for 5G networks that can: (1) achieve high controllable performance, and (2)
possess provable properties. To that end, we designed Reminis and through
extensive experiments on emulated and real-world 5G networks, show the
performance benefits of it compared with different CC schemes. For instance,
averaged over 60 different 5G cellular links on the Standalone (SA) scenarios,
compared with a recent design by Google (BBR2), Reminis can achieve 2.2x lower
95th percentile delay while having the same link utilization.

<p class="mathjax">Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) is one of the most common procedures in
the US, with more than 1.2M procedures annually. Compared with classical open
cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is associated with
significantly shorter recovery period, and hence is the preferred method.
However, LC is also associated with an increase in bile duct injuries (BDIs),
resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The primary cause of BDIs
from LCs is misidentification of the cystic duct with the bile duct. Critical
view of safety (CVS) is the most effective of safety protocols, which is said
to be achieved during the surgery if certain criteria are met. However, due to
suboptimal understanding and implementation of CVS, the BDI rates have remained
stable over the last three decades. In this paper, we develop deep-learning
techniques to automate the assessment of CVS in LCs. An innovative aspect of
our research is on developing specialized learning techniques by incorporating
domain knowledge to compensate for the limited training data available in
practice. In particular, our CVS assessment process involves a fusion of two
segmentation maps followed by an estimation of a certain region of interest
based on anatomical structures close to the gallbladder, and then finally
determination of each of the three CVS criteria via rule-based assessment of
structural information. We achieved a gain of over 11.8% in mIoU on relevant
classes with our two-stream semantic segmentation approach when compared to a
single-model baseline, and 1.84% in mIoU with our proposed Sobel loss function
when compared to a Transformer-based baseline model. For CVS criteria, we
achieved up to 16% improvement and, for the overall CVS assessment, we achieved
5% improvement in balanced accuracy compared to DeepCVS under the same
experiment settings.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.

<p class="mathjax">The large variety of production implementations of the message passing
interface (MPI) each provide unique and varying underlying algorithms. Each
emerging supercomputer supports one or a small number of system MPI
installations, tuned for the given architecture. Performance varies with MPI
version, but application programmers are typically unable to achieve optimal
performance with local MPI installations and therefore rely on whichever
implementation is provided as a system install. This paper presents MPI
Advance, a collection of libraries that sit on top of MPI, optimizing the
underlying performance of any existing MPI library. The libraries provide
optimizations for collectives, neighborhood collectives, partitioned

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of unmanned vehicles offers many opportunities for solving
environmental sampling tasks with applications in resource monitoring and
precision agriculture. Informative path planning (IPP) includes a family of
methods which offer improvements over traditional surveying techniques for
suggesting locations for observation collection. In this work, we present a
novel solution to the IPP problem by using a coregionalized Gaussian processes
to estimate a dynamic scalar field that varies in space and time. Our method
improves previous approaches by using a composite kernel accounting for
spatiotemporal correlations and at the same time, can be readily incorporated
in existing IPP algorithms. Through extensive simulations, we show that our
novel modeling approach leads to more accurate estimations when compared with
formerly proposed methods that do not account for the temporal dimension.

<p class="mathjax">Accelerating the learning of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from
experimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous
randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However
such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have
sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the
learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel
exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the
value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when
the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large
areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates
concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value
domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for
learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in
Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the
decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation
between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic
number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence
that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%

<p class="mathjax">User feedback has grown in importance for organizations to improve software
products. Prior studies focused primarily on feedback collection and reported a
high-level overview of the processes, often overlooking how practitioners
reason about, and act upon this feedback through a structured set of
activities. In this work, we conducted an exploratory interview study with 40
practitioners from 32 organizations of various sizes and in several domains
such as e-commerce, analytics, and gaming. Our findings indicate that
organizations leverage many different user feedback sources. Social media
emerged as a key category of feedback that is increasingly critical for many
organizations. We found that organizations actively engage in a number of
non-trivial activities to curate and act on user feedback, depending on its
source. We synthesize these activities into a life cycle of managing user
feedback. We also report on the best practices for managing user feedback that
we distilled from responses of practitioners who felt that their organization
effectively understood and addressed their users' feedback. We present
actionable empirical results that organizations can leverage to increase their
understanding of user perception and behavior for better products thus reducing
user attrition.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we consider the problem of autonomous exploration in search of
targets while respecting a fixed energy budget. The robot is equipped with an
incremental-resolution symbolic perception module wherein the perception of
targets in the environment improves as the robot's distance from targets
decreases. We assume no prior information about the total number of targets,
their locations as well as their possible distribution within the environment.
This work proposes a novel decision-making framework for the resulting
constrained sequential decision-making problem by first converting it into a
reward maximization problem on a product graph computed offline. It is then
solved online as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) where the knowledge
about the environment is updated at each step, combining automata-based and
MILP-based techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with the
help of a case study and present empirical evaluation in terms of expected
regret. Furthermore, the runtime performance shows that online planning can be
efficiently performed for moderately-sized grid environments.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown its capability to solve the high
degrees of freedom in control and the complex interaction with the object in
the multi-finger dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks. Current DRL approaches
prefer sparse rewards to dense rewards for the ease of training but lack
behavior constraints during the manipulation process, leading to aggressive and
unstable policies that are insufficient for safety-critical in-hand
manipulation tasks. Dense rewards can regulate the policy to learn stable
manipulation behaviors with continuous reward constraints but are hard to
empirically define and slow to converge optimally. This work proposes the
Finger-specific Multi-agent Shadow Reward (FMSR) method to determine the stable
manipulation constraints in the form of dense reward based on the state-action
occupancy measure, a general utility of DRL that is approximated during the
learning process. Information Sharing (IS) across neighboring agents enables
consensus training to accelerate the convergence. The methods are evaluated in
two in-hand manipulation tasks on the Shadow Hand. The results show FMSR+IS
converges faster in training, achieving a higher task success rate and better
manipulation stability than conventional dense reward. The comparison indicates
FMSR+IS achieves a comparable success rate even with the behavior constraint
but much better manipulation stability than the policy trained with a sparse
reward.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation to Real-World Transfer allows affordable and fast training of
learning-based robots for manipulation tasks using Deep Reinforcement Learning
methods. Currently, Sim2Real uses Asymmetric Actor-Critic approaches to reduce
the rich idealized features in simulation to the accessible ones in the real
world. However, the feature reduction from the simulation to the real world is
conducted through an empirically defined one-step curtail. Small feature
reduction does not sufficiently remove the actor's features, which may still
cause difficulty setting up the physical system, while large feature reduction
may cause difficulty and inefficiency in training. To address this issue, we
proposed Curriculum-based Sensing Reduction to enable the actor to start with
the same rich feature space as the critic and then get rid of the
hard-to-extract features step-by-step for higher training performance and
better adaptation for real-world feature space. The reduced features are
replaced with random signals from a Deep Random Generator to remove the
dependency between the output and the removed features and avoid creating new
dependencies. The methods are evaluated on the Allegro robot hand in a
real-world in-hand manipulation task. The results show that our methods have
faster training and higher task performance than baselines and can solve
real-world tasks when selected tactile features are reduced.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an approach to estimate the end-to-end GSNR accurately in a short
time when a data center interconnect (DCI) network operator receives a service
request from users, not by measuring the GSNR at the operational route and
wavelength for the End-End optical path but by simply applying a QoT probe
channel link by link, at a convenient wavelength/modulation-format for
measurement. Assuming connections between coherent transceivers of various
frequency ranges, modulators, and modulation formats, we propose a new device
software architecture in which the DCI network operator optimizes the
transmission mode between user transceivers with high accuracy using only
standard parameters such as Bit Error Rate. In this paper, we first
experimentally built three different routes of 32 km/72 km/122 km in the C-band
to confirm the accuracy of this approach. For the operational end-to-end GSNR
measurements, the accuracy estimated from the sum of the measurements for each
link was 0.6 dB, and the wavelength-dependent error was about 0.2 dB. Then,
using field fibers deployed in the NSF COSMOS testbed (deployed in an urban
area), a Linux-based transmission device software architecture, and coherent
transceivers with different optical frequency ranges, modulators, and
modulation formats, the fast WDM provisioning of an optical path was completed
within 6 minutes (with a Q-factor error of about 0.7 dB).

<p class="mathjax">Suction cups are an important gripper type in industrial robot applications,
and prior literature focuses on using vision-based planners to improve grasping
success in these tasks. Vision-based planners can fail due to adversarial
objects or lose generalizability for unseen scenarios, without retraining
learned algorithms. We propose haptic exploration to improve suction cup
grasping when visual grasp planners fail. We present the Smart Suction Cup, an
end-effector that utilizes internal flow measurements for tactile sensing. We
show that model-based haptic search methods, guided by these flow measurements,
improve grasping success by up to 2.5x as compared with using only a vision
planner during a bin-picking task. In characterizing the Smart Suction Cup on
both geometric edges and curves, we find that flow rate can accurately predict
the ideal motion direction even with large postural errors. The Smart Suction
Cup includes no electronics on the cup itself, such that the design is easy to
fabricate and haptic exploration does not damage the sensor. This work
motivates the use of suction cups with autonomous haptic search capabilities in
especially adversarial scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video,
is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially in an age
where an immense volume of video content is constantly being generated.
Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features
like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage
demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in
low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the
post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating
the need for bitstream. We validate our approach using a custom-built data set
comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning
11 distinct categories. Our preliminary evaluations indicate precision,
accuracy, and recall rates well over 80%. The algorithm operates approximately
15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by six orders of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">Simplicial complexes prove effective in modeling data with multiway
dependencies, such as data defined along the edges of networks or within other
higher-order structures. Their spectrum can be decomposed into three
interpretable subspaces via the Hodge decomposition, resulting foundational in
numerous applications. We leverage this decomposition to develop a contrastive
self-supervised learning approach for processing simplicial data and generating
embeddings that encapsulate specific spectral information.Specifically, we
encode the pertinent data invariances through simplicial neural networks and
devise augmentations that yield positive contrastive examples with suitable
spectral properties for downstream tasks. Additionally, we reweight the
significance of negative examples in the contrastive loss, considering the
similarity of their Hodge components to the anchor. By encouraging a stronger
separation among less similar instances, we obtain an embedding space that
reflects the spectral properties of the data. The numerical results on two
standard edge flow classification tasks show a superior performance even when
compared to supervised learning techniques. Our findings underscore the
importance of adopting a spectral perspective for contrastive learning with
higher-order data.

<p class="mathjax">Most dynamics functions are not well-aligned to task requirements.
Controllers, therefore, often invert the dynamics and reshape it into something
more useful. The learning community has found that these controllers, such as
Operational Space Control (OSC), can offer important inductive biases for
training. However, OSC only captures straight line end-effector motion. There's
a lot more behavior we could and should be packing into these systems. Earlier
work [15][16][19] developed a theory that generalized these ideas and
constructed a broad and flexible class of second-order dynamical systems which
was simultaneously expressive enough to capture substantial behavior (such as
that listed above), and maintained the types of stability properties that make
OSC and controllers like it a good foundation for policy design and learning.
This paper, motivated by the empirical success of the types of fabrics used in
[20], reformulates the theory of fabrics into a form that's more general and
easier to apply to policy learning problems. We focus on the stability
properties that make fabrics a good foundation for policy synthesis. Fabrics
create a fundamentally stable medium within which a policy can operate; they
influence the system's behavior without preventing it from achieving tasks
within its constraints. When a fabrics is geometric (path consistent) we can
interpret the fabric as forming a road network of paths that the system wants
to follow at constant speed absent a forcing policy, giving geometric intuition
to its role as a prior. The policy operating over the geometric fabric acts to
modulate speed and steers the system from one road to the next as it
accomplishes its task. We reformulate the theory of fabrics here rigorously and
develop theoretical results characterizing system behavior and illuminating how
to design these systems, while also emphasizing intuition throughout.

<p class="mathjax">Quantile Regression (QR) can be used to estimate aleatoric uncertainty in
deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying
uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical
diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most
common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the
parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is
quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier
covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the
performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,
image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution
for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We
compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile
regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of
case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.
These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by applying it to a
medical imaging translation task using diffusion models.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability in modeling graphs,
however, their performance would significantly degrade when there are noisy
edges connecting nodes from different classes. To alleviate negative effect of
noisy edges on neighborhood aggregation, some recent GNNs propose to predict
the label agreement between node pairs within a single network. However,
predicting the label agreement of edges across different networks has not been
investigated yet. Our work makes the pioneering attempt to study a novel
problem of cross-network homophilous and heterophilous edge classification
(CNHHEC), and proposes a novel domain-adaptive graph attention-supervised
network (DGASN) to effectively tackle the CNHHEC problem. Firstly, DGASN adopts
multi-head GAT as the GNN encoder, which jointly trains node embeddings and
edge embeddings via the node classification and edge classification losses. As
a result, label-discriminative embeddings can be obtained to distinguish
homophilous edges from heterophilous edges. In addition, DGASN applies direct
supervision on graph attention learning based on the observed edge labels from
the source network, thus lowering the negative effects of heterophilous edges
while enlarging the positive effects of homophilous edges during neighborhood
aggregation. To facilitate knowledge transfer across networks, DGASN employs
adversarial domain adaptation to mitigate domain divergence. Extensive
experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
DGASN achieves the state-of-the-art performance in CNHHEC.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reports on the details of the International Competition on Graph
Counting Algorithms (ICGCA) held in 2023. The graph counting problem is to
count the subgraphs satisfying specified constraints on a given graph. The
problem belongs to #P-complete, a computationally tough class. Since many
essential systems in modern society, e.g., infrastructure networks, are often
represented as graphs, graph counting algorithms are a key technology to
efficiently scan all the subgraphs representing the feasible states of the
system. In the ICGCA, contestants were asked to count the paths on a graph
under a length constraint. The benchmark set included 150 challenging
instances, emphasizing graphs resembling infrastructure networks. Eleven
solvers were submitted and ranked by the number of benchmarks correctly solved
within a time limit. The winning solver, TLDC, was designed based on three
fundamental approaches: backtracking search, dynamic programming, and model
counting or #SAT (a counting version of Boolean satisfiability). Detailed
analyses show that each approach has its own strengths, and one approach is
unlikely to dominate the others. The codes and papers of the participating
solvers are available: https://afsa.jp/icgca/.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in summary
evaluation tasks, yet they face challenges such as high computational costs and
the Lost-in-the-Middle problem where important information in the middle of
long documents is often overlooked. To address these issues, this paper
introduces a novel approach, Extract-then-Evaluate, which involves extracting
key sentences from a long source document and then evaluating the summary by
prompting LLMs. The results reveal that the proposed method not only
significantly reduces evaluation costs but also exhibits a higher correlation
with human evaluations. Furthermore, we provide practical recommendations for
optimal document length and sentence extraction methods, contributing to the
development of cost-effective yet more accurate methods for LLM-based text
generation evaluation.

that arise in a collection of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)
$H(\Omega)$. By casting an optimal control problem in a specific class of

Explicit upper bounds on error in value function approximations are derived in
terms of power function $\Pwr_{H,N}$ for the space of finite dimensional

fake and biased news, content published with the intent to sway beliefs. While
detecting and profiling the sources that spread this news is important to
maintain a healthy society, it is challenging for automated systems.
<br />In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for news media profiling.
It combines the strengths of graph based news media profiling models,
Pre-trained Large Language Models, and human insight to characterize the social
context on social media. Experimental results show that with as little as 5
human interactions, our framework can rapidly detect fake and biased news
media, even in the most challenging settings of emerging news events, where

<p class="mathjax">Visually-grounded dialog systems, which integrate multiple modes of
communication such as text and visual inputs, have become an increasingly
popular area of investigation. However, the absence of a standardized
evaluation framework poses a challenge in assessing the development of this
field. To this end, we propose \textbf{VDialogUE}, a \textbf{V}isually-grounded
\textbf{Dialog}ue benchmark for \textbf{U}nified \textbf{E}valuation. It
defines five core multi-modal dialogue tasks and covers six datasets.
Furthermore, in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's
performance across all tasks, we developed a novel evaluation metric called
VDscore, which is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process~(AHP) method.
Additionally, we present a straightforward yet efficient baseline model, named
\textbf{VISIT}~(\textbf{VIS}ually-grounded d\textbf{I}alog
\textbf{T}ransformer), to promote the advancement of general multi-modal
dialogue systems. It progressively builds its multi-modal foundation and
dialogue capability via a two-stage pre-training strategy.
<br />We believe that the VDialogUE benchmark, along with the evaluation scripts
and our baseline models, will accelerate the development of visually-grounded
dialog systems and lead to the development of more sophisticated and effective
pre-trained models.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous Cyber Defence is required to respond to high-tempo cyber-attacks.
To facilitate the research in this challenging area, we explore the utility of
the autonomous cyber operation environments presented as part of the Cyber
Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenges, with a specific focus on
CAGE Challenge 2. CAGE Challenge 2 required a defensive Blue agent to defend a
network from an attacking Red agent. We provide a detailed description of the
this challenge and describe the approaches taken by challenge participants.
From the submitted agents, we identify four classes of algorithms, namely,
Single- Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Hierarchical DRL, Ensembles,
and Non-DRL approaches. Of these classes, we found that the hierarchical DRL
approach was the most capable of learning an effective cyber defensive
strategy. Our analysis of the agent policies identified that different
algorithms within the same class produced diverse strategies and that the
strategy used by the defensive Blue agent varied depending on the strategy used
by the offensive Red agent. We conclude that DRL algorithms are a suitable
candidate for autonomous cyber defence applications.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models have witnessed depth and pose estimation framework on
unannotated datasets as a effective pathway to succeed in endoscopic
navigation. Most current techniques are dedicated to developing more advanced
neural networks to improve the accuracy. However, existing methods ignore the
special properties of endoscopic images, resulting in an inability to fully
unleash the power of neural networks. In this study, we conduct a detail
analysis of the properties of endoscopic images and improve the compatibility
of images and neural networks, to unleash the power of current neural networks.
First, we introcude the Mask Image Modelling (MIM) module, which inputs partial
image information instead of complete image information, allowing the network
to recover global information from partial pixel information. This enhances the
network' s ability to perceive global information and alleviates the phenomenon
of local overfitting in convolutional neural networks due to local artifacts.
Second, we propose a lightweight neural network to enhance the endoscopic
images, to explicitly improve the compatibility between images and neural
networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on the three public datasets and
one inhouse dataset, and the proposed modules improve baselines by a large
margin. Furthermore, the enhanced images we proposed, which have higher network
compatibility, can serve as an effective data augmentation method and they are
able to extract more stable feature points in traditional feature point
matching tasks and achieve outstanding performance.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of universal audio representation learning is to obtain foundational
models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks involving speech,
music or environmental sounds. To approach this problem, methods inspired by
self-supervised models from NLP, like BERT, are often used and adapted to
audio. These models rely on the discrete nature of text, hence adopting this
type of approach for audio processing requires either a change in the learning
objective or mapping the audio signal to a set of discrete classes. In this
work, we explore the use of EnCodec, a neural audio codec, to generate discrete
targets for learning an universal audio model based on a masked autoencoder
(MAE). We evaluate this approach, which we call EncodecMAE, on a wide range of
audio tasks spanning speech, music and environmental sounds, achieving
performances comparable or better than leading audio representation models.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised pretraining attempts to enhance model performance by
obtaining effective features from unlabeled data, and has demonstrated its
effectiveness in the field of histopathology images. Despite its success, few
works concentrate on the extraction of nucleus-level information, which is
essential for pathologic analysis. In this work, we propose a novel
nucleus-aware self-supervised pretraining framework for histopathology images.
The framework aims to capture the nuclear morphology and distribution
information through unpaired image-to-image translation between histopathology
images and pseudo mask images. The generation process is modulated by both
conditional and stochastic style representations, ensuring the reality and
diversity of the generated histopathology images for pretraining. Further, an
instance segmentation guided strategy is employed to capture instance-level
information. The experiments on 7 datasets show that the proposed pretraining
method outperforms supervised ones on Kather classification, multiple instance
learning, and 5 dense-prediction tasks with the transfer learning protocol, and
yields superior results than other self-supervised approaches on 8
semi-supervised tasks. Our project is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Several prior studies have suggested that word frequency biases can cause the
Bert model to learn indistinguishable sentence embeddings. Contrastive learning
schemes such as SimCSE and ConSERT have already been adopted successfully in
unsupervised sentence embedding to improve the quality of embeddings by
reducing this bias. However, these methods still introduce new biases such as
sentence length bias and false negative sample bias, that hinders model's
ability to learn more fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we reexamine the
challenges of contrastive sentence embedding learning from a debiasing
perspective and argue that effectively eliminating the influence of various
biases is crucial for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. We think all
those biases are introduced by simple rules for constructing training data in
contrastive learning and the key for contrastive learning sentence embedding is
to mimic the distribution of training data in supervised machine learning in
unsupervised way. We propose a novel contrastive framework for sentence
embedding, termed DebCSE, which can eliminate the impact of these biases by an
inverse propensity weighted sampling method to select high-quality positive and
negative pairs according to both the surface and semantic similarity between
sentences. Extensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS)
benchmarks reveal that DebCSE significantly outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art models with an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of
80.33% on BERTbase.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional adversarial attacks concentrate on manipulating clean examples in
the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic
adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples,
such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real
world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic
adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic
information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models.
Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation
(ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the
diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent
space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation
methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or
black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ
datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and
transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve
approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID
as 36.61. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">In computation pathology, the pyramid structure of gigapixel Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) has recently been studied for capturing various information from
individual cell interactions to tissue microenvironments. This hierarchical
structure is believed to be beneficial for cancer diagnosis and prognosis
tasks. However, most previous hierarchical WSI analysis works (1) only
characterize local or global correlations within the WSI pyramids and (2) use
only unidirectional interaction between different resolutions, leading to an
incomplete picture of WSI pyramids. To this end, this paper presents a novel
Hierarchical Interaction Graph-Transformer (i.e., HIGT) for WSI analysis. With
Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building commons, HIGT can learn
both short-range local information and long-range global representation of the
WSI pyramids. Considering that the information from different resolutions is
complementary and can benefit each other during the learning process, we
further design a novel Bidirectional Interaction block to establish
communication between different levels within the WSI pyramids. Finally, we
aggregate both coarse-grained and fine-grained features learned from different
levels together for slide-level prediction. We evaluate our methods on two
public WSI datasets from TCGA projects, i.e., kidney carcinoma (KICA) and
esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Experimental results show that our HIGT
outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical state-of-the-art methods on
both tumor subtyping and staging tasks.

<p class="mathjax">We develop in this paper a multi-grade deep learning method for solving
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Deep neural networks (DNNs)
have received super performance in solving PDEs in addition to their
outstanding success in areas such as natural language processing, computer
vision, and robotics. However, training a very deep network is often a
challenging task. As the number of layers of a DNN increases, solving a
large-scale non-convex optimization problem that results in the DNN solution of
PDEs becomes more and more difficult, which may lead to a decrease rather than
an increase in predictive accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose a
two-stage multi-grade deep learning (TS-MGDL) method that breaks down the task
of learning a DNN into several neural networks stacked on top of each other in
a staircase-like manner. This approach allows us to mitigate the complexity of
solving the non-convex optimization problem with large number of parameters and
learn residual components left over from previous grades efficiently. We prove
that each grade/stage of the proposed TS-MGDL method can reduce the value of
the loss function and further validate this fact through numerical experiments.
Although the proposed method is applicable to general PDEs, implementation in
this paper focuses only on the 1D, 2D, and 3D viscous Burgers equations.
Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage multi-grade deep learning
method enables efficient learning of solutions of the equations and outperforms
existing single-grade deep learning methods in predictive accuracy.
Specifically, the predictive errors of the single-grade deep learning are
larger than those of the TS-MGDL method in 26-60, 4-31 and 3-12 times, for the
1D, 2D, and 3D equations, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Label scarcity in a graph is frequently encountered in real-world
applications due to the high cost of data labeling. To this end,
semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the
knowledge of a labeled source graph to aid in node classification on a target
graph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between
the source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research
problem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed
for cross-graph node classification. To tackle the SSDA problem on graphs, a
novel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive
learning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node
representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local
and global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the
entropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines on the SSDA tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world scenarios, typical visual recognition systems could fail under
two major causes, i.e., the misclassification between known classes and the
excusable misbehavior on unknown-class images. To tackle these deficiencies,
flexible visual recognition should dynamically predict multiple classes when
they are unconfident between choices and reject making predictions when the
input is entirely out of the training distribution. Two challenges emerge along
with this novel task. First, prediction uncertainty should be separately
quantified as confusion depicting inter-class uncertainties and ignorance
identifying out-of-distribution samples. Second, both confusion and ignorance
should be comparable between samples to enable effective decision-making. In
this paper, we propose to model these two sources of uncertainty explicitly
with the theory of Subjective Logic. Regarding recognition as an
evidence-collecting process, confusion is then defined as conflicting evidence,
while ignorance is the absence of evidence. By predicting Dirichlet
concentration parameters for singletons, comprehensive subjective opinions,
including confusion and ignorance, could be achieved via further evidence
combinations. Through a series of experiments on synthetic data analysis,
visual recognition, and open-set detection, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our methods in quantifying two sources of uncertainties and dealing with
flexible recognition.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents FunCodec, a fundamental neural speech codec toolkit,
which is an extension of the open-source speech processing toolkit FunASR.
FunCodec provides reproducible training recipes and inference scripts for the
latest neural speech codec models, such as SoundStream and Encodec. Thanks to
the unified design with FunASR, FunCodec can be easily integrated into
downstream tasks, such as speech recognition. Along with FunCodec, pre-trained
models are also provided, which can be used for academic or generalized
purposes. Based on the toolkit, we further propose the frequency-domain codec
models, FreqCodec, which can achieve comparable speech quality with much lower
computation and parameter complexity. Experimental results show that, under the
same compression ratio, FunCodec can achieve better reconstruction quality
compared with other toolkits and released models. We also demonstrate that the
pre-trained models are suitable for downstream tasks, including automatic
speech recognition and personalized text-to-speech synthesis. This toolkit is
publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunCodec.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel protocol for computing a circuit which implements the
multi-party private set intersection functionality (PSI). Circuit-based
approach has advantages over using custom protocols to achieve this task, since
many applications of PSI do not require the computation of the intersection
itself, but rather specific functional computations over the items in the
intersection.
<br />Our protocol represents the pioneering circuit-based multi-party PSI
protocol, which builds upon and optimizes the two-party SCS
\cite{huang2012private} protocol. By using secure computation between two
parties, our protocol sidesteps the complexities associated with multi-party
interactions and demonstrates good scalability.
<br />In order to mitigate the high overhead associated with circuit-based
constructions, we have further enhanced our protocol by utilizing simple
hashing scheme and permutation-based hash functions. These tricks have enabled
us to minimize circuit size by employing bucketing techniques while
simultaneously attaining noteworthy reductions in both computation and
communication expenses.

<p class="mathjax">Edge/fog computing, as a distributed computing paradigm, satisfies the
low-latency requirements of ever-increasing number of IoT applications and has
become the mainstream computing paradigm behind IoT applications. However,
because large number of IoT applications require execution on the edge/fog
resources, the servers may be overloaded. Hence, it may disrupt the edge/fog
servers and also negatively affect IoT applications' response time. Moreover,
many IoT applications are composed of dependent components incurring extra
constraints for their execution. Besides, edge/fog computing environments and
IoT applications are inherently dynamic and stochastic. Thus, efficient and
adaptive scheduling of IoT applications in heterogeneous edge/fog computing
environments is of paramount importance. However, limited computational
resources on edge/fog servers imposes an extra burden for applying optimal but
computationally demanding techniques. To overcome these challenges, we propose
a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IoT application Scheduling algorithm,
called DRLIS to adaptively and efficiently optimize the response time of
heterogeneous IoT applications and balance the load of the edge/fog servers. We
implemented DRLIS as a practical scheduler in the FogBus2 function-as-a-service
framework for creating an edge-fog-cloud integrated serverless computing
environment. Results obtained from extensive experiments show that DRLIS
significantly reduces the execution cost of IoT applications by up to 55%, 37%,
and 50% in terms of load balancing, response time, and weighted cost,
respectively, compared with metaheuristic algorithms and other reinforcement
learning techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular cameras are extensively employed in indoor robotics, but their
performance is limited in visual odometry, depth estimation, and related
applications due to the absence of scale information.Depth estimation refers to
the process of estimating a dense depth map from the corresponding input image,
existing researchers mostly address this issue through deep learning-based
approaches, yet their inference speed is slow, leading to poor real-time
capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose an explicit method for rapid
monocular depth recovery specifically designed for corridor environments,
leveraging the principles of nonlinear optimization. We adopt the virtual
camera assumption to make full use of the prior geometric features of the
scene. The depth estimation problem is transformed into an optimization problem
by minimizing the geometric residual. Furthermore, a novel depth plane
construction technique is introduced to categorize spatial points based on
their possible depths, facilitating swift depth estimation in enclosed
structural scenarios, such as corridors. We also propose a new corridor
dataset, named Corr\_EH\_z, which contains images as captured by the UGV camera
of a variety of corridors. An exhaustive set of experiments in different
corridors reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">A key challenge with procedure planning in instructional videos lies in how
to handle a large decision space consisting of a multitude of action types that
belong to various tasks. To understand real-world video content, an AI agent
must proficiently discern these action types (e.g., pour milk, pour water, open
lid, close lid, etc.) based on brief visual observation. Moreover, it must
adeptly capture the intricate semantic relation of the action types and task
goals, along with the variable action sequences. Recently, notable progress has
been made via the integration of diffusion models and visual representation
learning to address the challenge. However, existing models employ rudimentary
mechanisms to utilize task information to manage the decision space. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a simple yet effective enhancement - a
masked diffusion model. The introduced mask acts akin to a task-oriented
attention filter, enabling the diffusion/denoising process to concentrate on a
subset of action types. Furthermore, to bolster the accuracy of task
classification, we harness more potent visual representation learning
techniques. In particular, we learn a joint visual-text embedding, where a text
embedding is generated by prompting a pre-trained vision-language model to
focus on human actions. We evaluate the method on three public datasets and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. Code is available at
https://github.com/ffzzy840304/Masked-PDPP.

<p class="mathjax">In recent studies, linear recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) have achieved
Transformer-level performance in natural language modeling and long-range
modeling while offering rapid parallel training and constant inference costs.
With the resurged interest in LRNNs, we study whether they can learn the hidden
rules in training sequences, such as the grammatical structures of regular
language. We theoretically analyze some existing LRNNs and discover their
limitations on regular language. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a new
LRNN equipped with a block-diagonal and input-dependent transition matrix.
Experiments suggest that the proposed model is the only LRNN that can perform
length extrapolation on regular language tasks such as Sum, Even Pair, and
Modular Arithmetic.

<p class="mathjax">ASR systems have become increasingly widespread in recent years. However,
their textual outputs often require post-processing tasks before they can be
practically utilized. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the
multifaceted capabilities of LLMs and Whisper, and focus on integrating
multiple ASR text processing tasks related to speech recognition into the ASR
model. This integration not only shortens the multi-stage pipeline, but also
prevents the propagation of cascading errors, resulting in direct generation of
post-processed text. In this study, we focus on ASR-related processing tasks,
including Contextual ASR and multiple ASR post processing tasks. To achieve
this objective, we introduce the CPPF model, which offers a versatile and
highly effective alternative to ASR processing. CPPF seamlessly integrates
these tasks without any significant loss in recognition performance.

and poses high risk against the privacy of clients in FL. However, most
existing GIAs necessitate control over the server and rely on strong prior
knowledge including batch normalization and data distribution information. In
this work, we propose Client-side poisoning Gradient Inversion (CGI), which is
a novel attack method that can be launched from clients. For the first time, we
show the feasibility of a client-side adversary with limited knowledge being
able to recover the training samples from the aggregated global model. We take
a distinct approach in which the adversary utilizes a malicious model that
amplifies the loss of a specific targeted class of interest. When honest
clients employ the poisoned global model, the gradients of samples belonging to
the targeted class are magnified, making them the dominant factor in the
aggregated update. This enables the adversary to effectively reconstruct the
private input belonging to other clients using the aggregated update. In
addition, our CGI also features its ability to remain stealthy against
Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs). By optimizing malicious updates and
blending benign updates with a malicious replacement vector, our method remains
undetected by these defense mechanisms. To evaluate the performance of CGI, we
conduct experiments on various benchmark datasets, considering representative
Byzantine-robust AGRs, and exploring diverse FL settings with different levels
of adversary knowledge about the data. Our results demonstrate that CGI
consistently and successfully extracts training input in all tested scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce M3-AUDIODEC, an innovative neural spatial audio codec designed
for efficient compression of multi-channel (binaural) speech in both single and
multi-speaker scenarios, while retaining the spatial location information of
each speaker. This model boasts versatility, allowing configuration and
training tailored to a predetermined set of multi-channel, multi-speaker, and
multi-spatial overlapping speech conditions. Key contributions are as follows:
1) Previous neural codecs are extended from single to multi-channel audios. 2)
The ability of our proposed model to compress and decode for overlapping
speech. 3) A groundbreaking architecture that compresses speech content and
spatial cues separately, ensuring the preservation of each speaker's spatial
context after decoding. 4) M3-AUDIODEC's proficiency in reducing the bandwidth
for compressing two-channel speech by 48% when compared to individual binaural
channel compression. Impressively, at a 12.6 kbps operation, it outperforms
Opus at 24 kbps and AUDIODEC at 24 kbps by 37% and 52%, respectively. In our
assessment, we employed speech enhancement and room acoustic metrics to
ascertain the accuracy of clean speech and spatial cue estimates from
M3-AUDIODEC. Audio demonstrations and source code are available online.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing
various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.
<br />In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.

<p class="mathjax">The Lombard effect refers to individuals' unconscious modulation of vocal
effort in response to variations in the ambient noise levels, intending to
enhance speech intelligibility. The impact of different decibel levels and
types of background noise on Lombard effects remains unclear. Building upon the
characteristic of Lombard speech that individuals adjust their speech to
improve intelligibility dynamically based on the self-feedback speech, we
propose a flavor classification approach for the Lombard effect. We first
collected Mandarin Lombard speech under different noise conditions, then
simulated self-feedback speech, and ultimately conducted the statistical test

<p class="mathjax">The transition from traditional bus fleets to zero-emission ones necessitates
the development of effective planning models for battery electric bus (BEB)
charging infrastructure. On-route fast charging stations, distinct from on-base
charging stations, present unique challenges related to safe operation and
power supply capacity, making it difficult to control grid operational costs.
This paper establishes a novel framework that integrates the bus route network
and power network, which leverages the inter-dependency between both networks
to optimize the planning outcomes of on-route BEB charging stations in South
King County. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone
programming model, aiming to minimize the overall planning cost, which includes
investments in charging equipment, power facility, and grid operation.
Furthermore, fairness measurements are incorporated into the planning process,
allowing for the consideration of both horizontal transit equity and vertical
transit equity based on different zone merging criteria within the county's
existing census tracts. The results of this planning model offer valuable
insights into achieving both economic efficiency and social justice in the
design of on-route charging facilities for BEBs in South King County.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language
tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of
LLMs' MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for
which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without
published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of
the world's diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for
their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive
set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200
benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT
model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag
for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of
languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language's resource level is
the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to
translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs
and African languages.

<p class="mathjax">The semantic understanding of indoor 3D point cloud data is crucial for a
range of subsequent applications, including indoor service robots, navigation
systems, and digital twin engineering. Global features are crucial for
achieving high-quality semantic and instance segmentation of indoor point
clouds, as they provide essential long-range context information. To this end,
we propose JSMNet, which combines a multi-layer network with a global feature
self-attention module to jointly segment three-dimensional point cloud
semantics and instances. To better express the characteristics of indoor
targets, we have designed a multi-resolution feature adaptive fusion module
that takes into account the differences in point cloud density caused by
varying scanner distances from the target. Additionally, we propose a framework
for joint semantic and instance segmentation by integrating semantic and
instance features to achieve superior results. We conduct experiments on S3DIS,
which is a large three-dimensional indoor point cloud dataset. Our proposed
method is compared against other methods, and the results show that it
outperforms existing methods in semantic and instance segmentation and provides
better results in target local area segmentation. Specifically, our proposed
method outperforms PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) by 16.0% and 26.3% in terms of
semantic segmentation mIoU in S3DIS (Area 5) and instance segmentation mPre,
respectively. Additionally, it surpasses ASIS (Wang et al., 2019) by 6.0% and
4.6%, respectively, as well as JSPNet (Chen et al., 2022) by a margin of 3.3%
for semantic segmentation mIoU and a slight improvement of 0.3% for instance
segmentation mPre.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attack aims to compromise a model, which returns an adversary-wanted
output when a specific trigger pattern appears yet behaves normally for clean
inputs. Current backdoor attacks require changing pixels of clean images, which
results in poor stealthiness of attacks and increases the difficulty of the
physical implementation. This paper proposes a novel physical invisible
backdoor based on camera imaging without changing nature image pixels.
Specifically, a compromised model returns a target label for images taken by a
particular camera, while it returns correct results for other images. To
implement and evaluate the proposed backdoor, we take shots of different
objects from multi-angles using multiple smartphones to build a new dataset of
21,500 images. Conventional backdoor attacks work ineffectively with some
classical models, such as ResNet18, over the above-mentioned dataset.
Therefore, we propose a three-step training strategy to mount the backdoor
attack. First, we design and train a camera identification model with the phone
IDs to extract the camera fingerprint feature. Subsequently, we elaborate a
special network architecture, which is easily compromised by our backdoor
attack, by leveraging the attributes of the CFA interpolation algorithm and
combining it with the feature extraction block in the camera identification
model. Finally, we transfer the backdoor from the elaborated special network
architecture to the classical architecture model via teacher-student
distillation learning. Since the trigger of our method is related to the
specific phone, our attack works effectively in the physical world. Experiment
results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach and robustness
against various backdoor defenses.

<p class="mathjax">This thesis explores challenges in semantic parsing, specifically focusing on
scenarios with limited data and computational resources. It offers solutions
using techniques like automatic data curation, knowledge transfer, active
learning, and continual learning.
<br />For tasks with no parallel training data, the thesis proposes generating
synthetic training examples from structured database schemas. When there is
abundant data in a source domain but limited parallel data in a target domain,
knowledge from the source is leveraged to improve parsing in the target domain.
<br />For multilingual situations with limited data in the target languages, the
thesis introduces a method to adapt parsers using a limited human translation
budget. Active learning is applied to select source-language samples for manual
translation, maximizing parser performance in the target language. In addition,
an alternative method is also proposed to utilize machine translation services,
supplemented by human-translated data, to train a more effective parser.
<br />When computational resources are limited, a continual learning approach is
introduced to minimize training time and computational memory. This maintains
the parser's efficiency in previously learned tasks while adapting it to new
tasks, mitigating the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
<br />Overall, the thesis provides a comprehensive set of methods to improve
semantic parsing in resource-constrained conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Sifting through vast textual data and summarizing key information imposes a
substantial burden on how clinicians allocate their time. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown immense promise in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their efficacy across diverse clinical summarization
tasks has not yet been rigorously examined. In this work, we employ domain
adaptation methods on eight LLMs, spanning six datasets and four distinct
summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and
doctor-patient dialogue. Our thorough quantitative assessment reveals
trade-offs between models and adaptation methods in addition to instances where
recent advances in LLMs may not lead to improved results. Further, in a
clinical reader study with six physicians, we depict that summaries from the
best adapted LLM are preferable to human summaries in terms of completeness and
correctness. Our ensuing qualitative analysis delineates mutual challenges
faced by both LLMs and human experts. Lastly, we correlate traditional
quantitative NLP metrics with reader study scores to enhance our understanding
of how these metrics align with physician preferences. Our research marks the
first evidence of LLMs outperforming human experts in clinical text
summarization across multiple tasks. This implies that integrating LLMs into
clinical workflows could alleviate documentation burden, empowering clinicians
to focus more on personalized patient care and other irreplaceable human
aspects of medicine.

<p class="mathjax">To plan the trajectories of a large and heterogeneous swarm, sequential or
synchronous distributed methods usually become intractable, due to the lack of
global connectivity and clock synchronization, Moreover, the existing
asynchronously distributed schemes usually require recheck-like mechanisms
instead of inherently considering the other' moving tendency. To this end, we
propose a novel asynchronous protocol to allocate the agents' derivable space
in a distributed way, by which each agent can replan trajectory depending on
its own timetable. Properties such as collision avoidance and recursive
feasibility are theoretically shown and a lower bound of protocol updating is
provided. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons with five state-of-the-art
methods validate the effectiveness of our method and illustrate the improvement
in both the completion time and the moving distance. Finally, hardware
experiments are carried out, where 8 heterogeneous unmanned ground vehicles
with onboard computation navigate in cluttered scenarios at a high agility.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we address the challenge of encoding speech captured by a
microphone array using deep learning techniques with the aim of preserving and
accurately reconstructing crucial spatial cues embedded in multi-channel
recordings. We propose a neural spatial audio coding framework that achieves a
high compression ratio, leveraging single-channel neural sub-band codec and
SpatialCodec. Our approach encompasses two phases: (i) a neural sub-band codec
is designed to encode the reference channel with low bit rates, and (ii), a
SpatialCodec captures relative spatial information for accurate multi-channel
reconstruction at the decoder end. In addition, we also propose novel
evaluation metrics to assess the spatial cue preservation: (i) spatial
similarity, which calculates cosine similarity on a spatially intuitive
beamspace, and (ii), beamformed audio quality. Our system shows superior
spatial performance compared with high bitrate baselines and black-box neural
architecture. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/SpatialCodecDemo.

<p class="mathjax">Gestational diabetes (GDM) poses a growing health risk to both pregnant women
and their offspring. While telehealth interventions for GDM management have
proven effective, they have traditionally relied on healthcare professionals
for guidance and feedback. Our aim was to explore self-tracking in GDM with
wearable sensors from self-discovery (i.e., learning associations between
glucose levels and lifestyle) and user experience perspectives. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with women diagnosed with GDM, utilizing continuous glucose
monitor and three types of physical activity sensors (activity bracelet,
hip-worn sensor, and electrocardiography sensor) for a week. Data from the
sensors was collected, and participants were later interviewed about their
experience with the wearable sensors. Additionally, we gathered maternal
nutrition data through a 3-day food diary and recorded self-reported physical
activity using a logbook. We discovered that continuous glucose monitors were
especially valuable for self-discovery, particularly when establishing links
between glucose levels and nutritional intake. Challenges associated with using
wearable sensors data for self-discovery in GDM included: (1) Separation of
glucose and physical activity data in different applications, (2) Missing key
trackable features, such as light physical activity and non-walking activities,
(3) Discrepancies in data, and (4) Differences in perceived versus measured
physical activity. The placement of sensors on the body emerged as a critical
factor influencing data quality and personal preferences. To conclude, an app
where glucose, nutrition, and physical activity data are combined is needed to
support self-discovery. This app should enable tracking of essential features
for women with GDM, including light physical activity, with data originating
from a single sensor to ensure consistency and eliminate redundancy.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), possessing the capacity to comprehend,
learn, and execute tasks with human cognitive abilities, engenders significant
anticipation and intrigue across scientific, commercial, and societal arenas.
This fascination extends particularly to the Internet of Things (IoT), a
landscape characterized by the interconnection of countless devices, sensors,
and systems, collectively gathering and sharing data to enable intelligent
decision-making and automation. This research embarks on an exploration of the
opportunities and challenges towards achieving AGI in the context of the IoT.
Specifically, it starts by outlining the fundamental principles of IoT and the
critical role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT systems. Subsequently, it
delves into AGI fundamentals, culminating in the formulation of a conceptual
framework for AGI's seamless integration within IoT. The application spectrum
for AGI-infused IoT is broad, encompassing domains ranging from smart grids,
residential environments, manufacturing, and transportation to environmental
monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, and education. However, adapting AGI to
resource-constrained IoT settings necessitates dedicated research efforts.
Furthermore, the paper addresses constraints imposed by limited computing
resources, intricacies associated with large-scale IoT communication, as well
as the critical concerns pertaining to security and privacy.

<p class="mathjax">This work breaks through the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT)dilemma in prompt tuning,
i.e., the better the tuned model generalizes to the base (or target) task, the
worse it generalizes to new tasks, and vice versa. Specifically, through an
in-depth analysis of the learned features of the base and new tasks, we observe
that the BNT stems from a channel bias issue, i.e., the vast majority of
feature channels are occupied by base-specific knowledge, resulting in the
collapse of taskshared knowledge important to new tasks. To address this, we
propose the Decoupled Prompt Tuning (DePT) framework, which decouples
base-specific knowledge from feature channels into an isolated feature space
during prompt tuning, so as to maximally preserve task-shared knowledge in the
original feature space for achieving better zero-shot generalization on new
tasks. Importantly, our DePT is orthogonal to existing prompt tuning methods,
hence it can improve all of them. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show the
strong flexibility and effectiveness of DePT. Our code and pretrained models
are available at https://github.com/Koorye/DePT.

<p class="mathjax">Control design for general nonlinear robotic systems with guaranteed
stability and/or safety in the presence of model uncertainties is a challenging
problem. Recent efforts attempt to learn a controller and a certificate (e.g.,
a Lyapunov function or a contraction metric) jointly using neural networks
(NNs), in which model uncertainties are generally ignored during the learning
process. In this paper, for nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances,
we present a framework for jointly learning a robust nonlinear controller and a
contraction metric using a novel disturbance rejection objective that certifies
a universal $\mathcal L_\infty$ gain bound using NNs for user-specified
variables. The learned controller aims to minimize the effect of disturbances
on the actual trajectories of state and/or input variables from their nominal
counterparts while providing certificate tubes around nominal trajectories that
are guaranteed to contain actual trajectories in the presence of disturbances.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can generate tighter tubes
and a controller that is computationally efficient to implement.

<p class="mathjax">With the vigorous development of the urban construction industry, engineering
deformation or changes often occur during the construction process. To combat
this phenomenon, it is necessary to detect changes in order to detect
construction loopholes in time, ensure the integrity of the project and reduce
labor costs. Or the inconvenience and injuriousness of the road. In the study
of change detection in 3D point clouds, researchers have published various
research methods on 3D point clouds. Directly based on but mostly based
ontraditional threshold distance methods (C2C, M3C2, M3C2-EP), and some are to
convert 3D point clouds into DSM, which loses a lot of original information.
Although deep learning is used in remote sensing methods, in terms of change
detection of 3D point clouds, it is more converted into two-dimensional
patches, and neural networks are rarely applied directly. We prefer that the
network is given at the level of pixels or points. Variety. Therefore, in this
article, our network builds a network for 3D point cloud change detection, and
proposes a new module Cross transformer suitable for change detection.
Simultaneously simulate tunneling data for change detection, and do test
experiments with our network.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the progress we have recorded in the last few years in multilingual
natural language processing, evaluation is typically limited to a small set of
languages with available datasets which excludes a large number of low-resource
languages. In this paper, we created SIB-200 -- a large-scale open-sourced
benchmark dataset for topic classification in 200 languages and dialects to
address the lack of evaluation dataset for Natural Language Understanding
(NLU). For many of the languages covered in SIB-200, this is the first publicly
available evaluation dataset for NLU. The dataset is based on Flores-200
machine translation corpus. We annotated the English portion of the dataset and
extended the sentence-level annotation to the remaining 203 languages covered
in the corpus. Despite the simplicity of this task, our evaluation in
full-supervised setting, cross-lingual transfer setting and prompting of large
language model setting show that there is still a large gap between the
performance of high-resource and low-resource languages when multilingual
evaluation is scaled to numerous world languages. We found that languages
unseen during the pre-training of multilingual language models,
under-represented language families (like Nilotic and Altantic-Congo), and
languages from the regions of Africa, Americas, Oceania and South East Asia,
often have the lowest performance on our topic classification dataset. We hope
our dataset will encourage a more inclusive evaluation of multilingual language
models on a more diverse set of languages. https://github.com/dadelani/sib-200

<p class="mathjax">Smishing, also known as SMS phishing, is a type of fraudulent communication
in which an attacker disguises SMS communications to deceive a target into
providing their sensitive data. Smishing attacks use a variety of tactics;
however, they have a similar goal of stealing money or personally identifying
information (PII) from a victim. In response to these attacks, a wide variety
of anti-smishing tools have been developed to block or filter these
communications. Despite this, the number of phishing attacks continue to rise.
In this paper, we developed a test bed for measuring the effectiveness of
popular anti-smishing tools against fresh smishing attacks. To collect fresh
smishing data, we introduce Smishtank.com, a collaborative online resource for
reporting and collecting smishing data sets. The SMS messages were validated by
a security expert and an in-depth qualitative analysis was performed on the
collected messages to provide further insights. To compare tool effectiveness,
we experimented with 20 smishing and benign messages across 3 key segments of
the SMS messaging delivery ecosystem. Our results revealed significant room for
improvement in all 3 areas against our smishing set. Most anti-phishing apps
and bulk messaging services didn't filter smishing messages beyond the carrier
blocking. The 2 apps that blocked the most smish also blocked 85-100\% of
benign messages. Finally, while carriers did not block any benign messages,
they were only able to reach a 25-35\% blocking rate for smishing messages. Our
work provides insights into the performance of anti-smishing tools and the
roles they play in the message blocking process. This paper would enable the
research community and industry to be better informed on the current state of
anti-smishing technology on the SMS platform.

predict the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of a high-dimensional non-linear

the art for deep neural networks training and prediction. While our results are
encouraging, and show that the dynamics of the considered system can be
predicted for short time, we also indirectly discovered an unexpected and
undesirable behavior of the TensorFlow library. More specifically, the longer
term prediction of the system's chaotic behavior quickly deteriorates and blows
up due to the nondeterministic behavior of the TensorFlow library. Here we
provide numerical evidence of the short time prediction ability, and of the
longer term predictability blow up.

<p class="mathjax">A rising trend in theoretical deep learning is to understand why deep
learning works through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [jgh18], a kernel method
that is equivalent to using gradient descent to train a multi-layer
infinitely-wide neural network. NTK is a major step forward in the theoretical
deep learning because it allows researchers to use traditional mathematical
tools to analyze properties of deep neural networks and to explain various
neural network techniques from a theoretical view. A natural extension of NTK
on graph learning is \textit{Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)}, and
researchers have already provide GNTK formulation for graph-level regression
and show empirically that this kernel method can achieve similar accuracy as
GNNs on various bioinformatics datasets [dhs+19]. The remaining question now is
whether solving GNTK regression is equivalent to training an infinite-wide
multi-layer GNN using gradient descent. In this paper, we provide three new
theoretical results. First, we formally prove this equivalence for graph-level
regression. Second, we present the first GNTK formulation for node-level
regression. Finally, we prove the equivalence for node-level regression.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent strides made in Speech Separation, most models are trained on
datasets with neutral emotions. Emotional speech has been known to degrade
performance of models in a variety of speech tasks, which reduces the
effectiveness of these models when deployed in real-world scenarios. In this
paper we perform analysis to differentiate the performance degradation arising
from the emotions in speech from the impact of out-of-domain inference. This is
measured using a carefully designed test dataset, Emo2Mix, consisting of
balanced data across all emotional combinations. We show that even models with
strong out-of-domain performance such as Sepformer can still suffer significant
degradation of up to 5.1 dB SI-SDRi on mixtures with strong emotions. This
demonstrates the importance of accounting for emotions in real-world speech
separation applications.

<p class="mathjax">This article is concerned with a data-driven divide-and-conquer strategy to
construct symbolic abstractions for interconnected control networks with
unknown mathematical models. We employ a notion of alternating bisimulation
functions (ABF) to quantify the closeness between state trajectories of an
interconnected network and its symbolic abstraction. Consequently, the
constructed symbolic abstraction can be leveraged as a beneficial substitute
for the formal verification and controller synthesis over the interconnected
network. In our data-driven framework, we first establish a relation between
each unknown subsystem and its data-driven symbolic abstraction, so-called
alternating pseudo-bisimulation function (APBF), with a guaranteed
probabilistic confidence. We then provide compositional conditions based on
max-type small-gain techniques to construct an ABF for an unknown
interconnected network using APBF of its individual subsystems, constructed
from data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our data-driven approach over a room
temperature network composing 100 rooms with unknown models. We construct a
symbolic abstraction from data for each room as an appropriate substitute of
original system and compositionally synthesize controllers regulating the
temperature of each room within a safe zone with some guaranteed probabilistic
confidence.

<p class="mathjax">Sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to have
dense infrastructures, large-dimensional channels, cost-effective hardware,
diversified positioning methods, and enhanced intelligence. Such trends bring
both new challenges and opportunities for the practical design of 6G. On one
hand, acquiring channel state information (CSI) in real time for all wireless
links becomes quite challenging in 6G. On the other hand, there would be
numerous data sources in 6G containing high-quality location-tagged channel
data, making it possible to better learn the local wireless environment. By
exploiting such new opportunities and for tackling the CSI acquisition
challenge, there is a promising paradigm shift from the conventional
environment-unaware communications to the new environment-aware communications
based on the novel approach of channel knowledge map (CKM). This article aims
to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview on environment-aware
communications enabled by CKM to fully harness its benefits for 6G. First, the
basic concept of CKM is presented, and a comparison of CKM with various
existing channel inference techniques is discussed. Next, the main techniques
for CKM construction are discussed, including both the model-free and
model-assisted approaches. Furthermore, a general framework is presented for
the utilization of CKM to achieve environment-aware communications, followed by
some typical CKM-aided communication scenarios. Finally, important open
problems in CKM research are highlighted and potential solutions are discussed
to inspire future work.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across all
facets of life has ushered in an era of interconnectedness, creating new
avenues for cybersecurity challenges and underscoring the need for robust
intrusion detection systems. However, traditional security systems are designed
with a closed-world perspective and often face challenges in dealing with the
ever-evolving threat landscape, where new and unfamiliar attacks are constantly
emerging. In this paper, we introduce a framework aimed at mitigating the open
set recognition (OSR) problem in the realm of Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDS) tailored for IoT environments. Our framework capitalizes on
image-based representations of packet-level data, extracting spatial and
temporal patterns from network traffic. Additionally, we integrate stacking and
sub-clustering techniques, enabling the identification of unknown attacks by
effectively modeling the complex and diverse nature of benign behavior. The
empirical results prominently underscore the framework's efficacy, boasting an
impressive 88\% detection rate for previously unseen attacks when compared
against existing approaches and recent advancements. Future work will perform
extensive experimentation across various openness levels and attack scenarios,
further strengthening the adaptability and performance of our proposed solution
in safeguarding IoT environments.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Question Answering,
Summarization, and Classification. The use of LLMs as evaluators, that can rank
or score the output of other models (usually LLMs) has become increasingly
popular, due to the limitations of current evaluation techniques including the
lack of appropriate benchmarks, metrics, cost, and access to human annotators.
While LLMs are capable of handling approximately 100 languages, the majority of
languages beyond the top 20 lack systematic evaluation across various tasks,
metrics, and benchmarks. This creates an urgent need to scale up multilingual
evaluation to ensure a precise understanding of LLM performance across diverse
languages. LLM-based evaluators seem like the perfect solution to this problem,
as they do not require human annotators, human-created references, or
benchmarks and can theoretically be used to evaluate any language covered by
the LLM. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based evaluators can help
scale up multilingual evaluation. Specifically, we calibrate LLM-based
evaluation against 20k human judgments of five metrics across three
text-generation tasks in eight languages. Our findings indicate that LLM-based
evaluators may exhibit bias towards higher scores and should be used with
caution and should always be calibrated with a dataset of native speaker
judgments, particularly in low-resource and non-Latin script languages.

<p class="mathjax">An eye-movement-based predicted trajectory guidance control (ePTGC) is
proposed to mitigate the maneuverability degradation of a teleoperated ground
vehicle caused by communication delays. Human sensitivity to delays is the main
reason for the performance degradation of a ground vehicle teleoperation
system. The proposed framework extracts human intention from eye-movement.
Then, it combines it with contextual constraints to generate an
intention-compliant guidance trajectory, which is then employed to control the
vehicle directly. The advantage of this approach is that the teleoperator is
removed from the direct control loop by using the generated trajectories to
guide vehicle, thus reducing the adverse sensitivity to delay. The delay can be
compensated as long as the prediction horizon exceeds the delay. A
human-in-loop simulation platform is designed to evaluate the teleoperation
performance of the proposed method at different delay levels. The results are
analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, which shows that the proposed method
significantly improves maneuverability and cognitive burden at large delay
levels (&gt;200 ms). The overall performance is also much better than the PTGC
which does not employ the eye-movement feature.

<p class="mathjax">Community smells are negative patterns in software development teams'
interactions that impede their ability to successfully create software.
Examples are team members working in isolation, lack of communication and
collaboration across departments or sub-teams, or areas of the codebase where
only a few team members can work on. Current approaches aim to detect community
smells by analysing static network representations of software teams'
interaction structures. In doing so, they are insufficient to locate community
smells within development processes. Extending beyond the capabilities of
traditional social network analysis, we show that higher-order network models
provide a robust means of revealing such hidden patterns and complex
relationships. To this end, we develop a set of centrality measures based on
the MOGen higher-order network model and show their effectiveness in predicting
influential nodes using five empirical datasets. We then employ these measures
for a comprehensive analysis of a product team at the German IT security
company genua GmbH, showcasing our method's success in identifying and locating
community smells. Specifically, we uncover critical community smells in two
areas of the team's development process. Semi-structured interviews with five
team members validate our findings: while the team was aware of one community
smell and employed measures to address it, it was not aware of the second. This
highlights the potential of our approach as a robust tool for identifying and
addressing community smells in software development teams. More generally, our
work contributes to the social network analysis field with a powerful set of
higher-order network centralities that effectively capture community dynamics
and indirect relationships.

<p class="mathjax">Visual localization is the task of estimating a 6-DoF camera pose of a query
image within a provided 3D reference map. Thanks to recent advances in various
3D sensors, 3D point clouds are becoming a more accurate and affordable option
for building the reference map, but research to match the points of 3D point
clouds with pixels in 2D images for visual localization remains challenging.
Existing approaches that jointly learn 2D-3D feature matching suffer from low
inliers due to representational differences between the two modalities, and the
methods that bypass this problem into classification have an issue of poor
refinement. In this work, we propose EP2P-Loc, a novel large-scale visual
localization method that mitigates such appearance discrepancy and enables
end-to-end training for pose estimation. To increase the number of inliers, we
propose a simple algorithm to remove invisible 3D points in the image, and find
all 2D-3D correspondences without keypoint detection. To reduce memory usage
and search complexity, we take a coarse-to-fine approach where we extract
patch-level features from 2D images, then perform 2D patch classification on
each 3D point, and obtain the exact corresponding 2D pixel coordinates through
positional encoding. Finally, for the first time in this task, we employ a
differentiable PnP for end-to-end training. In the experiments on newly curated
large-scale indoor and outdoor benchmarks based on 2D-3D-S and KITTI, we show
that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
visual localization and image-to-point cloud registration methods.

<p class="mathjax">Articulated object manipulation is a fundamental yet challenging task in
robotics. Due to significant geometric and semantic variations across object
categories, previous manipulation models struggle to generalize to novel
categories. Few-shot learning is a promising solution for alleviating this
issue by allowing robots to perform a few interactions with unseen objects.
However, extant approaches often necessitate costly and inefficient test-time
interactions with each unseen instance. Recognizing this limitation, we observe
that despite their distinct shapes, different categories often share similar
local geometries essential for manipulation, such as pullable handles and
graspable edges - a factor typically underutilized in previous few-shot
learning works. To harness this commonality, we introduce 'Where2Explore', an
affordance learning framework that effectively explores novel categories with
minimal interactions on a limited number of instances. Our framework explicitly
estimates the geometric similarity across different categories, identifying
local areas that differ from shapes in the training categories for efficient
exploration while concurrently transferring affordance knowledge to similar
parts of the objects. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world
environments demonstrate our framework's capacity for efficient few-shot
exploration and generalization.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel fuzzy cascaded Proportional-Derivative (PD)
controller for under-actuated single-link flexible joint manipulators. The
original flexible joint system is considered as two coupled $2^{nd}$-order
sub-systems. The proposed controller is composed of two cascaded PD controllers
and two fuzzy logic regulators (FLRs). The first (virtual) PD controller is
used to generate desired control input that stabilizes the first $2^{nd}$-order
sub-system. Solving the equation by considering the coupling terms as design
variables, the reference signal is generated for the second sub-system. Then
through simple compensation design, together with the second PD controller, the
cascaded PD controller is derived. In order to further improve the performance,
two FLRs are implemented that adaptively tune the parameters of PD controllers.
Under natural assumptions, the cascaded fuzzy PD controller is proved to
possess locally asymptotic stability. All the offline tuning processes are
completed data-efficiently by Bayesian Optimization. The results in simulation
illustrate the stability and validity of our proposed method. Besides, the idea
of cascaded PD controller presented here may be extended as a novel control
method for other under-actuated systems, and the stability analysis renders a
new perspective towards the stability proof of all other fuzzy-enhanced PID
controllers.

<p class="mathjax">A service robot can provide a smoother interaction experience if it has the
ability to proactively detect whether a nearby user intends to interact, in
order to adapt its behavior e.g. by explicitly showing that it is available to
provide a service. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to
predict the probability that a human user will interact with a robot before the
interaction actually begins; the approach is self-supervised because after each
encounter with a human, the robot can automatically label it depending on
whether it resulted in an interaction or not. We explore different
classification approaches, using different sets of features considering the
pose and the motion of the user. We validate and deploy the approach in three
scenarios. The first collects $3442$ natural sequences (both interacting and
non-interacting) representing employees in an office break area: a real-world,
challenging setting, where we consider a coffee machine in place of a service
robot. The other two scenarios represent researchers interacting with service
robots ($200$ and $72$ sequences, respectively). Results show that, even in
challenging real-world settings, our approach can learn without external
supervision, and can achieve accurate classification (i.e. AUROC greater than
$0.9$) of the user's intention to interact with an advance of more than $3$s
before the interaction actually occurs.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a direct text to speech translation system using discrete
acoustic units. This framework employs text in different source languages as
input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text
transcriptions in this language. Motivated by the success of acoustic units in
previous works for direct speech to speech translation systems, we use the same
pipeline to extract the acoustic units using a speech encoder combined with a
clustering algorithm. Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture
is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units. Our
approach for direct text to speech translation was tested on the new CVSS
corpus with two different text mBART models employed as initialisation. The
systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs
evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our
proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we exploit the unique properties of a deterministic projected
belief network (D-PBN) to take full advantage of trainable compound activation
functions (TCAs). A D-PBN is a type of auto-encoder that operates by "backing
up" through a feed-forward neural network. TCAs are activation functions with
complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so
that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN
operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process,
restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a
given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a
D-PBN auto-encoder with TCAs can significantly out-perform standard
auto-encoders including variational auto-encoders.

<p class="mathjax">A Multilayer Network (MN) is a system consisting of several topological
levels (i.e., layers) representing the interactions between the system's
objects and the related interdependency. Therefore, it may be represented as a
set of layers that can be assimilated to a set of networks of its own objects,
by means inter-layer edges (or inter-edges) linking the nodes of different
layers; for instance, a biological MN may allow modeling of inter and intra
interactions among diseases, genes, and drugs, only using its own structure.
The analysis of MNs may reveal hidden knowledge, as demonstrated by several
algorithms for the analysis. Recently, there is a growing interest in comparing
two MNs by revealing local regions of similarity, as a counterpart of Network
Alignment algorithms (NA) for simple networks. However, classical algorithms
for NA such as Local NA (LNA) cannot be applied on multilayer networks, since
they are not able to deal with inter-layer edges. Therefore, there is the need
for the introduction of novel algorithms. In this paper, we present MuLaN, an
algorithm for the local alignment of multilayer networks. We first show as
proof of concept the performances of MuLaN on a set of synthetic multilayer
networks. Then, we used as a case study a real multilayer network in the
biomedical domain. Our results show that MuLaN is able to build high-quality
alignments and can extract knowledge about the aligned multilayer networks.

<p class="mathjax">Piezoelectric materials exhibit electric responses to mechanical stress, and
mechanical responses to electric stress. The PDE model, describing the
longitudinal oscillations on the beam, with two boundary feedback controllers
is known to have exponentially stable solutions. However, the reduced model by
the semi-discretized Finite Elements is shown to lack of exponential stability
uniformly as the discretization parameter tends to zero. This is due to the
loss of uniform gap among the high-frequency eigenvalues. In this paper, an
alternate Finite-Difference based model reduction is investigated by cleverly
reducing the order of the model together with the consideration of equidistant
grid points and averaging operators. This new model reduction successfully
retains the exponential stability uniformly as the discretization parameter
tends to zero. Moreover, it does not need a further numerical Fourier
filtering. Our results are based on a careful construction of a Lyapunov
function. The numerical simulations are provided to compare reduced models and
to show the strength of introduced results.

<p class="mathjax">Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to reconstruct facial movements to achieve
high natural lip movements from audio and facial features that are under
potential connections. Existing TFG methods have made significant advancements
to produce natural and realistic images. However, most work rarely takes visual
quality into consideration. It is challenging to ensure lip synchronization
while avoiding visual quality degradation in cross-modal generation methods. To
address this issue, we propose a universal High-Definition Teeth Restoration
Network, dubbed HDTR-Net, for arbitrary TFG methods. HDTR-Net can enhance teeth
regions at an extremely fast speed while maintaining synchronization, and
temporal consistency. In particular, we propose a Fine-Grained Feature Fusion
(FGFF) module to effectively capture fine texture feature information around
teeth and surrounding regions, and use these features to fine-grain the feature
map to enhance the clarity of teeth. Extensive experiments show that our method
can be adapted to arbitrary TFG methods without suffering from lip
synchronization and frame coherence. Another advantage of HDTR-Net is its
real-time generation ability. Also under the condition of high-definition
restoration of talking face video synthesis, its inference speed is $300\%$
faster than the current state-of-the-art face restoration based on
super-resolution.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of IoT and edge computing, there is a need for efficient
and reliable middleware to handle the communication among Edge devices or
between Edge and Cloud. Meanwhile, ROS\,2 is more commonly used in robotic
systems, but there is no comparison study of middleware using ROS Messages. In
this study, we compared the middlewares that are commonly used in ROS\,2
systems, including DDS, Zenoh, and MQTT. In order to evaluate the performance
of the middleware in Edge-to-Edge and Edge-to-Cloud scenarios, we conducted the
experiments in a multi-host environment and compared the latency and throughput
of the middlewares with different types and sizes of ROS Messages in three
network setups including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and 4G. Additionally, we implemented
different middlewares on a real robot platform, TurtleBot 4, and sent commands
from a host to the robot to run a square-shaped trajectory. With the Optitrack
Motion Capture system, we recorded the robot trajectories and analyzed the
drift error. The results showed that CycloneDDS performs better under Ethernet,
and Zenoh performs better under Wifi and 4G. In the actual robot test, Zenoh's
trajectory drift error was the smallest.

<p class="mathjax">A recent trend in deep learning algorithms has been towards training large
scale models, having high parameter count and trained on big dataset. However,
robustness of such large scale models towards real-world settings is still a
less-explored topic. In this work, we first benchmark the performance of these
models under different perturbations and datasets thereby representing
real-world shifts, and highlight their degrading performance under these
shifts. We then discuss on how complete model fine-tuning based existing
robustification schemes might not be a scalable option given very large scale
networks and can also lead them to forget some of the desired characterstics.
Finally, we propose a simple and cost-effective method to solve this problem,
inspired by knowledge transfer literature. It involves robustifying smaller
models, at a lower computation cost, and then use them as teachers to tune a
fraction of these large scale networks, reducing the overall computational
overhead. We evaluate our proposed method under various vision perturbations
including ImageNet-C,R,S,A datasets and also for transfer learning, zero-shot
evaluation setups on different datasets. Benchmark results show that our method
is able to induce robustness to these large scale models efficiently, requiring
significantly lower time and also preserves the transfer learning, zero-shot
properties of the original model which none of the existing methods are able to
achieve.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an approach for anomalous sound detection that
incorporates outlier exposure and inlier modeling within a unified framework by
multitask learning. While outlier exposure-based methods can extract features
efficiently, it is not robust. Inlier modeling is good at generating robust
features, but the features are not very effective. Recently, serial approaches
are proposed to combine these two methods, but it still requires a separate
training step for normal data modeling. To overcome these limitations, we use
multitask learning to train a conformer-based encoder for outlier-aware inlier
modeling. Moreover, our approach provides multi-scale scores for detecting
anomalies. Experimental results on the MIMII and DCASE 2020 task 2 datasets
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-model systems and
achieves comparable results with top-ranked multi-system ensembles.

<p class="mathjax">Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) promise to enhance safety, efficiency,
and sustainability in urban transportation. However, this is contingent upon a
CAV correctly predicting the motion of surrounding agents and planning its own
motion safely. Doing so is challenging in complex urban environments due to
frequent occlusions and interactions among many agents. One solution is to
leverage smart infrastructure to augment a CAV's situational awareness; the
present work leverages a recently proposed "Self-Supervised Traffic Advisor"
(SSTA) framework of smart sensors that teach themselves to generate and
broadcast useful video predictions of road users. In this work, SSTA
predictions are modified to predict future occupancy instead of raw video,
which reduces the data footprint of broadcast predictions. The resulting
predictions are used within a planning framework, demonstrating that this
design can effectively aid CAV motion planning. A variety of numerical
experiments study the key factors that make SSTA outputs useful for practical
CAV planning in crowded urban environments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the performance of a singleuser fluid antenna system
(FAS), by exploiting a class of elliptical copulas to describe the structure of
dependency amongst the fluid antenna ports. By expressing Jakes' model in terms
of the Gaussian copula, we consider two cases: (i) the general case, i.e., any
arbitrary correlated fading distribution; and (ii) the specific case, i.e.,
correlated Nakagami-m fading. For both scenarios, we first derive analytical
expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability
density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel in terms of multivariate
normal distribution. Then, we obtain the outage probability (OP) and the delay
outage rate (DOR) to analyze the performance of the FAS. By employing the
popular rank correlation coefficients such as Spearman's \{rho} and Kendall's
{\tau}, we measure the degree of dependency in correlated arbitrary fading
channels and illustrate how the Gaussian copula can be accurately connected to
Jakes' model in FAS without complicated mathematical analysis. Numerical
results show that increasing the fluid antenna size provides lower OP and DOR,
but the system performance saturates as the number of antenna ports increases.
In addition, our results indicate that FAS provides better performance compared
to conventional single-fixed antenna systems even when the size of fluid
antenna is small.

<p class="mathjax">The heterogeneity of use cases that next-generation wireless systems need to
support calls for flexible and programmable networks that can autonomously

others are more elastic and can adapt to the resources made available by the

(RAN) paradigm is seen as an enabler of dynamic control and adaptation of the
protocol stack of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks in the 5th
Generation (5G) and beyond. Through its embodiment in the O-RAN alliance
specifications, it introduces the Ran Intelligent Controllers (RICs), which
enable closed-loop control, leveraging a rich set of RAN Key Performance
Measurements (KPMs) to build a representation of the network and enforcing
dynamic control through the configuration of 3GPP-defined stack parameters. In
this paper, we leverage the Open RAN closed-loop control capabilities to
design, implement, and evaluate multiple data-driven and dynamic Service Level
Agreement (SLA) enforcement policies, capable of adapting the RAN
semi-persistent scheduling patterns to match users requirements. To do so, we
implement semi-persistent scheduling capabilities in the OpenAirInterface (OAI)
5G stack, as well as an easily extensible and customizable version of the Open
RAN E2 interface that connects the OAI base stations to the near-real-time RIC.
We deploy and test our framework on Colosseum, a large-scale
hardware-in-the-loop channel emulator. Results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed Open RAN-based solution in managing SLA in near-real-time.

<p class="mathjax">Generating realistic talking faces is a complex and widely discussed task
with numerous applications. In this paper, we present DiffTalker, a novel model
designed to generate lifelike talking faces through audio and landmark
co-driving. DiffTalker addresses the challenges associated with directly
applying diffusion models to audio control, which are traditionally trained on
text-image pairs. DiffTalker consists of two agent networks: a
transformer-based landmarks completion network for geometric accuracy and a
diffusion-based face generation network for texture details. Landmarks play a
pivotal role in establishing a seamless connection between the audio and image
domains, facilitating the incorporation of knowledge from pre-trained diffusion
models. This innovative approach efficiently produces articulate-speaking
faces. Experimental results showcase DiffTalker's superior performance in
producing clear and geometrically accurate talking faces, all without the need
for additional alignment between audio and image features.

<p class="mathjax">Perceiving and manipulating 3D articulated objects in diverse environments is
essential for home-assistant robots. Recent studies have shown that point-level
affordance provides actionable priors for downstream manipulation tasks.
However, existing works primarily focus on single-object scenarios with
homogeneous agents, overlooking the realistic constraints imposed by the
environment and the agent's morphology, e.g., occlusions and physical
limitations. In this paper, we propose an environment-aware affordance
framework that incorporates both object-level actionable priors and environment
constraints. Unlike object-centric affordance approaches, learning
environment-aware affordance faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion due
to the complexity of various occlusions, characterized by their quantities,
geometries, positions and poses. To address this and enhance data efficiency,
we introduce a novel contrastive affordance learning framework capable of
training on scenes containing a single occluder and generalizing to scenes with
complex occluder combinations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach in learning affordance considering environment constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the remarkable success of deep learning systems over the last decade,
a key difference still remains between neural network and human
decision-making: As humans, we cannot only form a decision on the spot, but
also ponder, revisiting an initial guess from different angles, distilling
relevant information, arriving at a better decision. Here, we propose
RecycleNet, a latent feature recycling method, instilling the pondering
capability for neural networks to refine initial decisions over a number of
recycling steps, where outputs are fed back into earlier network layers in an
iterative fashion. This approach makes minimal assumptions about the neural
network architecture and thus can be implemented in a wide variety of contexts.
Using medical image segmentation as the evaluation environment, we show that
latent feature recycling enables the network to iteratively refine initial
predictions even beyond the iterations seen during training, converging towards
an improved decision. We evaluate this across a variety of segmentation
benchmarks and show consistent improvements even compared with top-performing
segmentation methods. This allows trading increased computation time for
improved performance, which can be beneficial, especially for safety-critical
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Unit testing is critical to the software development process, ensuring the
correctness of basic programming units in a program (e.g., a method).
Search-based software testing (SBST) is an automated approach to generating
test cases. SBST generates test cases with genetic algorithms by specifying the
coverage criterion (e.g., branch coverage). However, a good test suite must
have different properties, which cannot be captured using an individual
coverage criterion. Therefore, the state-of-the-art approach combines multiple
criteria to generate test cases. Since combining multiple coverage criteria
brings multiple objectives for optimization, it hurts the test suites' coverage
for certain criteria compared with using the single criterion. To cope with
this problem, we propose a novel approach named \textbf{smart selection}. Based
on the coverage correlations among criteria and the subsumption relationships
among coverage goals, smart selection selects a subset of coverage goals to
reduce the number of optimization objectives and avoid missing any properties
of all criteria. We conduct experiments to evaluate smart selection on $400$
Java classes with three state-of-the-art genetic algorithms under the
$2$-minute budget. On average, smart selection outperforms combining all goals
on $65.1\%$ of the classes having significant differences between the two
approaches. Secondly, we conduct experiments to verify our assumptions about
coverage criteria relationships. Furthermore, we experiment with different
budgets of $5$, $8$, and $10$ minutes, confirming the advantage of smart
selection over combining all goals.

<p class="mathjax">Remote sensing images are essential for many earth science applications, but
their quality can be degraded due to limitations in sensor technology and
complex imaging environments. To address this, various remote sensing image
deblurring methods have been developed to restore sharp, high-quality images
from degraded observational data. However, most traditional model-based
deblurring methods usually require predefined hand-craft prior assumptions,
which are difficult to handle in complex applications, and most deep
learning-based deblurring methods are designed as a black box, lacking
transparency and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel blind
deblurring learning framework based on alternating iterations of shrinkage
thresholds, alternately updating blurring kernels and images, with the
theoretical foundation of network design. Additionally, we propose a learnable
blur kernel proximal mapping module to improve the blur kernel evaluation in
the kernel domain. Then, we proposed a deep proximal mapping module in the
image domain, which combines a generalized shrinkage threshold operator and a
multi-scale prior feature extraction block. This module also introduces an
attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the prior importance, thus avoiding
the drawbacks of hand-crafted image prior terms. Thus, a novel multi-scale
generalized shrinkage threshold network (MGSTNet) is designed to specifically
focus on learning deep geometric prior features to enhance image restoration.
Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our MGSTNet framework on remote
sensing image datasets compared to existing deblurring methods.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of singing voice synthesis presents critical challenges to artists
and industry stakeholders over unauthorized voice usage. Unlike synthesized
speech, synthesized singing voices are typically released in songs containing
strong background music that may hide synthesis artifacts. Additionally,
singing voices present different acoustic and linguistic characteristics from
speech utterances. These unique properties make singing voice deepfake
detection a relevant but significantly different problem from synthetic speech
detection. In this work, we propose the singing voice deepfake detection task.
We first present SingFake, the first curated in-the-wild dataset consisting of
28.93 hours of bonafide and 29.40 hours of deepfake song clips in five
languages from 40 singers. We provide a train/val/test split where the test
sets include various scenarios. We then use SingFake to evaluate four
state-of-the-art speech countermeasure systems trained on speech utterances. We
find these systems lag significantly behind their performance on speech test
data. When trained on SingFake, either using separated vocal tracks or song
mixtures, these systems show substantial improvement. However, our evaluations
also identify challenges associated with unseen singers, communication codecs,
languages, and musical contexts, calling for dedicated research into singing
voice deepfake detection. The SingFake dataset and related resources are
available online.

<p class="mathjax">By identifying similarities between successive inputs, Self-Supervised
Learning (SSL) methods for time series analysis have demonstrated their
effectiveness in encoding the inherent static characteristics of temporal data.
However, an exclusive emphasis on similarities might result in representations
that overlook the dynamic attributes critical for modeling cardiovascular
diseases within a confined subject cohort. Introducing Distilled Encoding
Beyond Similarities (DEBS), this paper pioneers an SSL approach that transcends
mere similarities by integrating dissimilarities among positive pairs. The
framework is applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leading to a notable
enhancement of +10\% in the detection accuracy of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)
across diverse subjects. DEBS underscores the potential of attaining a more
refined representation by encoding the dynamic characteristics of time series
data, tapping into dissimilarities during the optimization process. Broadly,
the strategy delineated in this study holds the promise of unearthing novel
avenues for advancing SSL methodologies tailored to temporal data.

<p class="mathjax">We study the classical problem of approximating a non-decreasing function $f:
\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its
values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a
known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize
the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an
approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after
stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our
complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this
problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally
proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox
achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic
factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions.
Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster
for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any
knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves
optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute
explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps
between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth
functions, as well as monotone or non-monotone functions. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments to support our theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">An underlying mechanism for successful deep learning (DL) with a limited deep
architecture and dataset, namely VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, was recently presented
based on a quantitative method to measure the quality of a single filter in
each layer. In this method, each filter identifies small clusters of possible
output labels, with additional noise selected as labels out of the clusters.
This feature is progressively sharpened with the layers, resulting in an
enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and higher accuracy. In this study, the
suggested universal mechanism is verified for VGG-16 and EfficientNet-B0
trained on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets with the following main results.
First, the accuracy progressively increases with the layers, whereas the noise
per filter typically progressively decreases. Second, for a given deep
architecture, the maximal error rate increases approximately linearly with the
number of output labels. Third, the average filter cluster size and the number
of clusters per filter at the last convolutional layer adjacent to the output
layer are almost independent of the number of dataset labels in the range [3,
1,000], while a high SNR is preserved. The presented DL mechanism suggests
several techniques, such as applying filter's cluster connections (AFCC), to

<p class="mathjax">Vertical farming allows for year-round cultivation of a variety of crops,
overcoming environmental limitations and ensuring food security. This closed
and highly controlled system allows the plants to grow in optimal conditions,
so that they reach maturity faster and yield more than on a conventional
outdoor farm. However, one of the challenges of vertical farming is the high
energy consumption. In this work, we optimize wheat growth using an optimal
control approach with two objectives: first, we optimize inputs such as water,
radiation, and temperature for each day of the growth cycle, and second, we
optimize the duration of the plant's growth period to achieve the highest
possible yield over a whole year. For this, we use a nonlinear, discrete-time
hybrid model based on a simple universal crop model that we adapt to make the
optimization more efficient. Using our approach, we find an optimal trade-off
between used resources, net profit of the yield, and duration of a cropping
period, thus increasing the annual yield of crops significantly while keeping
input costs as low as possible. This work demonstrates the high potential of
control theory in the discipline of vertical farming.

<p class="mathjax">We propose an upwind finite volume method for a system of two kinetic
equations in one dimension that are coupled through nonlocal interaction terms.
These cross-interaction systems were recently obtained as the mean-field limit
of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations for two interacting
species. Models of this kind are encountered in a myriad of contexts, for
instance, to describe large systems of indistinguishable agents such as cell
colonies, flocks of birds, schools of fish, herds of sheep. The finite volume
method we propose is constructed to conserve mass and preserve positivity.
Moreover, convex functionals of the discrete solution are controlled, which we
use to show the convergence of the scheme. Finally, we investigate the scheme
numerically.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way
for their application in diverse domains. This paper proposes a benchmarking
framework tailored specifically for evaluating LLM performance in the context
of Verilog code generation for hardware design and verification. We present a
comprehensive evaluation dataset consisting of 156 problems from the Verilog
instructional website HDLBits. The evaluation set consists of a diverse set of
Verilog code generation tasks, ranging from simple combinational circuits to
complex finite state machines. The Verilog code completions can be
automatically tested for functional correctness by comparing the transient
simulation outputs of the generated design with a golden solution. We also
demonstrate that the Verilog code generation capability of pretrained language
models could be improved with supervised fine-tuning by bootstrapping with LLM
generated synthetic problem-code pairs.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of manipulator robots in household environments suggests a
need for more predictable and human-like robot motion. This holds especially
true for wheelchair-mounted assistive robots that can support the independence
of people with paralysis. One method of generating naturalistic motion
trajectories is via the imitation of human demonstrators. This paper explores a
self-supervised imitation learning method using an autoregressive
spatio-temporal graph neural network for an assistive drinking task. We address
learning from diverse human motion trajectory data that were captured via
wearable IMU sensors on a human arm as the action-free task demonstrations.
Observed arm motion data from several participants is used to generate natural
and functional drinking motion trajectories for a UR5e robot arm.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an efficient three-layered p-GaAs/p-CIGS/n-CdS (PPN), a
unique solar cell architecture. Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)-based
solar cells exhibit substantial performance than the ones utilizing cadmium
sulfide (CdS). On the contrary, CIGS-based devices are more efficient,
considering their device performance, environmentally benign nature, and
reduced cost. Therefore, our paper proposes a numerical analysis of the
homojunction PPN-junction GaAs solar cell structure along with n-ZnO front
contact that was simulated using the Solar Cells Capacitance Simulator
(SCAPS-1D) software. Moreover, we investigated optimization techniques for
evaluating the effect of the thickness and the carrier density on the
performance of the PPN layer on solar cell architecture. Subsequently, the
paper discusses the electronic characteristics of adding GaAs material on the
top of the conventional (PN) junction, further leading to improved values of
the parameters, such as the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit
voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the
solar cell. The most promising results of our study show that adding the GaAs
layer using the optimised values of thickness as 5 ({\mu}m) and carrier density
as 1*1020 (1/cm) will result in the maximum PCE, VOC, FF, and JSC of 45.7%,
1.16V, 89.52% and 43.88 (mA/m2), respectively, for the proposed solar cell
architecture.

<p class="mathjax">Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) aims at recognizing the
discourse relation between two text segments without an explicit connective.
Recently, the prompt learning has just been applied to the IDRR task with great
performance improvements over various neural network-based approaches. However,
the discrete nature of the state-art-of-art prompting approach requires manual
design of templates and answers, a big hurdle for its practical applications.
In this paper, we propose a continuous version of prompt learning together with
connective knowledge distillation, called AdaptPrompt, to reduce manual design
efforts via continuous prompting while further improving performance via
knowledge transfer. In particular, we design and train a few virtual tokens to
form continuous templates and automatically select the most suitable one by
gradient search in the embedding space. We also design an answer-relation
mapping rule to generate a few virtual answers as the answer space.
Furthermore, we notice the importance of annotated connectives in the training
dataset and design a teacher-student architecture for knowledge transfer.
Experiments on the up-to-date PDTB Corpus V3.0 validate our design objectives
in terms of the better relation recognition performance over the
state-of-the-art competitors.

<p class="mathjax">Device fingerprinting is a widely used technique that allows a third party to
identify a particular device. Applications of device fingerprinting include
authentication, attacker identification, or software license binding.
<br />Device fingerprinting is also used on the web as a method for identifying
users. Unfortunately, one of its most widespread uses is to identify users
visiting different websites and thus build their browsing history. This
constitutes a specific type of web tracking that poses a threat to users'
privacy. While many anti-tracking solutions have been proposed, all of them
block or tamper with device fingerprinting techniques rather than just blocking
their web tracking application. Therefore, users may be limited in their
experience while using a website.
<br />In this paper, we propose \textit{Privacy-preserving Client-side
Fingerprinting} (PCF), a new method that allows device fingerprinting on the
web, while blocks the possibility of performing web tracking. To this end, PCF
is built upon fingerprinting transparency: any website ought to declare its
fingerprinting scripts while users will compute them in a privacy-preserving
manner, limiting the resultant fingerprints for each different domain and,
therefore, making web tracking not feasible.

<p class="mathjax">AMR is widely used in factories to replace manual labor to reduce costs and
improve efficiency. However, it is often difficult for logistics robots to plan
the optimal trajectory and unreasonable trajectory planning can lead to low
transport efficiency and high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a
method to directly calculate the optimal trajectory for short distance on the
basis of the Dubins set, which completes the calculation of the Dubins path.
Additionally, as an improvement of Dubins path, we smooth the Dubins path based
on clothoid, which makes the curvature varies linearly. AMR can adjust the
steering wheels while following this trajectory. The experiments show that the
Dubins path can be calculated quickly and well smoothed.

<p class="mathjax">Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) with discrete self-supervised
representations has achieved remarkable accuracy, but is unable to preserve the
speaker timbre of the source speech during translation. Meanwhile, the scarcity
of high-quality speaker-parallel data poses a challenge for learning style
transfer between source and target speech. We propose an S2ST framework with an
acoustic language model based on discrete units from a self-supervised model
and a neural codec for style transfer. The acoustic language model leverages
self-supervised in-context learning, acquiring the ability for style transfer
without relying on any speaker-parallel data, thereby overcoming the issue of
data scarcity. By using extensive training data, our model achieves zero-shot
cross-lingual style transfer on previously unseen source languages. Experiments
show that our model generates translated speeches with high fidelity and style
similarity. Audio samples are available at <a href="http://stylelm.github.io/">this http URL</a> .

static teams under observation-sharing information structures. Assuming that
agents can access shared observations, we begin by converting the team problem
into an equivalent centralized stochastic control problem through the
introduction of a topology on policies. We subsequently apply conventional
methods from stochastic control to prove the existence of team-optimal
strategies. This study expands upon the widely recognized common information
approach for team problems, originally designed for discrete scenarios, and
adapts it to a more abstract continuous framework. The primary difficulty in
this context is to establish the appropriate topology on policies.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel approach to address the challenge of generalization in
offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent learns from a fixed
dataset without any additional interaction with the environment. Specifically,
we aim to improve the agent's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
goals. To achieve this, we propose to learn a dynamics model and check if it is
equivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations
in the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the
equivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples.
Finally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an
off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can greatly improve the test performance of the policy on the
considered environments.

<p class="mathjax">The analysis of structured complex data, such as clustered graph based
datasets, usually applies a variety of visual representation techniques and
formats. The majority of currently available tools and approaches to
exploratory visualization are built on integrated schemes for simultaneous
displaying of multiple aspects of studying objects and processes. Usually, such
schemes partition screen space that is composed of multiple views and adopt
interaction patterns to focus on data-driven items. Widely known concepts as
overview plus-detail and focus-plus-context are ambiguous in interpretation by
means of technical terms. Therefore, their implementation by UI design
practitioners need reviews and a classification of the basic approaches to
visual composition of graphical representation modules. We propose a
description of basic components of the view and focus and an overview of their
multiple combinations.

<p class="mathjax">Graph-related applications have experienced significant growth in academia
and industry, driven by the powerful representation capabilities of graph.
However, efficiently executing these applications faces various challenges,
such as load imbalance, random memory access, etc. To address these challenges,
researchers have proposed various acceleration systems, including software
frameworks and hardware accelerators, all of which incorporate graph
pre-processing (GPP). GPP serves as a preparatory step before the formal
execution of applications, involving techniques such as sampling, reorder, etc.
However, GPP execution often remains overlooked, as the primary focus is
directed towards enhancing graph applications themselves. This oversight is
concerning, especially considering the explosive growth of real-world graph
data, where GPP becomes essential and even dominates system running overhead.
Furthermore, GPP methods exhibit significant variations across devices and
applications due to high customization. Unfortunately, no comprehensive work
systematically summarizes GPP. To address this gap and foster a better
understanding of GPP, we present a comprehensive survey dedicated to this area.
We propose a double-level taxonomy of GPP, considering both algorithmic and
hardware perspectives. Through listing relavent works, we illustrate our
taxonomy and conduct a thorough analysis and summary of diverse GPP techniques.
Lastly, we discuss challenges in GPP and potential future directions.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has led to
the prioritization of standardizing the processing, coding, and transmission of
video using neural networks. To address this priority area, the Moving Picture,
Audio, and Data Coding by Artificial Intelligence (MPAI) group is developing a
suite of standards called MPAI-EEV for "end-to-end optimized neural video
coding." The aim of this AI-based video standard project is to compress the
number of bits required to represent high-fidelity video data by utilizing
data-trained neural coding technologies. This approach is not constrained by
how data coding has traditionally been applied in the context of a hybrid
framework. This paper presents an overview of recent and ongoing
standardization efforts in this area and highlights the key technologies and
design philosophy of EEV. It also provides a comparison and report on some
primary efforts such as the coding efficiency of the reference model.
Additionally, it discusses emerging activities such as learned
Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles (UAVs) video coding which are currently planned, under
development, or in the exploration phase. With a focus on UAV video signals,
this paper addresses the current status of these preliminary efforts. It also
indicates development timelines, summarizes the main technical details, and
provides pointers to further points of reference. The exploration experiment
shows that the EEV model performs better than the state-of-the-art video coding
standard H.266/VVC in terms of perceptual evaluation metric.

<p class="mathjax">We present new supertaggers trained on HPSG-based treebanks. These treebanks
feature high-quality annotation based on a well-developed linguistic theory and
include diverse and challenging test datasets, beyond the usual WSJ section 23
and Wikipedia data. HPSG supertagging has previously relied on MaxEnt-based
models. We use SVM and neural CRF- and BERT-based methods and show that both
SVM and neural supertaggers achieve considerably higher accuracy compared to
the baseline. Our fine-tuned BERT-based tagger achieves 97.26% accuracy on 1000
sentences from WSJ23 and 93.88% on the completely out-of-domain The Cathedral
and the Bazaar (cb)). We conclude that it therefore makes sense to integrate
these new supertaggers into modern HPSG parsers, and we also hope that the
diverse and difficult datasets we used here will gain more popularity in the
field. We contribute the complete dataset reformatted for token classification.

<p class="mathjax">Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for
permutation-based methods.

<p class="mathjax">A recommendation system assists users in finding items that are relevant to
them. Existing recommendation models are primarily based on predicting
relationships between users and items and use complex matching models or
incorporate extensive external information to capture association patterns in
data. However, recommendation is not only a problem of inductive statistics
using data; it is also a cognitive task of reasoning decisions based on
knowledge extracted from information. Hence, a logic system could naturally be
incorporated for the reasoning in a recommendation task. However, although
hard-rule approaches based on logic systems can provide powerful reasoning
ability, they struggle to cope with inconsistent and incomplete knowledge in
real-world tasks, especially for complex tasks such as recommendation.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic recommendation model,
which transforms the user history interactions into a logic expression and then
transforms the recommendation prediction into a query task based on this logic
expression. The logic expressions are then computed based on the modular logic
operations of the neural network. We also construct an implicit logic encoder
to reasonably reduce the complexity of the logic computation. Finally, a user's
interest items can be queried in the vector space based on the computation
results. Experiments on three well-known datasets verified that our method
performs better compared to state of the art shallow, deep, session, and
reasoning models.

<p class="mathjax">Non-autoregressive (non-AR) sequence-to-seqeunce (seq2seq) models for voice
conversion (VC) is attractive in its ability to effectively model the temporal
structure while enjoying boosted intelligibility and fast inference thanks to
non-AR modeling. However, the dependency of current non-AR seq2seq VC models on
ground truth durations extracted from an external AR model greatly limits its
generalization ability to smaller training datasets. In this paper, we first
demonstrate the above-mentioned problem by varying the training data size.
Then, we present AAS-VC, a non-AR seq2seq VC model based on automatic alignment
search (AAS), which removes the dependency on external durations and serves as
a proper inductive bias to provide the required generalization ability for
small datasets. Experimental results show that AAS-VC can generalize better to
a training dataset of only 5 minutes. We also conducted ablation studies to
justify several model design choices. The audio samples and implementation are

<p class="mathjax">Credibility signals represent a wide range of heuristics that are typically
used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content.
Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially
noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We
demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their
role in misinformation detection.

<p class="mathjax">Recently sequential recommendations and next-item prediction task has become
increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two
state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec.
Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing
these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the
publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec
uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative
sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one
negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the
same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform
BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that
SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform
BERT4Rec, but the number of negative examples should be much larger than one.

<p class="mathjax">This letter investigates the application of the emerging fluid antenna (FA)
technology in multiuser communication systems when side information (SI) is
available at the transmitters. In particular, we consider a K-user dirty
multiple access channel (DMAC) with non-causally known SI at the transmitters,
where K users send independent messages to a common receiver with a FA capable
of changing its location depending on the channel condition. By connecting
Jakes' model to copula theory through Spearman's {\rho} rank correlation
coefficient, we accurately describe the spatial correlation between the FA
channels, and derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP)
under Fisher-Snedecor F fading. Numerical results illustrate how considering FA
can improve the performance of multiuser communication systems in terms of the
OP and also support a large number of users using only one FA at the common
receiver in a few wavelengths of space.

<p class="mathjax">The Multimodal Video Search by Examples (MVSE) project investigates using
video clips as the query term for information retrieval, rather than the more
traditional text query. This enables far richer search modalities such as
images, speaker, content, topic, and emotion. A key element for this process is
highly rapid, flexible, search to support large archives, which in MVSE is
facilitated by representing video attributes by embeddings. This work aims to
mitigate any performance loss from this rapid archive search by examining
reranking approaches. In particular, zero-shot reranking methods using large
language models are investigated as these are applicable to any video archive
audio content. Performance is evaluated for topic-based retrieval on a publicly
available video archive, the BBC Rewind corpus. Results demonstrate that
reranking can achieve improved retrieval ranking without the need for any
task-specific training data.

<p class="mathjax">There has been an increasingly widespread agreement among both academic
circles and the general public that the Social Media Platforms (SMPs) play a
central role in the dissemination of harmful and negative sentiment content in
a coordinated manner. A substantial body of recent scholarly research has
demonstrated the ways in which hateful content, political propaganda, and
targeted messaging on SMPs have contributed to serious real-world consequences.
Adopting inspirations from graph theory, in this paper we apply novel network
and community finding algorithms over a representative Facebook dataset
(n=608,417) which we have scrapped through 630 pages. By applying Girvan-Newman
algorithm over the historical dataset our analysis finds five communities of
coordinated networks of actors, within the contexts of Indian far-right
Hindutva discourse. This work further paves the path for future potentials of
applying such novel network analysis algorithms to SMPs, in order to
automatically identify toxic coordinated communities and sub-communities, and
to possibly resist real-world threats emerging from information dissemination
in the SMPs.

<p class="mathjax">The robotic manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is a vital and
challenging task that is important in many practical applications. Classical
model-based approaches to this problem require an accurate model to capture how
robot motions affect the deformation of the DLO. Nowadays, data-driven models
offer the best tradeoff between quality and computation time. This paper
analyzes several learning-based 3D models of the DLO and proposes a new one
based on the Transformer architecture that achieves superior accuracy, even on
the DLOs of different lengths, thanks to the proposed scaling method. Moreover,
we introduce a data augmentation technique, which improves the prediction
performance of almost all considered DLO data-driven models. Thanks to this
technique, even a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves close to
state-of-the-art performance while being significantly faster to evaluate. In
the experiments, we compare the performance of the learning-based 3D models of
the DLO on several challenging datasets quantitatively and demonstrate their
applicability in the task of shaping a DLO.

<p class="mathjax">Community question answering (CQA) forums are Internet-based platforms where
users ask questions about a topic and other expert users try to provide
solutions. Many CQA forums such as Quora, Stackoverflow, Yahoo!Answer,
StackExchange exist with a lot of user-generated data. These data are leveraged
in automated CQA ranking systems where similar questions (and answers) are
presented in response to the query of the user. In this work, we empirically
investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional
features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that
captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer. Secondly,
most of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only
from the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored
extensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly,
using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with
different rank-learning algorithms, some of which have not been used so far in
CQA domain. On three standard CQA datasets, our proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We also analyze importance of the features we use
in our investigation. This work is expected to guide the practitioners to
select a better set of features for the CQA retrieval task.

<p class="mathjax">We study the algebraic complexity of annihilators of polynomials maps. In
particular, when a polynomial map is `encoded by' a small algebraic circuit, we
show that the coefficients of an annihilator of the map can be computed in
PSPACE. Even when the underlying field is that of reals or complex numbers, an
analogous statement is true. We achieve this by using the class VPSPACE that
coincides with computability of coefficients in PSPACE, over integers.
<br />As a consequence, we derive the following two conditional results. First, we
show that a VP-explicit hitting set generator for all of VP would separate
either VP from VNP, or non-uniform P from PSPACE. Second, in relation to
algebraic natural proofs, we show that proving an algebraic natural proofs
barrier would imply either VP $\neq$ VNP or DSPACE($\log^{\log^{\ast}n} n$)
$\not\subset$ P.

language sentence, a caption, that describes the content of an audio recording,
in terms of sound events. Existing datasets provide audio-caption pairs, with
captions written in English only. In this work, we explore multilingual AAC,
using machine translated captions. We translated automatically two prominent
AAC datasets, AudioCaps and Clotho, from English to French, German and Spanish.
We trained and evaluated monolingual systems in the four languages, on
AudioCaps and Clotho. In all cases, the models achieved similar performance,
about 75% CIDEr on AudioCaps and 43% on Clotho. In French, we acquired manual
captions of the AudioCaps eval subset. The French system, trained on the
machine translated version of AudioCaps, achieved significantly better results
on the manual eval subset, compared to the English system for which we
automatically translated the outputs to French. This advocates in favor of
building systems in a target language instead of simply translating to a target
language the English captions from the English system. Finally, we built a
multilingual model, which achieved results in each language comparable to each
monolingual system, while using much less parameters than using a collection of
monolingual systems.

<p class="mathjax">Road disease detection is challenging due to the the small proportion of road
damage in target region and the diverse background,which introduce lots of
domain information.Besides, disease categories have high similarity,makes the
detection more difficult. In this paper, we propose a new LDBFSS(Latent Domain
Background Feature Separation and Suppression) network which could perform
background information separation and suppression without domain supervision
and contrastive enhancement of object features.We combine our LDBFSS network
with YOLOv5 model to enhance disease features for better road disease
detection. As the components of LDBFSS network, we first design a latent domain
discovery module and a domain adversarial learning module to obtain pseudo
domain labels through unsupervised method, guiding domain discriminator and
model to train adversarially to suppress background information. In addition,
we introduce a contrastive learning module and design k-instance contrastive
loss, optimize the disease feature representation by increasing the inter-class
distance and reducing the intra-class distance for object features. We
conducted experiments on two road disease detection datasets, GRDDC and CNRDD,
and compared with other models,which show an increase of nearly 4% on GRDDC
dataset compared with optimal model, and an increase of 4.6% on CNRDD dataset.
Experimental results prove the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances have focused mainly on the resilience of the monoplex network
in attacks targeting random nodes or links, as well as the robustness of the
network against cascading attacks. However, very little research has been done
to investigate the robustness of nodes in multiplex networks against targeted
attacks. In this paper, we first propose a new measure, MultiCoreRank, to
calculate the global influence of nodes in a multiplex network. The measure
models the influence propagation on the core lattice of a multiplex network
after the core decomposition. Then, to study how the structural features can
affect the influence robustness of nodes, we compare the dynamics of node
influence on three types of multiplex networks: assortative, neutral, and
disassortative, where the assortativity is measured by the correlation
coefficient of the degrees of nodes across different layers. We found that
assortative networks have higher resilience against attack than neutral and
disassortative networks. The structure of disassortative networks tends to
break down quicker under attack.

for spike trains is that there are no obvious coordinates for the data. The
Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator does not require coordinates, it relies only on
the distance between data points. In the case of bird song, estimating the
mutual information demonstrates that the information content of spiking does

<p class="mathjax">Traditional approaches for manipulation planning rely on an explicit
geometric model of the environment to formulate a given task as an optimization
problem. However, inferring an accurate model from raw sensor input is a hard
problem in itself, in particular for articulated objects (e.g., closets,
drawers). In this paper, we propose a Neural Field Representation (NFR) of
articulated objects that enables manipulation planning directly from images.
Specifically, after taking a few pictures of a new articulated object, we can
forward simulate its possible movements, and, therefore, use this neural model
directly for planning with trajectory optimization. Additionally, this
representation can be used for shape reconstruction, semantic segmentation and
image rendering, which provides a strong supervision signal during training and
generalization. We show that our model, which was trained only on synthetic
images, is able to extract a meaningful representation for unseen objects of
the same class, both in simulation and with real images. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the representation enables robotic manipulation of an
articulated object in the real world directly from images.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily trained on text-based datasets,
exhibit exceptional proficiencies in understanding and executing complex
linguistic instructions via text outputs. However, they falter when requests to
generate non-text ones. Concurrently, modality conversion models, such as
text-to-image, despite generating high-quality images, suffer from a lack of
extensive textual pretraining. As a result, these models are only capable of
accommodating specific image descriptions rather than comprehending more
complex instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach,
\methodname, from a modality conversion perspective that evolves a text-based
LLM into a multi-modal one. We specifically employ a minimal dataset to
instruct LLMs to recognize the intended output modality as directed by the
instructions. Consequently, the adapted LLM can effectively summon various
off-the-shelf modality conversion models from the model zoos to generate
non-text responses. This circumvents the necessity for complicated pretraining
that typically requires immense quantities of paired multi-modal data, while
simultaneously inheriting the extensive knowledge of LLMs and the ability of
high-quality generative models. To evaluate and compare the adapted multi-modal
LLM with its traditional counterparts, we have constructed a multi-modal
instruction benchmark that solicits diverse modality outputs. The experiment
results reveal that, with minimal training, LLMs can be conveniently adapted to

<p class="mathjax">Despite the success of neural models in solving reasoning tasks, their
compositional generalization capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we
propose a new setting of the structured explanation generation task to
facilitate compositional reasoning research. Previous works found that symbolic
methods achieve superior compositionality by using pre-defined inference rules
for iterative reasoning. But these approaches rely on brittle symbolic
transfers and are restricted to well-defined tasks. Hence, we propose a dynamic
modularized reasoning model, MORSE, to improve the compositional generalization
of neural models. MORSE factorizes the inference process into a combination of
modules, where each module represents a functional unit. Specifically, we adopt
modularized self-attention to dynamically select and route inputs to dedicated
heads, which specializes them to specific functions. We conduct experiments for
increasing lengths and shapes of reasoning trees on two benchmarks to test
MORSE's compositional generalization abilities, and find it outperforms
competitive baselines. Model ablation and deeper analyses show the
effectiveness of dynamic reasoning modules and their generalization abilities.

<p class="mathjax">As the landscape of devices that interact with the electrical grid expands,
also the complexity of the scenarios that arise from these interactions
increases. Validation methods and tools are typically domain specific and are
designed to approach mainly component level testing. For this kind of
applications, software and hardware-in-the-loop based simulations as well as
lab experiments are all tools that allow testing with different degrees of
accuracy at various stages in the development life-cycle. However, things are
vastly different when analysing the tools and the methodology available for
performing system-level validation. Until now there are no available
well-defined approaches for testing complex use cases involving components from
different domains. Smart grid applications would typically include a relatively
large number of physical devices, software components, as well as communication
technology, all working hand in hand. This paper explores the possibilities
that are opened in terms of testing by the integration of a real-time simulator
into co-simulation environments. Three practical implementations of such
systems together with performance metrics are discussed. Two control-related
examples are selected in order to show the capabilities of the proposed
approach.

<p class="mathjax">In this contribution, we are concerned with model order reduction in the
context of iterative regularization methods for the solution of inverse
problems arising from parameter identification in elliptic partial differential
equations. Such methods typically require a large number of forward solutions,
which makes the use of the reduced basis method attractive to reduce
computational complexity. However, the considered inverse problems are
typically ill-posed due to their infinite-dimensional parameter space.
Moreover, the infinite-dimensional parameter space makes it impossible to build
and certify classical reduced-order models efficiently in a so-called "offline
phase". We thus propose a new algorithm that adaptively builds a reduced
parameter space in the online phase. The enrichment of the reduced parameter
space is naturally inherited from the Tikhonov regularization within an
iteratively regularized Gau{\ss}-Newton method. Finally, the adaptive parameter
space reduction is combined with a certified reduced basis state space
reduction within an adaptive error-aware trust region framework. Numerical
experiments are presented to show the efficiency of the combined parameter and
state space reduction for inverse parameter identification problems with
distributed reaction or diffusion coefficients.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the impact of complex excitation errors of the
chamber array antenna on the accuracy of the test zone of a random
line-of-sight over-the-air testing setup. First, several combinations of
compact chamber arrays of lengths L and short distances D between the test zone
and the chamber array, which emulate a plane wave impinging at the test zone
are obtained. The chamber array is linear and uniform with 100 antenna
elements, and a linear taper was applied to some of the elements to emulate a
plane wave impinging at the test zone with more compact setups. A subset of L
and D was chosen, providing compact over-the-air test setups that fulfilled the
defined figures of merit, which assess the similarity of the obtained field
distribution to that of a plane wave. The tolerance of the chosen setups to
complex excitation errors of the chamber array was then investigated,
concluding that these errors must be considered when defining appropriate L and
D combinations. Moreover, the performance of the matched filter and
zero-forcing algorithms is evaluated for errors of the device under test array
weighting coefficients. A random line-of-sight over-the-air testing setup with
two arrays was simulated, where one of the arrays emulated the desired signal
and the other emulated the interference, observing that the errors were more
significant at higher signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, the zero-forcing
algorithm was more sensitive to errors than the matched filter, which was
expected since the accuracy of the former for interference suppression is
critical.

<p class="mathjax">The transition to the smart grid introduces complexity to the design and
operation of electric power systems. This complexity has the potential to
result in safety-related losses that are caused, for example, by unforeseen
interactions between systems and cyber-attacks. Consequently, it is important
to identify potential losses and their root causes, ideally during system
design. This is non-trivial and requires a systematic approach. Furthermore,
due to complexity, it may not possible to reason about the circumstances that
could lead to a loss; in this case, experiments are required. In this work, we
present how two complementary deductive approaches can be usefully integrated
to address these concerns: Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a
systems approach to identifying safety-related hazard scenarios; and the
ERIGrid Holistic Test Description (HTD) provides a structured approach to
refine and document experiments. The intention of combining these approaches is
to enable a systematic approach to hazard analysis whose findings can be
experimentally tested. We demonstrate the use of this approach with a reactive
power voltage control case study for a low voltage distribution network.

<p class="mathjax">The electrical power network is gradually migrating from a centralized
generation approach to a decentralized generation with high shares of renewable
energy sources (RES). However, power systems with low shares of synchronous
generation and consequently low total system inertia, are vulnerable to power
imbalances. Such systems can experience frequency stability problems, such as
high frequency excursions and higher rates of change of frequency even under
small disturbances. This phenomenon is intensified when the grid under
investigation has low or no interconnections (islanded) and thus the challenge
for stable operation becomes more significant for the operators. This work
focuses on how the frequency stability is affected when a photovoltaic (PV)
inverter is integrated into a real non-interconnected distribution grid in
Cyprus. In order to capture the realistic interactions of this integration,
stability experiments in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment are performed
with the aim to provide insightful results for the grid operator.

<p class="mathjax">Offline evolutionary-based methodologies have supplied a successful motion
planning framework for the quadrupedal jump. However, the time-consuming
computation caused by massive population evolution in offline
evolutionary-based jumping framework significantly limits the popularity in the
quadrupedal field. This paper presents a time-friendly online motion planning
framework based on meta-heuristic Differential evolution (DE), Latin hypercube
sampling, and Configuration space (DLC). The DLC framework establishes a
multidimensional optimization problem leveraging centroidal dynamics to
determine the ideal trajectory of the center of mass (CoM) and ground reaction
forces (GRFs). The configuration space is introduced to the evolutionary
optimization in order to condense the searching region. Latin hypercube
sampling offers more uniform initial populations of DE under limited sampling
points, accelerating away from a local minimum. This research also constructs a
collection of pre-motion trajectories as a warm start when the objective state
is in the neighborhood of the pre-motion state to drastically reduce the
solving time. The proposed methodology is successfully validated via real robot
experiments for online jumping trajectory optimization with different jumping
motions (e.g., ordinary jumping, flipping, and spinning).

environments and servers alike. The burgeoning ecosystem of WebAssembly
compilers and tools lacks robust software diversification systems. We introduce
WASM-MUTATE, a compiler-agnostic WebAssembly diversification engine. It is
engineered to fulfill the following key criteria: 1) the rapid generation of
semantically equivalent yet behaviorally diverse WebAssembly variants, 2)
universal applicability to any WebAssembly programs regardless of the source
programming language, and 3) the capability to counter high-risk security
threats. Utilizing an e-graph data structure, WASM-MUTATE is both fast and
effective. Our experiments reveal that WASM-MUTATE can efficiently generate
tens of thousands of unique WebAssembly variants in a matter of minutes.
Notably, WASM-MUTATE can protect WebAssembly binaries against timing
side-channel attacks, specifically, Spectre.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Code Completion Tools (NCCTs) have reshaped the field of software
development, which accurately suggest contextually-relevant code snippets
benefiting from language modeling techniques. However, language models may emit
the training data verbatim during inference with appropriate prompts. This
memorization property raises privacy concerns of commercial NCCTs about the
hard-coded credential leakage, leading to unauthorized access to systems.
Therefore, to answer whether NCCTs will inadvertently emit the hard-coded
credential, we propose an evaluation tool called Hard-coded Credential Revealer
(HCR). HCR effectively constructs test prompts from GitHub code files with
credentials to trigger memorization phenomenon of commercial NCCTs. Then, HCR
extracts credentials with pre-defined format from the responses by four
designed filters. We apply HCR to evaluate two representative commercial NCCTs:
GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer and successfully extracted 2,702
hard-coded credentials from Copilot and 129 secrets from CodeWhisper under the
black-box setting, among which at least 3.6% and 5.4% secrets are real strings
from GitHub repositories. Moreover, two operational credentials were
identified. The experimental results raise the severe privacy concern of the
potential leakage of hard-coded credentials in the training data of commercial
NCCTs.

<p class="mathjax">The reconstruction of indoor scenes from multi-view RGB images is challenging
due to the coexistence of flat and texture-less regions alongside delicate and
fine-grained regions. Recent methods leverage neural radiance fields aided by
predicted surface normal priors to recover the scene geometry. These methods
excel in producing complete and smooth results for floor and wall areas.
However, they struggle to capture complex surfaces with high-frequency
structures due to the inadequate neural representation and the inaccurately
predicted normal priors. To improve the capacity of the implicit
representation, we propose a hybrid architecture to represent low-frequency and
high-frequency regions separately. To enhance the normal priors, we introduce a
simple yet effective image sharpening and denoising technique, coupled with a
network that estimates the pixel-wise uncertainty of the predicted surface
normal vectors. Identifying such uncertainty can prevent our model from being
misled by unreliable surface normal supervisions that hinder the accurate
reconstruction of intricate geometries. Experiments on the benchmark datasets
show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
reconstruction quality.

of data visualization, automatic data visualization generation from natural

we propose a Chinese Text-to-Vis dataset in the paper and demonstrate our first

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present methodologies for optimal selection for renewable
energy sites under a different set of constraints and objectives. We consider
two different models for the site-selection problem - coarse-grained and
fine-grained, and analyze them to find solutions. We consider multiple
different ways to measure the benefits of setting up a site. We provide
approximation algorithms with a guaranteed performance bound for two different
benefit metrics with the coarse-grained model. For the fine-grained model, we
provide a technique utilizing Integer Linear Program to find the optimal
solution. We present the results of our extensive experimentation with
synthetic data generated from sparsely available real data from solar farms in
Arizona.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating the head pose of a person is a crucial problem for numerous
applications that is yet mainly addressed as a subtask of frontal pose
prediction. We present a novel method for unconstrained end-to-end head pose
estimation to tackle the challenging task of full range of orientation head
pose prediction. We address the issue of ambiguous rotation labels by
introducing the rotation matrix formalism for our ground truth data and propose
a continuous 6D rotation matrix representation for efficient and robust direct
regression. This allows to efficiently learn full rotation appearance and to
overcome the limitations of the current state-of-the-art. Together with new
accumulated training data that provides full head pose rotation data and a
geodesic loss approach for stable learning, we design an advanced model that is
able to predict an extended range of head orientations. An extensive evaluation
on public datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in an efficient and robust manner, while its advanced
prediction range allows the expansion of the application area. We open-source
our training and testing code along with our trained models:

<p class="mathjax">Scientists have built a variety of covert channels for secretive information
transmission with CPU cache and main memory. In this paper, we turn to a lower
level in the memory hierarchy, i.e., persistent storage. Most programs store
intermediate or eventual results in the form of files and some of them call
fsync to synchronously persist a file with storage device for orderly
persistence. Our quantitative study shows that one program would undergo
significantly longer response time for fsync call if the other program is
concurrently calling fsync, although they do not share any data. We further
find that, concurrent fsync calls contend at multiple levels of storage stack
due to sharing software structures (e.g., Ext4's journal) and hardware
resources (e.g., disk's I/O dispatch queue).
<br />We accordingly build a covert channel named Sync+Sync. Sync+Sync delivers a
transmission bandwidth of 20,000 bits per second at an error rate of about
0.40% with an ordinary solid-state drive. Sync+Sync can be conducted in
cross-disk partition, cross-file system, cross-container, cross-virtual
machine, and even cross-disk drive fashions, without sharing data between
programs. Next, we launch side-channel attacks with Sync+Sync and manage to
precisely detect operations of a victim database (e.g., insert/update and
B-Tree node split). We also leverage Sync+Sync to distinguish applications and
websites with high accuracy by detecting and analyzing their fsync frequencies
and flushed data volumes. These attacks are useful to support further
fine-grained information leakage.

<p class="mathjax">We explore the use of neural synthesis for acoustic guitar from string-wise
MIDI input. We propose four different systems and compare them with both
objective metrics and subjective evaluation against natural audio and a
sample-based baseline. We iteratively develop these four systems by making
various considerations on the architecture and intermediate tasks, such as
predicting pitch and loudness control features. We find that formulating the
control feature prediction task as a classification task rather than a
regression task yields better results. Furthermore, we find that our simplest
proposed system, which directly predicts synthesis parameters from MIDI input
performs the best out of the four proposed systems. Audio examples are

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider the intersection of two problems in machine
learning: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) and Dataset Distillation (DD).
On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled
source domains to an unlabeled target domain. On the other hand, the second
attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD
method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem
on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous
Stirred Tank Reactor, and Case Western Reserve University), where we show that,
even with as little as 1 sample per class, one achieves state-of-the-art
adaptation performance.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods enable high-quality novel-view
synthesis for multi-view images. This work presents a method for synthesizing
colorized novel views from input grey-scale multi-view images. When we apply
image or video-based colorization methods on the generated grey-scale novel
views, we observe artifacts due to inconsistency across views. Training a
radiance field network on the colorized grey-scale image sequence also does not
solve the 3D consistency issue. We propose a distillation based method to
transfer color knowledge from the colorization networks trained on natural
images to the radiance field network. Specifically, our method uses the
radiance field network as a 3D representation and transfers knowledge from
existing 2D colorization methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method produces superior colorized novel views for indoor and outdoor
scenes while maintaining cross-view consistency than baselines. Further, we
show the efficacy of our method on applications like colorization of radiance
field network trained from 1.) Infra-Red (IR) multi-view images and 2.) Old
grey-scale multi-view image sequences.

<p class="mathjax">The low-voltage ride-through service is carried out in this paper according
to the voltage profile described by the IEC 61400-21 European normative when
short-duration voltage sags happen, and some instantaneous reactive power is
delivered to the grid in accordance with the Spanish grid code; the mandatory
limitation of the amplitude of the three-phase inverter currents to its nominal
value is carried out with a novel control strategy, in which a certain amount
of instantaneous constant active power can also be delivered to the grid when
small or moderate voltage sags happen. A Multiple second order generalized
integrator frequency-locked loop synchronization algorithm is employed in order
to estimate the system frequency without harmonic distortions, as well as to
output the positive- and the negative- sequence of the {\alpha}\b{eta}
quantities of the three-phase grid voltages when balanced and unbalanced
voltage sags happen in a frequency-adaptive scheme. The current control is
carried out in the stationary reference frame, which guarantees the
cancellation of the harmonic distortions in the utility grid currents using a
Harmonic compensation structure, and the implementation of a constant active
power control in order to protect the DC link capacitor from thermal stresses
avoiding the appearance of large harmonic distortions at twice the fundamental
frequency in the DC link voltage. A case study of a three-phase single-stage
grid-connected PV system with a maximum apparent power about 500 kVA is tested
with several simulations using MATLAB/SIMULINK firstly, and secondly, with some
experiments using the Controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation
technique for several types of voltage sags in order to do the final validation
of the control algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, we propose an approach for federated domain adaptation, a
setting where distributional shift exists among clients and some have unlabeled
data. The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through
dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients'
distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a
federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon
the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative
communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep
clients' data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its
centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive
experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks.
Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other
benchmarks in federated domain adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Unveiling the underlying governing equations of nonlinear dynamic systems
remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy
observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER,
a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential
equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through
two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering
phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided
hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree
structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response
and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior
fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and
the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The
embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering
process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training.
The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational
graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical
experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing
equations from nonlinear dynamic systems with limited and highly noisy data and
outperform other physics-informed neural network-based discovery methods. This
work opens new potential for exploring real-world systems with limited
understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for
goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and
transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as
they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously
discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that
abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar
roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns
both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses
symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the
transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.
We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned
representation is interpretable, transferrable and results in data efficient
learning.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel evaluation approach to text-based speaker
diarization (SD), tackling the limitations of traditional metrics that do not
account for any contextual information in text. Two new metrics are proposed,
Text-based Diarization Error Rate and Diarization F1, which perform utterance-
and word-level evaluations by aligning tokens in reference and hypothesis
transcripts. Our metrics encompass more types of errors compared to existing
ones, allowing us to make a more comprehensive analysis in SD. To align tokens,
a multiple sequence alignment algorithm is introduced that supports multiple
sequences in the reference while handling high-dimensional alignment to the
hypothesis using dynamic programming. Our work is packaged into two tools,
align4d providing an API for our alignment algorithm and TranscribeView for
visualizing and evaluating SD errors, which can greatly aid in the creation of
high-quality data, fostering the advancement of dialogue systems.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational recommender systems (CRS) generate recommendations through an
interactive process. However, not all CRS approaches use human conversations as
their source of interaction data; the majority of prior CRS work simulates
interactions by exchanging entity-level information. As a result, claims of
prior CRS work do not generalise to real-world settings where conversations
take unexpected turns, or where conversational and intent understanding is not
perfect. To tackle this challenge, the research community has started to
examine holistic CRS, which are trained using conversational data collected
from real-world scenarios. Despite their emergence, such holistic approaches
are under-explored.
<br />We present a comprehensive survey of holistic CRS methods by summarizing the
literature in a structured manner. Our survey recognises holistic CRS
approaches as having three components: 1) a backbone language model, the
optional use of 2) external knowledge, and/or 3) external guidance. We also
give a detailed analysis of CRS datasets and evaluation methods in real
application scenarios. We offer our insight as to the current challenges of
holistic CRS and possible future trends.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI models garnered a large amount of public attention and
speculation with the release of OpenAIs chatbot, ChatGPT. At least two opinion
camps exist: one excited about possibilities these models offer for fundamental
changes to human tasks, and another highly concerned about power these models
seem to have. To address these concerns, we assessed GPT3.5 using standard,
normed, and validated cognitive and personality measures. For this seedling
project, we developed a battery of tests that allowed us to estimate the
boundaries of some of these models capabilities, how stable those capabilities
are over a short period of time, and how they compare to humans.
<br />Our results indicate that GPT 3.5 is unlikely to have developed sentience,
although its ability to respond to personality inventories is interesting. It
did display large variability in both cognitive and personality measures over
repeated observations, which is not expected if it had a human-like
personality. Variability notwithstanding, GPT3.5 displays what in a human would
be considered poor mental health, including low self-esteem and marked
dissociation from reality despite upbeat and helpful responses.

deep neural network that can solve fractional differential equations
accurately. A Gaussian integration rule and a $L_1$ discretization technique
are used in the proposed design. In each equation, a deep neural network is
used to approximate the unknown function. Three forms of fractional
differential equations have been examined to highlight the method's
versatility: a fractional ordinary differential equation, a fractional order

<p class="mathjax">The Chisholm rational approximant is a natural generalization to two
variables of the well-known single variable Pad\'e approximant, and has the
advantage of reducing to the latter when one of the variables is set equals to
0. We present, to our knowledge, the first automated Mathematica package to
evaluate diagonal Chisholm approximants of two variable series. For the moment,
the package can only be used to evaluate diagonal approximants i.e. the maximum
powers of both the variables, in both the numerator and the denominator, is
equal to some integer $M$. We further modify the original method so as to allow
us to evaluate the approximants around some general point $(x,y)$ not
necessarily $(0,0)$. Using the approximants around general point $(x,y)$,
allows us to get a better estimate of the result when the point of evaluation
is far from $(0,0)$. Several examples of the elementary functions have been
studied which shows that the approximants can be useful for analytic
continuation and convergence acceleration purposes. We continue our study using
various examples of two variable hypergeometric series,
$\mathrm{Li}_{2,2}(x,y)$ etc that arise in particle physics and in the study of
critical phenomena in condensed matter physics. The demonstration of the
package is discussed in detail and the Mathematica package is provided as an
ancillary file.

generative language models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), have brought about
various benefits by generating fluent human-like text, the task of

<p class="mathjax">Robot-assisted surgery is rapidly developing in the medical field, and the
integration of augmented reality shows the potential of improving the surgeons'
operation performance by providing more visual information. In this paper, we
proposed a markerless augmented reality framework to enhance safety by avoiding
intra-operative bleeding which is a high risk caused by the collision between
the surgical instruments and the blood vessel. Advanced stereo reconstruction
and segmentation networks are compared to find out the best combination to
reconstruct the intra-operative blood vessel in the 3D space for the
registration of the pre-operative model, and the minimum distance detection
between the instruments and the blood vessel is implemented. A robot-assisted
lymphadenectomy is simulated on the da Vinci Research Kit in a dry lab, and ten
human subjects performed this operation to explore the usability of the
proposed framework. The result shows that the augmented reality framework can
help the users to avoid the dangerous collision between the instruments and the
blood vessel while not introducing an extra load. It provides a flexible
framework that integrates augmented reality into the medical robot platform to
enhance safety during the operation.

<p class="mathjax">While the recently introduced Tree of Thoughts (ToT) has heralded
advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through
foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the
inherent local uncertainties in intermediate decision points or "thoughts".
These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse
responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing
this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a
reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse
local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty
quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's
precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous
experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.
The empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and
chain-of-thought prompting methods.

<p class="mathjax">Dataset condensation aims to condense a large dataset with a lot of training
samples into a small set. Previous methods usually condense the dataset into
the pixels format. However, it suffers from slow optimization speed and large
number of parameters to be optimized. When increasing image resolutions and
classes, the number of learnable parameters grows accordingly, prohibiting
condensation methods from scaling up to large datasets with diverse classes.
Moreover, the relations among condensed samples have been neglected and hence
the feature distribution of condensed samples is often not diverse. To solve
these problems, we propose to condense the dataset into another format, a
generative model. Such a novel format allows for the condensation of large
datasets because the size of the generative model remains relatively stable as
the number of classes or image resolution increases. Furthermore, an
intra-class and an inter-class loss are proposed to model the relation of
condensed samples. Intra-class loss aims to create more diverse samples for
each class by pushing each sample away from the others of the same class.
Meanwhile, inter-class loss increases the discriminability of samples by
widening the gap between the centers of different classes. Extensive
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and our ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of our method and its individual component. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to successfully conduct condensation on
ImageNet-1k.

<p class="mathjax">Decoding language from neural signals holds considerable theoretical and
practical importance. Previous research has indicated the feasibility of
decoding text or speech from invasive neural signals. However, when using
non-invasive neural signals, significant challenges are encountered due to
their low quality. In this study, we proposed a data-driven approach for
decoding semantic of language from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals
recorded while subjects were listening to continuous speech. First, a
multi-subject decoding model was trained using contrastive learning to
reconstruct continuous word embeddings from MEG data. Subsequently, a beam
search algorithm was adopted to generate text sequences based on the
reconstructed word embeddings. Given a candidate sentence in the beam, a
language model was used to predict the subsequent words. The word embeddings of
the subsequent words were correlated with the reconstructed word embedding.
These correlations were then used as a measure of the probability for the next
word. The results showed that the proposed continuous word embedding model can
effectively leverage both subject-specific and subject-shared information.
Additionally, the decoded text exhibited significant similarity to the target
text, with an average BERTScore of 0.816, a score comparable to that in the
previous fMRI study.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence models and methods commonly lack causal
interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved
interpretability in domains involving causation.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate dietary intake estimation is critical for informing policies and
programs to support healthy eating, as malnutrition has been directly linked to
decreased quality of life. However self-reporting methods such as food diaries
suffer from substantial bias. Other conventional dietary assessment techniques
and emerging alternative approaches such as mobile applications incur high time
costs and may necessitate trained personnel. Recent work has focused on using
computer vision and machine learning to automatically estimate dietary intake
from food images, but the lack of comprehensive datasets with diverse
viewpoints, modalities and food annotations hinders the accuracy and realism of
such methods. To address this limitation, we introduce NutritionVerse-Synth,
the first large-scale dataset of 84,984 photorealistic synthetic 2D food images
with associated dietary information and multimodal annotations (including depth
images, instance masks, and semantic masks). Additionally, we collect a real
image dataset, NutritionVerse-Real, containing 889 images of 251 dishes to
evaluate realism. Leveraging these novel datasets, we develop and benchmark
NutritionVerse, an empirical study of various dietary intake estimation
approaches, including indirect segmentation-based and direct prediction
networks. We further fine-tune models pretrained on synthetic data with real
images to provide insights into the fusion of synthetic and real data. Finally,
we release both datasets (NutritionVerse-Synth, NutritionVerse-Real) on
https://www.kaggle.com/nutritionverse/datasets as part of an open initiative to
accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.

<p class="mathjax">Learning a recommender system model from an item's raw modality features
(such as image, text, audio, etc.), called MoRec, has attracted growing
interest recently. One key advantage of MoRec is that it can easily benefit
from advances in other fields, such as natural language processing (NLP) and
computer vision (CV). Moreover, it naturally supports transfer learning across
different systems through modality features, known as transferable recommender
systems, or TransRec.
<br />However, so far, TransRec has made little progress, compared to
groundbreaking foundation models in the fields of NLP and CV. The lack of
large-scale, high-quality recommendation datasets poses a major obstacle. To
this end, we introduce NineRec, a TransRec dataset suite that includes a
large-scale source domain recommendation dataset and nine diverse target domain
recommendation datasets. Each item in NineRec is represented by a text
description and a high-resolution cover image. With NineRec, we can implement
TransRec models in an end-to-end training manner instead of using pre-extracted
invariant features. We conduct a benchmark study and empirical analysis of
TransRec using NineRec, and our findings provide several valuable insights. To
support further research, we make our code, datasets, benchmarks, and
leaderboards publicly available at
https://github.com/anonymous?ninerec/NineRec.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale self-supervised pre-trained speech encoders outperform
conventional approaches in speech recognition and translation tasks. Due to the
high cost of developing these large models, building new encoders for new tasks
and deploying them to on-device applications are infeasible. Prior studies
propose model compression methods to address this issue, but those works focus
on smaller models and less realistic tasks. Thus, we propose Contrastive
Layer-to-layer Distillation (CoLLD), a novel knowledge distillation method to
compress pre-trained speech encoders by leveraging masked prediction and
contrastive learning to train student models to copy the behavior of a large
teacher model. CoLLD outperforms prior methods and closes the gap between small
and large models on multilingual speech-to-text translation and recognition
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Financial simulators play an important role in enhancing forecasting
accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making.
Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing
frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We
pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context
labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with
context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other
modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned,
high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To
address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual
Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as
context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear
regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii)
we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an
autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge
transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that
Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives.
In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we
prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training
stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment,
fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate
Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and
showcase superior performance in comparison to 4 state-of-the-art time-series
generative models.

<p class="mathjax">Telemanipulation has become a promising technology that combines human
intelligence with robotic capabilities to perform tasks remotely. However, it
faces several challenges such as insufficient transparency, low immersion, and
limited feedback to the human operator. Moreover, the high cost of haptic
interfaces is a major limitation for the application of telemanipulation in
various fields, including elder care, where our research is focused. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes the usage of nonlinear model predictive
control for telemanipulation using low-cost virtual reality controllers,
including multiple control goals in the objective function. The framework
utilizes models for human input prediction and taskrelated models of the robot
and the environment. The proposed framework is validated on an UR5e robot arm
in the scenario of handling liquid without spilling. Further extensions of the
framework such as pouring assistance and collision avoidance can easily be
included.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the many successful applications of deep learning models for
multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks
process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The
intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned
from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In
contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of
vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.
Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust
training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad
framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this
context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued
models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains
the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.
Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing
restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between
feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued
neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as
real-valued networks.

<p class="mathjax">The phonological discrepancies between a speaker's native (L1) and the
non-native language (L2) serves as a major factor for mispronunciation. This
paper introduces a novel multilingual MDD architecture, L1-MultiMDD, enriched
with L1-aware speech representation. An end-to-end speech encoder is trained on
the input signal and its corresponding reference phoneme sequence. First, an
attention mechanism is deployed to align the input audio with the reference
phoneme sequence. Afterwards, the L1-L2-speech embedding are extracted from an
auxiliary model, pretrained in a multi-task setup identifying L1 and L2
language, and are infused with the primary network. Finally, the L1-MultiMDD is
then optimized for a unified multilingual phoneme recognition task using
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss for the target languages:
English, Arabic, and Mandarin. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed L1-MultiMDD framework on both seen -- L2-ARTIC, LATIC, and
AraVoiceL2v2; and unseen -- EpaDB and Speechocean762 datasets. The consistent
gains in PER, and false rejection rate (FRR) across all target languages
confirm our approach's robustness, efficacy, and generalizability.

<p class="mathjax">Inferential decision-making algorithms typically assume that an underlying
probabilistic model of decision alternatives and outcomes may be learned a
priori or online. Furthermore, when applied to robots in real-world settings
they often perform unsatisfactorily or fail to accomplish the necessary tasks
because this assumption is violated and/or they experience unanticipated
external pressures and constraints. Cognitive studies presented in this and
other papers show that humans cope with complex and unknown settings by
modulating between near-optimal and satisficing solutions, including
heuristics, by leveraging information value of available environmental cues
that are possibly redundant. Using the benchmark inferential decision problem
known as ``treasure hunt", this paper develops a general approach for
investigating and modeling active perception solutions under pressure. By
simulating treasure hunt problems in virtual worlds, our approach learns
generalizable strategies from high performers that, when applied to robots,
allow them to modulate between optimal and heuristic solutions on the basis of
external pressures and probabilistic models, if and when available. The result
is a suite of active perception algorithms for camera-equipped robots that
outperform treasure-hunt solutions obtained via cell decomposition, information
roadmap, and information potential algorithms, in both high-fidelity numerical
simulations and physical experiments. The effectiveness of the new active
perception strategies is demonstrated under a broad range of unanticipated
conditions that cause existing algorithms to fail to complete the search for
treasures, such as unmodelled time constraints, resource constraints, and
adverse weather (fog).

few prior studies have begun to unpack the organizational practices of the
security awareness teams tasked with executing program transformation. We
conducted a year-long case study of a security awareness program in a United
States (U.S.) government agency, collecting data via field observations,

involved in the progression of a security awareness program from being
compliance-focused to emphasizing impact on workforce attitudes and behaviors.
We uniquely capture transformational organizational security awareness
practices in action via a longitudinal study involving multiple workforce

<p class="mathjax">Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can promote
grounding instructions to robotic task planning. Despite the progress, most
existing works focused on utilizing raw images to help LLMs understand
environmental information, which not only limits the observation scope but also
typically requires massive multimodal data collection and large-scale models.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Graph-based Robotic
Instruction Decomposer (GRID), leverages scene graph instead of image to
perceive global scene information and continuously plans subtask in each stage
for a given instruction. Our method encodes object attributes and relationships
in graphs through an LLM and Graph Attention Networks, integrating instruction
features to predict subtasks consisting of pre-defined robot actions and target
objects in the scene graph. This strategy enables robots to acquire semantic
knowledge widely observed in the environment from the scene graph. To train and
evaluate GRID, we build a dataset construction pipeline to generate synthetic
datasets in graph-based robotic task planning. Experiments have shown that our
method outperforms GPT-4 by over 25.4% in subtask accuracy and 43.6% in task
accuracy. Experiments conducted on datasets of unseen scenes and scenes with
different numbers of objects showed that the task accuracy of GRID declined by
at most 3.8%, which demonstrates its good cross-scene generalization ability.
We validate our method in both physical simulation and the real world.

<p class="mathjax">The meanings of words and phrases depend not only on where they are used
(contexts) but also on who use them (writers). Pretrained language models
(PLMs) are powerful tools for capturing context, but they are typically
pretrained and fine-tuned for universal use across different writers. This
study aims to improve the accuracy of text understanding tasks by personalizing
the fine-tuning of PLMs for specific writers. We focus on a general setting
where only the plain text from target writers are available for
personalization. To avoid the cost of fine-tuning and storing multiple copies
of PLMs for different users, we exhaustively explore using writer-specific
prompts to personalize a unified PLM. Since the design and evaluation of these
prompts is an underdeveloped area, we introduce and compare different types of
prompts that are possible in our setting. To maximize the potential of
prompt-based personalized fine-tuning, we propose a personalized intermediate
learning based on masked language modeling to extract task-independent traits
of writers' text. Our experiments, using multiple tasks, datasets, and PLMs,
reveal the nature of different prompts and the effectiveness of our
intermediate learning approach.

<p class="mathjax">In everyday life collaboration tasks between human operators and robots, the
former necessitate simple ways for programming new skills, the latter have to
show adaptive capabilities to cope with environmental changes. The joint use of
visual servoing and imitation learning allows us to pursue the objective of
realizing friendly robotic interfaces that (i) are able to adapt to the
environment thanks to the use of visual perception and (ii) avoid explicit
programming thanks to the emulation of previous demonstrations. This work aims
to exploit imitation learning for the visual servoing paradigm to address the
specific problem of tracking moving objects. In particular, we show that it is
possible to infer from data the compensation term required for realizing the
tracking controller, avoiding the explicit implementation of estimators or
observers. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through
simulations with a robotic manipulator.

<p class="mathjax">Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) are predominantly used for
underwater environments and find applications in many areas. However, a lack of
security considerations, the unstable and challenging nature of the underwater
environment, and the resource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes used for
UW-ASNs (which makes them incapable of adopting security primitives) make the
UW-ASN prone to vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an Adaptive decentralised
Intrusion Detection and Prevention System called AIDPS for UW-ASNs. The
proposed AIDPS can improve the security of the UW-ASNs so that they can
efficiently detect underwater-related attacks (e.g., blackhole, grayhole and
flooding attacks). To determine the most effective configuration of the
proposed construction, we conduct a number of experiments using several
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., Adaptive Random Forest
(ARF), light gradient-boosting machine, and K-nearest neighbours) and concept
drift detection algorithms (e.g., ADWIN, kdqTree, and Page-Hinkley). Our
experimental results show that incremental ARF using ADWIN provides optimal
performance when implemented with One-class support vector machine (SVM)
anomaly-based detectors. Furthermore, our extensive evaluation results also
show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art bench-marking
methods while providing a wider range of desirable features such as scalability
and complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) have provided new insights into how
models for vision, language, and tabular data operate. However, few approaches
exist for understanding speech models. Existing work focuses on a few spoken
language understanding (SLU) tasks, and explanations are difficult to interpret
for most users. We introduce a new approach to explain speech classification
models. We generate easy-to-interpret explanations via input perturbation on
two information levels. 1) Word-level explanations reveal how each word-related
audio segment impacts the outcome. 2) Paralinguistic features (e.g., prosody
and background noise) answer the counterfactual: ``What would the model
prediction be if we edited the audio signal in this way?'' We validate our
approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models on two speech
classification tasks in English and Italian. Our findings demonstrate that the
explanations are faithful to the model's inner workings and plausible to
humans. Our method and findings pave the way for future research on
interpreting speech models.

<p class="mathjax">The physical layer authentication (PLA) is a promising technology which can
enhance the access security of a massive number of devices in the near future.
In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
PLA system, in which the legitimate transmitter can customize the channel
fingerprints during PLA by controlling the ON-OFF state of the RIS. Without
loss of generality, we use the received signal strength (RSS) based spoofing
detection approach to analyze the feasibility of the proposed architecture.
Specifically, based on the RSS, we derive the statistical properties of PLA and
give some interesting insights, which showcase that the RIS-assisted PLA is
theoretically feasible. Then, we derive the optimal detection threshold to
maximize the performance in the context of the presented performance metrics.
Next, the actual feasibility of the proposed system is verified via
proof-of-concept experiments on a RIS-assisted PLA prototype platform. The
experiment results show that there are 3.5% and 76% performance improvements
when the transmission sources are at different locations and at the same
location, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the performance of vehicleto-vehicle (V2V)
communications assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and a
simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent omni-surface (STAR-IOS)
under nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
schemes. In particular, we consider that the RIS is close to the transmitter
vehicle while the STAR-IOS is near the receiver vehicles. In addition, we
assume that the STAR-IOS exploits the energy-splitting (ES) protocol for
communication and the fading channels between the RIS and STAR-IOS follow
composite Fisher-Snedecor F distribution. Under such assumptions, we first use
the central limit theorem (CLT) to derive the PDF and the CDF of equivalent
channels at receiver vehicles, and then, we derive the closed-form expression
of outage probability (OP) under NOMA/OMA scenarios. Additionally, by
exploiting Jensen's inequality, we propose an upper bound of the ergodic
capacity (EC), and then, we derive an analytical expression of the energy
efficiency (EE) for both NOMA and OMA cases. Further, our analytical results,
which are double-checked with the Monte-Carlo simulation, reveal that applying
RIS/STAR-RIS in V2V communications can significantly improve the performance of
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Besides, the results indicate that
considering the NOMA scheme provides better performance in terms of the OP, EC,
and EE as compared with the OMA case for the considered V2V communication.

<p class="mathjax">Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of
low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of
interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts
is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept
interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a
variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect
the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar
as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in
Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and
operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical
framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL
builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly
models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a
principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the
vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment
and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and
clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of
representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked
to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept
leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general
information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization
aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of
interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on
human-interpretable representations.

<p class="mathjax">The information landscape has undergone dramatic changes with the expansion
of the internet and online social networks. Optimistic views thought that
online communication would foster a culture of participation. However, recent
events suggest that social media platforms limit the diversity of the content
by exposing users to pre-existing beliefs, which is known by the metaphor of
echo chambers. In addition, users with malicious intent are using these
platforms to deceive people and discredit the democratic process. To better
understand these two phenomena, this chapter describes a computational method
to analyze coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook groups on posts, URLs,
and images. Our findings suggest that Facebook groups shared identical items
almost simultaneously by different entities. In doing so, we could identify
that these groups resemble disinformation echo chambers, where repeatedly
sharing activities of disinformation narratives occur. The chapter concludes
with theoretical and empirical implications.

<p class="mathjax">Video matting has broad applications, from adding interesting effects to
casually captured movies to assisting video production professionals. Matting
with associated effects such as shadows and reflections has also attracted
increasing research activity, and methods like Omnimatte have been proposed to
separate dynamic foreground objects of interest into their own layers. However,
prior works represent video backgrounds as 2D image layers, limiting their
capacity to express more complicated scenes, thus hindering application to
real-world videos. In this paper, we propose a novel video matting method,
OmnimatteRF, that combines dynamic 2D foreground layers and a 3D background
model. The 2D layers preserve the details of the subjects, while the 3D
background robustly reconstructs scenes in real-world videos. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method reconstructs scenes with better quality
on various videos.

<p class="mathjax">Given a group of images, co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to
highlight the common salient object in each image. There are two factors
closely related to the success of this task, namely consensus extraction, and
the dispersion of consensus to each image. Most previous works represent the
group consensus using local features, while we instead utilize a hierarchical
Transformer module for extracting semantic-level consensus. Therefore, it can
obtain a more comprehensive representation of the common object category, and
exclude interference from other objects that share local similarities with the
target object. In addition, we propose a Transformer-based dispersion module
that takes into account the variation of the co-salient object in different
scenes. It distributes the consensus to the image feature maps in an
image-specific way while making full use of interactions within the group.
These two modules are integrated with a ViT encoder and an FPN-like decoder to
form an end-to-end trainable network, without additional branch and auxiliary
loss. The proposed method is evaluated on three commonly used CoSOD datasets
and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">We revisit a graph width parameter that we dub bipartite treewidth, along
with its associated graph decomposition that we call bipartite tree
decomposition. Bipartite treewidth can be seen as a common generalization of
treewidth and the odd cycle transversal number. Intuitively, a bipartite tree
decomposition is a tree decomposition whose bags induce almost bipartite graphs
and whose adhesions contain at most one vertex from the bipartite part of any
other bag, while the width of such decomposition measures how far the bags are
from being bipartite. Adapted from a tree decomposition originally defined by
Demaine, Hajiaghayi, and Kawarabayashi [SODA 2010] and explicitly defined by
Tazari [Th. Comp. Sci. 2012], bipartite treewidth appears to play a crucial
role for solving problems related to odd-minors, which have recently attracted
considerable attention. As a first step toward a theory for solving these
problems efficiently, the main goal of this paper is to develop dynamic
programming techniques to solve problems on graphs of small bipartite
treewidth. For such graphs, we provide a number of para-NP-completeness
results, FPT-algorithms, and XP-algorithms, as well as several open problems.
In particular, we show that $K_t$-Subgraph-Cover, Weighted Vertex
Cover/Independent Set, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Maximum Weighted Cut are
$FPT$ parameterized by bipartite treewidth. We provide the following complexity
dichotomy when $H$ is a 2-connected graph, for each of $H$-Subgraph-Packing,
$H$-Induced-Packing, $H$-Scattered-Packing, and $H$-Odd-Minor-Packing problem:
if $H$ is bipartite, then the problem is para-NP-complete parameterized by
bipartite treewidth while, if $H$ is non-bipartite, then it is solvable in
XP-time. We define 1-${\cal H}$-treewidth by replacing the bipartite graph
class by any class ${\cal H}$. Most of the technology developed here works for
this more general parameter.

generation of fake news, plagiarism, etc. As a result, accurate detection of
AI-generated language can be crucial in responsible usage of LLMs. In this
work, we explore 1) whether a certain body of text is AI generated or written
by human, and 2) attribution of a specific language model in generating a body
of text. Texts in both English and Spanish are considered. The datasets used in
this study are provided as part of the Automated Text Identification
(AuTexTification) shared task. For each of the research objectives stated
above, we propose an ensemble neural model that generates probabilities from
different pre-trained LLMs which are used as features to a Traditional Machine
Learning (TML) classifier following it. For the first task of distinguishing
between AI and human generated text, our model ranked in fifth and thirteenth
place (with macro $F1$ scores of 0.733 and 0.649) for English and Spanish
texts, respectively. For the second task on model attribution, our model ranked
in first place with macro $F1$ scores of 0.625 and 0.653 for English and
Spanish texts, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Interactive Object Grasping (IOG) is the task of identifying and grasping the
desired object via human-robot natural language interaction. Current IOG
systems assume that a human user initially specifies the target object's
category (e.g., bottle). Inspired by pragmatics, where humans often convey
their intentions by relying on context to achieve goals, we introduce a new IOG
task, Pragmatic-IOG, and the corresponding dataset, Intention-oriented
Multi-modal Dialogue (IM-Dial). In our proposed task scenario, an
intention-oriented utterance (e.g., "I am thirsty") is initially given to the
robot. The robot should then identify the target object by interacting with a
human user. Based on the task setup, we propose a new robotic system that can
interpret the user's intention and pick up the target object, Pragmatic Object
Grasping (PROGrasp). PROGrasp performs Pragmatic-IOG by incorporating modules
for visual grounding, question asking, object grasping, and most importantly,
answer interpretation for pragmatic inference. Experimental results show that
PROGrasp is effective in offline (i.e., target object discovery) and online
(i.e., IOG with a physical robot arm) settings.

<p class="mathjax">Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great
potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain
optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve
alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class
descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for
deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is
extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work
Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the
vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve
substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse
generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.

<p class="mathjax">Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) suffer from performance issues when
executing certain management instructions, such as creating an enclave, context
switching in and out of protected mode, and swapping cached pages. This is
especially problematic for short-running, interactive functions in
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, where existing techniques to address
enclave overheads are insufficient. We find FaaS functions can spend more time
managing the enclave than executing application instructions. In this work, we
propose a TEE/GC hybrid (TGh) protocol to enable confidential FaaS platforms.
TGh moves computation out of the enclave onto the untrusted host using garbled

approach retains the security guarantees of enclaves while avoiding the

<p class="mathjax">The Transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective for Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks, becoming a foundational component for a
plethora of research in the domain. Historically, many approaches have leaned
on fixed-length attention windows, which becomes problematic for varied speech
samples in duration and complexity, leading to data over-smoothing and neglect
of essential long-term connectivity. Addressing this limitation, we introduce
Echo-MSA, a nimble module equipped with a variable-length attention mechanism
that accommodates a range of speech sample complexities and durations. This
module offers the flexibility to extract speech features across various
granularities, spanning from frames and phonemes to words and discourse. The
proposed design captures the variable length feature of speech and addresses
the limitations of fixed-length attention. Our evaluation leverages a parallel
attention architecture complemented by a dynamic gating mechanism that
amalgamates traditional attention with the Echo-MSA module output. Empirical
evidence from our study reveals that integrating Echo-MSA into the primary
model's training regime significantly enhances the word error rate (WER)
performance, all while preserving the intrinsic stability of the original
model.

Humanoid Embodied Conversational Agents (HECAs) can foster usability in mobile
serious game (MSG) applications. The aim of the research is to assess the
impact of multiple agents and illusion of humanness on the quality of the
interaction. The experiment investigates two styles of agent presentation: an
agent of high human-likeness (HECA) and an agent of low human-likeness (text).
The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether and how agents of high
humanlikeness can evoke the illusion of humanness and affect usability. Agents
of high human-likeness were designed by following the ECA design model that is
a proposed guide for ECA development. The results of the experiment with 90
participants show that users prefer to interact with the HECAs. The difference
between the two versions is statistically significant with a large effect size
(d=1.01), with many of the participants justifying their choice by saying that
the human-like characteristics of the HECA made the version more appealing.
This research provides key information on the potential effect of HECAs on
serious games, which can provide insight into the design of future mobile
serious games.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a quantitative program verification infrastructure for
discrete probabilistic programs. Our infrastructure can be viewed as the
probabilistic analogue of Boogie: its central components are an intermediate
verification language (IVL) together with a real-valued logic. Our IVL provides
a programming-language-style for expressing verification conditions whose
validity implies the correctness of a program under investigation. As our focus
is on verifying quantitative properties such as bounds on expected outcomes,
expected run-times, or termination probabilities, off-the-shelf IVLs based on
Boolean first-order logic do not suffice. Instead, a paradigm shift from the
standard Boolean to a real-valued domain is required.
<br />Our IVL features quantitative generalizations of standard verification
constructs such as assume- and assert-statements. Verification conditions are
generated by a weakest-precondition-style semantics, based on our real-valued
logic. We show that our verification infrastructure supports natural encodings
of numerous verification techniques from the literature. With our SMT-based
implementation, we automatically verify a variety of benchmarks. To the best of
our knowledge, this establishes the first deductive verification infrastructure
for expectation-based reasoning about probabilistic programs.

<p class="mathjax">Content Security Policy (CSP) is an effective security mechanism that
prevents the exploitation of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on
websites by specifying the sources from which their web pages can load
resources, such as scripts and styles. CSP nonces enable websites to allow the
execution of specific inline scripts and styles without relying on a whitelist.
In this study, we measure and analyze the use of CSP nonces in the wild,
specifically looking for nonce reuse, short nonces, and invalid nonces. We find
that, of the 2271 sites that deploy a nonce-based policy, 598 of them reuse the
same nonce value in more than one response, potentially enabling attackers to
bypass protection offered by the CSP against XSS attacks. We analyze the causes
of the nonce reuses to identify whether they are introduced by the server-side
code or if the nonces are being cached by web caches. Moreover, we investigate
whether nonces are only reused within the same session or for different
sessions, as this impacts the effectiveness of CSP in preventing XSS attacks.
Finally, we discuss the possibilities for attackers to bypass the CSP and
achieve XSS in different nonce reuse scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by the interconnection of real
neurons, have achieved unprecedented success in various fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing. Recently, a novel mathematical ANN
model, known as the dendritic neuron model (DNM), has been proposed to address
nonlinear problems by more accurately reflecting the structure of real neurons.
However, the single-output design limits its capability to handle multi-output
tasks, significantly lowering its applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-in and multi-out dendritic neuron model (MODN) to tackle
multi-output tasks. Our core idea is to introduce a filtering matrix to the
soma layer to adaptively select the desired dendrites to regress each output.
Because such a matrix is designed to be learnable, MODN can explore the
relationship between each dendrite and output to provide a better solution to
downstream tasks. We also model a telodendron layer into MODN to simulate
better the real neuron behavior. Importantly, MODN is a more general and
unified framework that can be naturally specialized as the DNM by customizing
the filtering matrix. To explore the optimization of MODN, we investigate both
heuristic and gradient-based optimizers and introduce a 2-step training method
for MODN. Extensive experimental results performed on 11 datasets on both
binary and multi-class classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
MODN, with respect to accuracy, convergence, and generality.

<p class="mathjax">Effectively leveraging multimodal information from social media posts is
essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm
detection and hate speech classification. However, combining text and image
information is challenging because of the idiosyncratic cross-modal semantics
with hidden or complementary information present in matching image-text pairs.
In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal
models, demonstrating consistent improvements across four popular social media
datasets. Furthermore, through detailed analysis, we shed light on the specific
scenarios and cases where each auxiliary task proves to be most effective.

<p class="mathjax">Previous evaluations on 6DoF object pose tracking have presented obvious
limitations along with the development of this area. In particular, the
evaluation protocols are not unified for different methods, the widely-used
YCBV dataset contains significant annotation error, and the error metrics also
may be biased. As a result, it is hard to fairly compare the methods, which has
became a big obstacle for developing new algorithms. In this paper we
contribute a unified benchmark to address the above problems. For more accurate
annotation of YCBV, we propose a multi-view multi-object global pose refinement
method, which can jointly refine the poses of all objects and view cameras,
resulting in sub-pixel sub-millimeter alignment errors. The limitations of
previous scoring methods and error metrics are analyzed, based on which we
introduce our improved evaluation methods. The unified benchmark takes both
YCBV and BCOT as base datasets, which are shown to be complementary in scene
categories. In experiments, we validate the precision and reliability of the
proposed global pose refinement method with a realistic semi-synthesized
dataset particularly for YCBV, and then present the benchmark results unifying
learning&amp;non-learning and RGB&amp;RGBD methods, with some finds not discovered in
previous studies.

<p class="mathjax">A method is proposed for evaluation of single and double layer potentials of
the Laplace and Helmholtz equations on piecewise smooth manifold boundary
elements with constant densities. The method is based on a novel two-term
decomposition of the layer potentials, derived by means of differential
geometry. The first term is an integral of a differential 2-form which can be
reduced to contour integrals using Stokes' theorem, while the second term is
related to the element curvature. This decomposition reduces the degree of
singularity and the curvature term can be further regularized by a polar
coordinate transform. The method can handle singular and nearly singular
integrals. Numerical results validating the accuracy of the method are
presented for all combinations of single and double layer potentials, for the
Laplace and Helmholtz kernels, and for singular and nearly singular integrals.

<p class="mathjax">Recent breakthroughs in pre-trained code models, such as CodeBERT and Codex,
have shown their superior performance in various downstream tasks. The
correctness and unambiguity of API usage among these code models are crucial
for achieving desirable program functionalities, requiring them to learn
various API fully qualified names structurally and semantically. Recent studies
reveal that even state-of-the-art pre-trained code models struggle with
suggesting the correct APIs during code generation. However, the reasons for
such poor API usage performance are barely investigated. To address this
challenge, we propose using knowledge probing as a means of interpreting code
models, which uses cloze-style tests to measure the knowledge stored in models.
Our comprehensive study examines a code model's capability of understanding API
fully qualified names from two different perspectives: API call and API import.
Specifically, we reveal that current code models struggle with understanding
API names, with pre-training strategies significantly affecting the quality of
API name learning. We demonstrate that natural language context can assist code
models in locating Python API names and generalize Python API name knowledge to
unseen data. Our findings provide insights into the limitations and
capabilities of current pre-trained code models, and suggest that incorporating
API structure into the pre-training process can improve automated API usage and
code representations. This work provides significance for advancing code
intelligence practices and direction for future studies. All experiment

<p class="mathjax">Since the seminal work by Angluin, active learning of automata, by membership
and equivalence queries, has been extensively studied and several
generalisations have been developed to learn various extensions of automata.
For weighted automata, restricted cases have been tackled in the literature and
in this paper we chart the boundaries of the Angluin approach (using a class of
hypothesis automata constructed from membership and equivalence queries)
applied to learning weighted automata over a general semiring. We show
precisely the theoretical limitations of this approach and classify functions
with respect to how guessable they are (corresponding to the existence and
abundance of solutions of certain systems of equations). We provide a syntactic
description of the boundary condition for a correct hypothesis of the
prescribed form to exist. Of course, from an algorithmic standpoint, knowing
that (many) solutions exist need not translate into an effective algorithm to
find one; we conclude with a discussion of some known conditions (and variants
thereof) that suffice to ensure this, illustrating the ideas over several
familiar semirings (including the natural numbers) and pose some open questions
for future research.

<p class="mathjax">More research attention has recently been given to end-to-end autonomous
driving technologies where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a
single neural network because of its simpler structure and faster inference
time. Despite this appealing approach largely reducing the components in
driving pipeline, its simplicity also leads to interpretability problems and
safety issues <a href="/abs/2003.06404">arXiv:2003.06404</a>. The trained policy is not always compliant with
the traffic rules and it is also hard to discover the reason for the
misbehavior because of the lack of intermediate outputs. Meanwhile, Sensors are
also critical to autonomous driving's security and feasibility to perceive the
surrounding environment under complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we
proposed P-CSG, a novel penalty-based imitation learning approach with cross
semantics generation sensor fusion technologies to increase the overall
performance of End-to-End Autonomous Driving. We conducted an assessment of our
model's performance using the Town 05 Long benchmark, achieving an impressive
driving score improvement of over 15%. Furthermore, we conducted robustness
evaluations against adversarial attacks like FGSM and Dot attacks, revealing a
substantial increase in robustness compared to baseline models.More detailed

fundamental challenge in federated learning. In this work, we tackle this

normal noise addition process at the aggregator. This implies that we can
guarantee the same level of differential privacy against other clients while
substantially reducing the amount of communication required, as opposed to
transmitting full precision gradients and using central noise addition. We also

<p class="mathjax">Automatic identification of clinical trials for which a patient is eligible
is complicated by the fact that trial eligibility is stated in natural
language. A potential solution to this problem is to employ text classification
methods for common types of eligibility criteria. In this study, we focus on
seven common exclusion criteria in cancer trials: prior malignancy, human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, psychiatric illness,
drug/substance abuse, and autoimmune illness. Our dataset consists of 764 phase
III cancer trials with these exclusions annotated at the trial level. We
experiment with common transformer models as well as a new pre-trained clinical
trial BERT model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatically
classifying common exclusion criteria. Additionally, we demonstrate the value
of a pre-trained language model specifically for clinical trials, which yields
the highest average performance across all criteria.

<p class="mathjax">Directed graphs are a natural model for many phenomena, in particular
scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction
networks that define cellular signaling relationships. In these situations,
source nodes typically have distinct biophysical properties from sinks. Due to
their ordered and unidirectional relationships, many such networks also have
hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods
performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these
properties into account, and thus have not been leveraged effectively for
scientific tasks such as cellular signaling network inference. We propose a new
framework called Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE) which uses a directed
version of a geometric scattering transform, combined with the non-linear
dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder and the geometric
properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies. We show this
method outperforms numerous others on tasks such as embedding directed graphs
and learning cellular signaling networks.

<p class="mathjax">Many applications in computational physics involve approximating problems
with microstructure, characterized by multiple spatial scales in their data.
However, these numerical solutions are often computationally expensive due to
the need to capture fine details at small scales. As a result, simulating such
phenomena becomes unaffordable for many-query applications, such as
parametrized systems with multiple scale-dependent features. Traditional
projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) fail to resolve these issues, even
for second-order elliptic PDEs commonly found in engineering applications. To
address this, we propose an alternative nonintrusive strategy to build a ROM,
that combines classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a suitable
neural network (NN) model to account for the small scales. Specifically, we
employ sparse mesh-informed neural networks (MINNs), which handle both spatial
dependencies in the solutions and model parameters simultaneously. We evaluate
the performance of this strategy on benchmark problems and then apply it to
approximate a real-life problem involving the impact of microcirculation in
transport phenomena through the tissue microenvironment.

<p class="mathjax">One of the main issues in computing a tensor decomposition is how to choose
the number of rank-one components, since there is no finite algorithms for
determining the rank of a tensor. A commonly used approach for this purpose is
to find a low-dimensional subspace by solving an optimization problem and
assuming the number of components is fixed. However, even though this algorithm
is efficient and easy to implement, it often converges to poor local minima and
suffers from outliers and noise. The aim of this paper is to develop a
mathematical framework for exact tensor decomposition that is able to represent
a tensor as the sum of a finite number of low-rank tensors. In the paper three
different problems will be carried out to derive: i) the decomposition of a
non-negative self-adjoint tensor operator; ii) the decomposition of a linear
tensor transformation; iii) the decomposition of a generic tensor.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
capabilities at scale, particularly at generating text conditioned on a prompt.
In our work, we investigate the use of LLMs to augment training data of small
language models~(SLMs) with automatically generated counterfactual~(CF)
instances -- i.e. minimally altered inputs -- in order to improve
out-of-domain~(OOD) performance of SLMs in the extractive question
answering~(QA) setup. We show that, across various LLM generators, such data
augmentation consistently enhances OOD performance and improves model
calibration for both confidence-based and rationale-augmented calibrator
models. Furthermore, these performance improvements correlate with higher
diversity of CF instances in terms of their surface form and semantic content.
Finally, we show that CF augmented models which are easier to calibrate also
exhibit much lower entropy when assigning importance, indicating that
rationale-augmented calibrators prefer concise explanations.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic road extraction from satellite imagery using deep learning is a
viable alternative to traditional manual mapping. Therefore it has received
considerable attention recently. However, most of the existing methods are
supervised and require pixel-level labeling, which is tedious and error-prone.
To make matters worse, the earth has a diverse range of terrain, vegetation,
and man-made objects. It is well known that models trained in one area
generalize poorly to other areas. Various shooting conditions such as light and
angel, as well as different image processing techniques further complicate the
issue. It is impractical to develop training data to cover all image styles.
This paper proposes to leverage OpenStreetMap road data as weak labels and
large scale satellite imagery to pre-train semantic segmentation models. Our
extensive experimental results show that the prediction accuracy increases with
the amount of the weakly labeled data, as well as the road density in the areas
chosen for training. Using as much as 100 times more data than the widely used
DeepGlobe road dataset, our model with the D-LinkNet architecture and the
ResNet-50 backbone exceeds the top performer of the current DeepGlobe
leaderboard. Furthermore, due to large-scale pre-training, our model
generalizes much better than those trained with only the curated datasets,
implying great application potential.

<p class="mathjax">We present VAPOR, a novel method for autonomous legged robot navigation in
unstructured, densely vegetated outdoor environments using Offline
Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our method trains a novel RL policy from unlabeled
data collected in real outdoor vegetation. This policy uses height and
intensity-based cost maps derived from 3D LiDAR point clouds, a goal cost map,
and processed proprioception data as state inputs, and learns the physical and
geometric properties of the surrounding vegetation such as height, density, and
solidity/stiffness for navigation. Instead of using end-to-end policy actions,
the fully-trained RL policy's Q network is used to evaluate dynamically
feasible robot actions generated from a novel adaptive planner capable of
navigating through dense narrow passages and preventing entrapment in
vegetation such as tall grass and bushes. We demonstrate our method's
capabilities on a legged robot in complex outdoor vegetation. We observe an
improvement in success rates, a decrease in average power consumption, and
decrease in normalized trajectory length compared to both existing end-to-end
offline RL and outdoor navigation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the modern relevance of blockchain technology, smart contracts present
both substantial risks and benefits. Vulnerabilities within them can trigger a
cascade of consequences, resulting in significant losses. Many current papers
primarily focus on classifying smart contracts for malicious intent, often
relying on limited contract characteristics, such as bytecode or opcode. This
paper proposes a novel, two-layered framework: 1) classifying and 2) directly
repairing malicious contracts. Slither's vulnerability report is combined with
source code and passed through a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), classifying and repairing each suggested
vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and
prompt-engineered LLMs. The smart contract repair models, built from
pre-trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and fine-tuned Llama-2-7B models, reduced the overall
vulnerability count by 97.5% and 96.7% respectively. A manual inspection of
repaired contracts shows that all retain functionality, indicating that the
proposed method is appropriate for automatic batch classification and repair of
vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) employ multi-view images for 3D scene
representation and have shown remarkable performance. As one of the primary
sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as
varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes. Most previous
NeRF-based methods often assume a global unique camera and seldom consider
scenarios with multiple cameras. Besides, some pose-robust methods still remain
susceptible to suboptimal solutions when poses are poor initialized. In this
paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method can jointly optimize both intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields. Firstly, we
conduct a theoretical analysis to tackle the degenerate case and coupling issue
that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters. Secondly, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an
efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems,
including the design of calibration object. Lastly, we present a global
end-to-end network with training sequence that enables the regression of
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network. Moreover,
most existing datasets are designed for unique camera, we create a new dataset
that includes four different styles of multi-camera acquisition systems,
allowing readers to generate custom datasets. Experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our method when each image corresponds to different camera
parameters. Specifically, we adopt up to 110 images with 110 different
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, to achieve 3D scene representation without
providing initial poses. The Code and supplementary materials are available at
https://in2-viaun.github.io/MC-NeRF.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous
driving and robots to understand their surroundings accurately and robustly.
There are different types of methods, such as point-based, range image-based,
and polar-based. Among these, range image-based methods are widely used due to
their balance between accuracy and speed. However, they face a significant
challenge known as the ``many-to-one'' problem caused by the range image's
limited horizontal and vertical angular resolution, where around 20% of the 3D
points are occluded during model inference based on our observation. In this
paper, we present TFNet, a range image-based LiDAR semantic segmentation method
that utilizes temporal information to address this issue. Specifically, we
incorporate a temporal fusion layer to extract useful information from previous
scans and integrate it with the current scan. We then design a max-voting-based
post-processing technique to correct false predictions, particularly those
caused by the ``many-to-one'' issue. Experiments on two benchmarks and seven
backbones of three modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
our proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">As language models are adapted by a more sophisticated and diverse set of
users, the importance of guaranteeing that they provide factually correct
information supported by verifiable sources is critical across fields of study
&amp; professions. This is especially the case for high-stakes fields, such as
medicine and law, where the risk of propagating false information is high and
can lead to undesirable societal consequences. Previous work studying
factuality and attribution has not focused on analyzing these characteristics
of language model outputs in domain-specific scenarios. In this work, we
present an evaluation study analyzing various axes of factuality and
attribution provided in responses from a few systems, by bringing domain
experts in the loop. Specifically, we first collect expert-curated questions
from 484 participants across 32 fields of study, and then ask the same experts
to evaluate generated responses to their own questions. We also ask experts to
revise answers produced by language models, which leads to ExpertQA, a
high-quality long-form QA dataset with 2177 questions spanning 32 fields, along
with verified answers and attributions for claims in the answers.

<p class="mathjax">Before applying data analytics or machine learning to a data set, a vital
step is usually the construction of an informative set of features from the
data. In this paper, we present SMARTFEAT, an efficient automated feature
engineering tool to assist data users, even non-experts, in constructing useful
features. Leveraging the power of Foundation Models (FMs), our approach enables
the creation of new features from the data, based on contextual information and
open-world knowledge. To achieve this, our method incorporates an intelligent
operator selector that discerns a subset of operators, effectively avoiding
exhaustive combinations of original features, as is typically observed in
traditional automated feature engineering tools. Moreover, we address the
limitations of performing data tasks through row-level interactions with FMs,
which could lead to significant delays and costs due to excessive API calls. To
tackle this, we introduce a function generator that facilitates the acquisition
of efficient data transformations, such as dataframe built-in methods or lambda
functions, ensuring the applicability of SMARTFEAT to generate new features for
large datasets. With SMARTFEAT, dataset users can efficiently search for and
apply transformations to obtain new features, leading to improvements in the
AUC of downstream ML classification by up to 29.8%.

<p class="mathjax">Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are a widely-used algorithmic tool
for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, a notable example is the
equilibirum distribution of graphical models. The Glauber dynamics, also known
as the Gibbs sampler, is the simplest example of an MCMC algorithm; the
transitions of the chain update the configuration at a randomly chosen
coordinate at each step. Several works have studied distributed versions of the
Glauber dynamics and we extend these efforts to a more general family of Markov
chains. An important combinatorial problem in the study of MCMC algorithms is
random colorings. Given a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ and an integer
$k\geq\Delta+1$, the goal is to generate a random proper vertex $k$-coloring of
$G$.
<br />Jerrum (1995) proved that the Glauber dynamics has $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time
when $k&gt;2\Delta$. Fischer and Ghaffari (2018), and independently Feng, Hayes,
and Yin (2018), presented a parallel and distributed version of the Glauber
dynamics which converges in $O(\log{n})$ rounds for $k&gt;(2+\varepsilon)\Delta$
for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We improve this result to $k&gt;(11/6-\delta)\Delta$ for
a fixed $\delta&gt;0$. This matches the state of the art for randomly sampling
colorings of general graphs in the sequential setting. Whereas previous works
focused on distributed variants of the Glauber dynamics, our work presents a
parallel and distributed version of the more general flip dynamics presented by
Vigoda (2000) (and refined by Chen, Delcourt, Moitra, Perarnau, and Postle
(2019)), which recolors local maximal two-colored components in each step.

<p class="mathjax">Humans encode information into sounds by controlling articulators and decode
information from sounds using the auditory apparatus. This paper introduces
CiwaGAN, a model of human spoken language acquisition that combines
unsupervised articulatory modeling with an unsupervised model of information
exchange through the auditory modality. While prior research includes
unsupervised articulatory modeling and information exchange separately, our
model is the first to combine the two components. The paper also proposes an
improved articulatory model with more interpretable internal representations.
The proposed CiwaGAN model is the most realistic approximation of human spoken
language acquisition using deep learning. As such, it is useful for cognitively
plausible simulations of the human speech act.

<p class="mathjax">For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent
to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle
for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their
environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to
develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these
efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies
to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually,
what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve
as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse
scenarios. Due to the versatile and remarkable capabilities they demonstrate,
large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many
research efforts have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and
have achieved significant progress. We start by tracing the concept of agents
from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs
are suitable foundations for AI agents. Building upon this, we present a
conceptual framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components:
brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored to suit
different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of
LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent
scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent
societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the
social phenomena that emerge when they form societies, and the insights they
offer for human society. Finally, we discuss a range of key topics and open
problems within the field.

<p class="mathjax">Iterative refinement (IR) is a popular scheme for solving a linear system of
equations based on gradually improving the accuracy of an initial
approximation. Originally developed to improve upon the accuracy of Gaussian
elimination, interest in IR has been revived because of its suitability for
execution on fast low-precision hardware such as analog devices and graphics
processing units. IR generally converges when the error associated with the
solution method is small, but is known to diverge when this error is large. We
propose and analyze a novel enhancement to the IR algorithm by adding a line
search optimization step that guarantees the algorithm will not diverge.
Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results and illustrate the

<p class="mathjax">This paper targets a novel trade-off problem in generalizable prompt learning
for vision-language models (VLM), i.e., improving the performance on unseen
classes while maintaining the performance on seen classes. Comparing with
existing generalizable methods that neglect the seen classes degradation, the
setting of this problem is more strict and fits more closely with practical
applications. To solve this problem, we start from the optimization
perspective, and leverage the relationship between loss landscape geometry and
model generalization ability. By analyzing the loss landscape of the
state-of-the-art method and the widely-used Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM),
we conclude that the trade-off performance correlates to both loss value and
loss sharpness, while each of them are indispensable. However, we find the
optimizing gradient of existing methods cannot always maintain high consistency
with both loss value and loss sharpness during the whole optimization
procedure. To this end, we propose an novel SAM-based method for prompt
learning, denoted as Gradient Constrained Sharpness-aware Context Optimization
(GCSCoOp), to dynamically constrains the optimizing gradient, thus achieving
above two-fold optimization objective simultaneously. Extensive experiments
verify the effectiveness of GCSCoOp in the trade-off problem.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and
developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve
various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using
natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising
direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an
open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider
non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important
features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and
fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables
non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art
autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also
research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for
researchers. Agents is available at https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider a learning problem among non-cooperative agents
interacting in a time-varying system. Specifically, we focus on repeated linear
quadratic network games, in which the network of interactions changes with time
and agents may not be present at each iteration. To get tractability, we assume
that at each iteration, the network of interactions is sampled from an
underlying random network model and agents participate at random with a given
probability. Under these assumptions, we consider a gradient-based learning
algorithm and establish almost sure convergence of the agents' strategies to
the Nash equilibrium of the game played over the expected network.
Additionally, we prove, in the large population regime, that the learned
strategy is an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for each stage game with high
probability. We validate our results over an online market application.

<p class="mathjax">Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an efficient computational tool for
solving nonlinear optimal control problems. It was originally designed as a
single shooting method and thus is sensitive to the initial guess supplied.
This work considers the extension of DDP to multiple shooting (MS), improving
its robustness to initial guesses. A novel derivation is proposed that accounts
for the defect between shooting segments during the DDP backward pass, while
still maintaining quadratic convergence locally. The derivation enables
unifying multiple previous MS algorithms, and opens the door to many smaller
algorithmic improvements. A penalty method is introduced to strategically
control the step size, further improving the convergence performance. An
adaptive merit function and a more reliable acceptance condition are employed
for globalization. The effects of these improvements are benchmarked for
trajectory optimization with a quadrotor, an acrobot, and a manipulator. MS-DDP
is also demonstrated for use in Model Predictive Control (MPC) for dynamic
jumping with a quadruped robot, showing its benefits over a single shooting
approach.

<p class="mathjax">Elastic actuation taps into elastic elements' energy storage for dynamic
motions beyond rigid actuation. While Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) and
Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) are highly sophisticated, they do not fully
provide control over energy transfer timing. To overcome this problem on the
basic system level, the Bi-Stiffness Actuation (BSA) concept was recently
proposed. Theoretically, it allows for full link decoupling, while
simultaneously being able to lock the spring in the drive train via a
switch-and-hold mechanism. Thus, the user would be in full control of the
potential energy storage and release timing. In this work, we introduce an
initial proof-of-concept of Bi-Stiffness-Actuation in the form of a 1-DoF
physical prototype, which is implemented using a modular testbed. We present a
hybrid system model, as well as the mechatronic implementation of the actuator.
We corroborate the feasibility of the concept by conducting a series of
hardware experiments using an open-loop control signal obtained by trajectory
optimization. Here, we compare the performance of the prototype with a
comparable SEA implementation. We show that BSA outperforms SEA 1) in terms of
maximum velocity at low final times and 2) in terms of the movement strategy
itself: The clutch mechanism allows the BSA to generate consistent launch
sequences while the SEA has to rely on lengthy and possibly dangerous
oscillatory swing-up motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that providing full
control authority over the energy transfer timing and link decoupling allows
the user to synchronously release both elastic joint and gravitational energy.
This facilitates the optimal exploitation of elastic and gravitational
potentials in a synergistic manner.

<p class="mathjax">In many fields of robotics, knowing the relative position and orientation
between two sensors is a mandatory precondition to operate with multiple
sensing modalities. In this context, the pair LiDAR-RGB cameras offer
complementary features: LiDARs yield sparse high quality range measurements,
while RGB cameras provide a dense color measurement of the environment.
Existing techniques often rely either on complex calibration targets that are
expensive to obtain, or extracted virtual correspondences that can hinder the
estimate's accuracy. In this paper we address the problem of LiDAR-RGB
calibration using typical calibration patterns (i.e. A3 chessboard) with
minimal human intervention. Our approach exploits the planarity of the target
to find correspondences between the sensors measurements, leading to features
that are robust to LiDAR noise.
<br />Moreover, we estimate a solution by solving a joint non-linear optimization
problem. We validated our approach by carrying on quantitative and comparative
experiments with other state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that our
simple schema performs on par or better than other approches using complex
calibration targets. Finally, we release an open-source C++ implementation at

<p class="mathjax">Training large language models to follow instructions makes them perform
better on a wide range of tasks, generally becoming more helpful. However, a
perfectly helpful model will follow even the most malicious instructions and
readily generate harmful content. In this paper, we raise concerns over the
safety of models that only emphasize helpfulness, not safety, in their
instruction-tuning. We show that several popular instruction-tuned models are
highly unsafe. Moreover, we show that adding just 3% safety examples (a few
hundred demonstrations) in the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA
can substantially improve their safety. Our safety-tuning does not make models
significantly less capable or helpful as measured by standard benchmarks.
However, we do find a behavior of exaggerated safety, where too much
safety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that
superficially resemble unsafe ones. Our study sheds light on trade-offs in
training LLMs to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior.

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces a new multispectral database and novel approaches for
eyeblink detection in RGB and Near-Infrared (NIR) individual images. Our
contributed dataset (mEBAL2, multimodal Eye Blink and Attention Level
estimation, Version 2) is the largest existing eyeblink database, representing
a great opportunity to improve data-driven multispectral approaches for blink
detection and related applications (e.g., attention level estimation and
presentation attack detection in face biometrics). mEBAL2 includes 21,100 image
sequences from 180 different students (more than 2 million labeled images in
total) while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty or
taking a real course on HTML initiation through the edX MOOC platform. mEBAL2
uses multiple sensors, including two Near-Infrared (NIR) and one RGB camera to
capture facial gestures during the execution of the tasks, as well as an
Electroencephalogram (EEG) band to get the cognitive activity of the user and
blinking events. Furthermore, this work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network
architecture as benchmark for blink detection on mEBAL2 with performances up to
97%. Different training methodologies are implemented using the RGB spectrum,
NIR spectrum, and the combination of both to enhance the performance on
existing eyeblink detectors. We demonstrate that combining NIR and RGB images
during training improves the performance of RGB eyeblink detectors (i.e.,
detection based only on a RGB image). Finally, the generalization capacity of
the proposed eyeblink detectors is validated in wilder and more challenging
environments like the HUST-LEBW dataset to show the usefulness of mEBAL2 to
train a new generation of data-driven approaches for eyeblink detection.

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel local-global feature fusion framework for body-weight
exercise recognition with floor-based dynamic pressure maps. One step further
from the existing studies using deep neural networks mainly focusing on global
feature extraction, the proposed framework aims to combine local and global
features using image processing techniques and the YOLO object detection to
localize pressure profiles from different body parts and consider physical
constraints. The proposed local feature extraction method generates two sets of
high-level local features consisting of cropped pressure mapping and numerical
features such as angular orientation, location on the mat, and pressure area.
In addition, we adopt a knowledge distillation for regularization to preserve
the knowledge of the global feature extraction and improve the performance of
the exercise recognition. Our experimental results demonstrate a notable 11
percent improvement in F1 score for exercise recognition while preserving
label-specific features.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a method to learn hand-object interaction prior for
reconstructing a 3D hand-object scene from a single RGB image. The inference as
well as training-data generation for 3D hand-object scene reconstruction is
challenging due to the depth ambiguity of a single image and occlusions by the
hand and object. We turn this challenge into an opportunity by utilizing the
hand shape to constrain the possible relative configuration of the hand and
object geometry. We design a generalizable implicit function, HandNeRF, that
explicitly encodes the correlation of the 3D hand shape features and 2D object
features to predict the hand and object scene geometry. With experiments on
real-world datasets, we show that HandNeRF is able to reconstruct hand-object
scenes of novel grasp configurations more accurately than comparable methods.
Moreover, we demonstrate that object reconstruction from HandNeRF ensures more
accurate execution of a downstream task, such as grasping for robotic
hand-over.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the challenge of Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking in
non-cooperative convex games with partial-decision information. We propose a
distributed algorithm, where each agent refines its strategy through
projected-gradient steps and an averaging procedure. Each agent uses estimates
of competitors' actions obtained solely from local neighbor interactions, in a
directed communication network. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
(strong) monotonicity assumptions, this work establishes the convergence
towards a NE under a diagonal dominance property of the pseudo-gradient
mapping, that can be checked locally by the agents. Further, this condition is
physically interpretable and of relevance for many applications, as it suggests
that an agent's objective function is primarily influenced by its individual
strategic decisions, rather than by the actions of its competitors. In virtue
of a novel block-infinity norm convergence argument, we provide explicit bounds
for constant step-size that are independent of the communication structure, and
can be computed in a totally decentralized way. Numerical simulations on an
optical network's power control problem validate the algorithm's effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Current physics-informed (standard or operator) neural networks still rely on
accurately learning the initial conditions of the system they are solving. In
contrast, standard numerical methods evolve such initial conditions without
needing to learn these. In this study, we propose to improve current
physics-informed deep learning strategies such that initial conditions do not
need to be learned and are represented exactly in the predicted solution.
Moreover, this method guarantees that when a DeepONet is applied multiple times
to time step a solution, the resulting function is continuous.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) i.e. showing LLMs only a few task-specific
demonstrations has led to downstream gains with no task-specific fine-tuning
required. However, LLMs are sensitive to the choice of prompts, and therefore a
crucial research question is how to select good demonstrations for ICL. One
effective strategy is leveraging semantic similarity between the ICL
demonstrations and test inputs by using a text retriever, which however is
sub-optimal as that does not consider the LLM's existing knowledge about that
task. From prior work (Min et al., 2022), we already know that labels paired
with the demonstrations bias the model predictions. This leads us to our
hypothesis whether considering LLM's existing knowledge about the task,
especially with respect to the output label space can help in a better
demonstration selection strategy. Through extensive experimentation on three
text classification tasks, we find that it is beneficial to not only choose
semantically similar ICL demonstrations but also to choose those demonstrations
that help resolve the inherent label ambiguity surrounding the test example.
Interestingly, we find that including demonstrations that the LLM previously
mis-classified and also fall on the test example's decision boundary, brings
the most performance gain.

<p class="mathjax">We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene dynamics.
Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from
real video sequences containing natural, oscillating motion such as trees,
flowers, candles, and clothes blowing in the wind. Given a single image, our
trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to
predict a per-pixel long-term motion representation in the Fourier domain,
which we call a neural stochastic motion texture. This representation can be
converted into dense motion trajectories that span an entire video. Along with
an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of
downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping
dynamic videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in
real pictures.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a physics-based method for synthesizing dexterous hand-object
interactions in a full-body setting. While recent advancements have addressed
specific facets of human-object interactions, a comprehensive physics-based
approach remains a challenge. Existing methods often focus on isolated segments
of the interaction process and rely on data-driven techniques that may result
in artifacts. In contrast, our proposed method embraces reinforcement learning
(RL) and physics simulation to mitigate the limitations of data-driven
approaches. Through a hierarchical framework, we first learn skill priors for
both body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors
learn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying
part. A high-level policy then controls hand-object interactions in these
pretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target
trajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines
an adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while
fulfilling the task incentives. Our method successfully accomplishes the
complete interaction task, from approaching an object to grasping and
subsequent manipulation. We compare our approach against kinematics-based
baselines and show that it leads to more physically plausible motions.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant
improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to
produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data
augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend
to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often
compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability
of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to
other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems
from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these
domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and
efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure
that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is
achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug
first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This
provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for
labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an
architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.
Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by
1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up
to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance
in both vision and biological domains.

<p class="mathjax">Existing volumetric methods for predicting 3D human pose estimation are
accurate, but computationally expensive and optimized for single time-step
prediction. We present TEMPO, an efficient multi-view pose estimation model
that learns a robust spatiotemporal representation, improving pose accuracy
while also tracking and forecasting human pose. We significantly reduce
computation compared to the state-of-the-art by recurrently computing
per-person 2D pose features, fusing both spatial and temporal information into
a single representation. In doing so, our model is able to use spatiotemporal
context to predict more accurate human poses without sacrificing efficiency. We
further use this representation to track human poses over time as well as
predict future poses. Finally, we demonstrate that our model is able to
generalize across datasets without scene-specific fine-tuning. TEMPO achieves
10$\%$ better MPJPE with a 33$\times$ improvement in FPS compared to TesseTrack
on the challenging CMU Panoptic Studio dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, large-scale pre-trained language-image models like CLIP have shown
extraordinary capabilities for understanding spatial contents, but naively
transferring such models to video recognition still suffers from unsatisfactory
temporal modeling capabilities. Existing methods insert tunable structures into
or in parallel with the pre-trained model, which either requires
back-propagation through the whole pre-trained model and is thus
resource-demanding, or is limited by the temporal reasoning capability of the
pre-trained structure. In this work, we present DiST, which disentangles the
learning of spatial and temporal aspects of videos. Specifically, DiST uses a
dual-encoder structure, where a pre-trained foundation model acts as the
spatial encoder, and a lightweight network is introduced as the temporal
encoder. An integration branch is inserted between the encoders to fuse
spatio-temporal information. The disentangled spatial and temporal learning in
DiST is highly efficient because it avoids the back-propagation of massive
pre-trained parameters. Meanwhile, we empirically show that disentangled
learning with an extra network for integration benefits both spatial and
temporal understanding. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DiST
delivers better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods by
convincing gaps. When pre-training on the large-scale Kinetics-710, we achieve
89.7% on Kinetics-400 with a frozen ViT-L model, which verifies the scalability
of DiST. Codes and models can be found in
https://github.com/alibaba-mmai-research/DiST.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection (OD), a crucial vision task, remains challenged by the lack
of large training datasets with precise object localization labels. In this
work, we propose ALWOD, a new framework that addresses this problem by fusing
active learning (AL) with weakly and semi-supervised object detection
paradigms. Because the performance of AL critically depends on the model
initialization, we propose a new auxiliary image generator strategy that
utilizes an extremely small labeled set, coupled with a large weakly tagged set
of images, as a warm-start for AL. We then propose a new AL acquisition
function, another critical factor in AL success, that leverages the
student-teacher OD pair disagreement and uncertainty to effectively propose the
most informative images to annotate. Finally, to complete the AL loop, we
introduce a new labeling task delegated to human annotators, based on selection
and correction of model-proposed detections, which is both rapid and effective
in labeling the informative images. We demonstrate, across several challenging
benchmarks, that ALWOD significantly narrows the gap between the ODs trained on
few partially labeled but strategically selected image instances and those that
rely on the fully-labeled data. Our code is publicly available on
https://github.com/seqam-lab/ALWOD.

<p class="mathjax">Starting from the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs)
benefiting from large language models (LLMs) have never been so popular.
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task
information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with
understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images. The issue can
traced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data.
Specifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data
with a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved
multiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle
user prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more
sophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from
the web. We propose MMICL to address the issue by considering both the model
and data perspectives. We introduce a well-designed architecture capable of
seamlessly integrating visual and textual context in an interleaved manner and
MIC dataset to reduce the gap between the training data and the complex user
prompts in real-world applications, including: 1) multi-modal context with
interleaved images and text, 2) textual references for each image, and 3)
multi-image data with spatial, logical, or temporal relationships. Our
experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new stat-of-the-art zero-shot and
few-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks,
especially for complex reasoning benchmarks including MME and MMBench. Our
analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively deals with the challenge of
complex multi-modal prompt understanding. The experiments on ScienceQA-IMG also
show that MMICL successfully alleviates the issue of language bias in VLMs,
which we believe is the reason behind the advanced performance of MMICL.

<p class="mathjax">While text-conditional 3D object generation and manipulation have seen rapid
progress, the evaluation of coherence between generated 3D shapes and input
textual descriptions lacks a clear benchmark. The reason is twofold: a) the low
quality of the textual descriptions in the only publicly available dataset of
text-shape pairs; b) the limited effectiveness of the metrics used to
quantitatively assess such coherence. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
solution that addresses both weaknesses. Firstly, we employ large language
models to automatically refine textual descriptions associated with shapes.
Secondly, we propose a quantitative metric to assess text-to-shape coherence,
through cross-attention mechanisms. To validate our approach, we conduct a user
study and compare quantitatively our metric with existing ones. The refined
dataset, the new metric and a set of text-shape pairs validated by the user
study comprise a novel, fine-grained benchmark that we publicly release to
foster research on text-to-shape coherence of text-conditioned 3D generative
models. Benchmark available at

<p class="mathjax">Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI
and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical
plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the
development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before
the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework,
UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language
commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain
of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by
the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact
regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model
(LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC,
and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To
facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan
that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse
scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned
scenes. The project page is at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/UniHSI .

<p class="mathjax">Creating diverse and high-quality 3D assets with an automatic generative
model is highly desirable. Despite extensive efforts on 3D generation, most
existing works focus on the generation of a single category or a few
categories. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based feed-forward
framework for synthesizing massive categories of real-world 3D objects with a
single generative model. Notably, there are three major challenges for this
large-vocabulary 3D generation: a) the need for expressive yet efficient 3D
representation; b) large diversity in geometry and texture across categories;
c) complexity in the appearances of real-world objects. To this end, we propose
a novel triplane-based 3D-aware Diffusion model with TransFormer, DiffTF, for
handling challenges via three aspects. 1) Considering efficiency and
robustness, we adopt a revised triplane representation and improve the fitting
speed and accuracy. 2) To handle the drastic variations in geometry and
texture, we regard the features of all 3D objects as a combination of
generalized 3D knowledge and specialized 3D features. To extract generalized 3D
knowledge from diverse categories, we propose a novel 3D-aware transformer with
shared cross-plane attention. It learns the cross-plane relations across
different planes and aggregates the generalized 3D knowledge with specialized
3D features. 3) In addition, we devise the 3D-aware encoder/decoder to enhance
the generalized 3D knowledge in the encoded triplanes for handling categories
with complex appearances. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and OmniObject3D
(over 200 diverse real-world categories) convincingly demonstrate that a single
DiffTF model achieves state-of-the-art large-vocabulary 3D object generation
performance with large diversity, rich semantics, and high quality.

<p class="mathjax">Conducting cognitive tests is time-consuming for patients and clinicians.
Wearable device-based prediction models allow for continuous health monitoring
under normal living conditions and could offer an alternative to identifying
older adults with cognitive impairments for early interventions. In this study,
we first derived novel wearable-based features related to circadian rhythms,
ambient light exposure, physical activity levels, sleep, and signal processing.
Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to
predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found
that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting
all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex,
education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depression
symptoms, and functional independence scores. In addition to uncovering
previously unidentified wearable-based features that are predictive of poor
cognition such as the standard deviation of the midpoints of each persons most
active 10-hour periods and least active 5-hour periods, our paper provides
proof-of-concept that wearable-based machine learning models can be used to
autonomously screen older adults for possible cognitive impairments. Such
models offer cost-effective alternatives to conducting initial screenings
manually in clinical settings.

<p class="mathjax">The study presents the concept of a computationally efficient machine
learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) in
an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG).
We computed different types of entropy from EEG signals and found that Fuzzy
Entropy performed the best in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG. We
also investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG
channels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features
(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.
The most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we
have found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal
components (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly
received from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,
we assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths
of EEG data (150-1000 samples). Because the computational complexity is reduced
by reducing the input data. As a result, we have achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 99.9% for a sample length (LEEG) of 1000 (~7.8 seconds), 98.2% with
a LEEG of 800 (~6.2 seconds), and 79.3% for LEEG = 150 (~1.2 seconds). By
reducing the number of features and segment lengths, the computational cost of
classification can be reduced. Lower-performance smart ML sensors can be used
in IoT environments for enhances human resilience to PD.

<p class="mathjax">Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects millions of
individuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure
detection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable
long-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices
with long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for
resource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,
the development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the
challenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new
lightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted
Cross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and
specificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The
proposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of
91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and
PEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority
voting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x
reduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for
implementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance
on two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power
(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves
an energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference
of only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best
ARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency. The
EpiDeNet-SSWCE method demonstrates effective and accurate seizure detection
performance on heavily imbalanced datasets, while being suited for
implementation on energy-constrained platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in
clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep
learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of
Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success
in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a
useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG,
which expands the application of masked autoencoders to ECG time series. We
construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of
diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under
the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters
performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation
studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training
schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both
private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly
outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification.

<p class="mathjax">The task of blind source separation (BSS) involves separating sources from a
mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. This is a
challenging problem that often requires making restrictive assumptions about
both the mixing system and the sources. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for addressing BSS of non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural
feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders with
fully self-supervised learning without strong priors. During the training
phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the
multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder
for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we
introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of
the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we
also introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity
between the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a
so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source
estimations. In order to carefully evaluate our method, we conduct experiments
on a toy dataset and with real-world biosignal recordings from a
polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration.

<p class="mathjax">In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to
process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of
the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on
convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network
(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature
extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural
network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain
high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists
of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network
(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional
features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.
Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the
coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series
factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural
network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual
mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual
load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the
proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy
and prediction stability.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of electronic science and technology, the research
on wearable devices is constantly updated, but for now, it is not comprehensive
for wearable devices to recognize and analyze the movement of specific sports.
Based on this, this paper improves wearable devices of table tennis sport, and
realizes the pattern recognition and evaluation of table tennis players' motor
skills through artificial intelligence. Firstly, a device is designed to
collect the movement information of table tennis players and the actual
movement data is processed. Secondly, a sliding window is made to divide the
collected motion data into a characteristic database of six table tennis
benchmark movements. Thirdly, motion features were constructed based on feature
engineering, and motor skills were identified for different models after
dimensionality reduction. Finally, the hierarchical evaluation system of motor
skills is established with the loss functions of different evaluation indexes.
The results show that in the recognition of table tennis players' motor skills,
the feature-based BP neural network proposed in this paper has higher
recognition accuracy and stronger generalization ability than the traditional
convolutional neural network.

<p class="mathjax">In the domain of cardiovascular healthcare, the Electrocardiogram (ECG)
serves as a critical, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Although recent strides in
self-supervised learning (SSL) have been promising for ECG representation
learning, these techniques often require annotated samples and struggle with
classes not present in the fine-tuning stages. To address these limitations, we
introduce ECG-Text Pre-training (ETP), an innovative framework designed to
learn cross-modal representations that link ECG signals with textual reports.
For the first time, this framework leverages the zero-shot classification task
in the ECG domain. ETP employs an ECG encoder along with a pre-trained language
model to align ECG signals with their corresponding textual reports. The
proposed framework excels in both linear evaluation and zero-shot
classification tasks, as demonstrated on the PTB-XL and CPSC2018 datasets,
showcasing its ability for robust and generalizable cross-modal ECG feature
learning.

<p class="mathjax">Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain
signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have
shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on
traditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data
like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess
non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper
proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which
does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively
represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph
convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG
signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial
attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection
performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and
hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These
strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest
network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are
conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second
time window, we achieve results of 90.0\% and 79.6\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,
respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the
experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed
DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100
times.

<p class="mathjax">Decoding visual representations from human brain activity has emerged as a
thriving research domain, particularly in the context of brain-computer
interfaces. Our study presents an innovative method that employs to classify
and reconstruct images from the ImageNet dataset using electroencephalography
(EEG) data from subjects that had viewed the images themselves (i.e. "brain
decoding"). We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants, each exposed to 50
images spanning 40 unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were
converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional
neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based
on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image
classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a
top-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various
RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction
mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to
generate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,
our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a
credible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for e.g. swift,
individualized feedback experiments. Our research represents a significant step
forward in connecting neural signals with visual cognition.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our
lifestyle, and facial respirators have become an essential part of daily life.
Nevertheless, the current respirators possess several limitations such as poor
respirator fit because they are incapable of covering diverse human facial
sizes and shapes, potentially diminishing the effect of wearing respirators. In
addition, the current facial respirators do not inform the user of the air
quality within the smart facepiece respirator in case of continuous long-term
use. Here, we demonstrate the novel smart N-95 filtering facepiece respirator
that incorporates the humidity sensor and pressure sensory feedback-enabled
self-fit adjusting functionality for the effective performance of the facial
respirator to prevent the transmission of airborne pathogens. The laser-induced
graphene (LIG) constitutes the humidity sensor, and the pressure sensor array
based on the dielectric elastomeric sponge monitors the respirator contact on
the face of the user, providing the sensory information for a closed-loop
feedback mechanism. As a result of the self-fit adjusting mode along with
elastomeric lining, the fit factor is increased by 3.20 and 5 times at average
and maximum respectively. We expect that the experimental proof-of-concept of
this work will offer viable solutions to the current commercial respirators to
address the limitations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an innovative approach to address the pressing concern of
fall incidents among the elderly by developing an accurate fall detection

accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, with deep learning models, specifically
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Real-time execution capabilities are
achieved through the integration of Raspberry Pi hardware. We introduce pruning

precision, aiming to accurately identify falls and minimize false negatives for
timely intervention. Extensive experimentation and meticulous evaluation
demonstrate remarkable performance metrics, emphasizing a high recall rate
while maintaining a specificity of 96\%. Our research culminates in a
state-of-the-art fall detection system that promptly sends notifications,
ensuring vulnerable individuals receive timely assistance and improve their

<p class="mathjax">Sleep, a fundamental physiological process, occupies a significant portion of
our lives. Accurate classification of sleep stages serves as a crucial tool for
evaluating sleep quality and identifying probable sleep disorders. This work
introduces a novel methodology that utilises a SE-Resnet-Bi-LSTM architecture
to classify sleep into five separate stages. The classification process is
based on the analysis of single-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs). The
framework that has been suggested consists of two fundamental elements: a
feature extractor that utilises SE-ResNet, and a temporal context encoder that
use stacks of Bi-LSTM units.The effectiveness of our approach is substantiated
by thorough assessments conducted on three different datasets, namely
SLeepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS. Significantly, our methodology attains
notable levels of accuracy, specifically 87.5\%, 83.9\%, and 87.8\%, along with
macro-F1 scores of 82.5, 78.9, and 81.9 for the corresponding datasets.
Notably, we introduce the utilization of 1D-GradCAM visualization to shed light
on the decision-making process of our model in the realm of sleep stage
classification. This visualization method not only provides valuable insights
into the model's classification rationale but also aligns its outcomes with the
annotations made by sleep experts. One notable feature of our research is the
integration of an expedited training approach, which effectively preserves the
model's resilience in terms of performance. The experimental evaluations
conducted provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our
proposed model in comparison to existing approaches, highlighting its potential
for practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">We propose EEG-SimpleConv, a straightforward 1D convolutional neural network
for Motor Imagery decoding in BCI. Our main motivation is to propose a very
simple baseline to compare to, using only very standard ingredients from the
literature. We evaluate its performance on four EEG Motor Imagery datasets,
including simulated online setups, and compare it to recent Deep Learning and
Machine Learning approaches. EEG-SimpleConv is at least as good or far more
efficient than other approaches, showing strong knowledge-transfer capabilities
across subjects, at the cost of a low inference time. We advocate that using
off-the-shelf ingredients rather than coming with ad-hoc solutions can
significantly help the adoption of Deep Learning approaches for BCI. We make
the code of the models and the experiments accessible.

<p class="mathjax">This article summarizes a systematic review of the electroencephalography
(EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is
twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably
eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific
nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations
in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis
revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of
a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few
studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for
real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a
single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date
during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as
black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for
classifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power
provided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested
that interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive
workload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the
non-stationary nature of the signal.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel hybrid Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system
designed specifically for resource-constrained robots. The proposed approach
combines Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with deep learning models and leverages
socket programming to distribute processing tasks effectively. In this
architecture, the HMM-based processing takes place within the robot, while a
separate PC handles the deep learning model. This synergy between HMMs and deep
learning enhances speech recognition accuracy significantly. We conducted
experiments across various robotic platforms, demonstrating real-time and
precise speech recognition capabilities. Notably, the system exhibits
adaptability to changing acoustic conditions and compatibility with low-power
hardware, making it highly effective in environments with limited computational
resources. This hybrid ASR paradigm opens up promising possibilities for
seamless human-robot interaction. In conclusion, our research introduces a
pioneering dimension to ASR techniques tailored for robotics. By employing
socket programming to distribute processing tasks across distinct devices and
strategically combining HMMs with deep learning models, our hybrid ASR system
showcases its potential to enable robots to comprehend and respond to spoken
language adeptly, even in environments with restricted computational resources.
This paradigm sets a innovative course for enhancing human-robot interaction
across a wide range of real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Topological signal processing (TSP) utilizes simplicial complexes to model
structures with higher order than vertices and edges. In this paper, we study
the transferability of TSP via a generalized higher-order version of graphon,
known as complexon. We recall the notion of a complexon as the limit of a
simplicial complex sequence [1]. Inspired by the integral operator form of
graphon shift operators, we construct a marginal complexon and complexon shift
operator (CSO) according to components of all possible dimensions from the
complexon. We investigate the CSO's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and relate
them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a
simplicial complex sequence converges to a complexon, the eigenvalues of the
corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon. These results hint
at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex
sequences, which generalize the graphon signal processing framework.

<p class="mathjax">Human activity recognition (HAR) is an essential research field that has been
used in different applications including home and workplace automation,
security and surveillance as well as healthcare. Starting from conventional
machine learning methods to the recently developing deep learning techniques
and the Internet of things, significant contributions have been shown in the
HAR area in the last decade. Even though several review and survey studies have
been published, there is a lack of sensor-based HAR overview studies focusing
on summarising the usage of wearable sensors and smart home sensors data as
well as applications of HAR and deep learning techniques. Hence, we overview
sensor-based HAR, discuss several important applications that rely on HAR, and
highlight the most common machine learning methods that have been used for HAR.
Finally, several challenges of HAR are explored that should be addressed to
further improve the robustness of HAR.

<p class="mathjax">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has served as a powerful
analytical tool for studying molecular structure and dynamics in chemistry and
biology. However, the processing of raw data acquired from NMR spectrometers
and subsequent quantitative analysis involves various specialized tools, which
necessitates comprehensive knowledge in programming and NMR. Particularly, the
emerging deep learning tools is hard to be widely used in NMR due to the
sophisticated setup of computation. Thus, NMR processing is not an easy task
for chemist and biologists. In this work, we present CloudBrain-NMR, an
intelligent online cloud computing platform designed for NMR data reading,
processing, reconstruction, and quantitative analysis. The platform is
conveniently accessed through a web browser, eliminating the need for any

<p class="mathjax">One of the common human diseases is sleep disorders. The classification of
sleep stages plays a fundamental role in diagnosing sleep disorders, monitoring
treatment effectiveness, and understanding the relationship between sleep
stages and various health conditions. A precise and efficient classification of
these stages can significantly enhance our understanding of sleep-related
phenomena and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and disease
treatment.
<br />Models others propose are often time-consuming and lack sufficient accuracy,
especially in stage N1. The main objective of this research is to present a
machine-learning model called "EEGMobile". This model utilizes pre-trained
models and learns from electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms of brain
signals. The model achieved an accuracy of 86.97% on a publicly available
dataset named "Sleep-EDF20", outperforming other models proposed by different
researchers. Moreover, it recorded an accuracy of 56.4% in stage N1, which is
better than other models. These findings demonstrate that this model has the
potential to achieve better results for the treatment of this disease.

<p class="mathjax">In global healthcare, respiratory diseases are a leading cause of mortality,
underscoring the need for rapid and accurate diagnostics. To advance rapid
screening techniques via auscultation, our research focuses on employing one of
the largest publicly available medical database of respiratory sounds to train
multiple machine learning models able to classify different health conditions.
Our method combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and spectral analysis to
extract physiologically relevant biosignals from acoustic data, closely tied to
cardiovascular and respiratory patterns, making our approach apart in its
departure from conventional audio feature extraction practices. We use Power
Spectral Density analysis and filtering techniques to select Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with underlying physiological phenomena.
These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for
predictive modeling. Initially, we deploy a binary classification model that
demonstrates a balanced accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between healthy and
diseased individuals. Subsequently, we employ a six-class classification model
that achieves a balanced accuracy of 72% in diagnosing specific respiratory
conditions like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
the first time, we also introduce regression models that estimate age and body
mass index (BMI) based solely on acoustic data, as well as a model for gender
classification. Our findings underscore the potential of this approach to
significantly enhance assistive and remote diagnostic capabilities.

precision medicine, intelligent healthcare, and telemedicine in the era of

four triboelectric sensors into a wristband to detect and analyze limb

patients, which includes location/trajectory tracking, heart monitoring and
identity recognition. This innovative approach enabled us to accurately capture

providing insightful feedback and comprehensive assessment of the patients

<p class="mathjax">Ball bearings find widespread use in various manufacturing and mechanical
domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the
field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few
studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure
is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time
to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing
data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in
frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several
survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and
covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and
entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow
us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate
our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a
0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best
is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates
further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive
maintenance.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in healthcare,
outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.

<p class="mathjax">The discovery of governing equations from data has been an active field of
research for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse
regression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,
noisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy
approach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear
governing equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of
neural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data
so that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but
also the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.
Additionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy
framework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we
obtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic
differentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further
incorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple
initial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology
to discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of
several examples and compare its performance with existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Variational algorithms require architectures that naturally constrain the
optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating
broader applicability to other real-world problems.

<p class="mathjax">Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few
years, is a new way of studying the interplay between algebra and geometry. It
replaces the concept of a topological space by a more sophisticated but
better-behaved idea, namely that of a condensed set. Central to the theory are
solid abelian groups and liquid vector spaces, analogues of complete
topological groups.
<br />N\"obeling's theorem, a surprising result from the 1960s about the structure
of the abelian group of continuous maps from a profinite space to the integers,
is a crucial ingredient in the theory of solid abelian groups; without it one
cannot give any nonzero examples of solid abelian groups. We discuss a recently
completed formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and give a
more detailed proof than those previously available in the literature. The
proof is somewhat unusual in that it requires induction over ordinals -- a
technique which has not previously been used to a great extent in formalised
mathematics.

<p class="mathjax">Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease which primarily
affects the joint's synovial tissue. It is a highly heterogeneous disease, with
wide cellular and molecular variability observed in synovial tissues. Over the
last two decades, the methods available for their study have advanced
considerably. In particular, Immunohistochemistry stains are well suited to
highlighting the functional organisation of samples. Yet, analysis of
IHC-stained synovial tissue samples is still overwhelmingly done manually and
semi-quantitatively by expert pathologists. This is because in addition to the
fragmented nature of IHC stained synovial tissue, there exist wide variations
in intensity and colour, strong clinical centre batch effect, as well as the
presence of many undesirable artefacts present in gigapixel Whole Slide Images
(WSIs), such as water droplets, pen annotation, folded tissue, blurriness, etc.
There is therefore a strong need for a robust, repeatable automated tissue
segmentation algorithm which can cope with this variability and provide support
to imaging pipelines. We train a UNET on a hand-curated, heterogeneous
real-world multi-centre clinical dataset R4RA, which contains multiple types of
IHC staining. The model obtains a DICE score of 0.865 and successfully segments
different types of IHC staining, as well as dealing with variance in colours,
intensity and common WSIs artefacts from the different clinical centres. It can
be used as the first step in an automated image analysis pipeline for synovial
tissue samples stained with IHC, increasing speed, reproducibility and
robustness.

<p class="mathjax">Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in
genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.

<p class="mathjax">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often
emerges in early childhood. ASD assessment typically involves an observation
protocol including note-taking and ratings of child's social behavior conducted
by a trained clinician. A robust machine learning (ML) model that is capable of
labeling adult and child audio has the potential to save significant time and
labor in manual coding children's behaviors. This may assist clinicians capture
events of interest, better communicate events with parents, and educate new
clinicians. In this study, we leverage the self-supervised learning model,
Wav2Vec 2.0 (W2V2), pretrained on 4300h of home recordings of children under 5
years old, to build a unified system that performs both speaker diarization
(SD) and vocalization classification (VC) tasks. We apply this system to
two-channel audio recordings of brief 3-5 minute clinician-child interactions
using the Rapid-ABC corpus. We propose a novel technique by introducing
auxiliary features extracted from W2V2-based automatic speech recognition (ASR)
system for children under 4 years old to improve children's VC task. We test
our proposed method of improving children's VC task on two corpora (Rapid-ABC
and BabbleCor) and observe consistent improvements. Furthermore, we reach, or
perhaps outperform, the state-of-the-art performance of BabbleCor.

extraordinary ability to handle classically intractable problems. To realize
its potential, however, quantum computers need to scale to millions of qubits,
a feat that will require addressing fascinating yet extremely challenging

<p class="mathjax">Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has emerged as a framework to solve
sequential decision-making tasks, showcasing empirical quantum advantages. A
notable development is through quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) for
memory-intensive tasks such as partially observable environments. However, QRL
models incorporating QRNN encounter challenges such as inefficient training of
QRL with QRNN, given that the computation of gradients in QRNN is both
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents a novel
approach to address this challenge by constructing QRL agents utilizing
QRNN-based reservoirs, specifically employing quantum long short-term memory
(QLSTM). QLSTM parameters are randomly initialized and fixed without training.
The model is trained using the asynchronous advantage actor-aritic (A3C)
algorithm. Through numerical simulations, we validate the efficacy of our
QLSTM-Reservoir RL framework. Its performance is assessed on standard
benchmarks, demonstrating comparable results to a fully trained QLSTM RL model
with identical architecture and training settings.

<p class="mathjax">A major challenge in imaging genetics and similar fields is to link
high-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional
data in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the
area are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging
phenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
each pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously
successful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.
Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest
or that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work
we introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term
Cluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in
both domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the
framework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single
input features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the
genetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000
subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant
locus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes. We found that a
vast majority of these loci could be technically validated at a high rate:
using classic GWAS or Genome-Wide Inferred Statistics (GWIS) we found that 85
locus-phenotype pairs exceeded the genome-wide suggestive (P&lt;1e-05) threshold.

investigate a CAV system consisting of multiple vehicles that transmit

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks have shown many fruitful applications in this decade. A
network can get the generalized function through training with a finite
dataset. The degree of generalization is a realization of the proximity scale
in the data space. Specifically, the scale is not clear if the dataset is
complicated. Here we consider a network for the distribution estimation of the
dataset. We show the estimation is unstable and the instability depends on the
data density and training duration. We derive the kernel-balanced equation,
which gives a short phenomenological description of the solution. The equation
tells us the reason for the instability and the mechanism of the scale. The
network outputs a local average of the dataset as a prediction and the scale of
averaging is determined along the equation. The scale gradually decreases along
training and finally results in instability in our case.

<p class="mathjax">Attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) speech recognition model has been
widely successful in recent years. However, the joint optimization of acoustic
model and language model in end-to-end manner has created challenges for text

has become a primary concern for deploying AED systems in industry. To address
this issue, we propose a novel model, the hybrid attention-based

of conventional hybrid automatic speech recognition systems. Our HAED model
separates the acoustic and language models, allowing for the use of
conventional text-based language model adaptation techniques. We demonstrate
that the proposed HAED model yields 21\% Word Error Rate (WER) improvements in
relative when out-of-domain text data is used for language model adaptation,
and with only a minor degradation in WER on a general test set compared with
conventional AED model.

<p class="mathjax">Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) is the task of generating natural language
descriptions given an audio stream. A typical AAC system requires manually
curated training data of audio segments and corresponding text caption
annotations. The creation of these audio-caption pairs is costly, resulting in
general data scarcity for the task. In this work, we address this major
limitation and propose an approach to train AAC systems using only text. Our
approach leverages the multimodal space of contrastively trained audio-text
models, such as CLAP. During training, a decoder generates captions conditioned
on the pretrained CLAP text encoder. During inference, the text encoder is
replaced with the pretrained CLAP audio encoder. To bridge the modality gap
between text and audio embeddings, we propose the use of noise injection or a
learnable adapter, during training. We find that the proposed text-only
framework performs competitively with state-of-the-art models trained with
paired audio, showing that efficient text-to-audio transfer is possible.
Finally, we showcase both stylized audio captioning and caption enrichment
while training without audio or human-created text captions.

We present the Video Conferencing Dataset (VCD) for evaluating video codecs for
real-time communication, the first such dataset focused on video conferencing.
VCD includes a wide variety of camera qualities and spatial and temporal
information. It includes both desktop and mobile scenarios and two types of
video background processing. We report the compression efficiency of H.264,
H.265, H.266, and AV1 in low-delay settings on VCD and compare it with the
non-video conferencing datasets UVC, MLC-JVC, and HEVC. The results show the
source quality and the scenarios have a significant effect on the compression
efficiency of all the codecs. VCD enables the evaluation and tuning of codecs
for this important scenario. The VCD is publicly available as an open-source

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) proficiency in speech-related tasks has driven
research into utilizing discrete tokens for speech tasks like recognition and
translation, which offer lower storage requirements and great potential to
employ natural language processing techniques. However, these studies, mainly
single-task focused, faced challenges like overfitting and performance
degradation in speech recognition tasks, often at the cost of sacrificing
performance in multi-task scenarios. This study presents a comprehensive
comparison and optimization of discrete tokens generated by various leading SSL
models in speech recognition and synthesis tasks. We aim to explore the
universality of speech discrete tokens across multiple speech tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that discrete tokens achieve comparable
results against systems trained on FBank features in speech recognition tasks
and outperform mel-spectrogram features in speech synthesis in subjective and
objective metrics. These findings suggest that universal discrete tokens have
enormous potential in various speech-related tasks. Our work is open-source and
publicly available to facilitate research in this direction.

<p class="mathjax">Subjective speech quality assessment is the gold standard for evaluating
speech enhancement processing and telecommunication systems. The commonly used
standard ITU-T Rec. P.800 defines how to measure speech quality in lab
environments, and ITU-T Rec.~P.808 extended it for crowdsourcing. ITU-T Rec.
P.835 extends P.800 to measure the quality of speech in the presence of noise.
ITU-T Rec. P.804 targets the conversation test and introduces perceptual speech
quality dimensions which are measured during the listening phase of the
conversation. The perceptual dimensions are noisiness, coloration,
discontinuity, and loudness. We create a crowdsourcing implementation of a
multi-dimensional subjective test following the scales from P.804 and extend it
to include reverberation, the speech signal, and overall quality. We show the
tool is both accurate and reproducible. The tool has been used in the ICASSP
2023 Speech Signal Improvement challenge and we show the utility of these
speech quality dimensions in this challenge. The tool will be publicly
available as open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/P.808.

<p class="mathjax">Prompts are crucial to large language models as they provide context
information such as topic or logical relationships. Inspired by this, we
propose PromptASR, a framework that integrates prompts in end-to-end automatic
speech recognition (E2E ASR) systems to achieve contextualized ASR with
controllable style of transcriptions. Specifically, a dedicated text encoder
encodes the text prompts and the encodings are injected into the speech encoder
by cross-attending the features from two modalities. When using the ground
truth text from preceding utterances as content prompt, the proposed system
achieves 21.9% and 6.8% relative word error rate reductions on a book reading
dataset and an in-house dataset compared to a baseline ASR system. The system
can also take word-level biasing lists as prompt to improve recognition
accuracy on rare words. An additional style prompt can be given to the text
encoder and guide the ASR system to output different styles of transcriptions.
The code is available at icefall.

<p class="mathjax">Complex adaptive systems (CASs), from ecosystems to economies, are open
systems and inherently dependent on external conditions. While a system can
transition from one state to another based on the magnitude of change in
external conditions, the rate of change -- irrespective of magnitude -- may
also lead to system state changes due to a phenomenon known as a rate-induced
transition (RIT). This study presents a novel framework that captures RITs in
CASs through a local model and a network extension where each node contributes
to the structural adaptability of others. Our findings reveal how RITs occur at
a critical environmental change rate, with lower-degree nodes tipping first due
to fewer connections and reduced adaptive capacity. High-degree nodes tip later
as their adaptability sources (lower-degree nodes) collapse. This pattern
persists across various network structures. Our study calls for an extended
perspective when managing CASs, emphasizing the need to focus not only on
thresholds of external conditions but also the rate at which those conditions
change, particularly in the context of the collapse of surrounding systems that
contribute to the focal system's resilience. Our analytical method opens a path
to designing management policies that mitigate RIT impacts and enhance
resilience in ecological, social, and socioecological systems. These policies
could include controlling environmental change rates, fostering system
adaptability, implementing adaptive management strategies, and building
capacity and knowledge exchange. Our study contributes to the understanding of
RIT dynamics and informs effective management strategies for complex adaptive
systems in the face of rapid environmental change.

<p class="mathjax">The myriad complex systems with multiway interactions motivate the extension
of graph-based pairwise connections to higher-order relations. In particular,
the simplicial complex has inspired generalizations of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to simplicial complex-based models. Learning on such systems requires
large amounts of data, which can be expensive or impossible to obtain. We
propose data augmentation of simplicial complexes through both linear and
nonlinear mixup mechanisms that return mixtures of existing labeled samples. In
addition to traditional pairwise mixup, we present a convex clustering mixup
approach for a data-driven relationship among several simplicial complexes. We
theoretically demonstrate that the resultant synthetic simplicial complexes
interpolate among existing data with respect to homomorphism densities. Our
method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets for simplicial
complex classification.

<p class="mathjax">Heart auscultations are a low-cost and effective way of detecting valvular
heart diseases early, which can save lives. Nevertheless, it has been difficult
to scale this screening method since the effectiveness of auscultations is
dependent on the skill of doctors. As such, there has been increasing research
interest in the automatic classification of heart sounds using deep learning
algorithms. However, it is currently difficult to develop good heart sound
classification models due to the limited data available for training. In this
work, we propose a simple time domain approach, to the heart sound
classification problem with a base classification error rate of 0.8 and show
that augmentation of the data through codec simulation can improve the
classification error rate to 0.2. With data augmentation, our approach
outperforms the existing time-domain CNN-BiLSTM baseline model. Critically, our
experiments show that codec data augmentation is effective in getting around
the data limitation.

<p class="mathjax">A $k$-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph where each $k$-hyperedge has exactly
$k$ vertices. A $k$-homogeneous access structure is represented by a
$k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, in which the participants correspond to
the vertices of hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. A set of vertices can reconstruct the
secret value from their shares if they are connected by a $k$-hyperedge, while
a set of non-adjacent vertices does not obtain any information about the
secret. One parameter for measuring the efficiency of a secret sharing scheme
is the information rate, defined as the ratio between the length of the secret
and the maximum length of the shares given to the participants. Secret sharing
schemes with an information rate equal to one are called ideal secret sharing
schemes. An access structure is considered ideal if an ideal secret sharing
scheme can realize it. Characterizing ideal access structures is one of the
important problems in secret sharing schemes. The characterization of ideal
access structures has been studied by many authors~\cite{BD, CT,JZB,
FP1,FP2,DS1,TD}. In this paper, we characterize ideal $k$-homogeneous access
structures using the independent sequence method. In particular, we prove that
the reduced access structure of $\Gamma$ is an $(k, n)$-threshold access
structure when the optimal information rate of $\Gamma$ is larger than
$\frac{k-1}{k}$, where $\Gamma$ is a $k$-homogeneous access structure
satisfying specific criteria.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of this work is to improve musculoskeletal-based models of the
upper-limb Wrench Feasible Set i.e. the set of achievable maximal wrenches at
the hand for applications in collaborative robotics and computer aided
ergonomics. In particular, a recent method performing wrench capacity
evaluation called the Iterative Convex Hull Method is upgraded in order to
integrate non dislocation and compression limitation constraints at the
glenohumeral joint not taken into account in the available models. Their
effects on the amplitude of the force capacities at the hand, glenohumeral
joint reaction forces and upper-limb muscles coordination in comparison to the
original iterative convex hull method are investigated in silico. The results
highlight the glenohumeral potential dislocation for the majority of elements
of the wrench feasible set with the original Iterative Convex Hull method and
the fact that the modifications satisfy correctly stability constraints at the
glenohumeral joint. Also, the induced muscles coordination pattern favors the
action of stabilizing muscles, in particular the rotator-cuff muscles, and
lowers that of known potential destabilizing ones according to the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning methods have achieved promising performance for
anomalous sound detection (ASD) under domain shift, where the type of domain
shift is considered in feature learning by incorporating section IDs. However,
the attributes accompanying audio files under each section, such as machine
operating conditions and noise types, have not been considered, although they
are also crucial for characterizing domain shifts. In this paper, we present a
hierarchical metadata information constrained self-supervised (HMIC) ASD
method, where the hierarchical relation between section IDs and attributes is
constructed, and used as constraints to obtain finer feature representation. In
addition, we propose an attribute-group-center (AGC)-based method for
calculating the anomaly score under the domain shift condition. Experiments are
performed to demonstrate its improved performance over the state-of-the-art
self-supervised methods in DCASE 2022 challenge Task 2.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims at the algorithmic/theoretical core of reinforcement learning
(RL) by introducing the novel class of proximal Bellman mappings. These
mappings are defined in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), to benefit
from the rich approximation properties and inner product of RKHSs, they are
shown to belong to the powerful Hilbertian family of (firmly) nonexpansive
mappings, regardless of the values of their discount factors, and possess ample
degrees of design freedom to even reproduce attributes of the classical Bellman
mappings and to pave the way for novel RL designs. An approximate
policy-iteration scheme is built on the proposed class of mappings to solve the
problem of selecting online, at every time instance, the "optimal" exponent $p$
in a $p$-norm loss to combat outliers in linear adaptive filtering, without
training data and any knowledge on the statistical properties of the outliers.
Numerical tests on synthetic data showcase the superior performance of the
proposed framework over several non-RL and kernel-based RL schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Speech anonymisation prevents misuse of spoken data by removing any personal
identifier while preserving at least linguistic content. However, emotion
preservation is crucial for natural human-computer interaction. The well-known
voice conversion technique StarGANv2-VC achieves anonymisation but fails to
preserve emotion. This work presents an any-to-many semi-supervised
StarGANv2-VC variant trained on partially emotion-labelled non-parallel data.
We propose emotion-aware losses computed on the emotion embeddings and acoustic
features correlated to emotion. Additionally, we use an emotion classifier to
provide direct emotion supervision. Objective and subjective evaluations show
that the proposed approach significantly improves emotion preservation over the
vanilla StarGANv2-VC. This considerable improvement is seen over diverse
datasets, emotions, target speakers, and inter-group conversions without
compromising intelligibility and anonymisation.

<p class="mathjax">Voice conversion (VC) transforms an utterance to sound like another person
without changing the linguistic content. A recently proposed generative
adversarial network-based VC method, StarGANv2-VC is very successful in
generating natural-sounding conversions. However, the method fails to preserve
the emotion of the source speaker in the converted samples. Emotion
preservation is necessary for natural human-computer interaction. In this
paper, we show that StarGANv2-VC fails to disentangle the speaker and emotion
representations, pertinent to preserve emotion. Specifically, there is an
emotion leakage from the reference audio used to capture the speaker embeddings
while training. To counter the problem, we propose novel emotion-aware losses
and an unsupervised method which exploits emotion supervision through latent
emotion representations. The objective and subjective evaluations prove the
efficacy of the proposed strategy over diverse datasets, emotions, gender, etc.

<p class="mathjax">In spite of the excellent strides made by end-to-end (E2E) models in speech
recognition in recent years, named entity recognition is still challenging but
critical for semantic understanding. In order to enhance the ability to
recognize named entities in E2E models, previous studies mainly focus on
various rule-based or attention-based contextual biasing algorithms. However,
their performance might be sensitive to the biasing weight or degraded by
excessive attention to the named entity list, along with a risk of false
triggering. Inspired by the success of the class-based language model (LM) in
named entity recognition in conventional hybrid systems and the effective
decoupling of acoustic and linguistic information in the factorized neural
Transducer (FNT), we propose a novel E2E model to incorporate class-based LMs
into FNT, which is referred as C-FNT. In C-FNT, the language model score of
named entities can be associated with the name class instead of its surface
form. The experimental results show that our proposed C-FNT presents
significant error reduction in named entities without hurting performance in
general word recognition.

<p class="mathjax">In the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the variational posterior often aligns
closely with the prior, which is known as posterior collapse and hinders the
quality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable
hyperparameter beta has been introduced in the VAE. This paper presents a
closed-form expression to assess the relationship between the beta in VAE, the
dataset size, the posterior collapse, and the rate-distortion curve by
analyzing a minimal VAE in a high-dimensional limit. These results clarify that
a long plateau in the generalization error emerges with a relatively larger
beta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes
infinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta,
unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse
regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires
careful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the
rate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a
rate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support
our analysis.

two-levels quantum states known as qubits. Current physical realizations of
qubits require a careful calibration, composed by different experiments, due to
noise and decoherence phenomena. Among the different characterization
experiments, a crucial step is to develop a model to classify the measured

<p class="mathjax">Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) aims to decode the attended
spatial location with EEG in a multiple-speaker setting. ASAD methods are
inspired by the brain lateralization of cortical neural responses during the
processing of auditory spatial attention, and show promising performance for
the task of auditory attention decoding (AAD) with neural recordings. In the
previous ASAD methods, the spatial distribution of EEG electrodes is not fully
exploited, which may limit the performance of these methods. In the present
work, by transforming the original EEG channels into a two-dimensional (2D)
spatial topological map, the EEG data is transformed into a three-dimensional
(3D) arrangement containing spatial-temporal information. And then a 3D deep
convolutional neural network (DenseNet-3D) is used to extract temporal and
spatial features of the neural representation for the attended locations. The
results show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with
1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the

<p class="mathjax">Computational complexity is critical when deploying deep learning-based
speech denoising models for on-device applications. Most prior research focused
on optimizing model architectures to meet specific computational cost
constraints, often creating distinct neural network architectures for different
complexity limitations. This study conducts complexity scaling for speech
denoising tasks, aiming to consolidate models with various complexities into a
unified architecture. We present a Multi-Path Transform-based (MPT)
architecture to handle both low- and high-complexity scenarios. A series of MPT
networks present high performance covering a wide range of computational
complexities on the DNS challenge dataset. Moreover, inspired by the scaling
experiments in natural language processing, we explore the empirical
relationship between model performance and computational cost on the denoising
task. As the complexity number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) is
scaled from 50M/s to 15G/s on MPT networks, we observe a linear increase in the
values of PESQ-WB and SI-SNR, proportional to the logarithm of MACs, which
might contribute to the understanding and application of complexity scaling in
speech denoising tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) play a vital role in using quantum
resources for supervised machine learning tasks, such as classification.
However, current methods are strongly limited in terms of scalability on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose a novel
approach called the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) enhanced QSVM.
This is built upon our idea of utilizing the variational quantum linear solver
to solve system of linear equations of a least squares-SVM on a NISQ device.
The implementation of our approach is evaluated by an extensive series of
numerical experiments with the Iris dataset, which consists of three distinct
iris plant species. Based on this, we explore the practicality and
effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a classifier capable of
classification in a feature space ranging from one to seven dimensions.
Furthermore, by strategically exploiting both classical and quantum computing
for various subroutines of our algorithm, we effectively mitigate practical
challenges associated with the implementation. These include significant
improvement in the trainability of the variational ansatz and notable
reductions in run-time for cost calculations. Based on the numerical
experiments, our approach exhibits the capability of identifying a separating
hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space. Moreover, it consistently
demonstrated strong performance across various instances with the same dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Polar duality is a well-known concept from convex geometry and analysis. In
the present paper, we study two symplectically covariant versions of polar
duality keeping in mind their applications to quantum mechanics. The first
variant makes use of the symplectic form on phase space and allows a precise
study of the covariance matrix of a density operator. The latter is a
fundamental object in quantum information theory., The second variant is a
symplectically covariant version of the usual polar duality highlighting the
role played by Lagrangian planes. It allows us to define the notion of
"geometric quantum states" with are in bijection with generalized Gaussians.

<p class="mathjax">Computational pathology uses artificial intelligence to enable precision
medicine and decision support systems through the analysis of whole slide
images. It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific
computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development.
To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep
neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using
self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and
eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of
magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks
including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level
biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on
internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as
well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for
pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite
instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The
gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive
pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could
continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited
amounts of training data are available, such as drug outcome prediction.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of approximating the regression function from noisy
vector-valued data by an online learning algorithm using an appropriate
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm,
i.i.d. samples become available one by one by a random process and are
successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. We
are interested in the asymptotic performance of such online approximation
algorithms and show that the expected squared error in the RKHS norm can be
bounded by $C^2 (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)}$, where $m$ is the current number of processed
data, the parameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption
on the regression function and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the
input noise, the smoothness of the regression function and further parameters
of the algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as a transformative force in
assistive technologies, empowering individuals with motor impairments by
enabling device control and facilitating functional recovery. However, the
persistent challenge of inter-session variability poses a significant hurdle,
requiring time-consuming calibration at every new use. Compounding this issue,
the low comfort level of current devices further restricts their usage. To
address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive solution that combines a
tiny CNN-based Transfer Learning (TL) approach with a comfortable, wearable EEG
headband. The novel wearable EEG device features soft dry electrodes placed on
the headband and is capable of on-board processing. We acquire multiple
sessions of motor-movement EEG data and achieve up to 96% inter-session
accuracy using TL, greatly reducing the calibration time and improving
usability. By executing the inference on the edge every 100ms, the system is
estimated to achieve 30h of battery life. The comfortable BMI setup with tiny
CNN and TL paves the way to future on-device continual learning, essential for
tackling inter-session variability and improving usability.

<p class="mathjax">Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based neural vocoders have been widely
used in audio synthesis tasks due to their high generation quality, efficient
inference, and small computation footprint. However, it is still challenging to
train a universal vocoder which can generalize well to out-of-domain (OOD)
scenarios, such as unseen speaking styles, non-speech vocalization, singing,
and musical pieces. In this work, we propose SnakeGAN, a GAN-based universal
vocoder, which can synthesize high-fidelity audio in various OOD scenarios.
SnakeGAN takes a coarse-grained signal generated by a differentiable digital
signal processing (DDSP) model as prior knowledge, aiming at recovering
high-fidelity waveform from a Mel-spectrogram. We introduce periodic
nonlinearities through the Snake activation function and anti-aliased
representation into the generator, which further brings the desired inductive
bias for audio synthesis and significantly improves the extrapolation capacity
for universal vocoding in unseen scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, we train SnakeGAN with only speech data and evaluate its
performance for various OOD distributions with both subjective and objective
metrics. Experimental results show that SnakeGAN significantly outperforms the
compared approaches and can generate high-fidelity audio samples including
unseen speakers with unseen styles, singing voices, instrumental pieces, and
nonverbal vocalization.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new debiasing framework for high-dimensional linear regression
that bypasses the restrictions on covariate distributions imposed by modern
debiasing technology. We study the prevalent setting where the number of
features and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,
state-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to
remove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,
this method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates
follow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix
estimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)
covariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)
rows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable
feature covariance estimates are lacking.
<br />To address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is
a rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size
determined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,
we assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the
orthogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations
where traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column
dependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank
structures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator
(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a
consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance. Lastly, we introduce a
debiased Principal Component Regression (PCR) technique using our
Spectrum-Aware approach. In varied simulations and real data experiments, we
observe that our method outperforms degrees-of-freedom debiasing by a margin.

<p class="mathjax">Speech emotion conversion is the task of converting the expressed emotion of
a spoken utterance to a target emotion while preserving the lexical content and
speaker identity. While most existing works in speech emotion conversion rely
on acted-out datasets and parallel data samples, in this work we specifically
focus on more challenging in-the-wild scenarios and do not rely on parallel
data. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based generative model for speech
emotion conversion, the EmoConv-Diff, that is trained to reconstruct an input
utterance while also conditioning on its emotion. Subsequently, at inference, a
target emotion embedding is employed to convert the emotion of the input
utterance to the given target emotion. As opposed to performing emotion
conversion on categorical representations, we use a continuous arousal
dimension to represent emotions while also achieving intensity control. We
validate the proposed methodology on a large in-the-wild dataset, the
MSP-Podcast v1.10. Our results show that the proposed diffusion model is indeed
capable of synthesizing speech with a controllable target emotion. Crucially,
the proposed approach shows improved performance along the extreme values of
arousal and thereby addresses a common challenge in the speech emotion
conversion literature.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a machine-learning framework to warm-start fixed-point
optimization algorithms. Our architecture consists of a neural network mapping
problem parameters to warm starts, followed by a predefined number of
fixed-point iterations. We propose two loss functions designed to either
minimize the fixed-point residual or the distance to a ground truth solution.
In this way, the neural network predicts warm starts with the end-to-end goal
of minimizing the downstream loss. An important feature of our architecture is
its flexibility, in that it can predict a warm start for fixed-point algorithms
run for any number of steps, without being limited to the number of steps it
has been trained on. We provide PAC-Bayes generalization bounds on unseen data
for common classes of fixed-point operators: contractive, linearly convergent,
and averaged. Applying this framework to well-known applications in control,
statistics, and signal processing, we observe a significant reduction in the
number of iterations and solution time required to solve these problems,
through learned warm starts.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic volatility models, where the volatility is a stochastic process,
can capture most of the essential stylized facts of implied volatility surfaces
and give more realistic dynamics of the volatility smile or skew. However, they
come with the significant issue that they take too long to calibrate.
<br />Alternative calibration methods based on Deep Learning (DL) techniques have
been recently used to build fast and accurate solutions to the calibration
problem. Huge and Savine developed a Differential Deep Learning (DDL) approach,
where Machine Learning models are trained on samples of not only features and
labels but also differentials of labels to features. The present work aims to
apply the DDL technique to price vanilla European options (i.e. the calibration
instruments), more specifically, puts when the underlying asset follows a
Heston model and then calibrate the model on the trained network. DDL allows
for fast training and accurate pricing. The trained neural network dramatically
reduces Heston calibration's computation time.
<br />In this work, we also introduce different regularisation techniques, and we
apply them notably in the case of the DDL. We compare their performance in
reducing overfitting and improving the generalisation error. The DDL
performance is also compared to the classical DL (without differentiation) one
in the case of Feed-Forward Neural Networks. We show that the DDL outperforms
the DL.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning was recently successfully used in deriving symmetry
transformations that preserve important physics quantities. Being completely
agnostic, these techniques postpone the identification of the discovered
symmetries to a later stage. In this letter we propose methods for examining
and identifying the group-theoretic structure of such machine-learned
symmetries. We design loss functions which probe the subalgebra structure
either during the deep learning stage of symmetry discovery or in a subsequent
post-processing stage. We illustrate the new methods with examples from the
U(n) Lie group family, obtaining the respective subalgebra decompositions. As
an application to particle physics, we demonstrate the identification of the
residual symmetries after the spontaneous breaking of non-Abelian gauge
symmetries like SU(3) and SU(5) which are commonly used in model building.

<p class="mathjax">Can we accelerate convergence of gradient descent without changing the
algorithm -- just by carefully choosing stepsizes? Surprisingly, we show that
the answer is yes. Our proposed Silver Stepsize Schedule optimizes strongly
convex functions in $k^{\log_{\rho} 2} \approx k^{0.7864}$ iterations, where
$\rho=1+\sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio and $k$ is the condition number. This is
intermediate between the textbook unaccelerated rate $k$ and the accelerated
rate $\sqrt{k}$ due to Nesterov in 1983. The non-strongly convex setting is
conceptually identical, and standard black-box reductions imply an analogous
accelerated rate $\varepsilon^{-\log_{\rho} 2} \approx \varepsilon^{-0.7864}$.
We conjecture and provide partial evidence that these rates are optimal among
all possible stepsize schedules.
<br />The Silver Stepsize Schedule is constructed recursively in a fully explicit
way. It is non-monotonic, fractal-like, and approximately periodic of period
$k^{\log_{\rho} 2}$. This leads to a phase transition in the convergence rate:
initially super-exponential (acceleration regime), then exponential (saturation
regime).

<p class="mathjax">In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.

<p class="mathjax">This study focuses on the use of genetic algorithms to optimize control
parameters in two potential strategies called mechanical and chemical control,
for mitigating the spread of Huanglongbing (HLB) in citrus orchards. By
developing a two-orchard model that incorporates the dispersal of the Asian
Citrus Psyllid (ACP), the cost functions and objective function are explored to
assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies. The mobility of
ACP is also taken into account to capture the disease dynamics more
realistically. Additionally, a mathematical expression for the global
reproduction number ($R_{0}$) is derived, allowing for sensitivity analysis of
the model parameters when ACP mobility is present. Furthermore, we
mathematically express the cost function and efficiency of the strategy in
terms of the final size and individual $R_{0}$ of each patch (i.e., when ACP
mobility is absent). The results obtained through the genetic algorithms reveal
optimal parameters for each control strategy, providing valuable insights for
decision-making in implementing effective control measures against HLB in
citrus orchards. This study highlights the importance of optimizing control
parameters in disease management in agriculture and provides a solid foundation
for future research in developing disease control strategies based on genetic
algorithms.
