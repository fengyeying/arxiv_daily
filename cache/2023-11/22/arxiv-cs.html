<p class="mathjax">In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of a plasma display
panel for a wide field of view desktop virtual reality environment. Present
commercial plasma displays are not designed with virtual reality in mind,
leading to several problems in generating stereo imagery and obtaining good
tracking information. Although we developed solutions for a number of these
problems, the limitations of the system preclude its current use in practical
applications, and point to issues that must be resolved for flat panel displays
to be useful for VR.

<p class="mathjax">Detection and characterization of hidden defects, impurities, and damages in
layered composites like Fibre laminates, e.g., Fibre Metal Laminates (FML), as
well as in monolithic materials, e.g., aluminum die casting materials, is still
a challenge. This work discusses methods and challenges in data-driven modeling
of automated damage and defect detectors using X-ray single- and
multi-projection (CT) images. Three main issues are identified: Data and
feature variance, data feature labeling (for supervised machine learning), and
the missing ground truth. It will be shown that only simulation of data can
deliver a ground truth data set and accurate labeling. Noise has significant
impact on the feature detection and will be discussed. Data-driven feature
detectors are implemented with semantic pixel- or z-profile Convolutional
Neural Networks and LSTM Auto-encoders. Data is measured with three different
devices: A low-quality and low-cost (Low-Q), a mid- and a high-quality
(micro-CT, Mid-/High-Q) device. The goals of this work are the training of
robust and generalized feature detectors with synthetic data and the transition
from High- and Mid-Q laboratory measuring technologies towards in-field usable
technologies and methods.

<p class="mathjax">Although 3D human pose estimation has gained impressive development in recent
years, only a few works focus on infants, that have different bone lengths and
also have limited data. Directly applying adult pose estimation models
typically achieves low performance in the infant domain and suffers from
out-of-distribution issues. Moreover, the limitation of infant pose data
collection also heavily constrains the efficiency of learning-based models to
lift 2D poses to 3D. To deal with the issues of small datasets, domain
adaptation and data augmentation are commonly used techniques. Following this
paradigm, we take advantage of an optimization-based method that utilizes
generative priors to predict 3D infant keypoints from 2D keypoints without the
need of large training data. We further apply a guided diffusion model to
domain adapt 3D adult pose to infant pose to supplement small datasets.
Besides, we also prove that our method, ZeDO-i, could attain efficient domain
adaptation, even if only a small number of data is given. Quantitatively, we
claim that our model attains state-of-the-art MPJPE performance of 43.6 mm on
the SyRIP dataset and 21.2 mm on the MINI-RGBD dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Unlearning is the process of removing specific training data samples
and their corresponding effects from an already trained model. It has
significant practical benefits, such as purging private, inaccurate, or
outdated information from trained models without the need for complete
re-training. Unlearning within a multimodal setting presents unique challenges
due to the intrinsic dependencies between different data modalities and the
expensive cost of training on large multimodal datasets and architectures.
Current approaches to machine unlearning have not fully addressed these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMUL, a machine unlearning
approach specifically designed for multimodal data and models. MMUL formulates
the multimodal unlearning task by focusing on three key properties: (a):
modality decoupling, which effectively decouples the association between
individual unimodal data points within multimodal inputs marked for deletion,
rendering them as unrelated data points within the model's context, (b):
unimodal knowledge retention, which retains the unimodal representation
capability of the model post-unlearning, and (c): multimodal knowledge
retention, which retains the multimodal representation capability of the model
post-unlearning. MMUL is efficient to train and is not constrained by the
requirement of using a strongly convex loss. Experiments on two multimodal
models and four multimodal benchmark datasets, including vision-language and
graph-language datasets, show that MMUL outperforms existing baselines, gaining
an average improvement of +17.6 points against the best-performing unimodal
baseline in distinguishing between deleted and remaining data. In addition,
MMUL can largely maintain pre-existing knowledge of the original model post
unlearning, with a performance gap of only 0.3 points compared to retraining a
new model from scratch.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world continual learning scenarios, tasks often exhibit intricate and
unpredictable semantic shifts, posing challenges for fixed prompt management
strategies. We identify the inadequacy of universal and specific prompting in
handling these dynamic shifts. Universal prompting is ineffective for tasks
with abrupt semantic changes, while specific prompting struggles with
overfitting under mild semantic shifts. To overcome these limitations, we
propose an adaptive prompting approach that tailors minimal yet sufficient
prompts based on the task semantics. Our methodology, SemPrompt, incorporates a
two-level semantic grouping process: macroscopic semantic assignment and
microscopic semantic refinement. This process ensures optimal prompt
utilization for varying task semantics, improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of learning in real-world CL settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate that SemPrompt consistently outperforms existing methods in
adapting to diverse semantic shifts in tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed paradigm, eliminating the
need for data sharing but facing challenges from data heterogeneity.
Personalized parameter generation through a hypernetwork proves effective, yet
existing methods fail to personalize local model structures. This leads to
redundant parameters struggling to adapt to diverse data distributions. To
address these limitations, we propose FedOFA, utilizing personalized orthogonal
filter attention for parameter recalibration. The core is the Two-stream
Filter-aware Attention (TFA) module, meticulously designed to extract
personalized filter-aware attention maps, incorporating Intra-Filter Attention
(IntraFa) and Inter-Filter Attention (InterFA) streams. These streams enhance
representation capability and explore optimal implicit structures for local
models. Orthogonal regularization minimizes redundancy by averting
inter-correlation between filters. Furthermore, we introduce an
Attention-Guided Pruning Strategy (AGPS) for communication efficiency. AGPS
selectively retains crucial neurons while masking redundant ones, reducing
communication costs without performance sacrifice. Importantly, FedOFA operates
on the server side, incurring no additional computational cost on the client,
making it advantageous in communication-constrained scenarios. Extensive
experiments validate superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches,
with code availability upon paper acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">The current GAN inversion methods typically can only edit the appearance and
shape of a single object and background while overlooking spatial information.
In this work, we propose a 3D editing framework, 3D-GOI, to enable multifaceted
editing of affine information (scale, translation, and rotation) on multiple
objects. 3D-GOI realizes the complex editing function by inverting the
abundance of attribute codes (object
shape/appearance/scale/rotation/translation, background shape/appearance, and
camera pose) controlled by GIRAFFE, a renowned 3D GAN. Accurately inverting all
the codes is challenging, 3D-GOI solves this challenge following three main
steps. First, we segment the objects and the background in a multi-object
image. Second, we use a custom Neural Inversion Encoder to obtain coarse codes
of each object. Finally, we use a round-robin optimization algorithm to get
precise codes to reconstruct the image. To the best of our knowledge, 3D-GOI is
the first framework to enable multifaceted editing on multiple objects. Both
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that 3D-GOI holds immense
potential for flexible, multifaceted editing in complex multi-object scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often possess the
ability to deceive other black-box models, a property known as transferability.
Recent research has focused on enhancing adversarial transferability, with
input transformation being one of the most effective approaches. However,
existing input transformation methods suffer from two issues. Firstly, certain
methods, such as the Scale-Invariant Method, employ exponentially decreasing
scale invariant parameters that decrease the adaptability in generating
effective adversarial examples across multiple scales. Secondly, most mixup
methods only linearly combine candidate images with the source image, leading
to reduced features blending effectiveness. To address these challenges, we
propose a framework called Uniform Scale and Mix Mask Method (US-MM) for
adversarial example generation. The Uniform Scale approach explores the upper
and lower boundaries of perturbation with a linear factor, minimizing the
negative impact of scale copies. The Mix Mask method introduces masks into the
mixing process in a nonlinear manner, significantly improving the effectiveness
of mixing strategies. Ablation experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of each component in US-MM and explore the effect of
hyper-parameters. Empirical evaluations on standard ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that US-MM achieves an average of 7% better transfer attack success
rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose MagicDance, a diffusion-based model for 2D human
motion and facial expression transfer on challenging human dance videos.
Specifically, we aim to generate human dance videos of any target identity
driven by novel pose sequences while keeping the identity unchanged. To this
end, we propose a two-stage training strategy to disentangle human motions and
appearance (e.g., facial expressions, skin tone and dressing), consisting of
the pretraining of an appearance-control block and fine-tuning of an
appearance-pose-joint-control block over human dance poses of the same dataset.
Our novel design enables robust appearance control with temporally consistent
upper body, facial attributes, and even background. The model also generalizes
well on unseen human identities and complex motion sequences without the need
for any fine-tuning with additional data with diverse human attributes by
leveraging the prior knowledge of image diffusion models. Moreover, the
proposed model is easy to use and can be considered as a plug-in
module/extension to Stable Diffusion. We also demonstrate the model's ability
for zero-shot 2D animation generation, enabling not only the appearance
transfer from one identity to another but also allowing for cartoon-like
stylization given only pose inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
superior performance on the TikTok dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Global floods, exacerbated by climate change, pose severe threats to human
life, infrastructure, and the environment. This urgency is highlighted by
recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand, underlining the
critical need for precise flood mapping for guiding restoration efforts,
understanding vulnerabilities, and preparing for future events. While Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities,
harnessing it for deep learning is hindered by the absence of a large annotated
dataset. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a meticulously curated
multi-temporal dataset, spanning 32 flood events globally. Our dataset maps
more than 63 billion m2 of land, with 12.1 billion of them being either a
flooded area or a permanent water body. Kuro Siwo stands out for its
unparalleled annotation quality to facilitate rapid flood mapping in a
supervised setting. We also augment learning by including a large unlabeled set
of SAR samples, aimed at self-supervised pretraining. We provide an extensive
benchmark and strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe,
America, Africa and Australia. Our benchmark demonstrates the quality of Kuro
Siwo annotations, training models that can achieve $\approx$ 85% and $\approx$
87% in F1-score for flooded areas and general water detection respectively.
This work calls on the deep learning community to develop solution-driven
algorithms for rapid flood mapping, with the potential to aid civil protection
and humanitarian agencies amid climate change challenges. Our code and data
will be made available at https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/KuroSiwo

<p class="mathjax">Given the capability of mitigating the long-tail deficiencies and
intricate-shaped absence prevalent in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction
has become a pivotal component in autonomous driving systems. However, the
procession of three-dimensional voxel-level representations inevitably
introduces large overhead in both memory and computation, obstructing the
deployment of to-date occupancy prediction approaches. In contrast to the trend
of making the model larger and more complicated, we argue that a desirable
framework should be deployment-friendly to diverse chips while maintaining high
precision. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play paradigm, namely FlashOCC,
to consolidate rapid and memory-efficient occupancy prediction while
maintaining high precision. Particularly, our FlashOCC makes two improvements
based on the contemporary voxel-level occupancy prediction approaches. Firstly,
the features are kept in the BEV, enabling the employment of efficient 2D
convolutional layers for feature extraction. Secondly, a channel-to-height
transformation is introduced to lift the output logits from the BEV into the 3D
space. We apply the FlashOCC to diverse occupancy prediction baselines on the
challenging Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks and conduct extensive experiments to
validate the effectiveness. The results substantiate the superiority of our
plug-and-play paradigm over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of
precision, runtime efficiency, and memory costs, demonstrating its potential
for deployment. The code will be made available.

<p class="mathjax">The signed distance field (SDF) represents 3D geometries in continuous
function space. Due to its continuous nature, explicit 3D models (e.g., meshes)
can be extracted from it at arbitrary resolution, which means losing the SDF is
equivalent to losing the mesh. Recent research has shown meshes can also be
extracted from SDF-enhanced neural radiance fields (NeRF). Such a signal raises
an alarm that any implicit neural representation with SDF enhancement can
extract the original mesh, which indicates identifying the SDF's intellectual
property becomes an urgent issue. This paper proposes FuncMark, a robust and
invisible watermarking method to protect the copyright of signed distance
fields by leveraging analytic on-surface deformations to embed binary watermark
messages. Such deformation can survive isosurfacing and thus be inherited by
the extracted meshes for further watermark message decoding. Our method can
recover the message with high-resolution meshes extracted from SDFs and detect
the watermark even when mesh vertices are extremely sparse. Furthermore, our
method is robust even when various distortions (including remeshing) are
encountered. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our \tool significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and the message is still detectable
even when only 50 vertex samples are given.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), a novel brain-inspired algorithm, are
garnering increased attention for their superior computation and energy
efficiency over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). To facilitate
deployment on memory-constrained devices, numerous studies have explored SNN
pruning. However, these efforts are hindered by challenges such as scalability
challenges in more complex architectures and accuracy degradation. Amidst these
challenges, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) emerges as a promising pruning
strategy. It posits that within dense neural networks, there exist winning
tickets or subnetworks that are sparser but do not compromise performance. To
explore a more structure-sparse and energy-saving model, we investigate the
unique synergy of SNNs with LTH and design two novel spiking winning tickets to
push the boundaries of sparsity within SNNs. Furthermore, we introduce an
innovative algorithm capable of simultaneously identifying both weight and
patch-level winning tickets, enabling the achievement of sparser structures
without compromising on the final model's performance. Through comprehensive
experiments on both RGB-based and event-based datasets, we demonstrate that our
spiking lottery ticket achieves comparable or superior performance even when
the model structure is extremely sparse.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Social aspects are of high importance for being successful using
agile methods in software development. People are influenced by their cultural
imprint, as the underlying cultural values are guiding us in how we think and
act. Thus, one may assume that in multicultural agile software development
teams, cultural characteristics influence the result in terms of quality of the
team work and consequently, the product to be delivered. Objective: We aim to
identify barriers and potentials that may arise in multicultural agile software
development teams to provide valuable strategies for both researchers and
practitioners faced with barriers or unrealized potentials of cultural
diversity. Method: The study is designed as a single-case study with two units
of analysis using a mixed-method design consisting quantitative and qualitative
methods. Results: First, our results suggest that the cultural characteristics
at the team level need to be analyzed individually in intercultural teams,
Second, we identified key potentials regarding cultural characteristics
providing key potentials such as a individual team subculture that fits agile
values like open communication. Third, we derived strategies supporting the
potentials of cultural diversity in agile software development teams.
Conclusion: Our findings show, that a deeper understanding of cultural
influences in multicultural agile software development teams is needed. Based
on the results, we already prepare future work to validate the results in other
industries.

method to regress edges directly from aerial LiDAR point clouds.Our method,
named Parametric Building Wireframe Reconstruction (PBWR), takes aerial LiDAR
point clouds and initial edge entities as input, and fully uses self-attention
mechanism of transformers to regress edge parameters without any intermediate
steps such as corner prediction. We propose an edge non-maximum suppression
(E-NMS) module based on edge similarityto remove redundant edges. Additionally,
a dedicated edge loss function is utilized to guide the PBWR in regressing
edges parameters, where simple use of edge distance loss isn't suitable. In our
experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the Building3D dataset,
achieving an improvement of approximately 36% in entry-level dataset edge
accuracy and around 42% improvement in the Tallinn dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Progress in 3D computer vision tasks demands a huge amount of data, yet
annotating multi-view images with 3D-consistent annotations, or point clouds
with part segmentation is both time-consuming and challenging. This paper
introduces DatasetNeRF, a novel approach capable of generating infinite,
high-quality 3D-consistent 2D annotations alongside 3D point cloud
segmentations, while utilizing minimal 2D human-labeled annotations.
Specifically, we leverage the strong semantic prior within a 3D generative
model to train a semantic decoder, requiring only a handful of fine-grained
labeled samples. Once trained, the decoder efficiently generalizes across the
latent space, enabling the generation of infinite data. The generated data is
applicable across various computer vision tasks, including video segmentation
and 3D point cloud segmentation. Our approach not only surpasses baseline
models in segmentation quality, achieving superior 3D consistency and
segmentation precision on individual images, but also demonstrates versatility
by being applicable to both articulated and non-articulated generative models.
Furthermore, we explore applications stemming from our approach, such as
3D-aware semantic editing and 3D inversion.

<p class="mathjax">To ensure the security of airports, it is essential to protect the airside
from unauthorized access. For this purpose, security fences are commonly used,
but they require regular inspection to detect damages. However, due to the
growing shortage of human specialists and the large manual effort, there is the
need for automated methods. The aim is to automatically inspect the fence for
damage with the help of an autonomous robot. In this work, we explore object
detection methods to address the fence inspection task and localize various
types of damages. In addition to evaluating four State-of-the-Art (SOTA) object
detection models, we analyze the impact of several design criteria, aiming at
adapting to the task-specific challenges. This includes contrast adjustment,
optimization of hyperparameters, and utilization of modern backbones. The
experimental results indicate that our optimized You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5)
model achieves the highest accuracy of the four methods with an increase of
6.9% points in Average Precision (AP) compared to the baseline. Moreover, we
show the real-time capability of the model. The trained models are published on

training-free manner. By making the LLM the task planner and off-the-shelf

chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning guide the LLM to observe

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as an evolutionary for producing
creative content in image synthesis. Based on the impressive generation
abilities of these models, instruction-guided diffusion models can edit images
with simple instructions and input images. While they empower users to obtain
their desired edited images with ease, they have raised concerns about
unauthorized image manipulation. Prior research has delved into the
unauthorized use of personalized diffusion models; however, this problem of
instruction-guided diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this paper,
we first propose a protection method EditShield against unauthorized
modifications from such models. Specifically, EditShield works by adding
imperceptible perturbations that can shift the latent representation used in
the diffusion process, forcing models to generate unrealistic images with
mismatched subjects. Our extensive experiments demonstrate EditShield's
effectiveness among synthetic and real-world datasets. Besides, EditShield also
maintains robustness against various editing types and synonymous instruction
phrases.

high-quality fashion images, paired with detailed text descriptions. Sourced
from a diverse range of geographical locations and cultural backgrounds, the
dataset encapsulates global fashion trends. The images have been meticulously
annotated with fine-grained attributes related to clothing and humans,
simplifying the fashion design process into a Text-to-Image (T2I) task. The
Fashion-Diffusion dataset not only provides high-quality text-image pairs and
diverse human-garment pairs but also serves as a large-scale resource about
humans, thereby facilitating research in T2I generation. Moreover, to foster
standardization in the T2I-based fashion design field, we propose a new
benchmark comprising multiple datasets for evaluating the performance of
fashion design models. This work represents a significant leap forward in the
realm of AI-driven fashion design, setting a new standard for future research
in this field.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object
detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel
object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are
inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a
novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set
detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary
strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM,
through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism
with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new
benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in
novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS
dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current
state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes. Our

<p class="mathjax">Numerous studies have proved their effective strength in detecting Control
Area Network (CAN) attacks. In the realm of understanding the human semantic
space, transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness.
Leveraging pre-trained transformers has become a common strategy in various
language-related tasks, enabling these models to grasp human semantics more
comprehensively. To delve into the adaptability evaluation on pre-trained
models for CAN intrusion detection, we have developed two distinct models:
CAN-SecureBERT and CAN-LLAMA2. Notably, our CAN-LLAMA2 model surpasses the
state-of-the-art models by achieving an exceptional performance 0.999993 in
terms of balanced accuracy, precision detection rate, F1 score, and a
remarkably low false alarm rate of 3.10e-6. Impressively, the false alarm rate
is 52 times smaller than that of the leading model, MTH-IDS (Multitiered Hybrid
Intrusion Detection System). Our study underscores the promise of employing a
Large Language Model as the foundational model, while incorporating adapters
for other cybersecurity-related tasks and maintaining the model's inherent
language-related capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Studying backdoor attacks is valuable for model copyright protection and
enhancing defenses. While existing backdoor attacks have successfully infected
multimodal contrastive learning models such as CLIP, they can be easily
countered by specialized backdoor defenses for MCL models. This paper reveals
the threats in this practical scenario that backdoor attacks can remain
effective even after defenses and introduces the \emph{\toolns} attack, which
is resistant to backdoor detection and model fine-tuning defenses. To achieve
this, we draw motivations from the perspective of the Bayesian rule and propose
a dual-embedding guided framework for backdoor attacks. Specifically, we ensure
that visual trigger patterns approximate the textual target semantics in the
embedding space, making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter
variations induced by backdoor learning on such natural trigger patterns.
Additionally, we optimize the visual trigger patterns to align the poisoned
samples with target vision features in order to hinder the backdoor unlearning
through clean fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (+45.3% ASR) in the
presence of SoTA backdoor defenses, rendering these mitigation and detection
strategies virtually ineffective. Furthermore, our approach effectively attacks
some more rigorous scenarios like downstream tasks. We believe that this paper
raises awareness regarding the potential threats associated with the practical
application of multimodal contrastive learning and encourages the development
of more robust defense mechanisms.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of open-world intelligent systems. Despite the notable advancements in existing
OOD detection methodologies, our study identifies a significant performance
drop under the scarcity of training samples. In this context, we introduce a
novel few-shot OOD detection benchmark, carefully constructed to address this
gap. Our empirical analysis reveals the superiority of ParameterEfficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as visual prompt tuning and visual adapter
tuning, over conventional techniques, including fully fine-tuning and linear
probing tuning in the few-shot OOD detection task. Recognizing some crucial
information from the pre-trained model, which is pivotal for OOD detection, may
be lost during the fine-tuning process, we propose a method termed
DomainSpecific and General Knowledge Fusion (DSGF). This approach is designed
to be compatible with diverse fine-tuning frameworks. Our experiments show that
the integration of DSGF significantly enhances the few-shot OOD detection
capabilities across various methods and fine-tuning methodologies, including
fully fine-tuning, visual adapter tuning, and visual prompt tuning. The code

<p class="mathjax">Single image super-resolution (SISR) has experienced significant
advancements, primarily driven by deep convolutional networks. Traditional
networks, however, are limited to upscaling images to a fixed scale, leading to
the utilization of implicit neural functions for generating arbitrarily scaled
images. Nevertheless, these methodologies have imposed substantial
computational demands as they involve querying every target pixel to a single
resource-intensive decoder. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient
framework, the Mixture of Experts Implicit Super-Resolution (MoEISR), which
enables super-resolution at arbitrary scales with significantly increased
computational efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction quality. MoEISR
dynamically allocates the most suitable decoding expert to each pixel using a
lightweight mapper module, allowing experts with varying capacities to
reconstruct pixels across regions with diverse complexities. Our experiments
demonstrate that MoEISR successfully reduces up to 73% in floating point
operations (FLOPs) while delivering comparable or superior peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR).

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully,
and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation
losses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of
teacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing
what specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy
degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature
maps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency
distillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey
general but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also
introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally
to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency
Prompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context
during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency
mask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests
(PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware
relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order
spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge
Distillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and
extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on
dense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on
COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys
more robustness to the student. Notably, we also validate the generalization of
our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g., DINO and SAM).

<p class="mathjax">Pansharpening, a pivotal task in remote sensing, involves integrating
low-resolution multispectral images with high-resolution panchromatic images to
synthesize an image that is both high-resolution and retains multispectral
information. These pansharpened images enhance precision in land cover
classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring within remote
sensing data analysis. While deep learning techniques have shown significant
success in pansharpening, existing methods often face limitations in their
evaluation, focusing on restricted satellite data sources, single scene types,
and low-resolution images. This paper addresses this gap by introducing
PanBench, a high-resolution multi-scene dataset containing all mainstream
satellites and comprising 5,898 pairs of samples. Each pair includes a
four-channel (RGB + near-infrared) multispectral image of 256x256 pixels and a
mono-channel panchromatic image of 1,024x1,024 pixels. To achieve high-fidelity
synthesis, we propose a Cascaded Multiscale Fusion Network (CMFNet) for
Pansharpening. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMFNet. We

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks are a major deterrent towards the reliable use of machine
learning models. A powerful type of adversarial attacks is the patch-based
attack, wherein the adversarial perturbations modify localized patches or
specific areas within the images to deceive the trained machine learning model.
In this paper, we introduce Outlier Detection and Dimension Reduction (ODDR), a
holistic defense mechanism designed to effectively mitigate patch-based
adversarial attacks. In our approach, we posit that input features
corresponding to adversarial patches, whether naturalistic or otherwise,
deviate from the inherent distribution of the remaining image sample and can be
identified as outliers or anomalies. ODDR employs a three-stage pipeline:
Fragmentation, Segregation, and Neutralization, providing a model-agnostic
solution applicable to both image classification and object detection tasks.
The Fragmentation stage parses the samples into chunks for the subsequent
Segregation process. Here, outlier detection techniques identify and segregate
the anomalous features associated with adversarial perturbations. The
Neutralization stage utilizes dimension reduction methods on the outliers to
mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations without sacrificing pertinent
information necessary for the machine learning task. Extensive testing on
benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial patches demonstrates the
effectiveness of ODDR. Results indicate robust accuracies matching and lying
within a small range of clean accuracies (1%-3% for classification and 3%-5%
for object detection), with only a marginal compromise of 1%-2% in performance
on clean samples, thereby significantly outperforming other defenses.

<p class="mathjax">Directly transferring the 2D techniques to 3D scene generation is challenging
due to significant resolution reduction and the scarcity of comprehensive
real-world 3D scene datasets. To address these issues, our work introduces the
Pyramid Discrete Diffusion model (PDD) for 3D scene generation. This novel
approach employs a multi-scale model capable of progressively generating
high-quality 3D scenes from coarse to fine. In this way, the PDD can generate
high-quality scenes within limited resource constraints and does not require
additional data sources. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
adopt the simple but effective coarse-to-fine strategy for 3D large scene
generation. Our experiments, covering both unconditional and conditional
generation, have yielded impressive results, showcasing the model's
effectiveness and robustness in generating realistic and detailed 3D scenes.
Our code will be available to the public.

<p class="mathjax">Automated disease, weed and crop classification with computer vision will be
invaluable in the future of agriculture. However, existing model architectures
like ResNet, EfficientNet and ConvNeXt often underperform on smaller,
specialised datasets typical of such projects. We address this gap with
informed data collection and the development of a new CNN architecture,
PhytNet. Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we
demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing
architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data,
which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa
trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model
development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology
of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18
showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct
signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to
relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost
(1.19 GFLOPS). As such PhytNet is a promising candidate for rapid disease or
plant classification, or precise localisation of disease symptoms for
autonomous systems.

<p class="mathjax">Gait analysis holds significant importance in monitoring daily health,
particularly among older adults. Advancements in sensor technology enable the
capture of movement in real-life environments and generate big data. Machine
learning, notably deep learning (DL), shows promise to use these big data in
gait analysis. However, the inherent black-box nature of these models poses
challenges for their clinical application. This study aims to enhance
transparency in DL-based gait classification for aged-related gait patterns
using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, such as SHAP.
<br />A total of 244 subjects, comprising 129 adults and 115 older adults (age&gt;65),
were included. They performed a 3-minute walking task while accelerometers were
affixed to the lumbar segment L3. DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN)
and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride
accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was
employed to explain the models' predictions.
<br />CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC
of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and
an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher
SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly
emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to
loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not
treat every stride equally.
<br />CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the
characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification
by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In
both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting
differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between
different age groups.

<p class="mathjax">We propose FrePolad: frequency-rectified point latent diffusion, a point
cloud generation pipeline integrating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for the latent distribution.
FrePolad simultaneously achieves high quality, diversity, and flexibility in
point cloud cardinality for generation tasks while maintaining high
computational efficiency. The improvement in generation quality and diversity
is achieved through (1) a novel frequency rectification module via spherical
harmonics designed to retain high-frequency content while learning the point
cloud distribution; and (2) a latent DDPM to learn the regularized yet complex
latent distribution. In addition, FrePolad supports variable point cloud
cardinality by formulating the sampling of points as conditional distributions
over a latent shape distribution. Finally, the low-dimensional latent space
encoded by the VAE contributes to FrePolad's fast and scalable sampling. Our
quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of FrePolad in terms of quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in local spatial pattern
recognition. For many vision tasks, such as object recognition and
segmentation, salient information is also present outside CNN's kernel
boundaries. However, CNNs struggle in capturing such relevant information due
to their confined receptive fields. Self-attention can improve a model's access
to global information but increases computational overhead. We present a fast
and simple fully convolutional method called DAS that helps focus attention on
relevant information. It uses deformable convolutions for the location of
pertinent image regions and separable convolutions for efficiency. DAS plugs
into existing CNNs and propagates relevant information using a gating
mechanism. Compared to the O(n^2) computational complexity of transformer-style
attention, DAS is O(n). Our claim is that DAS's ability to pay increased
attention to relevant features results in performance improvements when added
to popular CNNs for Image Classification and Object Detection. For example, DAS
yields an improvement on Stanford Dogs (4.47%), ImageNet (1.91%), and COCO AP
(3.3%) with base ResNet50 backbone. This outperforms other CNN attention
mechanisms while using similar or less FLOPs. Our code will be publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">We present a method to create interpretable concept sliders that enable
precise control over attributes in image generations from diffusion models. Our
approach identifies a low-rank parameter direction corresponding to one concept
while minimizing interference with other attributes. A slider is created using
a small set of prompts or sample images; thus slider directions can be created
for either textual or visual concepts. Concept Sliders are plug-and-play: they
can be composed efficiently and continuously modulated, enabling precise
control over image generation. In quantitative experiments comparing to
previous editing techniques, our sliders exhibit stronger targeted edits with
lower interference. We showcase sliders for weather, age, styles, and
expressions, as well as slider compositions. We show how sliders can transfer
latents from StyleGAN for intuitive editing of visual concepts for which
textual description is difficult. We also find that our method can help address
persistent quality issues in Stable Diffusion XL including repair of object
deformations and fixing distorted hands. Our code, data, and trained sliders
are available at https://sliders.baulab.info/

<p class="mathjax">While current state-of-the-art generalizable implicit neural shape models
rely on the inductive bias of convolutions, it is still not entirely clear how
properties emerging from such biases are compatible with the task of 3D
reconstruction from point cloud. We explore an alternative approach to
generalizability in this context. We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using
MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the
hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the
reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP
locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with
fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets
are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A
decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by
pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by
denoised relative positional encoding. We outperform the state-of-the-art
convolutional method while using half the number of model parameters.

using videos in the wild. We exploit advances in more accurate hand pose
estimation and propose a novel architecture that leverages the transformer
based encoder-decoder model enabling seamless contextual word translation. The
translation model is augmented by a novel loss term that accurately predicts
the length of the finger-spelled word, benefiting both training and inference.
We also propose a novel two-stage inference approach that re-ranks the
hypotheses using the language model capabilities of the decoder. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ achieving more than
10% relative improvement in performance. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of our approach and its potential to advance fingerspelling

<p class="mathjax">Formally verifying audio classification systems is essential to ensure
accurate signal classification across real-world applications like
surveillance, automotive voice commands, and multimedia content management,
preventing potential errors with serious consequences. Drawing from recent
research, this study advances the utilization of star-set-based formal
verification, extended through reachability analysis, tailored explicitly for
Long Short-Term Memory architectures and their Convolutional variations within
the audio classification domain. By conceptualizing the classification process
as a sequence of set operations, the star set-based reachability approach
streamlines the exploration of potential operational states attainable by the
system. The paper serves as an encompassing case study, validating and
verifying sequence audio classification analytics within real-world contexts.
It accentuates the necessity for robustness verification to ensure precise and
dependable predictions, particularly in light of the impact of noise on the
accuracy of output classifications.

<p class="mathjax">Generating images with a Text-to-Image model often requires multiple trials,
where human users iteratively update their prompt based on feedback, namely the
output image. Taking inspiration from cognitive work on reference games and
dialogue alignment, this paper analyzes the dynamics of the user prompts along
such iterations. We compile a dataset of iterative interactions of human users
with Midjourney. Our analysis then reveals that prompts predictably converge
toward specific traits along these iterations. We further study whether this
convergence is due to human users, realizing they missed important details, or
due to adaptation to the model's ``preferences'', producing better images for a
specific language style. We show initial evidence that both possibilities are
at play. The possibility that users adapt to the model's preference raises
concerns about reusing user data for further training. The prompts may be
biased towards the preferences of a specific model, rather than align with
human intentions and natural manner of expression.

market issues, insufficient funding, or simply a bad product idea. However,
inadequacies in software product engineering are relatively little explored and
could be a significant contributing factor to high start-up failure rate. In
this paper we present analysis of 88 start-up experience reports. The analysis
is presented in a form of three anti-patterns illustrating common symptoms,
actual causes, and potential countermeasures of engineering inadequacies. The
three anti-patterns are: product uncertainty comprising of issues in
requirements engineering, poor product quality comprising of inadequacies in
product quality, and team breakup comprising of team issues. The anti-patterns
show that challenges and failure scenarios that appear to be business or
market-related can actually originate from inadequacies in product engineering.

<p class="mathjax">Error-bounded lossy compression has been identified as a promising solution
for significantly reducing scientific data volumes upon users' requirements on
data distortion. For the existing scientific error-bounded lossy compressors,
some of them (such as SPERR and FAZ) can reach fairly high compression ratios
and some others (such as SZx, SZ, and ZFP) feature high compression speeds, but
they rarely exhibit both high ratio and high speed meanwhile. In this paper, we
propose HPEZ with newly-designed interpolations and quality-metric-driven
auto-tuning, which features significantly improved compression quality upon the
existing high-performance compressors, meanwhile being exceedingly faster than
high-ratio compressors. The key contributions lie in the following points: (1)
We develop a series of advanced techniques such as interpolation re-ordering,
multi-dimensional interpolation, and natural cubic splines to significantly
improve compression qualities with interpolation-based data prediction. (2) The
auto-tuning module in HPEZ has been carefully designed with novel strategies,
including but not limited to block-wise interpolation tuning, dynamic dimension
freezing, and Lorenzo tuning. (3) We thoroughly evaluate HPEZ compared with
many other compressors on six real-world scientific datasets. Experiments show
that HPEZ outperforms other high-performance error-bounded lossy compressors in
compression ratio by up to 140% under the same error bound, and by up to 360%
under the same PSNR. In parallel data transfer experiments on the distributed
database, HPEZ achieves a significant performance gain with up to 40% time cost
reduction over the second-best compressor.

<p class="mathjax">Social networks have become essential for people's lives. The proliferation
of web services further expands social networks at an unprecedented scale,
leading to immeasurable commercial value for online platforms. Recently, the
group buying (GB) business mode is prevalent and also becoming more popular in
E-commerce. GB explicitly forms groups of users with similar interests to
secure better discounts from the merchants, often operating within social
networks. It is a novel way to further unlock the commercial value by
explicitly utilizing the online social network in E-commerce. Participant
recommendation, a fundamental problem emerging together with GB, aims to find
the participants for a launched group buying process with an initiator and a
target item to increase the GB success rate. This paper proposes Multi-View
Graph Convolution for Participant Recommendation (MVPRec) to tackle this
problem. To differentiate the roles of users (Initiator/Participant) within the
GB process, we explicitly reconstruct historical GB data into initiator-view
and participant-view graphs. Together with the social graph, we obtain a
multi-view user representation with graph encoders. Then MVPRec fuses the GB
and social representation with an attention module to obtain the user
representation and learns a matching score with the initiator's social friends
via a multi-head attention mechanism. Social friends with the Top-k matching
score are recommended for the corresponding GB process. Experiments on three
datasets justify the effectiveness of MVPRec in the emerging participant
recommendation problem.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Start-up companies have become an important supplier of innovation
and software-intensive products. The flexibility and reactiveness of start-ups
enables fast development and launch of innovative products. However, a majority
of software start-up companies fail before achieving any success. Among other
factors, poor software engineering could be a significant contributor to the
challenges experienced by start-ups. However, the state-of-practice of software
engineering in start-ups, as well as the utilization of state-of-the-art is
largely an unexplored area. Objective: In this study we investigate how
software engineering is applied in start-up context with a focus to identify
key knowledge areas and opportunities for further research. Method: We perform
a multi-vocal exploratory study of 88 start-up experience reports. We develop a
custom taxonomy to categorize the reported software engineering practices and
their interrelation with business aspects, and apply qualitative data analysis
to explore influences and dependencies between the knowledge areas. Results: We
identify the most frequently reported software engineering (requirements
engineering, software design and quality) and business aspect (vision and
strategy development) knowledge areas, and illustrate their relationships. We
also present a summary of how relevant software engineering knowledge areas are
implemented in start-ups and identify potentially useful practices for adoption
in start-ups. Conclusions: The results enable a more focused research on
engineering practices in start-ups. We conclude that most engineering
challenges in start-ups stem from inadequacies in requirements engineering.
Many promising practices to address specific engineering challenges exists,
however more research on adaptation of established practices, and validation of
new start-up specific practices is needed.

<p class="mathjax">Since DARPA Grand Challenges (rural) in 2004/05 and Urban Challenges in 2007,
autonomous driving has been the most active field of AI applications. Recently
powered by large language models (LLMs), chat systems, such as chatGPT and
PaLM, emerge and rapidly become a promising direction to achieve artificial
general intelligence (AGI) in natural language processing (NLP). There comes a
natural thinking that we could employ these abilities to reformulate autonomous
driving. By combining LLM with foundation models, it is possible to utilize the
human knowledge, commonsense and reasoning to rebuild autonomous driving
systems from the current long-tailed AI dilemma. In this paper, we investigate
the techniques of foundation models and LLMs applied for autonomous driving,
categorized as simulation, world model, data annotation and planning or E2E
solutions etc.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Establishing traceability from requirements documents to
downstream artifacts early can be beneficial as it allows engineers to reason
about requirements quality (e.g. completeness, consistency, redundancy).
However, creating such early traces is difficult if downstream artifacts do not
exist yet. Objective: We propose to use domain-specific taxonomies to establish
early traceability, raising the value and perceived benefits of trace links so
that they are also available at later development phases, e.g. in design,
testing or maintenance. Method: We developed a recommender system that suggests
trace links from requirements to a domain-specific taxonomy based on a series
of heuristics. We designed a controlled experiment to compare industry
practitioners' efficiency, accuracy, consistency and confidence with and
without support from the recommender. Results: We have piloted the experimental
material with seven practitioners. The analysis of self-reported confidence
suggests that the trace task itself is very challenging as both control and
treatment group report low confidence on correctness and completeness.
Conclusions: As a pilot, the experiment was successful since it provided
initial feedback on the performance of the recommender, insight on the
experimental material and illustrated that the collected data can be
meaningfully analysed.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the space of optimizing feedback mechanisms in complex
domains, such as data science, by combining two prevailing approaches:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learnersourcing. Towards addressing the
challenges posed by each approach, this work compares traditional
learnersourcing with an AI-supported approach. We report on the results of a
randomized controlled experiment conducted with 72 Master's level students in a
data visualization course, comparing two conditions: students writing hints
independently versus revising hints generated by GPT-4. The study aimed to
evaluate the quality of learnersourced hints, examine the impact of student
performance on hint quality, gauge learner preference for writing hints with or
without AI support, and explore the potential of the student-AI collaborative
exercise in fostering critical thinking about LLMs. Based on our findings, we
provide insights for designing learnersourcing activities leveraging AI support
and optimizing students' learning as they interact with LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation enables robots to plan and estimate the outcomes of prospective
actions without the need to physically execute them. We introduce a
self-supervised learning framework to enable robots model and predict their
morphology, kinematics and motor control using only brief raw video data,
eliminating the need for extensive real-world data collection and kinematic
priors. By observing their own movements, akin to humans watching their
reflection in a mirror, robots learn an ability to simulate themselves and
predict their spatial motion for various tasks. Our results demonstrate that
this self-learned simulation not only enables accurate motion planning but also
allows the robot to detect abnormalities and recover from damage.

<p class="mathjax">In a power grid with growing penetrations of renewable energy sources,
inverters play a larger role in the dynamic interactions among network
components. However, much is yet to be studied regarding inverter-dominated
grid stability. This has initiated a re-examination of long-established
assumptions made when conducting power systems studies. In this work we study
the small-signal stability characteristics of a power system comprised of
inverter and synchronous machine sources, and consider the effect of inverter
control gains, transmission line dynamics, and network operating conditions. We
utilize PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl to perform this study on the IEEE WSCC 9
Bus test system. We vary inverter parameters across reported ranges in the
literature, we consider three transmission line models of varying fidelity, and
compare results across different operating conditions. We find that line
dynamics are generally important for correctly assessing small-signal stability
in networks with large penetrations of grid-following converters, and that gain
tuning in these networks should utilize high fidelity line models.

<p class="mathjax">Software bots have attracted increasing interest and popularity in both
research and society. Their contributions span automation, digital twins, game
characters with conscious-like behavior, and social media. However, there is
still a lack of intelligent bots that can adapt to web environments'
variability and dynamic nature. Unlike human users, they have difficulty
understanding and exploiting the affordances across multiple virtual
environments.
<br />Despite the hype, bots with human user-like cognition do not currently exist.
Chatbots, for instance, lack situational awareness on the digital platforms
where they operate, preventing them from enacting meaningful and autonomous
intelligent behavior similar to human users.
<br />In this survey, we aim to explore the role of cognitive architectures in
supporting efforts towards engineering software bots with advanced general
intelligence. We discuss how cognitive architectures can contribute to creating
intelligent software bots. Furthermore, we highlight key architectural
recommendations for the future development of autonomous, user-like cognitive
bots.

<p class="mathjax">The task of predicting 3D eye gaze from eye images can be performed either by
(a) end-to-end learning for image-to-gaze mapping or by (b) fitting a 3D eye
model onto images. The former case requires 3D gaze labels, while the latter
requires eye semantics or landmarks to facilitate the model fitting. Although
obtaining eye semantics and landmarks is relatively easy, fitting an accurate
3D eye model on them remains to be very challenging due to its ill-posed nature
in general. On the other hand, obtaining large-scale 3D gaze data is cumbersome
due to the required hardware setups and computational demands. In this work, we
propose to predict 3D eye gaze from weak supervision of eye semantic
segmentation masks and direct supervision of a few 3D gaze vectors. The
proposed method combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large amounts of
weak annotations--which are easy to obtain, and only a few 3D gaze
vectors--which alleviate the difficulty of fitting 3D eye models on the
semantic segmentation of eye images. Thus, the eye gaze vectors, used in the
model fitting, are directly supervised using the few-shot gaze labels.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based network architecture, that serves
as a solid baseline for our improvements. Our experiments in diverse settings
illustrate the significant benefits of the proposed method, achieving about 5
degrees lower angular gaze error over the baseline, when only 0.05% 3D
annotations of the training images are used. The source code is available at
https://github.com/dimitris-christodoulou57/Model-aware_3D_Eye_Gaze.

<p class="mathjax">The aim of video summarization is to shorten videos automatically while
retaining the key information necessary to convey the overall story. Video
summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual
consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand
the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as
interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also
be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do
not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is
proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video
summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and
introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to
characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions
are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention
module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the
presence of multi-modal input. The proposed video summarization method
incorporates the above innovative design choices that aim to narrow the gap
between human-generated and machine-generated video summaries. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used video summarization
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Existing visual parsers for molecule diagrams translate pixel-based raster
images such as PNGs to chemical structure representations (e.g., SMILES).
However, PDFs created by word processors including \LaTeX{} and Word provide
explicit locations and shapes for characters, lines, and polygons. We
%introduce a method to extract symbols from born-digital PDF molecule images
and then apply simple graph transformations to capture both visual and chemical
structure in editable ChemDraw files (CDXML). Our fast ( PDF $\rightarrow$
visual graph $\rightarrow$ chemical graph ) pipeline does not require GPUs,
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or vectorization. We evaluate on standard
benchmarks using SMILES strings, along with a novel evaluation that provides
graph-based metrics and error compilation using LgEval. The geometric
information in born-digital PDFs produces a highly accurate parser, motivating
generating training data for visual parsers that recognize from raster images,
with extracted graphics, visual structure, and chemical structure as
annotations. To do this we render SMILES strings in Indigo, parse molecule
structure, and then validate recognized structure to select correct files.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method for the classification of objects that are structured as
random trees. Our aim is to model a distribution over the node label
assignments in settings where the tree data structure is associated with node
attributes (typically high dimensional embeddings). The tree topology is not
predetermined and none of the label assignments are present during inference.
Other methods that produce a distribution over node label assignment in trees
(or more generally in graphs) either assume conditional independence of the
label assignment, operate on a fixed graph topology, or require part of the
node labels to be observed. Our method defines a Markov Network with the
corresponding topology of the random tree and an associated Gibbs distribution.
We parameterize the Gibbs distribution with a Graph Neural Network that
operates on the random tree and the node embeddings. This allows us to estimate
the likelihood of node assignments for a given random tree and use MCMC to
sample from the distribution of node assignments.
<br />We evaluate our method on the tasks of node classification in trees on the
Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. Our method outperforms the baselines on
this dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for modeling joint distributions
of node labels in random trees.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic annotations are indispensable to train or evaluate perception
models, yet very costly to acquire. This work introduces a fully automated
2D/3D labeling framework that, without any human intervention, can generate
labels for RGB-D scans at equal (or better) level of accuracy than comparable
manually annotated datasets such as ScanNet. Our approach is based on an
ensemble of state-of-the-art segmentation models and 3D lifting through neural
rendering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LabelMaker pipeline by
generating significantly better labels for the ScanNet datasets and
automatically labelling the previously unlabeled ARKitScenes dataset. Code and
models are available at https://labelmaker.org

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of covert online decision-making in which an agent
attempts to identify a parameter governing a system by probing the system while
escaping detection from an adversary. The system is modeled as a Markov kernel
whose input is controlled by the agent and whose two outputs are observed by
the agent and the adversary, respectively. This problem is motivated by
applications such as covert sensing or covert radar, in which one tries to
perform a sensing task without arousing suspicion by an adversary monitoring
the environment for the presence of sensing signals. Specifically, we consider
two situations corresponding to different amounts of knowledge of the system.
If the kernel is known but governed by an unknown fixed parameter, we formulate
the problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. If the kernel
determining the observations of the agent is unknown but the kernel determining
those of the adversary is known, we formulate the problem as a best-arm
identification problem in a bandit setting. In both situations, we characterize
the exponent of the probability of identification error. As expected because of
the covertness requirement, the probability of identification error decays
exponentially with the square root of the blocklength.

<p class="mathjax">The importance of qualitative parallel data in machine translation has long
been determined but it has always been very difficult to obtain such in
sufficient quantity for the majority of world languages, mainly because of the
associated cost and also the lack of accessibility to these languages. Despite
the potential for obtaining parallel datasets from online articles using
automatic approaches, forensic investigations have found a lot of
quality-related issues such as misalignment, and wrong language codes. In this
work, we present a simple but qualitative parallel sentence aligner that
carefully leveraged the closed-access Cohere multilingual embedding, a solution
that ranked second in the just concluded #CoHereAIHack 2023 Challenge (see
https://ai6lagos.devpost.com). The proposed approach achieved $94.96$ and
$54.83$ f1 scores on FLORES and MAFAND-MT, compared to $3.64$ and $0.64$ of
LASER respectively. Our method also achieved an improvement of more than 5 BLEU
scores over LASER, when the resulting datasets were used with MAFAND-MT dataset
to train translation models. Our code and data are available for research
purposes here (https://github.com/abumafrim/Cohere-Align).

<p class="mathjax">Trust in robots is widely believed to be imperative for the adoption of
robots into people's daily lives. It is, therefore, understandable that the
literature of the last few decades focuses on measuring how much people trust
robots -- and more generally, any agent - to foster such trust in these
technologies. Researchers have been exploring how people trust robot in
different ways, such as measuring trust on human-robot interactions (HRI) based
on textual descriptions or images without any physical contact, during and
after interacting with the technology. Nevertheless, trust is a complex
behaviour, and it is affected and depends on several factors, including those
related to the interacting agents (e.g. humans, robots, pets), itself (e.g.
capabilities, reliability), the context (e.g. task), and the environment (e.g.
public spaces vs private spaces vs working spaces). In general, most
roboticists agree that insufficient levels of trust lead to a risk of
disengagement while over-trust in technology can cause over-reliance and
inherit dangers, for example, in emergency situations. It is, therefore, very
important that the research community has access to reliable methods to measure
people's trust in robots and technology. In this position paper, we outline
current methods and their strengths, identify (some) weakly covered aspects and
discuss the potential for covering a more comprehensive amount of factors
influencing trust in HRI.

<p class="mathjax">Manipulating liquid is widely required for many tasks, especially in cooking.
A common way to address this is extruding viscous liquid from a squeeze bottle.
In this work, our goal is to create a sauce plating robot, which requires
precise control of the thickness of squeezed liquids on a surface. Different
liquids demand different manipulation policies. We command the robot to tilt
the container and monitor the liquid response using a force sensor to identify
liquid properties. Based on the liquid properties, we predict the liquid
behavior with fixed squeezing motions in a data-driven way and calculate the
required drawing speed for the desired stroke size. This open-loop system works
effectively even without sensor feedback. Our experiments demonstrate accurate
stroke size control across different liquids and fill levels. We show that
understanding liquid properties can facilitate effective liquid manipulation.
More importantly, our dish garnishing robot has a wide range of applications
and holds significant commercialization potential.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning-based large language models, such as ChatGPT, are
believed to have potential to aid human experts in many domains, including
healthcare. There is, however, little work on ChatGPT's ability to perform a
key task in healthcare: formal, probabilistic medical diagnostic reasoning.
This type of reasoning is used, for example, to update a pre-test probability
to a post-test probability. In this work, we probe ChatGPT's ability to perform
this task. In particular, we ask ChatGPT to give examples of how to use Bayes
rule for medical diagnosis. Our prompts range from queries that use terminology
from pure probability (e.g., requests for a "posterior probability") to queries
that use terminology from the medical diagnosis literature (e.g., requests for
a "post-test probability"). We show how the introduction of medical variable
names leads to an increase in the number of errors that ChatGPT makes. Given
our results, we also show how one can use prompt engineering to facilitate
ChatGPT's partial avoidance of these errors. We discuss our results in light of
recent commentaries on sensitivity and specificity. We also discuss how our
results might inform new research directions for large language models.

centralized power system towards a decentralized multi-agent network. Operating
multi-agent networks significantly relies on inter-agent communications.
Computation granularity in this context refers to the number of nodes overseen
by an agent. The impact of granularity on equitable power coordination,
particularly among marginalized customers with limited communication bandwidth
(e.g., intermittent internet connectivity) is not well studied. This work
explores different levels of computation granularity for agent-based energy
dispatch and studies their impact on equitable coordination. We will leverage

<p class="mathjax">We present a method for semantically transferring the visual appearance of
one natural image to another. Specifically, our goal is to generate an image in
which objects in a source structure image are "painted" with the visual
appearance of their semantically related objects in a target appearance image.
To integrate semantic information into our framework, our key idea is to
leverage a pre-trained and fixed Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Specifically,
we derive novel disentangled representations of structure and appearance
extracted from deep ViT features. We then establish an objective function that
splices the desired structure and appearance representations, interweaving them
together in the space of ViT features. Based on our objective function, we
propose two frameworks of semantic appearance transfer -- "Splice", which works
by training a generator on a single and arbitrary pair of structure-appearance
images, and "SpliceNet", a feed-forward real-time appearance transfer model
trained on a dataset of images from a specific domain. Our frameworks do not
involve adversarial training, nor do they require any additional input
information such as semantic segmentation or correspondences. We demonstrate
high-resolution results on a variety of in-the-wild image pairs, under
significant variations in the number of objects, pose, and appearance. Code and
supplementary material are available in our project page: splice-vit.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">The realism of digital avatars is crucial in enabling telepresence
applications with self-expression and customization. A key aspect of this
realism originates from the physical accuracy of both a true-to-life body shape
and clothing. While physical simulations can produce high-quality, realistic
motions for clothed humans, they require precise estimation of body shape and
high-quality garment assets with associated physical parameters for cloth
simulations. However, manually creating these assets and calibrating their
parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. To address
this gap, we propose DiffAvatar, a novel approach that performs body and
garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating
physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex
nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body, our
framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material
parameters in a physically plausible way. Our experiments demonstrate that our
approach generates realistic clothing and body shape that can be easily used in
downstream applications.

grounded Newtonian dynamics within 3D Gaussians to achieve high-quality novel
motion synthesis. Employing a custom Material Point Method (MPM), our approach
enriches 3D Gaussian kernels with physically meaningful kinematic deformation
and mechanical stress attributes, all evolved in line with continuum mechanics
principles. A defining characteristic of our method is the seamless integration
between physical simulation and visual rendering: both components utilize the
same 3D Gaussian kernels as their discrete representations. This negates the
necessity for triangle/tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, "cage meshes," or
any other geometry embedding, highlighting the principle of "what you see is
what you simulate (WS$^2$)." Our method demonstrates exceptional versatility
across a wide variety of materials--including elastic entities, metals,
non-Newtonian fluids, and granular materials--showcasing its strong
capabilities in creating diverse visual content with novel viewpoints and
movements. Our project page is at: https://xpandora.github.io/PhysGaussian/

<p class="mathjax">In supervised speech separation, permutation invariant training (PIT) is
widely used to handle label ambiguity by selecting the best permutation to
update the model. Despite its success, previous studies showed that PIT is
plagued by excessive label assignment switching in adjacent epochs, impeding
the model to learn better label assignments. To address this issue, we propose
a novel training strategy, dynamic sample dropout (DSD), which considers
previous best label assignments and evaluation metrics to exclude the samples
that may negatively impact the learned label assignments during training.
Additionally, we include layer-wise optimization (LO) to improve the
performance by solving layer-decoupling. Our experiments showed that combining
DSD and LO outperforms the baseline and solves excessive label assignment
switching and layer-decoupling issues. The proposed DSD and LO approach is easy
to implement, requires no extra training sets or steps, and shows generality to
various speech separation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an optimal strategy for a Renewable Energy Community
participating in the Italian pay-as-bid ancillary service market. The community
is composed by a group of residential customers sharing a common facility
equipped with a PV power plant and a battery energy storage system. This
battery is employed to maximize the community cash flow obtained by the
participation in the service market. A scenario-based optimization problem is
defined to size the bids to be submitted to the market and to define the
corresponding optimal battery energy exchange profile for the day ahead. The
proposed optimization scheme is able to take in to account the probability of
acceptance of the service market bids and the uncertainties on the forecasts of
PV generation and energy demands. Results prove the effectiveness of the
approach and the economic advantages on participating in the service market.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have experienced a
series of cyber-attacks, leading to temporary, widespread blackouts of
considerable magnitude. Since most substations are unmanned and have limited
physical security protection, cyber breaches into power grid substations
present a risk. Nowadays, software-defined network (SDN), a popular virtual
network technology based on the OpenFlow protocol is being widely used in the
substation automation system. However, the susceptibility of SDN architecture
to cyber-attacks has exhibited a notable increase in recent years, as indicated
by research findings. This suggests a growing concern regarding the potential
for cybersecurity breaches within the SDN framework. In this paper, we propose
a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)-integrated SDN architecture for
detecting and preventing the injection of malicious IEC 61850-based generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages in a digital substation.
Additionally, this program locates the fault's location and, as a form of
mitigation, disables a certain port. Furthermore, implementation examples are
demonstrated and verified using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed that
mimics the functioning of a digital substation.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we introduce a novel semantics, called defense semantics, for
Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks in terms of a notion of (partial)
defence, which is a triple encoding that one argument is (partially) defended
by another argument via attacking the attacker of the first argument. In terms
of defense semantics, we show that defenses related to self-attacked arguments
and arguments in 3-cycles are unsatifiable under any situation and therefore
can be removed without affecting the defense semantics of an AF. Then, we
introduce a new notion of defense equivalence of AFs, and compare defense
equivalence with standard equivalence and strong equivalence, respectively.
Finally, by exploiting defense semantics, we define two kinds of reasons for
accepting arguments, i.e., direct reasons and root reasons, and a notion of
root equivalence of AFs that can be used in argumentation summarization.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial patch-based attacks have shown to be a major deterrent towards
the reliable use of machine learning models. These attacks involve the
strategic modification of localized patches or specific image areas to deceive
trained machine learning models. In this paper, we propose
\textit{DefensiveDR}, a practical mechanism using a dimensionality reduction
technique to thwart such patch-based attacks. Our method involves projecting
the sample images onto a lower-dimensional space while retaining essential
information or variability for effective machine learning tasks. We perform
this using two techniques, Singular Value Decomposition and t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. We experimentally tune the variability to be
preserved for optimal performance as a hyper-parameter. This dimension
reduction substantially mitigates adversarial perturbations, thereby enhancing
the robustness of the given machine learning model. Our defense is
model-agnostic and operates without assumptions about access to model decisions
or model architectures, making it effective in both black-box and white-box
settings. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across various models and remains
robust against several unseen patch-based attacks. The proposed defensive
approach improves the accuracy from 38.8\% (without defense) to 66.2\% (with
defense) when performing LaVAN and GoogleAp attacks, which supersedes that of
the prominent state-of-the-art like LGS (53.86\%) and Jujutsu (60\%).

<p class="mathjax">Wayfinding in complex indoor environments is often challenging for older
adults due to declines in navigational and spatial-cognition abilities. This
paper introduces NavMarkAR, an augmented reality navigation system designed for
smart-glasses to provide landmark-based guidance, aiming to enhance older
adults' spatial navigation skills. This work addresses a significant gap in
design research, with limited prior studies evaluating cognitive impacts of AR
navigation systems. An initial usability test involved 6 participants, leading
to prototype refinements, followed by a comprehensive study with 32
participants in a university setting. Results indicate improved wayfinding
efficiency and cognitive map accuracy when using NavMarkAR. Future research
will explore long-term cognitive skill retention with such navigational aids.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based user-centric approach for
processing sensing data in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
system with high accuracy and efficient resource utilization. The considered
scenario involves an ISAC device with a lightweight deep neural network (DNN)
and a mobile edge computing (MEC) server with a large DNN. After collecting
sensing data, the ISAC device either processes the data locally or uploads them
to the server for higher-accuracy data processing. To cope with data drifts,
the server updates the lightweight DNN when necessary, referred to as continual
learning. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average computation cost
of the MEC server by optimizing two decisions, i.e., sensing data offloading
and sensing data selection for the DNN update. A DT of the ISAC device is
constructed to predict the impact of potential decisions on the long-term
computation cost of the server, based on which the decisions are made with
closed-form formulas. Experiments on executing DNN-based human motion
recognition tasks are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of
the proposed DT-based approach in computation cost minimization.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new algorithm called the Free-pipeline Fast Inner Product
(FFIP) and its hardware architecture that improve an under-explored fast
inner-product algorithm (FIP) proposed by Winograd in 1968. Unlike the
unrelated Winograd minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional layers, FIP
is applicable to all machine learning (ML) model layers that can mainly
decompose to matrix multiplication, including fully-connected, convolutional,
recurrent, and attention/transformer layers. We implement FIP for the first
time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized
architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a
consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute
ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We
show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point
systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the
number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum
systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget. Our
FFIP implementation for non-sparse ML models with 8 to 16-bit fixed-point
inputs achieves higher throughput and compute efficiency than the best-in-class
prior solutions on the same type of compute platform.

<p class="mathjax">Battery management systems (BMS) are becoming increasingly important in the
modern age, where clean energy awareness is getting more prominent. They are
responsible for controlling large battery packs in modern electric vehicles.
However, conventional solutions rely only on a wired design, which adds
manufacturing cost and complexity. Recent research has considered wireless
solutions for the BMS. However, it is still challenging to develop a solution
that considers both the active in-vehicle and the external second-life
applications. The battery passport initiative aims to keep track of the
batteries, both during active and inactive use cases. There is a need to
provide a secure design while considering energy and cost-efficient solutions.
We aim to fill this gap by proposing a wireless solution based on near-field
communication (NFC) that extends previous work and provides a unified
architecture for both use cases. To provide protection against common wireless
threats, an advanced security analysis is performed, as well as a system design
analysis for the wake-up process that reduces the daily power consumption of
the stored battery packs from milli- to microwatts.

<p class="mathjax">The polynomial hierarchy has been widely studied in classical complexity
theory. In this paper, we will generalize some commonly known results about the
polynomial hierarchy to a version of the hierarchy extended to promise
problems. This paper proposes new definitions of existential and universal
operators for classes of promise problems. Applying these to BQP, we recover
the hierarchy proposed by Gharibian et al. (MFCS 2018). Moreover, using our
definition, we give an easy proof of the collapse of this hierarchy under a
Karp-Lipton-like scenario, which was an open question for the original
definition of Gharibian et al.

<p class="mathjax">Despite impressive recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models,
obtaining high-quality images often requires prompt engineering by humans who
have developed expertise in using them. In this work, we present NeuroPrompts,
an adaptive framework that automatically enhances a user's prompt to improve
the quality of generations produced by text-to-image models. Our framework
utilizes constrained text decoding with a pre-trained language model that has
been adapted to generate prompts similar to those produced by human prompt
engineers. This approach enables higher-quality text-to-image generations and
provides user control over stylistic features via constraint set specification.
We demonstrate the utility of our framework by creating an interactive
application for prompt enhancement and image generation using Stable Diffusion.
Additionally, we conduct experiments utilizing a large dataset of
human-engineered prompts for text-to-image generation and show that our
approach automatically produces enhanced prompts that result in superior image
quality. We make our code, a screencast video demo and a live demo instance of
NeuroPrompts publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of designing a data-driven feedback
controller for complex nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of
time-varying disturbances with unknown dynamics. Such disturbances are modeled
as the "unknown" part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve
finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while
also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven
stabilization or system identification. First, we expand upon the notion of
"regularizability" and characterize this system characteristic for a linear
time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded
higher-order terms. "Rapid-regularizability" then gauges the extent by which a
system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior.
We then propose the Data-Guided Regulation for Adaptive Nonlinear Control (
DG-RAN) algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes
discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states
and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of
adverse environmental disturbances.

<p class="mathjax">As businesses, products, and services spring up around large language models,
the trustworthiness of these models hinges on the verifiability of their
outputs. However, methods for explaining language model outputs largely fall
across two distinct fields of study which both use the term "attribution" to
refer to entirely separate techniques: citation generation and training data
attribution. In many modern applications, such as legal document generation and
medical question answering, both types of attributions are important. In this
work, we argue for and present a unified framework of large language model
attributions. We show how existing methods of different types of attribution
fall under the unified framework. We also use the framework to discuss
real-world use cases where one or both types of attributions are required. We
believe that this unified framework will guide the use case driven development
of systems that leverage both types of attribution, as well as the
standardization of their evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years witnessed a rising interest towards Datalog-based ontological
reasoning systems, both in academia and industry. These systems adopt
languages, often shared under the collective name of Datalog$+/-$, that extend
Datalog with the essential feature of existential quantification, while
introducing syntactic limitations to sustain reasoning decidability and achieve
a good trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. From an
implementation perspective, modern reasoners borrow the vast experience of the
database community in developing streaming-based data processing systems, such
as volcano-iterator architectures, that sustain a limited memory footprint and
good scalability. In this paper, we focus on two extremely promising,
expressive, and tractable languages, namely, Shy and Warded Datalog$+/-$. We
leverage their theoretical underpinnings to introduce novel reasoning
techniques, technically, "chase variants", that are particularly fit for
efficient reasoning in streaming-based architectures. We then implement them in
Vadalog, our reference streaming-based engine, to efficiently solve ontological
reasoning tasks over real-world settings.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks are increasingly recognized as a powerful numerical solution
technique for partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diverse
scientific computing domains, including quantum many-body physics. In the
context of time-dependent PDEs, the dominant paradigm involves casting the
approximate solution in terms of stochastic minimization of an objective
function given by the norm of the PDE residual, viewed as a function of the
neural network parameters. Recently, advancements have been made in the
direction of an alternative approach which shares aspects of nonlinearly
parametrized Galerkin methods and variational quantum Monte Carlo, especially
for high-dimensional, time-dependent PDEs that extend beyond the usual scope of
quantum physics. This paper is inspired by the potential of solving
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDEs using Neural Galerkin methods and commences
the exploration of nonlinearly parametrized trial functions for which the
evolution equations are analytically tractable. As a precursor to the Neural
Galerkin scheme, we present trial functions with evolution equations that admit
closed-form solutions, focusing on time-dependent HJB equations relevant to
finance.

<p class="mathjax">Assortment planning, integral to multiple commercial offerings, is a key
problem studied in e-commerce and retail settings. Numerous variants of the
problem along with their integration into business solutions have been
thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. However, the nuanced
complexities of in-store planning and a lack of optimization proficiency among
store planners with strong domain expertise remain largely overlooked. These
challenges frequently necessitate collaborative efforts with multiple
stakeholders which often lead to prolonged decision-making processes and
significant delays. To mitigate these challenges and capitalize on the
advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an interactive
assortment planning framework, InteraSSort that augments LLMs with optimization
tools to assist store planners in making decisions through interactive
conversations. Specifically, we develop a solution featuring a user-friendly
interface that enables users to express their optimization objectives as input
text prompts to InteraSSort and receive tailored optimized solutions as output.
Our framework extends beyond basic functionality by enabling the inclusion of
additional constraints through interactive conversation, facilitating precise
and highly customized decision-making. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework and potential extensions to a broad range of
operations management challenges.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world reinforcement learning problems, the state information is often
only partially observable, which breaks the basic assumption in Markov decision
processes, and thus, leads to inferior performances. Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes have been introduced to explicitly take the issue
into account for learning, exploration, and planning, but presenting
significant computational and statistical challenges. To address these
difficulties, we exploit the representation view, which leads to a coherent
design framework for a practically tractable reinforcement learning algorithm
upon partial observations. We provide a theoretical analysis for justifying the
statistical efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We also empirically
demonstrate the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art performance
with partial observations across various benchmarks, therefore, pushing
reliable reinforcement learning towards more practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Loop closure is necessary for correcting errors accumulated in simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments. However, conventional
loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause
high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop
closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some
literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D
scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an
approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine
high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct
accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The
effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.

<p class="mathjax">We are interested in assessing the use of neural networks as surrogate models
to approximate and minimize objective functions in optimization problems. While
neural networks are widely used for machine learning tasks such as
classification and regression, their application in solving optimization
problems has been limited. Our study begins by determining the best activation
function for approximating the objective functions of popular nonlinear
optimization test problems, and the evidence provided shows that~SiLU has the
best performance. We then analyze the accuracy of function value, gradient, and
Hessian approximations for such objective functions obtained through
interpolation/regression models and neural networks. When compared to
interpolation/regression models, neural networks can deliver competitive zero-
and first-order approximations (at a high training cost) but underperform on
second-order approximation. However, it is shown that combining a neural net
activation function with the natural basis for quadratic
interpolation/regression can waive the necessity of including cross terms in
the natural basis, leading to models with fewer parameters to determine.
Lastly, we provide evidence that the performance of a state-of-the-art
derivative-free optimization algorithm can hardly be improved when the gradient
of an objective function is approximated using any of the surrogate models
considered, including neural networks.

approach for processing dynamic graph-structured data. However, the influence
of temporal information on model performance and robustness remains
insufficiently explored, particularly regarding how models address prediction
tasks with different time granularities. In this paper, we explore the impact
of time granularity when training DGNNs on dynamic graphs through extensive
experiments. We examine graphs derived from various domains and compare three
different DGNNs to the baseline model across four varied time granularities. We
mainly consider the interplay between time granularities, model architectures,
and negative sampling strategies to obtain general conclusions. Our results
reveal that a sophisticated memory mechanism and proper time granularity are
crucial for a DGNN to deliver competitive and robust performance in the dynamic
link prediction task. We also discuss drawbacks in considered models and
datasets and propose promising directions for future research on the time
granularity of temporal graphs.

these issues, they often rely on simulations with simplistic, model-based
Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) during car-following scenarios. Diverging from this
trend, in this study, we analyze real-world human driving trajectories,
extracting a wide range of acceleration behaviors during car-following. We then
incorporate these behaviors in simulation where RVs from prior studies are
employed to mitigate congestion, and evaluate their safety, efficiency, and
stability. Further, we also introduce a reinforcement learning based RV that
utilizes a congestion stage classifier neural network to optimize either
"safety+stability" or "efficiency" in the presence of the diverse human driving
behaviors. We evaluate the proposed RVs in two different mixed traffic control
environments at various densities, configurations, and penetration rates and
compare with the existing RVs.

<p class="mathjax">Improving system-level resiliency of networked microgrids is an important
aspect with increased population of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This paper
(1) presents resilient control design in presence of adversarial cyber-events,
and proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning (Fed-RL) approach to
tackle (a) model complexities, unknown dynamical behaviors of IBR devices, (b)
privacy issues regarding data sharing in multi-party-owned networked grids, and
(2) transfers learned controls from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop
test-bed, thereby bridging the gap between simulation and real world. With
these multi-prong objectives, first, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL)
training setup generating episodic trajectories with adversaries (attack
signal) injected at the primary controllers of the grid forming (GFM) inverters
where RL agents (or controllers) are being trained to mitigate the injected
attacks. For networked microgrids, the horizontal Fed-RL method involving
distinct independent environments is not appropriate, leading us to develop
vertical variant Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FedSAC) algorithm to grasp the
interconnected dynamics of networked microgrid. Next, utilizing OpenAI Gym
interface, we built a custom simulation set-up in GridLAB-D/HELICS
co-simulation platform, named Resilient RL Co-simulation (ResRLCoSIM), to train
the RL agents with IEEE 123-bus benchmark test systems comprising 3
interconnected microgrids. Finally, the learned policies in simulation world
are transferred to the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up developed
using high-fidelity Hypersim platform. Experiments show that the
simulator-trained RL controllers produce convincing results with the real-time
test-bed set-up, validating the minimization of sim-to-real gap.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel inverse rendering method that enables the transformation
of existing indoor panoramas with new indoor furniture layouts under natural
illumination. To achieve this, we captured indoor HDR panoramas along with
real-time outdoor hemispherical HDR photographs. Indoor and outdoor HDR images
were linearly calibrated with measured absolute luminance values for accurate
scene relighting. Our method consists of three key components: (1) panoramic
furniture detection and removal, (2) automatic floor layout design, and (3)
global rendering with scene geometry, new furniture objects, and a real-time
outdoor photograph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our workflow in
rendering indoor scenes under different outdoor illumination conditions.
Additionally, we contribute a new calibrated HDR (Cali-HDR) dataset that
consists of 137 calibrated indoor panoramas and their associated outdoor

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies causal representation learning, the task of recovering
high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level data
that we observe, assuming access to observations generated from multiple
environments. While existing works are able to prove full identifiability of
the underlying data generating process, they typically assume access to
single-node, hard interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice. The
main contribution of this paper is characterize a notion of identifiability
which is provably the best one can achieve when hard interventions are not
available. First, for linear causal models, we provide identifiability
guarantee for data observed from general environments without assuming any
similarities between them. While the causal graph is shown to be fully
recovered, the latent variables are only identified up to an effect-domination
ambiguity (EDA). We then propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which is guaranteed to
recover the ground-truth model up to EDA, and we demonstrate its effectiveness
via numerical experiments. Moving on to general non-parametric causal models,
we prove the same idenfifiability guarantee assuming access to groups of soft
interventions. Finally, we provide counterparts of our identifiability results,
indicating that EDA is basically inevitable in our setting.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen categories based on
paired audio-visual sequences. Recent methods mainly focus on learning aligned
and discriminative multi-modal features to boost generalization towards unseen
categories. However, these approaches ignore the obscure action concepts in
category names and may inevitably introduce complex network structures with
difficult training objectives. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
framework named Knowledge-aware Distribution Adaptation (KDA) to help the model
better grasp the novel action contents with an external knowledge base.
Specifically, we first propose using large language models to generate rich
descriptions from category names, which leads to a better understanding of
unseen categories. Additionally, we propose a distribution alignment loss as
well as a knowledge-aware adaptive margin loss to further improve the
generalization ability towards unseen categories. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed KDA can outperform state-of-the-art
methods on three popular audio-visual zero-shot learning datasets. Our code
will be avaliable at \url{https://github.com/chenhaoxing/KDA}.

<p class="mathjax">Statistics of grain sizes and orientations in metals correlate to the
material's mechanical properties. Reproducing representative volume elements
for further analysis of deformation and failure in metals, like 316L stainless
steel, is particularly important due to their wide use in manufacturing goods
today. Two approaches, initially created for video games, were considered for
the procedural generation of representative grain microstructures. The first is
the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, and the second is constraint
propagation and probabilistic inference through Markov Junior, a free and
open-source software. This study aimed to investigate these two algorithms'
effectiveness in using reference electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps
and recreating a statistically similar one that could be used in further
research. It utilized two stainless steel EBSD maps as references to test both
algorithms. First, the WFC algorithm was too constricting and, thus, incapable
of producing images that resembled EBSDs. The second, MarkovJunior, was much
more effective in creating a Voronoi tessellation that could be used to create
an EBSD map in Python. When comparing the results between the reference and the
generated EBSD, we discovered that the orientation and volume fractions were
extremely similar. With the study, it was concluded that MarkovJunior is an
effective machine learning tool that can reproduce representative grain
microstructures.

<p class="mathjax">The growing complexity of next-generation networks exacerbates the modeling
and algorithmic flaws of conventional network optimization methodology. In this
paper, we propose a mobile network digital twin (MNDT) architecture for 6G
networks. To address the modeling and algorithmic shortcomings, the MNDT uses a
simulation-optimization structure. The feedback from the network simulation
engine, which serves as validation for the optimizer's decision outcomes, is
used explicitly to train artificial intelligence (AI) empowered optimizers
iteratively. In practice, we develop a network digital twin prototype system
leveraging data-driven technology to accurately model the behaviors of mobile
network elements (e.g., mobile users and base stations), wireless environments,
and network performance. An AI-powered network optimizer has been developed
based on the deployed MNDT prototype system for providing reliable and
optimized network configurations. The results of the experiments demonstrate
that the proposed MNDT infrastructure can provide practical network
optimization solutions while adapting to the more complex environment.

<p class="mathjax">This paper extends a new concept of energy-water-hydrogen (EWH) nexus, which
was recently developed as a solution for reducing carbon emissions from the
generation side of power systems, to the distribution side. Under the concept
of distribution-level EWH (micro EWH) nexus, renewable energy sources (RES) are
utilized to meet the energy needs of a small community. To avoid the
uncertainty caused by RESs, this paper aims to investigate the real-time
optimal operation of the micro EWH nexus which is however a challenging
optimization problem. First, such a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear
programming problem is relaxed into a mixed-integer convex program (MICP) by
leveraging the effective convex-hull relaxation technique. Second, a fast
data-driven solution method based on active constraint and integer variable
prediction is presented, which can solve the MICP problem very fast since it
utilizes historical optimization data to quickly predict binary variable values

<p class="mathjax">After a large language model (LLM) is deployed on edge devices, it is
desirable for these devices to learn from user-generated conversation data to
generate user-specific and personalized responses in real-time. However,
user-generated data usually contains sensitive and private information, and
uploading such data to the cloud for annotation is not preferred if not
prohibited. While it is possible to obtain annotation locally by directly
asking users to provide preferred responses, such annotations have to be sparse
to not affect user experience. In addition, the storage of edge devices is
usually too limited to enable large-scale fine-tuning with full user-generated
data. It remains an open question how to enable on-device LLM personalization,
considering sparse annotation and limited on-device storage. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework to select and store the most representative data
online in a self-supervised way. Such data has a small memory footprint and
allows infrequent requests of user annotations for further fine-tuning. To
enhance fine-tuning quality, multiple semantically similar pairs of question
texts and expected responses are generated using the LLM. Our experiments show
that the proposed framework achieves the best user-specific content-generating
capability (accuracy) and fine-tuning speed (performance) compared with vanilla
baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first on-device LLM
personalization framework.

<p class="mathjax">As the popularity of hierarchical point forecast reconciliation methods
increases, there is a growing interest in probabilistic forecast
reconciliation. Many studies have utilized machine learning or deep learning
techniques to implement probabilistic forecasting reconciliation and have made
notable progress. However, these methods treat the reconciliation step as a
fixed and hard post-processing step, leading to a trade-off between accuracy
and coherency. In this paper, we propose a new approach for probabilistic
forecast reconciliation. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed approach
fuses the prediction step and reconciliation step into a deep learning
framework, making the reconciliation step more flexible and soft by introducing
the Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term into the loss function. The
approach is evaluated using three hierarchical time series datasets, which
shows the advantages of our approach over other probabilistic forecast
reconciliation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Structural clustering is one of the most popular graph clustering methods,
which has achieved great performance improvement by utilizing GPUs. Even
though, the state-of-the-art GPU-based structural clustering algorithm,
GPUSCAN, still suffers from efficiency issues since lots of extra costs are
introduced for parallelization. Moreover, GPUSCAN assumes that the graph is
resident in the GPU memory. However, the GPU memory capacity is limited
currently while many real-world graphs are big and cannot fit in the GPU
memory, which makes GPUSCAN unable to handle large graphs. Motivated by this,
we present a new GPU-based structural clustering algorithm, GPUSCAN++, in this
paper. To address the efficiency issue, we propose a new progressive clustering
method tailored for GPUs that not only avoid high parallelization costs but
also fully exploits the computing resources of GPUs. To address the GPU memory
limitation issue, we propose a partition-based algorithm for structural
clustering that can process large graphs with limited GPU memory. We conduct
experiments on real graphs, and the experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm can achieve up to 168 times speedup compared with the
state-of-the-art GPU-based algorithm when the graph can be resident in the GPU
memory. Moreover, our algorithm is scalable to handle large graphs. As an
example, our algorithm can finish the structural clustering on a graph with 1.8
billion edges using less than 2 GB GPU memory.

recovery problem using a new regularization-based method, named orthogonally
weighted $\ell_{2,1}$ ($\mathit{ow}\ell_{2,1}$), which is specifically designed
to take into account the rank of the solution matrix. This method has
applications in feature extraction, matrix column selection, and dictionary
learning, and it is distinct from commonly used $\ell_{2,1}$ regularization and
other existing regularization-based approaches because it can exploit the full

provide a proof of the method's rank-awareness, establish the existence of

numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and demonstrate the

<p class="mathjax">Terrain traversability in off-road autonomy has traditionally relied on
semantic classification or resource-intensive dynamics models to capture
vehicle-terrain interactions. However, our experiences in the development of a
high-speed off-road platform have revealed several critical challenges that are
not adequately addressed by current methods at our operating speeds of 7--10
m/s. This study focuses particularly on uneven terrain geometries such as
hills, banks, and ditches. These common high-risk geometries are capable of
disabling the vehicle and causing severe passenger injuries if poorly
traversed. We introduce a physics-based framework for identifying
traversability constraints on terrain dynamics. Using this framework, we then
derive two fundamental constraints, with a primary focus on mitigating rollover
and ditch-crossing failures. In addition, we present the design of our planning
and control system, which uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a low-level
controller to enable the fast and efficient computation of these constraints to
meet the demands of our aggressive driving. Through real-world experimentation
and traversal of hills and ditches, our approach is tested and benchmarked
against a human expert. These results demonstrate that our approach captures
fundamental elements of safe and aggressive control on these terrain features.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) heralds a pivotal shift in online
user interactions with information. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR)
systems primarily relied on query-document matching, whereas LLMs excel in
comprehending and generating human-like text, thereby enriching the IR
experience significantly. While LLMs are often associated with chatbot
functionalities, this paper extends the discussion to their explicit
application in information retrieval. We explore methodologies to optimize the
retrieval process, select optimal models, and effectively scale and orchestrate
LLMs, aiming for cost-efficiency and enhanced result accuracy. A notable
challenge, model hallucination-where the model yields inaccurate or
misinterpreted data-is addressed alongside other model-specific hurdles. Our
discourse extends to crucial considerations including user privacy, data
optimization, and the necessity for system clarity and interpretability.
Through a comprehensive examination, we unveil not only innovative strategies
for integrating Language Models (LLMs) with Information Retrieval (IR) systems,
but also the consequential considerations that underline the need for a
balanced approach aligned with user-centric principles.

<p class="mathjax">Situated visualization presents data alongside their source context (physical
referent). While environmental factors influence memory recall (known as
Context-Dependent Memory or CDM), how physical context affects cognition in
real-world tasks such as working with visualizations in situated contexts is
unclear. This study explores the design space of information memorability in
situated visualization through the lens of CDM. We investigate the presence of
physical referents for creating contextual cues in desktop and Virtual Reality
(VR) environments. Across three studies (n=144), we observe a trend suggesting
a CDM effect due to contextual referent is more apparent in VR. Overall, we did
not find statistically significant evidence of a CDM effect due to the presence
of a referent. However, we did find a significant CDM effect for lighting
conditions. This suggests that representing the entire environment, rather than
the physical objects alone, may be necessary to provide sufficiently strong
contextual memory cues.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language
processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the
pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by
retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language
model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the
structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models
are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the
faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel
structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document
structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document
graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship,
etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g.,
Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the
curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding
passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text
embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the
documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language
model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that
include science question-answering and scientific document classification
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves
retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while
showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models have recently gained attention within the field of machine
learning thanks to its efficiency in broad data processing. While researchers
had attempted to extend this success to time series models, the main challenge
is effectively extracting representations and transferring knowledge from
pretraining datasets to the target finetuning dataset. To tackle this issue, we
introduce a novel pretraining procedure that leverages supervised contrastive
learning to distinguish features within each pretraining dataset. This
pretraining phase enables a probabilistic similarity metric, which assesses the
likelihood of a univariate sample being closely related to one of the
pretraining datasets. Subsequently, using this similarity metric as a guide, we
propose a fine-tuning procedure designed to enhance the accurate prediction of
the target data by aligning it more closely with the learned dynamics of the
pretraining datasets. Our experiments have shown promising results which
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Existing 3D semantic segmentation methods rely on point-wise or voxel-wise
feature descriptors to output segmentation predictions. However, these
descriptors are often supervised at point or voxel level, leading to
segmentation models that can behave poorly at instance-level. In this paper, we
proposed a novel instance-aware approach for 3D semantic segmentation. Our
method combines several geometry processing tasks supervised at instance-level
to promote the consistency of the learned feature representation. Specifically,
our methods use shape generators and shape classifiers to perform shape
reconstruction and classification tasks for each shape instance. This enforces
the feature representation to faithfully encode both structural and local shape
information, with an awareness of shape instances. In the experiments, our
method significantly outperform existing approaches in 3D semantic segmentation
on several public benchmarks, such as Waymo Open Dataset, SemanticKITTI and
ScanNetV2.

<p class="mathjax">The overarching objective of this paper is two-fold. First, to explore
model-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the
RE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards
the first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis
of TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from
the instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the
second objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to
automatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and
reannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is
based on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used
false-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our
second approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean
subset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally,
we retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset. Our
empirical results based on two SOTA models trained on TACRED-E following the IS
show an average 4% F1-score improvement, whereas reannotation (TACRED-R) does
not improve the original results. However, following ES, SOTA models show the
average F1-score improvement of 3.8% and 4.4% when trained on respective
eliminated (TACRED-EN) and reannotated (TACRED-RN) datasets respectively. We
further extended the ES for cleaning positive examples as well, which resulted
in an average performance improvement of 5.8% and 5.6% for the eliminated
(TACRED-ENP) and reannotated (TACRED-RNP) datasets respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Automated human action recognition, a burgeoning field within computer
vision, boasts diverse applications spanning surveillance, security,
human-computer interaction, tele-health, and sports analysis. Precise action
recognition in infants serves a multitude of pivotal purposes, encompassing
safety monitoring, developmental milestone tracking, early intervention for
developmental delays, fostering parent-infant bonds, advancing computer-aided
diagnostics, and contributing to the scientific comprehension of child
development. This paper delves into the intricacies of infant action
recognition, a domain that has remained relatively uncharted despite the
accomplishments in adult action recognition. In this study, we introduce a
groundbreaking dataset called ``InfActPrimitive'', encompassing five
significant infant milestone action categories, and we incorporate specialized
preprocessing for infant data. We conducted an extensive comparative analysis
employing cutting-edge skeleton-based action recognition models using this
dataset. Our findings reveal that, although the PoseC3D model achieves the
highest accuracy at approximately 71%, the remaining models struggle to
accurately capture the dynamics of infant actions. This highlights a
substantial knowledge gap between infant and adult action recognition domains
and the urgent need for data-efficient pipeline models.

discover effective land-use policies for specific locations. Such a system was

<p class="mathjax">In the fundamental statistics course, students are taught to remember the
well-known saying: "Correlation is not Causation". Till now, statistics (i.e.,
correlation) have developed various successful frameworks, such as Transformer
and Pre-training large-scale models, which have stacked multiple parallel
self-attention blocks to imitate a wide range of tasks. However, in the
causation community, how to build an integrated causal framework still remains
an untouched domain despite its excellent intervention capabilities. In this
paper, we propose the Causal Graph Routing (CGR) framework, an integrated
causal scheme relying entirely on the intervention mechanisms to reveal the
cause-effect forces hidden in data. Specifically, CGR is composed of a stack of
causal layers. Each layer includes a set of parallel deconfounding blocks from
different causal graphs. We combine these blocks via the concept of the
proposed sufficient cause, which allows the model to dynamically select the
suitable deconfounding methods in each layer. CGR is implemented as the stacked
networks, integrating no confounder, back-door adjustment, front-door
adjustment, and probability of sufficient cause. We evaluate this framework on
two classical tasks of CV and NLP. Experiments show CGR can surpass the current
state-of-the-art methods on both Visual Question Answer and Long Document
Classification tasks. In particular, CGR has great potential in building the
"causal" pre-training large-scale model that effectively generalizes to diverse
tasks. It will improve the machines' comprehension of causal relationships
within a broader semantic space.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the utility of graph neural networks (GNNs) as proxies of
power grid operational decision-making algorithms (optimal power flow (OPF) and
security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)) to enable rigorous quantification
of the operational risk. To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte
Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (foretasted) probability distributions of
spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF
and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using
traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s).
The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting
quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and
SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at
system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk
quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from
OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing
fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for
OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk
assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied
in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification.

<p class="mathjax">A customer service platform system with a core text semantic similarity (STS)
task faces two urgent challenges: Firstly, one platform system needs to adapt
to different domains of customers, i.e., different domains adaptation (DDA).
Secondly, it is difficult for the model of the platform system to distinguish
sentence pairs that are literally close but semantically different, i.e., hard
negative samples. In this paper, we propose an incorporation external keywords
matrices model (IEKM) to address these challenges. The model uses external
tools or dictionaries to construct external matrices and fuses them to the
self-attention layers of the Transformer structure through gating units, thus
enabling flexible corrections to the model results. We evaluate the method on
multiple datasets and the results show that our method has improved performance
on all datasets. To demonstrate that our method can effectively solve all the
above challenges, we conduct a flexible correction experiment, which results in
an increase in the F1 value from 56.61 to 73.53. Our code will be publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">Arbitrary oriented object detection (AOOD) in aerial images is a widely
concerned and highly challenging task, and plays an important role in many
scenarios. The core of AOOD involves the representation, encoding, and feature
augmentation of oriented bounding-boxes (Bboxes). Existing methods lack
intuitive modeling of angle difference measurement in oriented Bbox
representations. Oriented Bboxes under different representations exhibit
rotational symmetry with varying periods due to angle periodicity. The angular
boundary discontinuity (ABD) problem at periodic boundary positions is caused
by rotational symmetry in measuring angular differences. In addition, existing
methods also use additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes.
In this paper, we design an angular boundary free loss (ABFL) based on the von
Mises distribution. The ABFL aims to solve the ABD problem when detecting
oriented objects. Specifically, ABFL proposes to treat angles as circular data
rather than linear data when measuring angle differences, aiming to introduce
angle periodicity to alleviate the ABD problem and improve the accuracy of
angle difference measurement. In addition, ABFL provides a simple and effective
solution for various periodic boundary discontinuities caused by rotational
symmetry in AOOD tasks, as it does not require additional encoding-decoding
structures for oriented Bboxes. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016
datasets show that the proposed ABFL loss outperforms some state-of-the-art
methods focused on addressing the ABD problem.

<p class="mathjax">Our goal is to define an algebraic language for reasoning about
non-deterministic computations. Towards this goal, we introduce an algebra of
string-to-string transductions. Specifically, it is an algebra of partial
functions on words over the alphabet of relational $\tau$-structures over the
same domain. The algebra has a two-level syntax, and thus, two parameters to
control its expressive power. The top level defines algebraic expressions, and
the bottom level specifies atomic transitions. History-dependent Choice
functions resolve atomic non-determinism, and make general relations
functional. Equivalence classes of such functions serve as certificates for
computational problems specified by algebraic terms. The algebra has an
equivalent syntax in the form of a Dynamic Logic, where terms describing
computational processes or programs appear inside the modalities. We define a
simple secondary logic for representing atomic transitions, which is a
modification of conjunctive queries. With this logic, the algebra can represent
both reachability and counting examples, which is not possible in Datalog. We
analyze the data complexity of this logic, measured in the size of the input
structure, and show that a restricted fragment of the logic captures the
complexity class NP. The logic can be viewed as a database query language,
where atomic propagations are separated from control.

<p class="mathjax">Graph sparsification is a technique that approximates a given graph by a
sparse graph with a subset of vertices and/or edges. The goal of an effective
sparsification algorithm is to maintain specific graph properties relevant to
the downstream task while minimizing the graph's size. Graph algorithms often
suffer from long execution time due to the irregularity and the large
real-world graph size. Graph sparsification can be applied to greatly reduce
the run time of graph algorithms by substituting the full graph with a much
smaller sparsified graph, without significantly degrading the output quality.
However, the interaction between numerous sparsifiers and graph properties is
not widely explored, and the potential of graph sparsification is not fully
understood.
<br />In this work, we cover 16 widely-used graph metrics, 12 representative graph
sparsification algorithms, and 14 real-world input graphs spanning various
categories, exhibiting diverse characteristics, sizes, and densities. We
developed a framework to extensively assess the performance of these
sparsification algorithms against graph metrics, and provide insights to the
results. Our study shows that there is no one sparsifier that performs the best
in preserving all graph properties, e.g. sparsifiers that preserve
distance-related graph properties (eccentricity) struggle to perform well on
Graph Neural Networks (GNN). This paper presents a comprehensive experimental
study evaluating the performance of sparsification algorithms in preserving
essential graph metrics. The insights inform future research in incorporating
matching graph sparsification to graph algorithms to maximize benefits while
minimizing quality degradation. Furthermore, we provide a framework to
facilitate the future evaluation of evolving sparsification algorithms, graph
metrics, and ever-growing graph data.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across various natural language processing tasks. Yet, many of these advanced
LLMs are tailored for broad, general-purpose applications. In this technical
report, we introduce AcademicGPT, designed specifically to empower academic
research. AcademicGPT is a continual training model derived from LLaMA2-70B.
Our training corpus mainly consists of academic papers, thesis, content from
some academic domain, high-quality Chinese data and others. While it may not be
extensive in data scale, AcademicGPT marks our initial venture into a
domain-specific GPT tailored for research area. We evaluate AcademicGPT on
several established public benchmarks such as MMLU and CEval, as well as on
some specialized academic benchmarks like PubMedQA, SCIEval, and our
newly-created ComputerScienceQA, to demonstrate its ability from general
knowledge ability, to Chinese ability, and to academic ability. Building upon
AcademicGPT's foundation model, we also developed several applications catered
to the academic area, including General Academic Question Answering,
AI-assisted Paper Reading, Paper Review, and AI-assisted Title and Abstract
Generation.

<p class="mathjax">Histopathology serves as the gold standard for medical diagnosis but faces
application limitations due to the shortage of medical resources. Leveraging
deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the
pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis. However, developing
a reliable model generally necessitates substantial data for training, which is
challenging in pathological field. In response, we propose an adaptive
depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data
generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and
overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance.
Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and
local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and
ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive
depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of
yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft
labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and
supportable for further pathology-related research.

<p class="mathjax">With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs), multimodal AI systems benefiting from large models have the
potential to equally perceive the real world, make decisions, and control tools
as humans. In recent months, LLMs have shown widespread attention in autonomous
driving and map systems. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack
of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future
endeavors to apply in LLM driving systems. In this paper, we present a
systematic investigation in this field. We first introduce the background of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the multimodal models development
using LLMs, and the history of autonomous driving. Then, we overview existing
MLLM tools for driving, transportation, and map systems together with existing
datasets and benchmarks. Moreover, we summarized the works in The 1st WACV
Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD),
which is the first workshop of its kind regarding LLMs in autonomous driving.
To further promote the development of this field, we also discuss several
important problems regarding using MLLMs in autonomous driving systems that
need to be solved by both academia and industry.

developing a method for identifying and preventing hardware Trojans, employing
functional verification tools and languages familiar to hardware designers. We
dump synthesized design netlist mapped to a field programmable gate array

switching and coverage, which allows us to retrieve Trojan trigger condition.
We further provide a solution to preventing Trojan from activation by
reconfiguring the confirmed malicious LUTs. Experimental results have
demonstrated that our method can detect and mitigate Trust-Hub as well as
recently reported don't care Trojans.

<p class="mathjax">Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on
online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly
stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise
in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research
practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for
a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on
social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization
at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such
existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires
laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks
the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media
conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in
social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user
communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we
first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post
content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality
of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated
dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can
exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social
media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot
learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods
and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts
collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab
and Twitter.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate dynamic modeling of power systems is essential to assess the
stability of electrical power systems when faced with disturbances, which can
trigger cascading failures leading to blackouts. A continuum model proves to be
effective in capturing Electromechanical Wave (EMW) propagation
characteristics, including its velocity, arrival time, and deviations.
Analyzing these characteristics enables the assessment of the impacts of EMW on
the performance of the protection system. Prior research has often modeled
nonlinear EMW propagation through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) within
a homogeneous and uniform frame structure, assuming constant bus voltages
across the entire power system. However, this assumption can produce inaccurate
results. In this paper, we relax this assumption by introducing a second-order
nonlinear hyperbolic EMW propagation equation model that accounts for voltage
variations. Additionally, we present numerical solutions for the EMW
propagation equation using the Lax-Wendroff integration method. To validate our
approach, we conduct simulations on two test systems: a two-bus one-machine
system and the New England 39-bus 10-machine system. The simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and emphasize the
importance of including the bus voltage equations in the analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models have revolutionized human-computer interaction and
shown significant progress in multi-modal tasks. However, applying these models
to complex visual tasks like medical image analysis remains challenging. In
this study, we propose ViLaM, a unified Vision-Language transformer model that
integrates instruction tuning predicated on a large language model. This
approach enables us to optimally utilize the knowledge and reasoning capacities
of large pre-trained language models for an array of tasks encompassing both
language and vision. We employ frozen pre-trained encoders to encode and align
both image and text features, enabling ViLaM to handle a variety of visual
tasks following textual instructions. Besides, we've designed cycle training
for referring expressions to address the need for high-quality, paired
referring expression datasets for training large models in terms of both
quantity and quality. We evaluated ViLaM's exceptional performance on public
general datasets and further confirmed its generalizability on medical
datasets. Importantly, we've observed the model's impressive zero-shot learning
ability, indicating the potential future application of ViLaM in the medical
field.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are widely considered state-of-the-art for
collaborative filtering. Although several GCN-based methods have been proposed
and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they can be
computationally expensive and time-consuming to train if too many layers are
created. However, since the linear GCN model can be interpreted as a
differential equation, it is possible to transfer it to an ODE problem. This
inspired us to address the computational limitations of GCN-based models by
designing a simple and efficient NODE-based model that can skip some GCN layers
to reach the final state, thus avoiding the need to create many layers. In this
work, we propose a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation-based method for
Collaborative Filtering (GODE-CF). This method estimates the final embedding by
utilizing the information captured by one or two GCN layers. To validate our
approach, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results
demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines, including
GCN-based models and other state-of-the-art CF methods. Notably, our proposed
GODE-CF model has several advantages over traditional GCN-based models. It is
simple, efficient, and has a fast training time, making it a practical choice
for real-world situations.

<p class="mathjax">A distinction is often drawn between a model's ability to predict a label for
an evaluation sample that is directly memorised from highly similar training
samples versus an ability to predict the label via some method of
generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering,
discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered
through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally
be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method
of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would
have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input
tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that
our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to
surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or
discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable
subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask
fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two
additional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart
simple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on
some of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is
performance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of
the evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional
training datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of
our evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and
25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change
in performance.

game theory specifically for intersection applications are then summarized.
Next, we present the game-theoretic models and solutions that have been applied
to intersection management. Finally, the limitations and potential

<p class="mathjax">Recent text-to-image diffusion models have reached an unprecedented level in
generating high-quality images. However, their exclusive reliance on textual
prompts often falls short in accurately conveying fine-grained spatial
compositions. In this paper, we propose LoCo, a training-free approach for
layout-to-image synthesis that excels in producing high-quality images aligned
with both textual prompts and spatial layouts. Our method introduces a
Localized Attention Constraint to refine cross-attention for individual
objects, ensuring their precise placement in designated regions. We further
propose a Padding Token Constraint to leverage the semantic information
embedded in previously neglected padding tokens, thereby preventing the
undesired fusion of synthesized objects. LoCo seamlessly integrates into
existing text-to-image and layout-to-image models, significantly amplifying
their performance and effectively addressing semantic failures observed in
prior methods. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the superiority of
our approach, surpassing existing state-of-the-art training-free
layout-to-image methods both qualitatively and quantitatively across multiple
benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the distinctive characteristics of sensors, each modality exhibits
unique physical properties. For this reason, in the context of multi-modal
action recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall action
content but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In this
paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network,
which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary information
across modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition.
A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal Contextualization
Unit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible for
temporally encoding a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action content
features of other modalities (e.g., depth and infrared modalities). This
process encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also to
supplement complementary information of other modalities. Furthermore, to
extract appropriate complementary information regarding to the given modality
settings, we introduce a new module, named Complementary Feature Extraction
Module (CFEM). CFEM incorporates sepearte learnable query embeddings for each
modality, which guide CFEM to extract complementary information and global
action content from the other modalities. As a result, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and
NW-UCLA datasets. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we further
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Aerial object detection is a challenging task, in which one major obstacle
lies in the limitations of large-scale data collection and the long-tail
distribution of certain classes. Synthetic data offers a promising solution,
especially with recent advances in diffusion-based methods like stable
diffusion (SD). However, the direct application of diffusion methods to aerial
domains poses unique challenges: stable diffusion's optimization for rich
ground-level semantics doesn't align with the sparse nature of aerial objects,
and the extraction of post-synthesis object coordinates remains problematic. To
address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework
tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest
(ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model
with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and
finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds,
providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data.

<p class="mathjax">With the bomb ignited by ChatGPT, Transformer-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) have paved a revolutionary path toward Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI) and have been applied in diverse areas as knowledge bases, human
interfaces, and dynamic agents. However, a prevailing limitation exists: many
current LLMs, constrained by resources, are primarily pre-trained on shorter
texts, rendering them less effective for longer-context prompts, commonly
encountered in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey focusing on the advancement of model architecture in Transformer-based
LLMs to optimize long-context capabilities across all stages from pre-training
to inference. We firstly delineate and analyze the problems of handling
long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. Then,
we mainly offer a holistic taxonomy to navigate the landscape of Transformer
upgrades on architecture to solve these problems. Afterward, we provide the
investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context
LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as some amazing
optimization toolkits like libraries, systems, and compilers to augment LLMs'
efficiency and efficacy across different stages. Finally, we further discuss
the predominant challenges and potential avenues for future research in this
domain. Additionally, we have established a repository where we curate relevant
literature with real-time updates at

<p class="mathjax">Tour itinerary recommendation involves planning a sequence of relevant
Point-of-Interest (POIs), which combines challenges from the fields of both
Operations Research (OR) and Recommendation Systems (RS). As an OR problem,
there is the need to maximize a certain utility (e.g., popularity of POIs in
the tour) while adhering to some constraints (e.g., maximum time for the tour).
As a RS problem, it is heavily related to problem or filtering or ranking a
subset of POIs that are relevant to a user and recommending it as part of an
itinerary. In this paper, we explore the use of language models for the task of
tour itinerary recommendation and planning. This task has the unique
requirement of recommending personalized POIs relevant to users and planning
these POIs as an itinerary that satisfies various constraints. We discuss some
approaches in this area, such as using word embedding techniques like Word2Vec
and GloVe for learning POI embeddings and transformer-based techniques like
BERT for generating
<br />itineraries.

<p class="mathjax">Despite their popularity across a wide range of domains, regression neural
networks are prone to overfitting complex datasets. In this work, we propose a
loss function termed Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, which is empirically
shown to mitigate overfitting. With RLP loss, the distance between sets of
hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of the neural network's
feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs is minimized. The intuition
behind this loss derives from the notion that if two functions share the same
hyperplanes connecting all subsets of feature-label pairs, then these functions
must necessarily be equivalent. Our empirical studies, conducted across
benchmark datasets and representative synthetic examples, demonstrate the
improvements of the proposed RLP loss over mean squared error (MSE).
Specifically, neural networks trained with the RLP loss achieve better
performance while requiring fewer data samples and are more robust to additive
noise. We provide theoretical analysis supporting our empirical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) on heterogeneous data (non-IID data) has recently
received great attention. Most existing methods focus on studying the
convergence guarantees for the global objective. While these methods can
guarantee the decrease of the global objective in each communication round,
they fail to ensure risk decrease for each client. In this paper, to address
the problem,we propose FedCOME, which introduces a consensus mechanism to
enforce decreased risk for each client after each training round. In
particular, we allow a slight adjustment to a client's gradient on the server
side, which generates an acute angle between the corrected gradient and the
original ones of other clients. We theoretically show that the consensus
mechanism can guarantee the convergence of the global objective. To generalize
the consensus mechanism to the partial participation FL scenario, we devise a
novel client sampling strategy to select the most representative clients for
the global data distribution. Training on these selected clients with the
consensus mechanism could empirically lead to risk decrease for clients that
are not selected. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets to show the superiority of FedCOME against other state-of-the-art
methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness. For
reproducibility, we make our source code publicly available at:

<p class="mathjax">Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a powerful technique for model
compression, reducing the precision of neural networks without additional
training overhead. Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point
quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the
exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison
with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present
minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of
further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model
while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ
design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes
across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the
applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight
equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding,
and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of
low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a
spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning
vision workloads. Finally, we evaluate our results against an FPGA-based
hardware cost model, showing that integer quantization often remains the
Pareto-optimal option, given its relatively smaller hardware resource
footprint.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised learning is increasingly popular in medical image
segmentation due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to
extract additional information. However, most existing semi-supervised
segmentation methods focus only on extracting information from unlabeled data.
In this paper, we propose a novel Dual KMax UX-Net framework that leverages
labeled data to guide the extraction of information from unlabeled data. Our
approach is based on a mutual learning strategy that incorporates two modules:
3D UX-Net as our backbone meta-architecture and KMax decoder to enhance the
segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on the Atrial Segmentation
Challenge dataset have shown that our method can significantly improve
performance by merging unlabeled data. Meanwhile, our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods on 10\% and 20\% labeled
settings. Code located at: https://github.com/Rows21/DK-UXNet.

<p class="mathjax">We study how to design learning-based adaptive controllers that enable fast
and accurate online adaptation in changing environments. In these settings,
learning is typically done during an initial (offline) design phase, where the
vehicle is exposed to different environmental conditions and disturbances
(e.g., a drone exposed to different winds) to collect training data. Our work
is motivated by the observation that real-world disturbances fall into two
categories: 1) those that can be directly monitored or controlled during
training, which we call "manageable", and 2) those that cannot be directly
measured or controlled (e.g., nominal model mismatch, air plate effects, and
unpredictable wind), which we call "latent". Imprecise modeling of these
effects can result in degraded control performance, particularly when latent
disturbances continuously vary. This paper presents the Hierarchical
Meta-learning-based Adaptive Controller (HMAC) to learn and adapt to such
multi-source disturbances. Within HMAC, we develop two techniques: 1)
Hierarchical Iterative Learning, which jointly trains representations to
caption the various sources of disturbances, and 2) Smoothed Streaming
Meta-Learning, which learns to capture the evolving structure of latent
disturbances over time (in addition to standard meta-learning on the manageable
disturbances). Experimental results demonstrate that HMAC exhibits more precise
and rapid adaptation to multi-source disturbances than other adaptive
controllers.

<p class="mathjax">The widespread use of the Internet has revolutionized information retrieval
methods. However, this transformation has also given rise to a significant
cybersecurity challenge: the rapid proliferation of malicious URLs, which serve
as entry points for a wide range of cyber threats. In this study, we present an
efficient pre-training model-based framework for malicious URL detection.
Leveraging the subword and character-aware pre-trained model, CharBERT, as our
foundation, we further develop three key modules: hierarchical feature
extraction, layer-aware attention, and spatial pyramid pooling. The
hierarchical feature extraction module follows the pyramid feature learning
principle, extracting multi-level URL embeddings from the different Transformer
layers of CharBERT. Subsequently, the layer-aware attention module autonomously
learns connections among features at various hierarchical levels and allocates
varying weight coefficients to each level of features. Finally, the spatial
pyramid pooling module performs multiscale downsampling on the weighted
multi-level feature pyramid, achieving the capture of local features as well as
the aggregation of global features. The proposed method has been extensively
validated on multiple public datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement
over prior works, with the maximum accuracy gap reaching 8.43% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, we have assessed the model's
generalization and robustness in scenarios such as cross-dataset evaluation and
adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted real-world case studies on the
active phishing URLs.

<p class="mathjax">Forecast combination integrates information from various sources by
consolidating multiple forecast results from the target time series. Instead of
the need to select a single optimal forecasting model, this paper introduces a
deep learning ensemble forecasting model based on the Dirichlet process.
Initially, the learning rate is sampled with three basis distributions as
hyperparameters to convert the infinite mixture into a finite one. All
checkpoints are collected to establish a deep learning sub-model pool, and
weight adjustment and diversity strategies are developed during the combination
process. The main advantage of this method is its ability to generate the
required base learners through a single training process, utilizing the
decaying strategy to tackle the challenge posed by the stochastic nature of
gradient descent in determining the optimal learning rate. To ensure the
method's generalizability and competitiveness, this paper conducts an empirical
analysis using the weekly dataset from the M4 competition and explores
sensitivity to the number of models to be combined. The results demonstrate
that the ensemble model proposed offers substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy and stability compared to a single benchmark model.

method for double integrator dynamics. We show that whereas plain RRT fails in
every instance to plan for $4$ robots, our method can plan for up to 16 robots,
corresponding to searching through a very large 65-dimensional space, which
validates the effectiveness of data-driven heuristics at combating exponential
search space growth. We also find that the heuristic information is
complementary; using both heuristics produces search trees with lower failure
rates, nodes, and path costs when compared to using each in isolation. These

<p class="mathjax">Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with
respect to example boxes or class names, \emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot
counting. Current state-of-the-art methods highly rely on density maps to
predict object counts, which lacks model interpretability. In this paper, we
propose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting
based on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two
foundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\textbf{i})
SAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\textbf{ii}) CLIP
to classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy
meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that
cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework,
termed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we
first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but
least point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation
costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a
generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as
the classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain
discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive
experimental results on FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that PseCo achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object
counting/detection, with additional results on large-scale COCO and LVIS
datasets. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Visibility graph (VG) transformation is a technique used to convert a time
series into a graph based on specific visibility criteria. It has attracted
increasing interest in the fields of time series analysis, forecasting, and
classification. Optimizing the VG transformation algorithm to accelerate the
process is a critical aspect of VG-related research, as it enhances the
applicability of VG transformation in latency-sensitive areas and conserves
computational resources. In the real world, many time series are presented in
the form of data streams. Despite the proposal of the concept of VG's online
functionality, previous studies have not thoroughly explored the acceleration
of VG transformation by leveraging the characteristics of data streams. In this
paper, we propose that an efficient online VG algorithm should adhere to two
criteria and develop a linear-time method, termed the LOT framework, for both
natural and horizontal visibility graph transformations in data stream
scenarios. Experiments are conducted on two datasets, comparing our approach
with five existing methods as baselines. The results demonstrate the validity
and promising computational efficiency of our framework.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing the challenge of adapting pre-trained vision-language models for
generating insightful explanations for visual reasoning tasks with limited
annotations, we present ReVisE: a $\textbf{Re}$cursive $\textbf{Vis}$ual
$\textbf{E}$xplanation algorithm. Our method iteratively computes visual
features (conditioned on the text input), an answer, and an explanation, to
improve the explanation quality step by step until the answer converges. We
find that this multi-step approach guides the model to correct its own answers
and outperforms single-step explanation generation. Furthermore, explanations
generated by ReVisE also serve as valuable annotations for few-shot
self-training. Our approach outperforms previous methods while utilizing merely
5% of the human-annotated explanations across 10 metrics, demonstrating up to a
4.2 and 1.3 increase in BLEU-1 score on the VCR and VQA-X datasets,
underscoring the efficacy and data-efficiency of our method.

<p class="mathjax">The task of logic synthesis is to map a technology-independent representation
of an application to hardware-specific operations, taking into account various
constraints and trading off different costs associated with the implementation.
Constraints may include the target gate library and feasible connectivity,
whereas the costs capture, for example, the required chip area and delay. Here
we propose to use parallel tempering Monte Carlo to find low-level
implementations of a given Boolean function. In contrast to previous work
leveraging Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as simulated annealing, we do
not start with an initially correct (but suboptimal) implementation that is
then further optimized. Instead, our approach starts with a random logic
network that is subsequently modified in order to reduce the error to zero. We
apply our method to the task of synthesizing Majority-$n$ in terms of
Majority-$3$ gates with and without inverters, aiming for a low Majority-$3$
count. Our method is able to find solutions that are on par or better than
previously known solutions. For example, for $n\in\{9,11,13\}$ our approach
successfully finds inverter-free implementations using between 7% and 42% fewer
Majority-$3$ gates.

and finding proper equivalent of those words are very important to render
correctly and understandably, the article defines some thoughts and ideas of
scientists on the common problems of non-equivalent words from English to
Russian language and includes English and Russian examples and ideas of certain
scientist. The English language is worldwide spoken and there are 1.35 billion
English speakers and over 258 million Russian speakers according to the 2021s
statistics. Inevitably, these billions of speakers around the world have
connection and they may have deal in different criteria. In order to understand
one another they need to have a pure and fully-understood language. These pure
languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge where
linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. Hence, this research paper includes different ways and rules of
rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target language.

<p class="mathjax">Growing global concerns about climate change highlight the need for
environmentally sustainable computing. The ecological impact of computing,
including operational and embodied, is a key consideration. Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs) stand out as promising sustainable computing platforms due
to their reconfigurability across various applications. This paper introduces
GreenFPGA, a tool estimating the total carbon footprint (CFP) of FPGAs over
their lifespan, considering design, manufacturing, reconfigurability (reuse),
operation, disposal, and recycling. Using GreenFPGA, the paper evaluates
scenarios where the ecological benefits of FPGA reconfigurability outweigh
operational and embodied carbon costs, positioning FPGAs as a environmentally
sustainable choice for hardware acceleration compared to Application-Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Experimental results show that FPGAs have lower
CFP than ASICs, particularly for multiple distinct, low-volume applications, or
short application lifespans.

<p class="mathjax">Recent generative models show impressive performance in generating
photographic images. Humans can hardly distinguish such incredibly
realistic-looking AI-generated images from real ones. AI-generated images may
lead to ubiquitous disinformation dissemination. Therefore, it is of utmost
urgency to develop a detector to identify AI-generated images. Most existing
detectors suffer from sharp performance drops over unseen generative models. In
this paper, we propose a novel AI-generated image detector capable of
identifying fake images created by a wide range of generative models. Our
approach leverages the inter-pixel correlation contrast between rich and poor
texture regions within an image. Pixels in rich texture regions exhibit more
significant fluctuations than those in poor texture regions. This discrepancy
reflects that the entropy of rich texture regions is larger than that of poor
ones. Consequently, synthesizing realistic rich texture regions proves to be
more challenging for existing generative models. Based on this principle, we
divide an image into multiple patches and reconstruct them into two images,
comprising rich-texture and poor-texture patches respectively. Subsequently, we
extract the inter-pixel correlation discrepancy feature between rich and poor
texture regions. This feature serves as a universal fingerprint used for
AI-generated image forensics across different generative models. In addition,
we build a comprehensive AI-generated image detection benchmark, which includes
16 kinds of prevalent generative models, to evaluate the effectiveness of
existing baselines and our approach. Our benchmark provides a leaderboard for
follow-up studies. Extensive experimental results show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Our project:

<p class="mathjax">Transparent objects are widely used in our daily lives, making it important
to teach robots to interact with them. However, it's not easy because the
reflective and refractive effects can make RGB-D cameras fail to give accurate
geometry measurements. To solve this problem, this paper introduces RFTrans, an
RGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation of
transparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate
representation, RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the
geometry (e.g. surface normal) from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real
gap. RFTrans integrates the RFNet, which predicts refractive flow, object mask,
and boundaries, followed by the F2Net, which estimates surface normal from the
refractive flow. To make manipulation possible, a global optimization module
will take in the predictions, refine the raw depth, and construct the point
cloud with normal. An analytical grasp planning algorithm, ISF, is followed to
generate the grasp poses. We build a synthetic dataset with physically
plausible ray-tracing rendering techniques to train the networks. Results show
that the RFTrans trained on the synthetic dataset can consistently outperform
the baseline ClearGrasp in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks by a large
margin. Finally, a real-world robot grasping task witnesses an 83% success
rate, proving that refractive flow can help enable direct sim-to-real transfer.

<p class="mathjax">Graph plays a significant role in representing and analyzing complex
relationships in real-world applications such as citation networks, social
networks, and biological data. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), which
have achieved tremendous success in various domains, have also been leveraged
in graph-related tasks to surpass traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
based methods and yield state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we first
present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing methods that integrate
LLMs with graphs. First of all, we propose a new taxonomy, which organizes
existing methods into three categories based on the role (i.e., enhancer,
predictor, and alignment component) played by LLMs in graph-related tasks. Then
we systematically survey the representative methods along the three categories
of the taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing
studies and highlight promising avenues for future research. The relevant
papers are summarized and will be consistently updated at:

<p class="mathjax">Integrating deep learning and causal discovery has increased the
interpretability of Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) tasks. However,
frame-level causal relationships exist many complicated noises outside the
segment-level, making it infeasible to directly express macro action semantics.
Thus, we propose \textit{\textbf{Causal Abstraction Segmentation Refiner
(CASR)}}, which can refine TAS results from various models by enhancing video
causality in marginalizing frame-level casual relationships. Specifically, we
define the equivalent frame-level casual model and segment-level causal model,
so that the causal adjacency matrix constructed from marginalized frame-level
causal relationships has the ability to represent the segmnet-level causal
relationships. CASR works out by reducing the difference in the causal
adjacency matrix between we constructed and pre-segmentation results of
backbone models. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric Causal Edit
Distance (CED) to evaluate the causal interpretability. Extensive experimental
results on mainstream datasets indicate that CASR significantly surpasses
existing various methods in action segmentation performance, as well as in
causal explainability and generalization. Our code will be available soon.

<p class="mathjax">Mental health professionals and clinicians have observed the upsurge of
mental disorders due to Interpersonal Risk Factors (IRFs). To simulate the
human-in-the-loop triaging scenario for early detection of mental health
disorders, we recognized textual indications to ascertain these IRFs : Thwarted
Belongingness (TBe) and Perceived Burdensomeness (PBu) within personal
narratives. In light of this, we use N-shot learning with GPT-3 model on the
IRF dataset, and underscored the importance of fine-tuning GPT-3 model to
incorporate the context-specific sensitivity and the interconnectedness of
textual cues that represent both IRFs.
<br />In this paper, we introduce an Interpretable Prompting (InterPrompt)} method
to boost the attention mechanism by fine-tuning the GPT-3 model. This allows a
more sophisticated level of language modification by adjusting the pre-trained
weights. Our model learns to detect usual patterns and underlying connections
across both the IRFs, which leads to better system-level explainability and
trustworthiness. The results of our research demonstrate that all four variants
of GPT-3 model, when fine-tuned with InterPrompt, perform considerably better
as compared to the baseline methods, both in terms of classification and
explanation generation.

<p class="mathjax">Articulated objects (e.g., doors and drawers) exist everywhere in our life.
Different from rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of
freedom and are rich in geometries, semantics, and part functions. Modeling
different kinds of parts and articulations with nerual networks plays an
essential role in articulated object understanding and manipulation, and will
further benefit 3D vision and robotics communities. To model articulated
objects, most previous works directly encode articulated objects into feature
representations, without specific designs for parts, articulations and part
motions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly
disentangles the part motion of articulated objects by predicting the
transformation matrix of points on the part surface, using spatially continuous
neural implicit representations to model the part motion smoothly in the space.
More importantly, while many methods could only model a certain kind of joint

is generic to different kinds of joint motions in that transformation matrix

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous exploration using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is essential for
various tasks such as building inspections, rescue operations, deliveries, and
warehousing. However, there are two main limitations to previous approaches:
they may not be able to provide a complete map of the environment and assume
that the map built during exploration is accurate enough for safe navigation,
which is usually not the case. To address these limitations, a novel
exploration method is proposed that combines frontier-based exploration with a
collector strategy that achieves global exploration and complete map creation.
In each iteration, the collector strategy stores and validates frontiers
detected during exploration and selects the next best frontier to navigate to.
The collector strategy ensures global exploration by balancing the exploitation
of a known map with the exploration of unknown areas. In addition, the online
path replanning ensures safe navigation through the map created during motion.
The performance of the proposed method is verified by exploring 3D simulation
environments in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the
proposed approach is validated in a real-world experiment.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially driven scientific progress in
various domains, and many papers have demonstrated their ability to tackle
complex problems with creative solutions. Our paper introduces a new foundation
model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks:
biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation,
molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain
and multi-task encoder-decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from
scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of
chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where
specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the
final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework,
enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. Furthermore, it can generate
high-quality outputs in molecular and textual formats, showcasing its
effectiveness in multi-domain setups.

<p class="mathjax">While transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a
variety of classification and generation tasks, their black-box nature makes
them challenging for interpretability. In this work, we present a novel visual
analytical framework to support the analysis of transformer-based generative
networks. In contrast to previous work, which has mainly focused on
encoder-based models, our framework is one of the first dedicated to supporting
the analysis of transformer-based encoder-decoder models and decoder-only

<p class="mathjax">Bouldering is a sport where athletes aim to climb up an obstacle using a set
of defined holds called a route. Typically routes are assigned a grade to
inform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their
progression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and
physical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a
difficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and
deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard
datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE
and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not
require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in
literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization
capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based
method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these
techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods
as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing
mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and
assess new routes with reduced bias.

<p class="mathjax">As software becomes increasingly complex and prone to vulnerabilities,
automated vulnerability detection is critically important, yet challenging.
Given the significant successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, there is growing anticipation of their efficacy in vulnerability
detection. However, a quantitative understanding of their potential in
vulnerability detection is still missing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive vulnerability benchmark VulBench. This benchmark aggregates
high-quality data from a wide range of CTF (Capture-the-Flag) challenges and
real-world applications, with annotations for each vulnerable function
detailing the vulnerability type and its root cause. Through our experiments
encompassing 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based models
and static analyzers, we find that several LLMs outperform traditional deep
learning approaches in vulnerability detection, revealing an untapped potential
in LLMs. This work contributes to the understanding and utilization of LLMs for
enhanced software security.

<p class="mathjax">Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image or 2D keypoints is inherently
challenging, given the fundamental ambiguity wherein multiple 3D poses can
correspond to the same 2D representation. The acquisition of 3D data, while
invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate
setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We
improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview
data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency,
to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss
enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D
pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss
substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data.
Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to
obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views.
Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities
with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration
procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in
3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to
customize models for specific applications. The used dataset, featuring
additional views, will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have demonstrated effectiveness in \emph{in-context solving}
data-fitting problems from various (latent) models, as reported by Garg et al.
However, the absence of an inherent iterative structure in the transformer
architecture presents a challenge in emulating the iterative algorithms, which
are commonly employed in traditional machine learning methods. To address this,
we propose the utilization of \emph{looped} transformer architecture and its
associated training methodology, with the aim of incorporating iterative
characteristics into the transformer architectures. Experimental results
suggest that the looped transformer achieves performance comparable to the
standard transformer in solving various data-fitting problems, while utilizing
less than 10\% of the parameter count.

three parts: artificial intelligence module, Unity development module and
Hololens2AR module. This project is based on R3Det algorithm to complete the
detection and recognition of ships in remote sensing images. The recognition
rate of model detection trained on RTX 2080Ti can reach 96%. Then, the 3D model
of the ship is obtained by ship categories and information and generated in the
virtual scene. At the same time, voice module and UI interaction module are
added. Finally, we completed the deployment of the project on Hololens2 through
MRTK. The system realizes the fusion of computer vision and augmented reality
technology, which maps the results of object detection to the AR field, and

<p class="mathjax">Are similar, or even identical, mechanisms used in the computational modeling
of speech segmentation, serial image processing and music processing? We
address this question by exploring how TRACX2, (French et al., 2011; French \&amp;
Cottrell, 2014; Mareschal \&amp; French, 2017), a recognition-based, recursive
connectionist autoencoder model of chunking and sequence segmentation, which
has successfully simulated speech and serial-image processing, might be applied
to elementary melody perception. The model, a three-layer autoencoder that
recognizes ''chunks'' of short sequences of intervals that have been frequently
encountered on input, is trained on the tone intervals of melodically simple
French children's songs. It dynamically incorporates the internal
representations of these chunks into new input. Its internal representations
cluster in a manner that is consistent with ''human-recognizable'' melodic
categories. TRACX2 is sensitive to both contour and proximity information in
the musical chunks that it encounters in its input. It shows the
''end-of-word'' superiority effect demonstrated by Saffran et al. (1999) for
short musical phrases. The overall findings suggest that the recursive
autoassociative chunking mechanism, as implemented in TRACX2, may be a general
segmentation and chunking mechanism, underlying not only word-and
imagechunking, but also elementary melody processing.

<p class="mathjax">The large untapped spectrum in the sub-THz allows for ultra-high throughput
communication to realize many seemingly impossible applications in 6G. One of
the challenges in radio communications in sub-THz is the hardware impairments.
Specifically, phase noise is one key hardware impairment, which is accentuated
as we increase the frequency and bandwidth. Furthermore, the modest output
power of the sub-THz power amplifier demands limits on peak to average power
ratio (PAPR) signal design. Single carrier frequency domain equalization
(SC-FDE) waveform has been identified as a suitable candidate for sub-THz,
although some challenges such as phase noise and PAPR still remain to be
tackled. In this work, we design a phase noise robust, low PAPR SC-FDE waveform
by geometrically shaping the constellation under practical conditions. We
formulate the waveform optimization problem in its augmented Lagrangian form
and use a back-propagation-inspired technique to obtain a constellation design
that is numerically robust to phase noise, while maintaining a low PAPR.

<p class="mathjax">In the recent years, the raise in the usage and efficiency of Artificial
Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has
brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated
with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying
bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these
systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on one
side encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more
appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such
biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers
of society, including policy makers, to call for ``fair'' algorithms. We
believe that while a lot of excellent and multidisciplinary research is
currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness
that having ``fair'' algorithms is per s\'e a nearly meaningless requirement,
that needs to be complemented with a lot of additional societal choices to
become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is
demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually
means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of
such a hiatus, and pinpoint a list of fundamental ambiguities and attention
points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to
the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems.

<p class="mathjax">Calibration of machine learning classifiers is necessary to obtain reliable
and interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between model confidence and
actual probabilities. One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims
at calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy on a
calibration set via monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning
procedure, which allows achieving a calibration error of zero, but leaves open
the issue of the effect on performance. In this paper, we first prove that IR
preserves the convex hull of the ROC curve -- an essential performance metric
for binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while
controlling for overfitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel
generalization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with K
classes. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on
the probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal
to zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that
preserves the K-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically
that this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between
reducing cross entropy loss and avoiding overfitting of the calibration set.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation is a challenging task in
medical image analysis, and it becomes more challenging when source and target
domain data are collected from multiple institutions. In this paper, we present
our solution to tackle the multi-institutional unsupervised domain adaptation
for the crossMoDA 2023 challenge. First, we perform unpaired image translation
to translate the source domain images to the target domain, where we design a
dynamic network to generate synthetic target domain images with controllable,
site-specific styles. Afterwards, we train a segmentation model using the
synthetic images and further reduce the domain gap by self-training. Our
solution achieved the 1st place during both the validation and testing phases
of the challenge.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a new simulation-based approach to address the stochastic
Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) problem, focusing on large congested networks
and dynamic settings. The proposed methodology incorporates a random walk model
inspired by the theoretical concept of the \textit{equivalent impedance}
method, specifically designed to overcome the limitations of traditional
Multinomial Logit (MNL) models in handling overlapping routes and scaling
issues. By iteratively contracting non-overlapping subnetworks into virtual
links and computing equivalent virtual travel costs, the route choice
decision-making process is shifted to intersections, enabling a more accurate
representation of travelers' choices as traffic conditions evolve and allowing
more accurate performance under fine-grained temporal segmentation.
<br />The approach leverages Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) structure to
efficiently find all routes between two nodes, thus obviating the need for
route enumeration, which is intractable in general networks. While with the
calculation approach of downstream node choice probabilities, all available
routes in the network can be selected with non-zero probability.
<br />To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are
conducted on two synthetic networks under congested demand scenarios using
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), an open-source microscopic traffic
simulation software. The results demonstrate the method's robustness, faster
convergence, and realistic trip distribution compared to traditional route
assignment methods, making it an ideal proposal for real-time or
resource-intensive applications such as microscopic demand calibration.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic communication is widely touted as a key technology for propelling
the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, providing effective
semantic representation is quite challenging in practice. To address this
issue, this article takes a crack at exploiting semantic knowledge base (KB) to
usher in a new era of generative semantic communication. Via semantic KB,
source messages can be characterized in low-dimensional subspaces without
compromising their desired meaning, thus significantly enhancing the
communication efficiency. The fundamental principle of semantic KB is first
introduced, and a generative semantic communication architecture is developed
by presenting three sub-KBs, namely source, task, and channel KBs. Then, the
detailed construction approaches for each sub-KB are described, followed by
their utilization in terms of semantic coding and transmission. A case study is
also provided to showcase the superiority of generative semantic communication
over conventional syntactic communication and classical semantic communication.
In a nutshell, this article establishes a scientific foundation for the
exciting uncharted frontier of generative semantic communication.

<p class="mathjax">We study the fundamental, classical mechanism design problem of single-buyer
multi-item Bayesian revenue-maximizing auctions under the lens of communication
complexity between the buyer and the seller. Specifically, we ask whether using
quantum communication can be more efficient than classical communication. We
have two sets of results, revealing a surprisingly rich landscape - which looks
quite different from both quantum communication in non-strategic parties, and
classical communication in mechanism design.
<br />We first study the expected communication complexity of approximately optimal
auctions. We give quantum auction protocols for buyers with unit-demand or
combinatorial valuations that obtain an arbitrarily good approximation of the
optimal revenue while running in exponentially more efficient communication
compared to classical approximately optimal auctions. However, these auctions
come with the caveat that they may require the seller to charge exponentially
large payments from a deviating buyer. We show that this caveat is necessary -
we give an exponential lower bound on the product of the expected quantum
communication and the maximum payment.
<br />We then study the worst-case communication complexity of exactly optimal
auctions in an extremely simple setting: additive buyer's valuations over two
items. We show the following separations:
<br />1. There exists a prior where the optimal classical auction protocol requires
infinitely many bits, but a one-way message of 1 qubit and 2 classical bits
suffices.
<br />2. There exists a prior where no finite one-way quantum auction protocol can
obtain the optimal revenue. However, there is a barely-interactive
revenue-optimal quantum auction protocol.
<br />3. There exists a prior where no multi-round quantum auction protocol with a
finite bound on communication complexity can obtain the optimal revenue.

<p class="mathjax">Neglecting the effect that decisions have on individuals (and thus, on the
underlying data distribution) when designing algorithmic decision-making
policies may increase inequalities and unfairness in the long term - even if
fairness considerations were taken in the policy design process. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for achieving long-term group fairness in
dynamical systems, in which current decisions may affect an individual's
features in the next step, and thus, future decisions. Specifically, our
framework allows us to identify a time-independent policy that converges, if
deployed, to the targeted fair stationary state of the system in the long term,
independently of the initial data distribution. We model the system dynamics
with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimize the policy leveraging the
Markov chain convergence theorem to ensure unique convergence. We provide
examples of different targeted fair states of the system, encompassing a range
of long-term goals for society and policymakers. Furthermore, we show how our
approach facilitates the evaluation of different long-term targets by examining
their impact on the group-conditional population distribution in the long term
and how it evolves until convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLM)-based speech synthesis has been widely adopted in
zero-shot speech synthesis. However, they require a large-scale data and
possess the same limitations as previous autoregressive speech models,
including slow inference speed and lack of robustness. This paper proposes
HierSpeech++, a fast and strong zero-shot speech synthesizer for text-to-speech
(TTS) and voice conversion (VC). We verified that hierarchical speech synthesis
frameworks could significantly improve the robustness and expressiveness of the
synthetic speech. Furthermore, we significantly improve the naturalness and
speaker similarity of synthetic speech even in zero-shot speech synthesis
scenarios. For text-to-speech, we adopt the text-to-vec framework, which
generates a self-supervised speech representation and an F0 representation
based on text representations and prosody prompts. Then, HierSpeech++ generates
speech from the generated vector, F0, and voice prompt. We further introduce a
high-efficient speech super-resolution framework from 16 kHz to 48 kHz. The
experimental results demonstrated that the hierarchical variational autoencoder
could be a strong zero-shot speech synthesizer given that it outperforms
LLM-based and diffusion-based models. Moreover, we achieved the first
human-level quality zero-shot speech synthesis. Audio samples and source code
are available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/HierSpeechpp.

<p class="mathjax">Speech is considered as a multi-modal process where hearing and vision are
two fundamentals pillars. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that the
robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition systems can be improved when audio
and visual cues are combined to represent the nature of speech. In addition,
Visual Speech Recognition, an open research problem whose purpose is to
interpret speech by reading the lips of the speaker, has been a focus of
interest in the last decades. Nevertheless, in order to estimate these systems
in the currently Deep Learning era, large-scale databases are required. On the
other hand, while most of these databases are dedicated to English, other
languages lack sufficient resources. Thus, this paper presents a
semi-automatically annotated audiovisual database to deal with unconstrained
natural Spanish, providing 13 hours of data extracted from Spanish television.
Furthermore, baseline results for both speaker-dependent and
speaker-independent scenarios are reported using Hidden Markov Models, a
traditional paradigm that has been widely used in the field of Speech
Technologies.

<p class="mathjax">One of the significant barriers to the training of statistical models on
knowledge graphs is the difficulty that scientists have in finding the best
input data to address their prediction goal. In addition to this, a key
challenge is to determine how to manipulate these relational data, which are
often in the form of particular triples (i.e., subject, predicate, object), to
enable the learning process. Currently, many high-quality catalogs of knowledge
graphs, are available. However, their primary goal is the re-usability of these
resources, and their interconnection, in the context of the Semantic Web. This
paper describes the LiveSchema initiative, namely, a first version of a gateway
that has the main scope of leveraging the gold mine of data collected by many
existing catalogs collecting relational data like ontologies and knowledge
graphs. At the current state, LiveSchema contains - 1000 datasets from 4 main
sources and offers some key facilities, which allow to: i) evolving LiveSchema,
by aggregating other source catalogs and repositories as input sources; ii)
querying all the collected resources; iii) transforming each given dataset into
formal concept analysis matrices that enable analysis and visualization
services; iv) generating models and tensors from each given dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present a boundary and hole detection approach that
traverses all the boundaries of an edge-manifold triangular mesh,
irrespectively of the presence of singular vertices, and subsequently
determines and labels all holes of the mesh. The proposed automated
hole-detection method is valuable to the computer-aided design (CAD) community
as all half-edges within the mesh are utilized and for each half-edge the
algorithm guarantees both the existence and the uniqueness of the boundary
associated to it. As existing hole-detection approaches assume that singular
vertices are absent or may require mesh modification, these methods are
ill-equipped to detect boundaries/holes in real-world meshes that contain
singular vertices. We demonstrate the method in an underwater autonomous
robotic application, exploiting surface reconstruction methods based on point
cloud data. In such a scenario the determined holes can be interpreted as
information gaps, enabling timely corrective action during the data
acquisition. However, the scope of our method is not confined to these two
sectors alone; it is versatile enough to be applied on any edge-manifold
triangle mesh. An evaluation of the method is performed on both synthetic and
real-world data (including a triangle mesh from a point cloud obtained by a
multibeam sonar). The source code of our reference implementation is available:

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of unsupervised video domain
adaptation (UVDA) for action recognition. We specifically focus on scenarios
with a substantial domain gap, in contrast to existing works primarily deal
with small domain gaps between labeled source domains and unlabeled target
domains. To establish a more realistic setting, we introduce a novel UVDA
scenario, denoted as Kinetics-&gt;BABEL, with a more considerable domain gap in
terms of both temporal dynamics and background shifts. To tackle the temporal
shift, i.e., action duration difference between the source and target domains,
we propose a global-local view alignment approach. To mitigate the background
shift, we propose to learn temporal order sensitive representations by temporal
order learning and background invariant representations by background
augmentation. We empirically validate that the proposed method shows
significant improvement over the existing methods on the Kinetics-&gt;BABEL
dataset with a large domain gap. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">During a conversation, our brain is responsible for combining information
obtained from multiple senses in order to improve our ability to understand the
message we are perceiving. Different studies have shown the importance of
presenting visual information in these situations. Nevertheless, lipreading is
a complex task whose objective is to interpret speech when audio is not
available. By dispensing with a sense as crucial as hearing, it will be
necessary to be aware of the challenge that this lack presents. In this paper,
we propose an analysis of different speech visual features with the intention
of identifying which of them is the best approach to capture the nature of lip
movements for natural Spanish and, in this way, dealing with the automatic
visual speech recognition task. In order to estimate our system, we present an
audiovisual corpus compiled from a subset of the RTVE database, which has been
used in the Albayz\'in evaluations. We employ a traditional system based on
Hidden Markov Models with Gaussian Mixture Models. Results show that, although
the task is difficult, in restricted conditions we obtain recognition results
which determine that using eigenlips in combination with deep features is the
best visual approach.

<p class="mathjax">Given a function $f$ from the set $[N]$ to a $d$-dimensional integer grid, we
consider data structures that allow efficient orthogonal range searching
queries in the image of $f$, without explicitly storing it.
<br />We show that, if $f$ is of the form $[N]\to [2^{w}]^d$ for some
$w=\mathrm{polylog} (N)$ and is computable in constant time, then, for any
$0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$, we can obtain a data structure using $\tilde {O}(N^{1-\alpha /
3})$ words of space such that, for a given $d$-dimensional axis-aligned box
$B$, we can search for some $x\in [N]$ such that $f(x) \in B$ in time
$\tilde{O}(N^{\alpha})$.
<br />This result is obtained simply by combining integer range searching with the
Fiat-Naor function inversion scheme, which was already used in data-structure
problems previously.
<br />We further obtain
<br />- data structures for range counting and reporting, predecessor, selection,
ranking queries, and combinations thereof, on the set $f([N])$,
<br />- data structures for preimage size and preimage selection queries for a
given value of $f$, and
<br />- data structures for selection and ranking queries on geometric quantities
computed from tuples of points in $d$-space.
<br />These results unify and generalize previously known results on 3SUM-indexing
and string searching, and are widely applicable as a black box to a variety of
problems.
<br />In particular, we give a data structure for a generalized version of gapped
string indexing, and show how to preprocess a set of points on an integer grid
in order to efficiently compute (in sublinear time), for points contained in a
given axis-aligned box, their Theil-Sen estimator, the $k$th largest area
triangle, or the induced hyperplane that is the $k$th furthest from the origin.

<p class="mathjax">As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic
forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and
promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data
frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as
time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to
handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed
differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by
constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and
external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic
data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for
past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named
Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates
invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the
effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal
sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data
into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST
contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually
different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as
self-supervised signals to inject context information into both
representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the
learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting.
Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across
various ST OOD scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective and
promising solution to extend the wireless signal coverage and improve the
performance via passive signal reflection. Different from existing works which
do not account for the cooperation between RISs or do not provide full space
coverage, we propose the marriage of cooperative double-RIS with simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) technologies denoted as RIS/STAR-RIS
under correlated Rayleigh fading conditions to assist the communication in a
massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup. The proposed architecture
is superior since it enjoys the benefits of the individual designs. We
introduce a channel estimation approach of the cascaded channels with reduced
overhead. Also, we obtain the deterministic equivalent (DE) of the downlink
achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form based on large-scale
statistics. Notably, relied on statistical channel state information (CSI), we
optimise both surfaces by means of the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM),
and obtain the gradients in closed form. The proposed optimization achieves to
maximise the sum SE of such a complex system, and has low complexity and low
overhead since it can be performed at every several coherence intervals.
Numerical results show the benefit of the proposed architecture and verify the
analytical framework. In particular, we show that the RIS/STAR-RIS architecture
outperforms the conventional double-RIS or its single-RIS counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) play an essential role in summarising,
synthesising and validating scientific evidence. In recent years, there has
been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques to automate the
identification of relevant studies for SLRs. However, the lack of standardised
evaluation datasets makes comparing the performance of such automated
literature screening systems difficult. In this paper, we analyse the citation
screening evaluation datasets, revealing that many of the available datasets
are either too small, suffer from data leakage or have limited applicability to
systems treating automated literature screening as a classification task, as
opposed to, for example, a retrieval or question-answering task. To address
these challenges, we introduce CSMeD, a meta-dataset consolidating nine
publicly released collections, providing unified access to 325 SLRs from the
fields of medicine and computer science. CSMeD serves as a comprehensive
resource for training and evaluating the performance of automated citation
screening models. Additionally, we introduce CSMeD-FT, a new dataset designed
explicitly for evaluating the full text publication screening task. To
demonstrate the utility of CSMeD, we conduct experiments and establish
baselines on new datasets.

<p class="mathjax">While WangchanBERTa has become the de facto standard in transformer-based
Thai language modeling, it still has shortcomings in regard to the
understanding of foreign words, most notably English words, which are often
borrowed without orthographic assimilation into Thai in many contexts. We
identify the lack of foreign vocabulary in WangchanBERTa's tokenizer as the
main source of these shortcomings. We then expand WangchanBERTa's vocabulary
via vocabulary transfer from XLM-R's pretrained tokenizer and pretrain a new
model using the expanded tokenizer, starting from WangchanBERTa's checkpoint,

estimating accurate motion fields, even in very challenging cases with small
objects, large displacements and drastic appearance changes. In addition to
lower-level features, that are used in other Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based
motion estimation methods, MaskFlow draws from object-level features and
segmentations. These features and segmentations are used to approximate the
objects' translation motion field. We propose a novel and effective way of
incorporating the incomplete translation motion field into a subsequent motion
estimation network for refinement and completion. We also produced a new
challenging synthetic dataset with motion field ground truth, and also provide
extra ground truth for the object-instance matchings and corresponding

<p class="mathjax">Computational design can excite the full potential of soft robotics that has
the drawbacks of being highly nonlinear from material, structure, and contact.
Up to date, enthusiastic research interests have been demonstrated for
individual soft fingers, but the frame design space (how each soft finger is
assembled) remains largely unexplored. Computationally design remains
challenging for the finger-based soft gripper to grip across multiple
geometrical-distinct object types successfully. Including the design space for
the gripper frame can bring huge difficulties for conventional optimisation
algorithms and fitness calculation methods due to the exponential growth of
high-dimensional design space. This work proposes an automated computational
design optimisation framework that generates gripper diversity to individually
grasp geometrically distinct object types based on a quality-diversity
approach. This work first discusses a significantly large design space (28
design parameters) for a finger-based soft gripper, including the
rarely-explored design space of finger arrangement that is converted to various
configurations to arrange individual soft fingers. Then, a contact-based Finite
Element Modelling (FEM) is proposed in SOFA to output high-fidelity grasping
data for fitness evaluation and feature measurements. Finally, diverse gripper
designs are obtained from the framework while considering features such as the
volume and workspace of grippers. This work bridges the gap of computationally
exploring the vast design space of finger-based soft grippers while grasping
large geometrically distinct object types with a simple control scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Different studies have shown the importance of visual cues throughout the
speech perception process. In fact, the development of audiovisual approaches
has led to advances in the field of speech technologies. However, although
noticeable results have recently been achieved, visual speech recognition
remains an open research problem. It is a task in which, by dispensing with the
auditory sense, challenges such as visual ambiguities and the complexity of
modeling silence must be faced. Nonetheless, some of these challenges can be
alleviated when the problem is approached from a speaker-dependent perspective.
Thus, this paper studies, using the Spanish LIP-RTVE database, how the
estimation of specialized end-to-end systems for a specific person could affect
the quality of speech recognition. First, different adaptation strategies based
on the fine-tuning technique were proposed. Then, a pre-trained CTC/Attention
architecture was used as a baseline throughout our experiments. Our findings
showed that a two-step fine-tuning process, where the VSR system is first
adapted to the task domain, provided significant improvements when the speaker
adaptation was addressed. Furthermore, results comparable to the current state
of the art were reached even when only a limited amount of data was available.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is
challenging, because the fidelity of an explanation to the AI model does not
necessarily go hand in hand with its interpretability for humans. For instance,
when classifying images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), XAI
algorithms can explain which image areas had an impact on the CNN decision.
However, it is unclear whether the areas that best reflect the CNN internal
data processing will also make most sense to humans. Thus, the present study
investigated whether the image classification of humans and CNN is supported by
the same explanations. To assess such differences in interpretability, human
participants and a CNN classified image segments that were considered most
informative either by other humans (as revealed by eye movements and manual
selection) or by two XAI methods (Grad-CAM and XRAI). In three experiments,
humans classified and rated these segments, and we also had a CNN classify
them. The results indicated that the respective interpretability of the two XAI
methods strongly depended on image type, both for humans and CNN. Moreover,
human classification performance was highest with human segments, regardless of
how they were generated (i.e., from eye movements or manual selection), whereas
the type of human segment had major impacts on CNN classification performance.
Our results caution against general statements about the interpretability of
explanations, as this interpretability varies with the explanation method, the
explanations to be interpreted, and the agent who needs to perform the
interpretation.

<p class="mathjax">Complex software systems, e.g., Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), interact with
the real world; thus, they often behave unexpectedly in uncertain environments.
Testing such systems is challenging due to limited resources, time, complex
testing infrastructure setup, and the inherent uncertainties in their operating
environment. Devising uncertainty-aware testing solutions supported with test
optimization techniques can be considered as a mandate for tackling this
challenge. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware and time-aware test case
prioritization approach, named UncerPrio, for optimizing a sequence of tests to
execute with a multi-objective search. To guide the prioritization with
uncertainty, we identify four uncertainty measures: uncertainty measurement
(AUM), uncertainty space (PUS), the number of uncertainties (ANU), and
uncertainty coverage (PUU). Based on these measures and their combinations, we
proposed 10 uncertainty-aware and multi-objective test case prioritization
problems, and each problem was additionally defined with one cost objective
(execution cost, PET) to be minimized and one effective measure (model
coverage, PTR) to be maximized. Moreover, considering time constraints for test
executions (i.e., time-aware), we defined 10 time budgets for all the 10
problems for identifying the best strategy in solving uncertainty-aware test
prioritization. In our empirical study, we employed four well-known
Multi-Objective Search Algorithms (MuOSAs): NSGA-II, MOCell, SPEA2, and CellDE
with five use cases from two industrial CPS subject systems, and used Random
Algorithm (RS) as the comparison baseline. Results show that all the MuOSAs
significantly outperformed RS. The strategy of Prob.6 f(PET,PTR,AUM,ANU) (i.e.,
the problem with uncertainty measures AUM and ANU combined) achieved the
overall best performance in observing uncertainty when using 100% time budget.

<p class="mathjax">APIs are increasingly becoming new business assets for organizations and
consequently, API functionality and its pricing should be precisely defined for
customers. Pricing is typically composed by different plans that specify a
range of limitations, e.g., a Free plan allows 100 monthly requests while a
Gold plan has 10000 requests per month. In this context, the OpenAPI
Specification (OAS) has emerged to model the functional part of an API,
becoming a de facto industry standard and boosting a rich ecosystem of
vendor-neutral tools to assist API providers and consumers. In contrast, there
is no proposal for modeling API pricings (i.e. their plans and limitations) and
this lack hinders the creation of tools that can leverage this information. To
deal with this gap, this paper presents a pricing modeling framework that
includes: (a) Pricing4APIs model, a comprehensive and rigorous model of API
pricings, along SLA4OAI, a serialization that extends OAS; (b) an operation to
validate the description of API pricings, with a toolset (sla4oai-analyzer)
that has been developed to automate this operation. Additionally, we analyzed
268 real-world APIs to assess the expressiveness of our proposal and created a
representative dataset of 54 pricing models to validate our framework.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and automated segmentation of intervertebral discs (IVDs) in medical
images is crucial for assessing spine-related disorders, such as osteoporosis,
vertebral fractures, or IVD herniation. We present HCA-Net, a novel contextual
attention network architecture for semantic labeling of IVDs, with a special
focus on exploiting prior geometric information. Our approach excels at
processing features across different scales and effectively consolidating them
to capture the intricate spatial relationships within the spinal cord. To
achieve this, HCA-Net models IVD labeling as a pose estimation problem, aiming
to minimize the discrepancy between each predicted IVD location and its
corresponding actual joint location. In addition, we introduce a skeletal loss
term to reinforce the model's geometric dependence on the spine. This loss
function is designed to constrain the model's predictions to a range that
matches the general structure of the human vertebral skeleton. As a result, the
network learns to reduce the occurrence of false predictions and adaptively
improves the accuracy of IVD location estimation. Through extensive
experimental evaluation on multi-center spine datasets, our approach
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both MRI T1w and
T2w modalities. The codebase is accessible to the public on
\href{https://github.com/xmindflow/HCA-Net}{GitHub}.

<p class="mathjax">Very low-resource languages, having only a few million tokens worth of data,
are not well-supported by multilingual NLP approaches due to poor quality
cross-lingual word representations. Recent work showed that good cross-lingual
performance can be achieved if a source language is related to the low-resource
target language. However, not all language pairs are related. In this paper, we
propose to build multilingual word embeddings (MWEs) via a novel language
chain-based approach, that incorporates intermediate related languages to
bridge the gap between the distant source and target. We build MWEs one
language at a time by starting from the resource rich source and sequentially
adding each language in the chain till we reach the target. We extend a
semi-joint bilingual approach to multiple languages in order to eliminate the
main weakness of previous works, i.e., independently trained monolingual
embeddings, by anchoring the target language around the multilingual space. We
evaluate our method on bilingual lexicon induction for 4 language families,
involving 4 very low-resource (&lt;5M tokens) and 4 moderately low-resource (&lt;50M)
target languages, showing improved performance in both categories.
Additionally, our analysis reveals the importance of good quality embeddings
for intermediate languages as well as the importance of leveraging anchor
points from all languages in the multilingual space.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have enabled high-fidelity
scene reconstruction for novel view synthesis. However, NeRF requires hundreds
of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral,
making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can
effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To
address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a
multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and
fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The
key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding
strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits
memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the
fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine
resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone
tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates
encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster
rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint
in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

peer-to-peer network, and its associated blockchain, which records all
transactions since its inception. While this ensures integrity and
transparency, the transparent nature of Bitcoin potentially compromises users'
privacy rights. To address this concern, users have adopted CoinJoin, a method
that amalgamates multiple transaction intents into a single, larger transaction
to bolster transactional privacy. This process complicates individual
transaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis
heuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on
identifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin
implementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting
distinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study
delves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming
to develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the
blockchain. Our exhaustive analysis covers transactions up to block 760,000,
offering a comprehensive insight into CoinJoin transactions and their

<p class="mathjax">Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends traditional RL by
seeking policies making different compromises among conflicting objectives. The
recent surge of interest in MORL has led to diverse studies and solving
methods, often drawing from existing knowledge in multi-objective optimization
based on decomposition (MOO/D). Yet, a clear categorization based on both RL
and MOO/D is lacking in the existing literature. Consequently, MORL researchers
face difficulties when trying to classify contributions within a broader
context due to the absence of a standardized taxonomy. To tackle such an issue,
this paper introduces Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on
Decomposition (MORL/D), a novel methodology bridging RL and MOO literature. A
comprehensive taxonomy for MORL/D is presented, providing a structured
foundation for categorizing existing and potential MORL works. The introduced
taxonomy is then used to scrutinize MORL research, enhancing clarity and
conciseness through well-defined categorization. Moreover, a flexible framework
derived from the taxonomy is introduced. This framework accommodates diverse
instantiations using tools from both RL and MOO/D. Implementation across
various configurations demonstrates its versatility, assessed against benchmark
problems. Results indicate MORL/D instantiations achieve comparable performance
with significantly greater versatility than current state-of-the-art
approaches. By presenting the taxonomy and framework, this paper offers a
comprehensive perspective and a unified vocabulary for MORL. This not only
facilitates the identification of algorithmic contributions but also lays the
groundwork for novel research avenues in MORL, contributing to the continued
advancement of this field.

<p class="mathjax">Research in fair machine learning, and particularly clustering, has been
crucial in recent years given the many ethical controversies that modern
intelligent systems have posed. Ahmadian et al. [2020] established the study of
fairness in \textit{hierarchical} clustering, a stronger, more structured
variant of its well-known flat counterpart, though their proposed algorithm
that optimizes for Dasgupta's [2016] famous cost function was highly
theoretical. Knittel et al. [2023] then proposed the first practical fair
approximation for cost, however they were unable to break the
polynomial-approximate barrier they posed as a hurdle of interest. We break
this barrier, proposing the first truly polylogarithmic-approximate low-cost
fair hierarchical clustering, thus greatly bridging the gap between the best
fair and vanilla hierarchical clustering approximations.

"nice-to-have" to a "must-have" capability for successful system developing
organisations. The current state of the art, however, does not provide clear
answers on how to map this need in terms of processes, methods, tools and
competencies (PMTC) and how to successfully manage the transition within
established industries. In this paper, we propose an agile Systems Engineering
(SE) Framework for the automotive industry to meet the new agility demand. In
addition to the methodological background, we present results of a pilot
project in the chassis development department of a German automotive
manufacturer and demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed framework.
By adopting the described agile SE Framework, companies can foster innovation
and collaboration based on a learning, continuous improvement and
self-reinforcing base.

<p class="mathjax">Processing convolution layers remains a huge bottleneck for private deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference for large datasets. To solve this
issue, this paper presents a novel homomorphic convolution algorithm that
provides speedup, communication cost, and storage saving. We first note that
padded convolution provides the advantage of model storage saving, but it does
not support channel packing, thereby increasing the amount of computation and
communication. We address this limitation by proposing a novel plaintext
multiplication algorithm using the Walsh-Hadamard matrix. Furthermore, we
propose the optimization techniques to significantly reduce the latency of the
proposed convolution by selecting the optimal encryption parameters and
applying lazy reduction. It achieves 1.6-3.8x speedup and reduces the weight
storage by 2000-8000x compared to the conventional convolution. When the
proposed convolution is employed for CNNs like VGG-16, ResNet-20, and
MobileNetV1 on ImageNet, it reduces the end-to-end latency by 1.3-2.6x, the
memory usage by 2.1-7.9x and communication cost by 1.7-2.0x compared to
conventional method.

<p class="mathjax">This study concentrates on evaluating the efficacy of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in healthcare, with a specific focus on their application in personal
anomalous health monitoring. Our research primarily investigates the
capabilities of LLMs in interpreting and analyzing physiological data obtained
from FDA-approved devices. We conducted an extensive analysis using anomalous
physiological data gathered in a simulated low-air-pressure plateau
environment. This allowed us to assess the precision and reliability of LLMs in
understanding and evaluating users' health status with notable specificity. Our
findings reveal that LLMs exhibit exceptional performance in determining
medical indicators, including a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1 beat
per minute for heart rate and less than 1% for oxygen saturation (SpO2).
Furthermore, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for these evaluations
remained below 1%, with the overall accuracy of health assessments surpassing
85%. In image analysis tasks, such as interpreting photoplethysmography (PPG)
data, our specially adapted GPT models demonstrated remarkable proficiency,
achieving less than 1 bpm error in cycle count and 7.28 MAE for heart rate
estimation. This study highlights LLMs' dual role as health data analysis tools
and pivotal elements in advanced AI health assistants, offering personalized

<p class="mathjax">In China, air conditioning in summer and electric heating in winter lead to
seasonal volatility in load power. Therefore, it is urgent to develop economic
and efficient long-term energy storage systems to enhance peak regulation.
Power-to-hydrogen technology is a perspective solution to balance seasonal
power fluctuation. However, current hydrogen storage methods have shortcomings
such as small storage capacity, high levelized cost and low operation safety,
which the salt cavern hydrogen storage could overcome. This paper considers the
use of hydrogen storage in salt caverns as a means of peak shaving. To minimize
the overall operating cost, a comprehensive power system capacity planning
model is proposed with the consideration of hydrogen storage in salt caverns,
which is implemented by adopting an improved fast unit commitment method.
Considering the seasonal characteristics of the load power in Jiangsu Province,
the capacity of the power system in 2050 has been planned. According to the
case study, after the optimal deployment of the salt cavern hydrogen storage
system (SCHSS), the construction capacity of renewable units (especially wind
power) will be significantly increased with environmental friendliness and
lower costs. Compared with the current energy storage method, the overall cost
of SCHSS-incorporated power system will be reduced by 22.2% with a carbon
emission reduction of 24.4%, and the amount of curtailed wind and solar power
will be reduced by 27.0% and 13.6%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid increase in the parameters of deep learning models has led to
significant costs, challenging computational efficiency and model
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel and straightforward
neural network pruning framework that incorporates the Gumbel-Softmax
technique. This framework enables the simultaneous optimization of a network's
weights and topology in an end-to-end process using stochastic gradient
descent. Empirical results demonstrate its exceptional compression capability,
maintaining high accuracy on the MNIST dataset with only 0.15\% of the original
network parameters. Moreover, our framework enhances neural network
interpretability, not only by allowing easy extraction of feature importance
directly from the pruned network but also by enabling visualization of feature
symmetry and the pathways of information propagation from features to outcomes.
Although the pruning strategy is learned through deep learning, it is
surprisingly intuitive and understandable, focusing on selecting key
representative features and exploiting data patterns to achieve extreme sparse
pruning. We believe our method opens a promising new avenue for deep learning
pruning and the creation of interpretable machine learning systems.

<p class="mathjax">Metagenomics has led to significant advancements in many fields. Metagenomic
analysis commonly involves the key tasks of determining the species present in
a sample and their relative abundances. These tasks require searching large
metagenomic databases containing information on different species' genomes.
Metagenomic analysis suffers from significant data movement overhead due to
moving large amounts of low-reuse data from the storage system to the rest of
the system. In-storage processing can be a fundamental solution for reducing
data movement overhead. However, designing an in-storage processing system for
metagenomics is challenging because none of the existing approaches can be
directly implemented in storage effectively due to the hardware limitations of
modern SSDs. We propose MetaStore, the first in-storage processing system
designed to significantly reduce the data movement overhead of end-to-end
metagenomic analysis. MetaStore is enabled by our lightweight and cooperative
design that effectively leverages and orchestrates processing inside and
outside the storage system. Through our detailed analysis of the end-to-end
metagenomic analysis pipeline and careful hardware/software co-design, we
address in-storage processing challenges for metagenomics via specialized and
efficient 1) task partitioning, 2) data/computation flow coordination, 3)
storage technology-aware algorithmic optimizations, 4) light-weight in-storage
accelerators, and 5) data mapping. Our evaluation shows that MetaStore
outperforms the state-of-the-art performance- and accuracy-optimized software
metagenomic tools by 2.7-37.2$\times$ and 6.9-100.2$\times$, respectively,
while matching the accuracy of the accuracy-optimized tool. MetaStore achieves
1.5-5.1$\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art metagenomic
hardware-accelerated tool, while achieving significantly higher accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Solving inverse problems requires knowledge of the forward operator, but
accurate models can be computationally expensive and hence cheaper variants are
desired that do not compromise reconstruction quality. This chapter reviews
reconstruction methods in inverse problems with learned forward operators that
follow two different paradigms. The first one is completely agnostic to the
forward operator and learns its restriction to the subspace spanned by the
training data. The framework of regularisation by projection is then used to
find a reconstruction. The second one uses a simplified model of the physics of
the measurement process and only relies on the training data to learn a model
correction. We present the theory of these two approaches and compare them
numerically. A common theme emerges: both methods require, or at least benefit
from, training data not only for the forward operator, but also for its
adjoint.

<p class="mathjax">Safe and smooth motion control is essential for mobile robots when performing
various automation tasks around obstacles, especially in the presence of people
and other mobile robots. The total turning and space used by a mobile robot
while moving towards a specified goal position play a crucial role in
determining the required control effort and complexity. In this paper, we
consider a standard unicycle control approach based on angular feedback
linearization and provide an explicit analytical measure for determining the
total turning effort during unicycle control in terms of unicycle state and
control gains. We show that undesired spiral oscillatory motion around the goal
position can be avoided by choosing a higher angular control gain compared to
the linear control gain. Accordingly, we establish an accurate, explicit
triangular motion range bound on the closed-loop unicycle trajectory using the
total turning effort. The improved accuracy in motion range prediction results
from a stronger dependency on the unicycle state and control parameters. To
compare alternative circular, conic, and triangular motion range prediction
approaches, we present an application of the proposed unicycle motion control
and motion prediction methods for safe unicycle path following around obstacles
in numerical simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Many Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks aim to generate a single output
text given an input prompt. Other settings require the generation of multiple
texts, e.g., for Synthetic Traffic Generation (STG). This generation task is
crucial for training and evaluating QA systems as well as conversational
agents, where the goal is to generate multiple questions or utterances
resembling the linguistic variability of real users. In this paper, we show
that common NLG metrics, like BLEU, are not suitable for evaluating STG. We
propose and evaluate several metrics designed to compare the generated traffic
to the distribution of real user texts. We validate our metrics with an
automatic procedure to verify whether they capture different types of quality
issues of generated data; we also run human annotations to verify the
correlation with human judgements. Experiments on three tasks, i.e., Shopping
Utterance Generation, Product Question Generation and Query Auto Completion,
demonstrate that our metrics are effective for evaluating STG tasks, and
improve the agreement with human judgement up to 20% with respect to common NLG
metrics. We believe these findings can pave the way towards better solutions
for estimating the representativeness of synthetic text data.

However, existing systems either fail to customize a corpus curation pipeline
or neglect to leverage comprehensive corpus assessment for iterative
optimization of the curation. To this end, we present a pretraining corpus
curation and assessment platform called Oasis -- a one-stop system for data
quality improvement and quantification with user-friendly interactive
interfaces. Specifically, the interactive modular rule filter module can devise
customized rules according to explicit feedback. The debiased neural filter
module builds the quality classification dataset in a negative-centric manner
to remove the undesired bias. The adaptive document deduplication module could
execute large-scale deduplication with limited memory resources. These three
parts constitute the customized data curation module. And in the holistic data
assessment module, a corpus can be assessed in local and global views, with
three evaluation means including human, GPT-4, and heuristic metrics. We
exhibit a complete process to use Oasis for the curation and assessment of
pretraining data. In addition, an 800GB bilingual corpus curated by Oasis is

Few studies have explored the interplay between ICL and specific properties of
functions it attempts to approximate. In our study, we use a formal framework
to explore ICL and propose a new task of approximating functions with varying
number of minima. We implement a method that allows for producing functions
with given inputs as minima. We find that increasing the number of minima
degrades ICL performance. At the same time, our evaluation shows that ICL
outperforms 2-layer Neural Network (2NN) model. Furthermore, ICL learns faster
than 2NN in all settings. We validate the findings through a set of few-shot
experiments across various hyperparameter configurations.

<p class="mathjax">Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as an important research
field in recent years. The prevailing strategies for FL model users (MUs)
assume that the entire team of the required data owners (DOs) for an FL task
must be assembled before training can commence. In practice, an MU can trigger
the FL training process multiple times. DOs can thus be gradually recruited
over multiple FL model training sessions. Existing bidding strategies for AFL
MUs are not designed to handle such scenarios. Therefore, the problem of
multi-session AFL remains open. To address this problem, we propose the
Multi-session Budget Optimization Strategy for forward Auction-based Federated
Learning (MultiBOS-AFL). Based on hierarchical reinforcement learning,
MultiBOS-AFL jointly optimizes inter-session budget pacing and intra-session
bidding for AFL MUs, with the objective of maximizing the total utility.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that it significantly
outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches. On average, MultiBOS-AFL
achieves 12.28% higher utility, 14.52% more data acquired through auctions for
a given budget, and 1.23% higher test accuracy achieved by the resulting FL
model compared to the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first budget optimization decision support method with budget pacing capability
designed for MUs in multi-session forward auction-based federated learning

<p class="mathjax">We present a novel time series anomaly detection method that achieves
excellent detection accuracy while offering a superior level of explainability.
Our proposed method, TimeVQVAE-AD, leverages masked generative modeling adapted
from the cutting-edge time series generation method known as TimeVQVAE. The
prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time-frequency domain.
Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved
in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different
frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies.
Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling
likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of
the detected anomalies through counterfactuals. Our experimental evaluation on
the UCR Time Series Anomaly archive demonstrates that TimeVQVAE-AD
significantly surpasses the existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and
explainability.

<p class="mathjax">Quantized tensor trains (QTTs) have recently emerged as a framework for the
numerical discretization of continuous functions, with the potential for
widespread applications in numerical analysis. However, the theory of QTT
approximation is not fully understood. In this work, we advance this theory
from the point of view of multiscale polynomial interpolation. This perspective
clarifies why QTT ranks decay with increasing depth, quantitatively controls
QTT rank in terms of smoothness of the target function, and explains why
certain functions with sharp features and poor quantitative smoothness can
still be well approximated by QTTs. The perspective also motivates new
practical and efficient algorithms for the construction of QTTs from function
evaluations on multiresolution grids.

<p class="mathjax">Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for
neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate
comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any
type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as
PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease
diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these
steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce
deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position
invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects
regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question
arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when
analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still
needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models
based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and
intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently
complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can
effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of
94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the
differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding
patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying
any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity
normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results
and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the problem of extracting planar regions in uneven
terrains from unordered point cloud measurements. Such a problem is critical in
various robotic applications such as robotic perceptive locomotion. While
existing approaches have shown promising results in effectively extracting
planar regions from the environment, they often suffer from issues such as low
computational efficiency or loss of resolution. To address these issues, we
propose a multi-resolution planar region extraction strategy in this paper that
balances the accuracy in boundaries and computational efficiency. Our method
begins with a pointwise classification preprocessing module, which categorizes
all sampled points according to their local geometric properties to facilitate
multi-resolution segmentation. Subsequently, we arrange the categorized points
using an octree, followed by an in-depth analysis of nodes to finish
multi-resolution plane segmentation. The efficiency and robustness of the
proposed approach are verified via synthetic and real-world experiments,
demonstrating our method's ability to generalize effectively across various
uneven terrains while maintaining real-time performance, achieving frame rates
exceeding 35 FPS.

<p class="mathjax">We study time harmonic acoustic scattering on large deviation rough random
scatterers. Therein, the roughness of the scatterers is caused by a low Sobolev
regularity in the covariance function of their deformation field. The
motivation for this study arises from physical phenomena where small-scale
material defects can potentially introduce non-smooth deviations from a
reference domain. The primary challenge in this scenario is that the scattered
wave is also random, which makes computational predictions unreliable.
Therefore, it is essential to quantify these uncertainties to ensure robust and
well-informed design processes. While existing methods for uncertainty
quantification typically rely on domain mapping or perturbation approaches, it
turns out that large and rough random deviations are not satisfactory covered.
To close this gap, and although counter intuitive at first, we show that the
$p$-multilevel Monte Carlo method can provide an efficient tool for uncertainty
quantification in this setting. To this end, we discuss the stable
implementation of higher-order polynomial approximation of the deformation
field by means of barycentric interpolation and provide a cost-to-accuracy
analysis. Our considerations are complemented by numerical experiments in three
dimensions on a complex scattering geometry.

<p class="mathjax">We present elliptical processes, a family of non-parametric probabilistic
models that subsume Gaussian processes and Student's t processes. This
generalization includes a range of new heavy-tailed behaviors while retaining
computational tractability. Elliptical processes are based on a representation
of elliptical distributions as a continuous mixture of Gaussian distributions.
We parameterize this mixture distribution as a spline normalizing flow, which
we train using variational inference. The proposed form of the variational
posterior enables a sparse variational elliptical process applicable to
large-scale problems. We highlight advantages compared to Gaussian processes
through regression and classification experiments. Elliptical processes can
supersede Gaussian processes in several settings, including cases where the
likelihood is non-Gaussian or when accurate tail modeling is essential.

non-normal matrix-sequences, which can be viewed as a low rank perturbation
depending on a parameter $\beta&gt;1$ of the basic Toeplitz matrix-sequence
$\{T_n(e^{\mathbf{i}\theta})\}_{n\in\N}$, $\mathbf{i}^2=-1$. The latter has
obviously all eigenvalues equal to zero for any matrix order $n$, while for the
matrix-sequence under consideration we will show a strong clustering at the
range of the generating function $e^{\mathbf{i}\theta}$ i.e. at the complex
unit circle. For $\beta\ge 2$ no outliers show up, while for $\beta \in (1,2)$
only two outliers are present, which are both real, positive and have finite
limits equal to $\beta-1$ and $(\beta-1)^{-1}$, respectively. The problem looks
mathematically innocent, but indeed it is quite challenging since all the
sophisticated machinery for deducing the eigenvalue clustering is not easy to
apply in the current setting and at most we may hope for weak clustering
results. In the derivations, we resort to a trick already used for the spectral
analysis of the Google matrix plus several tools from complex analysis. We only
mention that the problem is not an academical curiosity and in fact it stems
from problems in dynamical systems and number theory. Numerical experiments in
high precision are provided and more results are sketched for limit case of

<p class="mathjax">Categorical random variables can faithfully represent the discrete and
uncertain aspects of data as part of a discrete latent variable model. Learning
in such models necessitates taking gradients with respect to the parameters of
the categorical probability distributions, which is often intractable due to
their combinatorial nature. A popular technique to estimate these otherwise
intractable gradients is the Log-Derivative trick. This trick forms the basis
of the well-known REINFORCE gradient estimator and its many extensions. While
the Log-Derivative trick allows us to differentiate through samples drawn from
categorical distributions, it does not take into account the discrete nature of
the distribution itself. Our first contribution addresses this shortcoming by
introducing the CatLog-Derivative trick - a variation of the Log-Derivative
trick tailored towards categorical distributions. Secondly, we use the
CatLog-Derivative trick to introduce IndeCateR, a novel and unbiased gradient
estimator for the important case of products of independent categorical
distributions with provably lower variance than REINFORCE. Thirdly, we
empirically show that IndeCateR can be efficiently implemented and that its
gradient estimates have significantly lower bias and variance for the same
number of samples compared to the state of the art.

challenges persist in job scheduling for make-to-job and mass customization,

performance, a more condensed environment representation approach is proposed,
which is designed to work with the masks made by priority dispatching rules to

intermediaries such as Hugging Face provide easy access to user-uploaded models

Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited)

<p class="mathjax">In the era of large language models generating high quality texts, it is a
necessity to develop methods for detection of machine-generated text to avoid
harmful use or simply due to annotation purposes. It is, however, also
important to properly evaluate and compare such developed methods. Recently, a
few benchmarks have been proposed for this purpose; however, integration of
newest detection methods is rather challenging, since new methods appear each
month and provide slightly different evaluation pipelines. In this paper, we
present the IMGTB framework, which simplifies the benchmarking of
machine-generated text detection methods by easy integration of custom (new)
methods and evaluation datasets. Its configurability and flexibility makes
research and development of new detection methods easier, especially their
comparison to the existing state-of-the-art detectors. The default set of
analyses, metrics and visualizations offered by the tool follows the
established practices of machine-generated text detection benchmarking found in
state-of-the-art literature.

<p class="mathjax">A swarm of robots has advantages over a single robot, since it can explore
larger areas much faster and is more robust to single-point failures. Accurate
relative positioning is necessary to successfully carry out a collaborative
mission without collisions. When Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(VSLAM) is used to estimate the poses of each robot, inter-agent loop closing
is widely applied to reduce the relative positioning errors. This technique can
mitigate errors using the feature points commonly observed by different robots.
However, it requires significant computing and communication capabilities to
detect inter-agent loops, and to process the data transmitted by multiple
agents. In this paper, we propose Collaborative SLAM using Visual Odometry and
Range measurements (CoVOR-SLAM) to overcome this challenge. In the framework of
CoVOR-SLAM, robots only need to exchange pose estimates, covariances
(uncertainty) of the estimates, and range measurements between robots. Since
CoVOR-SLAM does not require to associate visual features and map points
observed by different agents, the computational and communication loads are
significantly reduced. The required range measurements can be obtained using
pilot signals of the communication system, without requiring complex additional
infrastructure. We tested CoVOR-SLAM using real images as well as real
ultra-wideband-based ranges obtained with two rovers. In addition, CoVOR-SLAM
is evaluated with a larger scale multi-agent setup exploiting public image
datasets and ranges generated using a realistic simulation. The results show
that CoVOR-SLAM can accurately estimate the robots' poses, requiring much less
computational power and communication capabilities than the inter-agent loop
closing technique.

<p class="mathjax">The number of vehicles on the road is growing every day, thus there's a
growing need to develop effective and hassle-free parking systems. Finding a
parking space may be a big challenge, especially in crowded cities or areas

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present a novel dense-correspondence method for 6DoF object
pose estimation from a single RGB-D image. While many existing data-driven
methods achieve impressive performance, they tend to be time-consuming due to
their reliance on rendering-based refinement approaches. To circumvent this
limitation, we present HiPose, which establishes 3D-3D correspondences in a
coarse-to-fine manner with a hierarchical binary surface encoding. Unlike
previous dense-correspondence methods, we estimate the correspondence surface
by employing point-to-surface matching and iteratively constricting the surface
until it becomes a correspondence point while gradually removing outliers.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less demonstrate
that our method surpasses all refinement-free methods and is even on par with
expensive refinement-based approaches. Crucially, our approach is
computationally efficient and enables real-time critical applications with high
accuracy requirements. Code and models will be released.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the
obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a
staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for
domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT
performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of
how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate
that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer
performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation
Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as
domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To
assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI
source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and
without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via
CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over
SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision
promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital
role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent
for further domain adaptation explorations.

<p class="mathjax">Schizophrenia is a complicated mental illness characterized by a broad
spectrum of symptoms affecting cognition, behavior, and emotion. The task of
identifying reliable biomarkers to classify Schizophrenia accurately continues
to be a challenge in the field of psychiatry. We investigate the temporal
patterns within the motor activity data as a potential key to enhancing the
categorization of individuals with Schizophrenia, using the dataset having
motor activity recordings of 22 Schizophrenia patients and 32 control subjects.
The dataset contains per-minute motor activity measurements collected for an
average of 12.7 days in a row for each participant. We dissect each day into
segments (Twelve, Eight, six, four, three, and two parts) and evaluate their
impact on classification. We employ sixteen statistical features within these
temporal segments and train them on Seven machine learning models to get deeper
insights. LightGBM model outperforms the other six models. Our results indicate
that the temporal segmentation significantly improves the classification, with
AUC-ROC = 0.93, F1 score = 0.84( LightGBM- without any segmentation) and
AUC-ROC = 0.98, F1 score = 0.93( LightGBM- with segmentation). Distinguishing
between diurnal and nocturnal segments amplifies the differences between
Schizophrenia patients and controls. However, further subdivisions into smaller
time segments do not affect the AUC- ROC significantly. Morning, afternoon,
evening, and night partitioning gives similar classification performance to
day-night partitioning. These findings are valuable as they indicate that
extensive temporal classification beyond distinguishing between day and night
does not yield substantial results, offering an efficient approach for further
classification, early diagnosis, and monitoring of Schizophrenia.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a way to interact with computers
without relying on physical movements. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG)-based visual BCIs, known for efficient speed and calibration ease, face
limitations in continuous tasks due to discrete stimulus design and decoding
methods. To achieve continuous control, we implemented a novel spatial encoding
stimulus paradigm and devised a corresponding projection method to enable
continuous modulation of decoded velocity. Subsequently, we conducted
experiments involving 17 participants and achieved Fitt's ITR of 0.55 bps for
the fixed tracking task and 0.37 bps for the random tracking task. The proposed
BCI with a high Fitt's ITR was then integrated into two applications, including
painting and gaming. In conclusion, this study proposed a visual BCI-based
control method to go beyond discrete commands, allowing natural continuous
control based on neural activity.

<p class="mathjax">Hypoxia occurs when tumour cells outgrow their blood supply, leading to
regions of low oxygen levels within the tumour. Calculating hypoxia levels can
be an important step in understanding the biology of tumours, their clinical
progression and response to treatment. This study demonstrates a novel
application of deep learning to evaluate hypoxia in the context of breast
cancer histomorphology. More precisely, we show that Weakly Supervised Deep
Learning (WSDL) models can accurately detect hypoxia associated features in
routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSI). We trained and
evaluated a deep Multiple Instance Learning model on tiles from WSI H&amp;E tissue
from breast cancer primary sites (n=240) obtaining on average an AUC of 0.87 on
a left-out test set. We also showed significant differences between features of
hypoxic and normoxic tissue regions as distinguished by the WSDL models. Such
DL hypoxia H&amp;E WSI detection models could potentially be extended to other
tumour types and easily integrated into the pathology workflow without
requiring additional costly assays.

<p class="mathjax">Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D
understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing
interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches
that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape
reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape
reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the
inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing,
and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address
these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D
shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a
vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural
representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a
Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes
representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural
function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D
shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D
shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up
research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal
perception in robotics. Code and supplementary material are available at:

<p class="mathjax">To assist surgeons in the operating theatre, surgical phase recognition is
critical for developing computer-assisted surgical systems, which requires
comprehensive understanding of surgical videos. Although existing studies made
great progress, there are still two significant limitations worthy of
improvement. First, due to the compromise of resource consumption, frame-wise
visual features are extracted by 2D networks and disregard spatial and temporal
knowledge of surgical actions, which hinders subsequent inter-frame modeling
for phase prediction. Second, these works simply utilize ordinary
classification loss with one-hot phase labels to optimize the phase
predictions, and cannot fully explore surgical videos under inadequate
supervision. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a Surgical Temporal
Action-aware Network with sequence Regularization, named STAR-Net, to recognize
surgical phases more accurately from input videos. Specifically, we propose an
efficient multi-scale surgical temporal action (MS-STA) module, which
integrates visual features with spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical
actions at the cost of 2D networks. Moreover, we devise the dual-classifier
sequence regularization (DSR) to facilitate the training of STAR-Net by the
sequence guidance of an auxiliary classifier with a smaller capacity. Our
STAR-Net with MS-STA and DSR can exploit visual features of surgical actions
with effective regularization, thereby leading to the superior performance of
surgical phase recognition. Extensive experiments on a large-scale gastrectomy
surgery dataset and the public Cholec80 benchmark prove that our STAR-Net
significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts of surgical phase recognition.

<p class="mathjax">When engaging in strategic decision-making, we are frequently confronted with
overwhelming information and data. The situation can be further complicated
when certain pieces of evidence contradict each other or become paradoxical.
The primary challenge is how to determine which information can be trusted when
we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for decision-making. This issue
is known as deciding what to decide or Trustworthy AI. However, the AI system
itself is often considered an opaque black box. We propose a new approach to
address this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI)
encompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss
function, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI
properties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim
to use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and
qualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making
context. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model
trained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of
credit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector. Finally, we provide our
view of the future direction of TAI research

<p class="mathjax">Recently, dense pseudo-label, which directly selects pseudo labels from the
original output of the teacher model without any complicated post-processing
steps, has received considerable attention in semi-supervised object detection
(SSOD). However, for the multi-oriented and dense objects that are common in
aerial scenes, existing dense pseudo-label selection methods are inefficient
and impede the performance in semi-supervised oriented object detection.
Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dense Pseudo Label Selection (ADPLS) for
semi-supervised oriented object detection. In ADPLS, we design a simple but
effective adaptive mechanism to guide the selection of dense pseudo labels.
Specifically, we propose the mean Feature-Richness Score (mFRS) to estimate the
density of potential objects and use this score to adjust the number of dense
pseudo labels. On the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms
previous methods especially when labeled data are scarce. For example, it
achieves 49.78 mAP given only 5% of annotated data, which surpasses previous
state-of-the-art method given 10% of annotated data by 1.15 mAP. Our codes will
be available soon.

<p class="mathjax">In the classical lossy source coding problem, one encodes long blocks of
source symbols that enables the distortion to approach the ultimate Shannon
limit. Such a block-coding approach introduces large delays, which is
undesirable in many delay-sensitive applications. We consider the zero-delay
case, where the goal is to encode and decode a finite-alphabet Markov source
without any delay. It has been shown that this problem lends itself to
stochastic control techniques, which lead to existence, structural, and general
structural approximation results. However, these techniques so far have
resulted only in computationally prohibitive algorithmic implementations for
code design. To address this problem, we present a reinforcement learning
design algorithm and rigorously prove its asymptotic optimality. In particular,
we show that a quantized Q-learning algorithm can be used to obtain a
near-optimal coding policy for this problem. The proof builds on recent results
on quantized Q-learning for weakly Feller controlled Markov chains whose
application necessitates the development of supporting technical results on
regularity and stability properties, and relating the optimal solutions for
discounted and average cost infinite horizon criteria problems. These
theoretical results are supported by simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Starting with early successes in computer vision tasks, deep learning based
techniques have since overtaken state of the art approaches in a multitude of
domains. However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques
fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying
on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep
learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain
specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue.
One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of
suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this,
we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated
chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its
corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which
constrains the set of predictions to "reasonable" game states, and are designed
to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside
standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to
logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the
art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on
standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results,
indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve a
multi-agent Markov decision process (MMDP). The goal, inspired by Blackwell's
Approachability Theorem, is to lower the time average cost of each agent to
below a pre-specified agent-specific bound. For the MMDP, we assume the state
dynamics to be controlled by the joint actions of agents, but the per-stage
costs to only depend on the individual agent's actions. We combine the
Q-learning algorithm for a weighted combination of the costs of each agent,
obtained by a gossip algorithm with the Metropolis-Hastings or Multiplicative
Weights formalisms to modulate the averaging matrix of the gossip. We use
multiple timescales in our algorithm and prove that under mild conditions, it
approximately achieves the desired bounds for each of the agents. We also
demonstrate the empirical performance of this algorithm in the more general
setting of MMDPs having jointly controlled per-stage costs.

<p class="mathjax">Current 3D semi-supervised segmentation methods face significant challenges
such as limited consideration of contextual information and the inability to
generate reliable pseudo-labels for effective unsupervised data use. To address
these challenges, we introduce two distinct subnetworks designed to explore and
exploit the discrepancies between them, ultimately correcting the erroneous
prediction results. More specifically, we identify regions of inconsistent
predictions and initiate a targeted verification training process. This
procedure strategically fine-tunes and harmonizes the predictions of the
subnetworks, leading to enhanced utilization of contextual information.
Furthermore, to adaptively fine-tune the network's representational capacity
and reduce prediction uncertainty, we employ a self-supervised contrastive
learning paradigm. For this, we use the network's confidence to distinguish
between reliable and unreliable predictions. The model is then trained to
effectively minimize unreliable predictions. Our experimental results for organ
segmentation, obtained from clinical MRI and CT scans, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach when compared to state-of-the-art methods. The

<p class="mathjax">High Content Imaging (HCI) plays a vital role in modern drug discovery and
development pipelines, facilitating various stages from hit identification to
candidate drug characterization. Applying machine learning models to these
datasets can prove challenging as they typically consist of multiple batches,
affected by experimental variation, especially if different imaging equipment
have been used. Moreover, as new data arrive, it is preferable that they are
analyzed in an online fashion. To overcome this, we propose CODA, an online
self-supervised domain adaptation approach. CODA divides the classifier's role
into a generic feature extractor and a task-specific model. We adapt the
feature extractor's weights to the new domain using cross-batch
self-supervision while keeping the task-specific model unchanged. Our results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces the generalization gap,
achieving up to a 300% improvement when applied to data from different labs
utilizing different microscopes. CODA can be applied to new, unlabeled
out-of-domain data sources of different sizes, from a single plate to multiple
experimental batches.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) look at
Complexity from different points of view. We explore the interface between AIT
and Kernel Methods (that are prevalent in ML) by adopting an AIT perspective on
the problem of learning kernels from data, in kernel ridge regression, through
the method of Sparse Kernel Flows. In particular, by looking at the differences
and commonalities between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and Regularization
in Machine Learning (RML), we prove that the method of Sparse Kernel Flows is
the natural approach to adopt to learn kernels from data. This paper shows that
it is not necessary to use the statistical route to derive Sparse Kernel Flows
and that one can directly work with code-lengths and complexities that are
concepts that show up in AIT.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring the precision of channel modeling plays a pivotal role in the
development of wireless communication systems, and this requirement remains a
persistent challenge within the realm of networks supported by Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). Achieving a comprehensive and reliable
understanding of channel behavior in RIS-aided networks is an ongoing and
complex issue that demands further exploration. In this paper, we empirically
validate a recently-proposed impedance-based RIS channel model that accounts
for the mutual coupling at the antenna array and precisely models the presence
of scattering objects within the environment as a discrete array of loaded
dipoles. To this end, we exploit real-life channel measurements collected in an
office environment to demonstrate the validity of such a model and its
applicability in a practical scenario. Finally, we provide numerical results
demonstrating that designing the RIS configuration based upon such model leads
to superior performance as compared to reference schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series is prevalent in many scientific and industrial
domains. Modeling multivariate signals is challenging due to their long-range
temporal dependencies and intricate interactions--both direct and indirect. To
confront these complexities, we introduce a method of representing multivariate
signals as nodes in a graph with edges indicating interdependency between them.
Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks (GNN) and attention mechanisms
to efficiently learn the underlying relationships within the time series data.
Moreover, we suggest employing hierarchical signal decompositions running over
the graphs to capture multiple spatial dependencies. The effectiveness of our
proposed model is evaluated across various real-world benchmark datasets
designed for long-term forecasting tasks. The results consistently showcase the
superiority of our model, achieving an average 23\% reduction in mean squared
error (MSE) compared to existing models.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in text-to-video generation have harnessed the power of
diffusion models to create visually compelling content conditioned on text
prompts. However, they usually encounter high computational costs and often
struggle to produce videos with coherent physical motions. To tackle these
issues, we propose GPT4Motion, a training-free framework that leverages the
planning capability of large language models such as GPT, the physical
simulation strength of Blender, and the excellent image generation ability of
text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the quality of video synthesis.
Specifically, GPT4Motion employs GPT-4 to generate a Blender script based on a
user textual prompt, which commands Blender's built-in physics engine to craft
fundamental scene components that encapsulate coherent physical motions across
frames. Then these components are inputted into Stable Diffusion to generate a
video aligned with the textual prompt. Experimental results on three basic
physical motion scenarios, including rigid object drop and collision, cloth
draping and swinging, and liquid flow, demonstrate that GPT4Motion can generate
high-quality videos efficiently in maintaining motion coherency and entity
consistency. GPT4Motion offers new insights in text-to-video research,
enhancing its quality and broadening its horizon for future explorations.

<p class="mathjax">As a physical fact, randomness is an inherent and ineliminable aspect in all
physical measurements and engineering production. As a consequence, material
parameters, serving as input data, are only known in a stochastic sense and
thus, also output parameters, e.g., stresses, fluctuate. For the estimation of
those fluctuations it is imperative to incoporate randomness into engineering
simulations. Unfortunately, incorporating uncertain parameters into the
modeling and simulation of inelastic materials is often computationally
expensive, as many individual simulations may have to be performed. The promise
of the proposed method is simple: using extended material models to include
stochasticity reduces the number of needed simulations to one. This single
computation is cheap, i.e., it has a comparable numerical effort as a single
standard simulation. The extended material models are easily derived from
standard deterministic material models and account for the effect of
uncertainty by an extended set of deterministic material parameters. The
time-dependent and stochastic material behavior are separated, such that only
the deterministic time-dependent behavior of the extended material model needs
to be simulated. The effect of stochasticity is then included during
post-processing. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated for three
different and highly non-linear material models: viscous damage, viscous phase
transformations and elasto-viscoplasticity. A comparison to the Monte Carlo
method showcases that the method is indeed able to provide reliable estimates
of the expectation and variance of internal variables and stress at a minimal
fraction of the computation cost.

<p class="mathjax">Within the multimodal field, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made
significant progress due to their strong perception and reasoning capabilities
in the visual and language systems. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two
critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the
practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation
methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but
lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting
in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is
devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of
multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation,
we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception,
aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated
answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates
the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also
further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal
potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our
proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the
development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost,
privacy protection, and reproducibility. Our code will be released upon
publication.

<p class="mathjax">In computer vision, the indexing problem is the problem of recognizing a few
objects in a large database of objects while avoiding the help of the classical
image-feature-to-object-feature matching paradigm. In this paper we address the
problem of recognizing 3-D polyhedral objects from 2-D images by indexing. Both
the objects to be recognized and the images are represented by weighted graphs.
The indexing problem is therefore the problem of determining whether a graph
extracted from the image is present or absent in a database of model graphs. We
introduce a novel method for performing this graph indexing process which is
based both on polynomial characterization of binary and weighted graphs and on
hashing. We describe in detail this polynomial characterization and then we
show how it can be used in the context of polyhedral object recognition. Next
we describe a practical recognition-by-indexing system that includes the
organization of the database, the representation of polyhedral objects in terms
of 2-D characteristic views, the representation of this views in terms of
weighted graphs, and the associated image processing. Finally, some
experimental results allow the evaluation of the system performance.

<p class="mathjax">Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning.
Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting
top-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph
representations. However, this paper highlights two key issues with these
methods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs
additional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a
thorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and
subsequent prediction tasks. 2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly
discard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the
latent information contained within these elements. To address the first issue,
we introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects
nodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final
representation vectors crucial for classification. The second issue is
addressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies
a uniform loss on the discarded nodes. This addition is designed to augment the
training process and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our
proposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets.
Our experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14
baseline methods for most datasets. Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances
GrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of cloud environments, data providers entrust their data to
data consumers in order to allow further computing on their own IT
infrastructure. Usage control measures allow the data provider to restrict the
usage of its data even on the data consumer's system. Two of these restrictions
can be the geographic location and time limitations. Current solutions that
could be used to enforce such constraints can be easily manipulated. These
include solutions based on the system time, organizational agreements,
GPS-based techniques or simple delay measurements to derive the distance to
known reference servers. With D-GATE, we propose a reliable solution that uses
trusted execution environments and relies on a decentralized mesh of reference
nodes, so-called GeoClients. Here, participants periodically measure the lowest
network delay to each other to geolocate themselves. For data providers, it is
thus possible to technically attest usage control with time and geolocation
constraints without depending on centralized reference systems.

<p class="mathjax">MathGloss is a project to create a knowledge graph (KG) for undergraduate
mathematics from text, automatically, using modern natural language processing
(NLP) tools and resources already available on the web. MathGloss is a linked
database of undergraduate concepts in mathematics. So far, it combines five
resources: (i) Wikidata, a collaboratively edited, multilingual knowledge graph
hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, (ii) terms covered in mathematics courses
at the University of Chicago, (iii) the syllabus of the French undergraduate
mathematics curriculum which includes hyperlinks to the automated theorem
prover Lean 4, (iv) MuLiMa, a multilingual dictionary of mathematics curated by
mathematicians, and (v) the nLab, a wiki for category theory also curated by
mathematicians. MathGloss's goal is to bring together resources for learning
mathematics and to allow every mathematician to tailor their learning to their
own preferences. Moreover, by organizing different resources for learning
undergraduate mathematics alongside those for learning formal mathematics, we
hope to make it easier for mathematicians and formal tools (theorem provers,
computer algebra systems, etc) experts to "understand" each other and break
down some of the barriers to formal math.

<p class="mathjax">Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is
essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and
manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration
performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic
segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models
for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection.
In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework
tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our
framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a
dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways:
one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns
boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the
fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise
relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel.
Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in
dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing
methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to
simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate
object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that
Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while
maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with
1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on
CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our method's generalizability. Code

<p class="mathjax">Recently, compositional optimization (CO) has gained popularity because of
its applications in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and many other
machine learning problems. Large-scale and distributed availability of data
demands the development of efficient federated learning (FL) algorithms for
solving CO problems. Developing FL algorithms for CO is particularly
challenging because of the compositional nature of the objective. Moreover,
current state-of-the-art methods to solve such problems rely on large batch
gradients (depending on the solution accuracy) not feasible for most practical
settings. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose efficient
FedAvg-type algorithms for solving non-convex CO in the FL setting. We first
establish that vanilla FedAvg is not suitable to solve distributed CO problems
because of the data heterogeneity in the compositional objective at each client
which leads to the amplification of bias in the local compositional gradient
estimates. To this end, we propose a novel FL framework FedDRO that utilizes
the DRO problem structure to design a communication strategy that allows FedAvg
to control the bias in the estimation of the compositional gradient. A key
novelty of our work is to develop solution accuracy-independent algorithms that
do not require large batch gradients (and function evaluations) for solving
federated CO problems. We establish $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ communication complexity in the FL setting while
achieving linear speedup with the number of clients. We corroborate our
theoretical findings with empirical studies on large-scale DRO problems.

<p class="mathjax">Whenever a sensor is mounted on a robot hand it is important to know the
relationship between the sensor and the hand. The problem of determining this
relationship is referred to as hand-eye calibration, which is important in at
least two types of tasks: (i) map sensor centered measurements into the robot
workspace and (ii) allow the robot to precisely move the sensor. In the past
some solutions were proposed in the particular case of a camera. With almost no
exception, all existing solutions attempt to solve the homogeneous matrix
equation AX=XB. First we show that there are two possible formulations of the
hand-eye calibration problem. One formulation is the classical one that we just
mentioned. A second formulation takes the form of the following homogeneous
matrix equation: MY=M'YB. The advantage of the latter is that the extrinsic and
intrinsic camera parameters need not be made explicit. Indeed, this formulation
directly uses the 3 by 4 perspective matrices (M and M') associated with two
positions of the camera. Moreover, this formulation together with the classical
one cover a wider range of camera-based sensors to be calibrated with respect
to the robot hand. Second, we develop a common mathematical framework to solve
for the hand-eye calibration problem using either of the two formulations. We
present two methods, (i) a rotation then translation and (ii) a non-linear
solver for rotation and translation. Third, we perform a stability analysis
both for our two methods and for the classical linear method developed. In the
light of this comparison, the non-linear optimization method, that solves for
rotation and translation simultaneously, seems to be the most robust one with
respect to noise and to measurement errors.

<p class="mathjax">Carbohydrates, vital components of biological systems, are well-known for
their structural diversity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays
a crucial role in understanding their intricate molecular arrangements and is
essential in assessing and verifying the molecular structure of organic
molecules. An important part of this process is to predict the NMR chemical
shift from the molecular structure. This work introduces a novel approach that
leverages E(3) equivariant graph neural networks to predict carbohydrate NMR
spectra. Notably, our model achieves a substantial reduction in mean absolute
error, up to threefold, compared to traditional models that rely solely on
two-dimensional molecular structure. Even with limited data, the model excels,
highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities. The implications
are far-reaching and go beyond an advanced understanding of carbohydrate
structures and spectral interpretation. For example, it could accelerate
research in pharmaceutical applications, biochemistry, and structural biology,
offering a faster and more reliable analysis of molecular structures.
Furthermore, our approach is a key step towards a new data-driven era in
spectroscopy, potentially influencing spectroscopic techniques beyond NMR.

how to represent a grasp or more generally, an alignment between two solids in
3-D projective space using an uncalibrated stereo rig. Such a 3-D projective
representation is view-invariant in the sense that it can be easily mapped into
an image set-point without any knowledge about the camera parameters. Third, we

<p class="mathjax">This study outlines a comprehensive methodology for verifying medical
documents, integrating advanced techniques in template extraction, comparison,
and fraud detection. It begins with template extraction using sophisticated
region-of-interest (ROI) methods, incorporating contour analysis and edge
identification. Pre-processing steps ensure template clarity through
morphological operations and adaptive thresholding. The template comparison
algorithm utilizes advanced feature matching with key points and descriptors,
enhancing robustness through histogram-based analysis for accounting
variations. Fraud detection involves the SSIM computation and OCR for textual
information extraction. The SSIM quantifies structural similarity, aiding in
potential match identification. OCR focuses on critical areas like patient
details, provider information, and billing amounts. Extracted information is
compared with a reference dataset, and confidence thresholding ensures reliable
fraud detection. Adaptive parameters enhance system flexibility for dynamic
adjustments to varying document layouts. This methodology provides a robust
approach to medical document verification, addressing complexities in template
extraction, comparison, fraud detection, and adaptability to diverse document
structures.

<p class="mathjax">We present the DURel tool that implements the annotation of semantic
proximity between uses of words into an online, open source interface. The tool
supports standardized human annotation as well as computational annotation,
building on recent advances with Word-in-Context models. Annotator judgments
are clustered with automatic graph clustering techniques and visualized for
analysis. This allows to measure word senses with simple and intuitive
micro-task judgments between use pairs, requiring minimal preparation efforts.
The tool offers additional functionalities to compare the agreement between
annotators to guarantee the inter-subjectivity of the obtained judgments and to
calculate summary statistics giving insights into sense frequency

<p class="mathjax">Steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) offer a non-invasive means of communication through high-speed speller
systems. However, their efficiency heavily relies on individual training data
obtained during time-consuming calibration sessions. To address the challenge
of data insufficiency in SSVEP-based BCIs, we present SSVEP-DAN, the first
dedicated neural network model designed for aligning SSVEP data across
different domains, which can encompass various sessions, subjects, or devices.
Our experimental results across multiple cross-domain scenarios demonstrate
SSVEP-DAN's capability to transform existing source SSVEP data into
supplementary calibration data, significantly enhancing SSVEP decoding accuracy
in scenarios with limited calibration data. We envision SSVEP-DAN as a catalyst
for practical SSVEP-based BCI applications with minimal calibration. The source

<p class="mathjax">We prove error estimates for a finite element approximation of viscoelastic
dynamics based on continuous Galerkin in space and time, both in energy norm
and in $L^2$ norm. The proof is based on an error representation formula using
a discrete dual problem and a stability estimate involving the kinetic,
elastic, and viscoelastic energies. To set up the dual error analysis and to
prove the basic stability estimates, it is natural to formulate the problem as
a system involving evolution equations for the viscoelastic stress, the
displacements, and the velocities. The equations for the viscoelastic stress
can, however, be solved analytically in terms of the deviatoric strain
velocity, and therefore, the viscoelastic stress can be eliminated from the
system, resulting in a system for displacements and velocities.

<p class="mathjax">Engineering Design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of
AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning.
Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling
this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage
the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and
are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision
language models, such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of
tasks. In light of these advancements, this paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of GPT-4V, a vision language model, across a wide spectrum of
engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design,
System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering
Education Tasks. Our study assesses GPT-4V's capabilities in design tasks such
as sketch similarity analysis, concept selection using Pugh Charts, material
selection, engineering drawing analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization,
design for additive and subtractive manufacturing, spatial reasoning
challenges, and textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not
only explore GPT-4V's proficiency in handling complex design and manufacturing
challenges but also identify its limitations in complex engineering design
applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of
vision language models, emphasizing their immense potential for innovating and
enhancing the engineering design and manufacturing landscape. It also
contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries,
for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.

<p class="mathjax">Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a challenging, albeit essential
task in drug repurposing. Learning on graph models have drawn special attention
as they can significantly reduce drug repurposing costs and time commitment.
However, many current approaches require high-demanding additional information
besides DTIs that complicates their evaluation process and usability.
Additionally, structural differences in the learning architecture of current
models hinder their fair benchmarking. In this work, we first perform an
in-depth evaluation of current DTI datasets and prediction models through a
robust benchmarking process, and show that DTI prediction methods based on
transductive models lack generalization and lead to inflated performance when
evaluated as previously done in the literature, hence not being suited for drug
repurposing approaches. We then propose a novel biologically-driven strategy
for negative edge subsampling and show through in vitro validation that newly
discovered interactions are indeed true. We envision this work as the
underpinning for future fair benchmarking and robust model design. All
generated resources and tools are publicly available as a python package.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning algorithms are improving rapidly, but annotating training
data remains a bottleneck for many applications. In this paper, we show how
real data can be used for self-supervised learning without any transformations
by taking advantage of the symmetry present in the activities. Our approach
involves contrastive matching of two different sensors (left and right wrist or
leg-worn IMUs) to make representations of co-occurring sensor data more similar
and those of non-co-occurring sensor data more different. We test our approach
on the Opportunity and MM-Fit datasets. In MM-Fit we show significant
improvement over the baseline supervised and self-supervised method SimCLR,
while for Opportunity there is significant improvement over the supervised
baseline and slight improvement when compared to SimCLR. Moreover, our method
improves supervised baselines even when using only a small amount of the data
for training. Future work should explore under which conditions our method is
beneficial for human activity recognition systems and other related
applications.

<p class="mathjax">It has been over six years since the Transformer architecture was put
forward. Surprisingly, the vanilla Transformer architecture is still widely
used today. One reason is that the lack of deep understanding and comprehensive
interpretation of the Transformer architecture makes it more challenging to
improve the Transformer architecture. In this paper, we first interpret the
Transformer architecture comprehensively in plain words based on our
understanding and experiences. The interpretations are further proved and
verified. These interpretations also cover the Extractor, a family of drop-in
replacements for the multi-head self-attention in the Transformer architecture.
Then, we propose an improvement on a type of the Extractor that outperforms the
self-attention, without introducing additional trainable parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that the improved Extractor performs even
better, showing a way to improve the Transformer architecture.

<p class="mathjax">Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically
involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with
data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal
windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple
objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and
efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a
single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while
still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art
without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold
interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold
smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a
single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window
optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized,
reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its
ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and
efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/.

<p class="mathjax">Scene segmentation via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the
transfer of knowledge acquired from source synthetic data to real-world target
data, which largely reduces the need for manual pixel-level annotations in the
target domain. To facilitate domain-invariant feature learning, existing
methods typically mix data from both the source domain and target domain by
simply copying and pasting the pixels. Such vanilla methods are usually
sub-optimal since they do not take into account how well the mixed layouts
correspond to real-world scenarios. Real-world scenarios are with an inherent
layout. We observe that semantic categories, such as sidewalks, buildings, and
sky, display relatively consistent depth distributions, and could be clearly
distinguished in a depth map. Based on such observation, we propose a
depth-aware framework to explicitly leverage depth estimation to mix the
categories and facilitate the two complementary tasks, i.e., segmentation and
depth learning in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the framework contains a
Depth-guided Contextual Filter (DCF) forndata augmentation and a cross-task
encoder for contextual learning. DCF simulates the real-world layouts, while
the cross-task encoder further adaptively fuses the complementing features
between two tasks. Besides, it is worth noting that several public datasets do
not provide depth annotation. Therefore, we leverage the off-the-shelf depth
estimation network to generate the pseudo depth. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed methods, even with pseudo depth, achieve competitive
performance on two widely-used bench-marks, i.e. 77.7 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes
and 69.3 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes.

<p class="mathjax">The unequal representation of different groups in a sample population can
lead to discrimination of minority groups when machine learning models make
automated decisions. To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning
jointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and
low unfairness. However, the inherent under-representation of minorities in the
data makes the disparate treatment of subpopulations less noticeable and
difficult to deal with during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel
adversarial reweighting method to address such \emph{representation bias}. To
balance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our
approach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical
risk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the
minority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance. Our theoretical
analysis shows the effectiveness of our adversarial reweighting approach.
Experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates bias without sacrificing
classification accuracy, outperforming related state-of-the-art methods on
image and tabular benchmark datasets.

explainability, must be monitored, verified, and maintained. This need is even
more pressing when modern applications operate in the edge-cloud continuum,
increasing their complexity and dynamicity. Existing approaches mostly focus on
i) implementing classifier selection solutions according to the functional
behavior of ML models, ii) finding new algorithmic solutions to this need, such
as continuous re-training. In this paper, we propose a multi-model approach
built on dynamic classifier selection, where multiple ML models showing similar
non-functional properties are made available to the application and one model
is selected over time according to (dynamic and unpredictable) contextual
changes. Our solution goes beyond the state of the art by providing an
architectural and methodological approach that continuously guarantees a stable
non-functional behavior of ML-based applications, is applicable to different ML
models, and is driven by non-functional properties assessed on the models
themselves. It consists of a two-step process working during application
operation, where model assessment verifies non-functional properties of ML
models trained and selected at development time, and model substitution
guarantees a continuous and stable support of non-functional properties. We
experimentally evaluate our solution in a real-world scenario focusing on
non-functional property fairness.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian deep learning and conformal prediction are two methods that have
been used to convey uncertainty and increase safety in machine learning
systems. We focus on combining Bayesian deep learning with split conformal
prediction and how this combination effects out-of-distribution coverage;
particularly in the case of multiclass image classification. We suggest that if
the model is generally underconfident on the calibration set, then the
resultant conformal sets may exhibit worse out-of-distribution coverage
compared to simple predictive credible sets. Conversely, if the model is
overconfident on the calibration set, the use of conformal prediction may
improve out-of-distribution coverage. We evaluate prediction sets as a result
of combining split conformal methods and neural networks trained with (i)
stochastic gradient descent, (ii) deep ensembles, and (iii) mean-field
variational inference. Our results suggest that combining Bayesian deep
learning models with split conformal prediction can, in some cases, cause
unintended consequences such as reducing out-of-distribution coverage.

<p class="mathjax">Group fairness is a central research topic in text classification, where
reaching fair treatment between sensitive groups (e.g. women vs. men) remains
an open challenge. This paper presents a novel method for mitigating biases in
neural text classification, agnostic to the model architecture. Considering the
difficulty to distinguish fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we
take inspiration from adversarial training to induce Wasserstein independence
between representations learned to predict our target label and the ones
learned to predict some sensitive attribute. Our approach provides two
significant advantages. Firstly, it does not require annotations of sensitive
attributes in both testing and training data. This is more suitable for
real-life scenarios compared to existing methods that require annotations of
sensitive attributes at train time. Second, our approach exhibits a comparable
or better fairness-accuracy trade-off compared to existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of merchant storage participating in the regulation
market with state-of-charge (SoC) dependent bids. Because storage can
simultaneously provide regulation up and regulation down capacities, the
market-clearing engine faces the computation challenge of evaluating storage
costs under different regulation scenarios. One approach is to employ a bilevel
optimization that minimizes the worst-case storage cost among all potential
regulation events. However, subproblems of such a bilevel optimization are
nonconvex, resulting in prohibitive computation challenges for the real-time
clearing of the regulation market. We show that the complex nonconvex market
clearing problem can be convexified by a simple restriction on the
SoC-dependent bid, rendering the intractable market clearing computation to
standard linear programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that SoC-dependent
bids satisfying the convexification conditions increase the profits of merchant
storage owners by 12.32-77.38% compared with SoC-independent bids.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in control
systems research to transition from model-based methods to data-driven
approaches. In this study, we aim to bridge a divide between conventional
model-based control and emerging data-driven paradigms grounded in Willem's
fundamental lemma. Specifically, we study how input/output data from two
separate systems can be manipulated to represent the behavior of interconnected
systems, either connected in series or through feedback. Using these results,
this paper introduces the Internal Behavior Control (IBC), a new control
strategy based on the well-known Internal Model Control (IMC) but viewed under
the lens of Behavioral System Theory. Similar to IMC, the IBC is easy to tune
and results in perfect tracking and disturbance rejection but, unlike IMC, does
not require a parametric model of the dynamics. We present two approaches for
IBC implementation: a component-by-component one and a unified one. We compare
the two approaches in terms of filter design, computations, and memory
requirements.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the informative path planning ($\mathtt{IPP}$) problem in which a
robot interacts with an uncertain environment and gathers information by
visiting locations. The goal is to minimize its expected travel cost to cover a
given submodular function. Adaptive solutions, where the robot incorporates all
available information to select the next location to visit, achieve the best
objective. However, such a solution is resource-intensive as it entails
recomputing after every visited location. A more practical approach is to
design solutions with a small number of adaptive "rounds", where the robot
recomputes only once at the start of each round. In this paper, we design an
algorithm for $\mathtt{IPP}$ parameterized by the number $k$ of adaptive
rounds, and prove a smooth trade-off between $k$ and the solution quality
(relative to fully adaptive solutions). We validate our theoretical results by
experiments on a real road network, where we observe that a few rounds of
adaptivity suffice to obtain solutions of cost almost as good as fully-adaptive
ones.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
powerful ability in natural language understanding and reasoning. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of
LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering
investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding
both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical
studies on five misinformation detection datasets show that LLMs with diverse
prompts achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection
but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation
structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation
detection. Besides, we further design four instruction-tuned strategies to
enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection.
These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple
instances or hard instances, and eliminate irrelevant propagation structures,
thereby achieving better detection performance. Extensive experiments further
demonstrate LLMs would play a better capacity in content and propagation
structure under these proposed strategies and achieve promising detection
performance. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect
misinformation.

<p class="mathjax">With the electrification in freight transportation, the availability of
fast-charging facilities becomes essential to facilitate en-route charging for
freight electric vehicles. Most studies focus on planning charging facilities
based on mathematical modeling and hypothetical scenarios. This study aims to
develop a data-driven integrated framework for fast-charging facility planning.
By leveraging the highway traffic data, we extracted, analyzed, and compared
spatial and temporal flow patterns of general traffic and freight traffic.
Furthermore, graph theory-based network evaluation methods are employed to
identify traffic nodes within the highway network that play a significant role
in accommodating charging infrastructure. A candidate selection method is
proposed to obtain potential deployment locations for charging stations and
to-go chargers. Based on this, we present a multi-period bi-objective
optimization model to provide optimal solutions for the placement of charging
facilities, with the objectives of minimizing investment cost and maximizing
demand coverage. The case study on the Amsterdam highway network shows how
existing traffic data can be used to generate more realistic charging demand
scenarios and how it can be integrated and evaluated within the optimization
framework for facility planning. The study also shows that the proposed model
can leverage the potential of early investment in improving the charging demand
coverage.

via two varied learning paradigms and demonstrate the superiority of one
learning approach with respect to localisation. Our analysis on medical and
natural datasets show that the traditional end-to-end (E2E) learning strategy
has a limited ability to localise discriminative features across multiple

learning (CL), results in more localised features. Considering localisation
accuracy, we not only show that CL outperforms E2E but that it is a promising
method of predicting regions. On the YOLO object detection framework, our best
result shows that CL outperforms the E2E scheme by $2\%$ in mAP.

<p class="mathjax">Standardized, validated questionnaires are vital tools in HCI research and
healthcare, offering dependable self-report data. However, their repeated use
in longitudinal or pre-post studies can induce respondent fatigue, impacting
data quality via response biases and decreased response rates. We propose
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse questionnaire
versions while retaining good psychometric properties. In a longitudinal study,
participants engaged with our agent system and responded daily for two weeks to
either a standardized depression questionnaire or one of two LLM-generated
questionnaire variants, alongside a validated depression questionnaire.
Psychometric testing revealed consistent covariation between the external
criterion and the focal measure administered across the three conditions,
demonstrating the reliability and validity of the LLM-generated variants.
Participants found the repeated administration of the standardized
questionnaire significantly more repetitive compared to the variants. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLM-generated variants to invigorate
questionnaires, fostering engagement and interest without compromising
validity.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal single-cell technologies enable the simultaneous collection of
diverse data types from individual cells, enhancing our understanding of
cellular states. However, the integration of these datatypes and modeling the
interrelationships between modalities presents substantial computational and
analytical challenges in disease biomarker detection and drug discovery.
Established practices rely on isolated methodologies to investigate individual
molecular aspects separately, often resulting in inaccurate analyses. To
address these obstacles, distinct Machine Learning Techniques are leveraged,
each of its own kind to model the co-variation of DNA to RNA, and finally to
surface proteins in single cells during hematopoietic stem cell development,
which simplifies understanding of underlying cellular mechanisms and immune
responses. Experiments conducted on a curated subset of a 300,000-cell time
course dataset, highlights the exceptional performance of Echo State Networks,
boasting a remarkable state-of-the-art correlation score of 0.94 and 0.895 on
Multi-omic and CiteSeq datasets. Beyond the confines of this study, these
findings hold promise for advancing comprehension of cellular differentiation
and function, leveraging the potential of Machine Learning.

<p class="mathjax">Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for
security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we
introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman
key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical
systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into
higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear
systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the
cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools
available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper
bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy.
Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the
intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our
approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on
algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a
data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data
samples of the cryptosystems.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning is an important emerging distributed training paradigm
that keeps data private on clients. It is now well understood that by
controlling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce a
backdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes.
In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness of
the trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performance
distribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where,
for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could have
disastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar to
that of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregated
model to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set of
attributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controlling
only a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL has
previously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has been
neglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be a
critical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained model
could benefit a user who participated in its training.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised environment design (UED) is a form of automatic curriculum
learning for training robust decision-making agents to zero-shot transfer into
unseen environments. Such autocurricula have received much interest from the RL
community. However, UED experiments, based on CPU rollouts and GPU model
updates, have often required several weeks of training. This compute
requirement is a major obstacle to rapid innovation for the field. This work
introduces the minimax library for UED training on accelerated hardware. Using
JAX to implement fully-tensorized environments and autocurriculum algorithms,
minimax allows the entire training loop to be compiled for hardware
acceleration. To provide a petri dish for rapid experimentation, minimax
includes a tensorized grid-world based on MiniGrid, in addition to reusable
abstractions for conducting autocurricula in procedurally-generated
environments. With these components, minimax provides strong UED baselines,
including new parallelized variants, which achieve over 120$\times$ speedups in
wall time compared to previous implementations when training with equal batch
sizes. The minimax library is available under the Apache 2.0 license at

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) is the promising privacy-preserve approach to
continually update the central machine learning (ML) model (e.g., object
detectors in edge servers) by aggregating the gradients obtained from local
observation data in distributed connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The
incentive mechanism is to incentivize individual selfish CAVs to participate in
FL towards the improvement of overall model accuracy. It is, however,
challenging to design the incentive mechanism, due to the complex correlation
between the overall model accuracy and unknown incentive sensitivity of CAVs,
especially under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data
of individual CAVs. In this paper, we propose a new learn-to-incentivize
algorithm to adaptively allocate rewards to individual CAVs under unknown
sensitivity functions. First, we gradually learn the unknown sensitivity
function of individual CAVs with accumulative observations, by using
compute-efficient Gaussian process regression (GPR). Second, we iteratively
update the reward allocation to individual CAVs with new sampled gradients,
derived from GPR. Third, we project the updated reward allocations to comply
with the total budget. We evaluate the performance of extensive simulations,
where the simulation parameters are obtained from realistic profiling of the
CIFAR-10 dataset and NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU. The results show that our proposed
algorithm substantially outperforms existing solutions, in terms of accuracy,
scalability, and adaptability.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving (AD) systems are often built and tested in a modular
fashion, where the performance of different modules is measured using
task-specific metrics. These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the
downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole.
For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to
be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it
is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various
perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy
to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs
\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically
constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box
planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA
simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that
they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their
implications for AD system deployment and testing.

<p class="mathjax">Soft random sampling (SRS) is a simple yet effective approach for efficient
training of large-scale deep neural networks when dealing with massive data.
SRS selects a subset uniformly at random with replacement from the full data
set in each epoch. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical and empirical
analysis of SRS. First, we analyze its sampling dynamics including data
coverage and occupancy. Next, we investigate its convergence with non-convex
objective functions and give the convergence rate. Finally, we provide its
generalization performance. We empirically evaluate SRS for image recognition
on CIFAR10 and automatic speech recognition on Librispeech and an in-house
payload dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness. Compared to existing
coreset-based data selection methods, SRS offers a better accuracy-efficiency
trade-off. Especially on real-world industrial scale data sets, it is shown to
be a powerful training strategy with significant speedup and competitive
performance with almost no additional computing cost.

<p class="mathjax">We study the following problem that is motivated by Blockchains where
``miners'' are serially given the monopoly for assembling transactions into the
next block. Our model has a single good that is sold repeatedly every day where
new demand for the good arrives every day. The novel element in our model is
that all unsatisfied demand from one day remains in the system and is added to
the new demand of the next day. Every day there is a new monopolist that gets
to sell a fixed supply $s$ of the good and naturally chooses to do so at the
monopolist's price for the combined demand. What will the dynamics of the
prices chosen by the sequence of monopolists be? What level of efficiency will
be obtained in the long term?
<br />We start with a non-strategic analysis of users' behavior and our main result
shows that prices keep fluctuating wildly and this is an endogenous property of
the model and happens even when demand is stable with nothing stochastic in the
model. These price fluctuations underscore the necessity of an analysis under
strategic behavior of the users, which we show results in the prices being
stable at the market equilibrium price.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for
solving various problems over graphs. In these models, the link structure of
the graph is typically exploited and nodes' embeddings are iteratively updated
based on adjacent nodes. Nodes' contents are used solely in the form of feature
vectors, served as nodes' first-layer embeddings. However, the filters or
convolutions, applied during iterations/layers to these initial embeddings lead
to their impact diminish and contribute insignificantly to the final
embeddings. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose augmenting
nodes' embeddings by embeddings generating from their content, at higher GNN
layers. More precisely, we propose models wherein a structural embedding using
a GNN and a content embedding are computed for each node. These two are
combined using a combination layer to form the embedding of a node at a given
layer. We suggest methods such as using an auto-encoder or building a content
graph, to generate content embeddings. In the end, by conducting experiments
over several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and
performance of our models.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), where smartphones, built-in
systems, wireless sensors, and nearly every smart device connect through local
networks or the internet, billions of smart things communicate with each other
and generate vast amounts of time-series data. As IoT time-series data is
high-dimensional and high-frequency, time-series classification or regression
has been a challenging issue in IoT. Recently, deep learning algorithms have
demonstrated superior performance results in time-series data classification in
many smart and intelligent IoT applications. However, it is hard to explore the
hidden dynamic patterns and trends in time-series. Recent studies show that
transforming IoT data into images improves the performance of the learning
model. In this paper, we present a review of these studies which use image
transformation/encoding techniques in IoT domain. We examine the studies
according to their encoding techniques, data types, and application areas.
Lastly, we emphasize the challenges and future dimensions of image
transformation.

<p class="mathjax">Digital network twin (DNT) is a promising paradigm to replicate real-world
cellular networks toward continual assessment, proactive management, and
what-if analysis. Existing discussions have been focusing on using only deep
learning techniques to build DNTs, which raises widespread concerns regarding
their generalization, explainability, and transparency. In this paper, we
explore an alternative approach to augment network simulators with
context-aware neural agents. The main challenge lies in the non-trivial
simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) discrepancy between offline simulators and
real-world networks. To solve the challenge, we propose a new learn-to-bridge
algorithm to cost-efficiently bridge the sim-to-real discrepancy in two
alternative stages. In the first stage, we select states to query performances
in real-world networks by using newly-designed cost-aware Bayesian
optimization. In the second stage, we train the neural agent to learn the state
context and bridge the probabilistic discrepancy based on Bayesian neural
networks (BNN). In addition, we build a small-scale end-to-end network testbed
based on OpenAirInterface RAN and Core with USRP B210 and a smartphone, and
replicate the network in NS-3. The evaluation results show that, our proposed
solution substantially outperforms existing methods, with more than 92\%
reduction in the sim-to-real discrepancy.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes a novel data-driven model capable of providing accurate
predictions for the power generation of all wind turbines in wind farms of
arbitrary layout, yaw angle configurations and wind conditions. The proposed
model functions by encoding a wind farm into a fully-connected graph and
processing the graph representation through a graph transformer. The graph
transformer surrogate is shown to generalise well and is able to uncover latent
structural patterns within the graph representation of wind farms. It is
demonstrated how the resulting surrogate model can be used to optimise yaw

accuracy to industrially-standard wind farm simulation tools while only taking

<p class="mathjax">Drone navigation through natural language commands remains a significant
challenge due to the lack of publicly available multi-modal datasets and the
intricate demands of fine-grained visual-text alignment. In response to this
pressing need, we present a new human-computer interaction annotation benchmark
called GeoText-1652, meticulously curated through a robust Large Language Model
(LLM)-based data generation framework and the expertise of pre-trained vision
models. This new dataset seamlessly extends the existing image dataset, \ie,
University-1652, with spatial-aware text annotations, encompassing intricate
image-text-bounding box associations. Besides, we introduce a new optimization
objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending
spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive
experiments reveal that our approach maintains an exceptional recall rate under
varying description complexities. This underscores the promising potential of
our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless
integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We prove that the most natural low-degree test for polynomials over finite
fields is ``robust'' in the high-error regime for linear-sized fields.
Specifically we consider the ``local'' agreement of a function $f:
\mathbb{F}_q^m \to \mathbb{F}_q$ from the space of degree-$d$ polynomials,
i.e., the expected agreement of the function from univariate degree-$d$
polynomials over a randomly chosen line in $\mathbb{F}_q^m$, and prove that if
this local agreement is $\epsilon \geq \Omega((\frac{d}{q})^\tau))$ for some
fixed $\tau &gt; 0$, then there is a global degree-$d$ polynomial $Q:
\mathbb{F}_q^m \to \mathbb{F}_q$ with agreement nearly $\epsilon$ with $f$.
This settles a long-standing open question in the area of low-degree testing,
yielding an $O(d)$-query robust test in the ``high-error'' regime (i.e., when
$\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{2}$). The previous results in this space either required
$\epsilon &gt; \frac{1}{2}$ (Polishchuk \&amp; Spielman, STOC 1994), or $q =
\Omega(d^4)$ (Arora \&amp; Sudan, Combinatorica 2003), or needed to measure local
distance on $2$-dimensional ``planes'' rather than one-dimensional lines
leading to $\Omega(d^2)$-query complexity (Raz \&amp; Safra, STOC 1997).
<br />Our analysis follows the spirit of most previous analyses in first analyzing
the low-variable case ($m = O(1)$) and then ``bootstrapping'' to general
multivariate settings. Our main technical novelty is a new analysis in the
bivariate setting that exploits a previously known connection between
multivariate factorization and finding (or testing) low-degree polynomials, in
a non ``black-box'' manner. A second contribution is a bootstrapping analysis
which manages to lift analyses for $m=2$ directly to analyses for general $m$,
where previous works needed to work with $m = 3$ or $m = 4$ -- arguably this
bootstrapping is significantly simpler than those in prior works.

<p class="mathjax">3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of
vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is
occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D
occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious
to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose
SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video
sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye
view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints
on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can
then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals
to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to
directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our
SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single
frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that
produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc
produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel
depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation
on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively. Code:

<p class="mathjax">The concept of creating a virtual copy of a complete Cyber-Physical System
opens up numerous possibilities, including real-time assessments of the
physical environment and continuous learning from the system to provide
reliable and precise information. This process, known as the twinning process
or the development of a digital twin (DT), has been widely adopted across
various industries. However, challenges arise when considering the
computational demands of implementing AI models, such as those employed in
digital twins, in real-time information exchange scenarios. This work proposes
a digital twin framework for optimal and autonomous decision-making applied to
a gas-lift process in the oil and gas industry, focusing on enhancing the
robustness and adaptability of the DT. The framework combines Bayesian
inference, Monte Carlo simulations, transfer learning, online learning, and
novel strategies to confer cognition to the DT, including model
hyperdimensional reduction and cognitive tack. Consequently, creating a
framework for efficient, reliable, and trustworthy DT identification was
possible. The proposed approach addresses the current gap in the literature
regarding integrating various learning techniques and uncertainty management in
digital twin strategies. This digital twin framework aims to provide a reliable
and efficient system capable of adapting to changing environments and
incorporating prediction uncertainty, thus enhancing the overall
decision-making process in complex, real-world scenarios. Additionally, this
work lays the foundation for further developments in digital twins for process
systems engineering, potentially fostering new advancements and applications
across various industrial sectors.

high-resolution greyscale images and multiple instance learning to overcome
adversarial binary enlargement. Current methods of visualisation-based malware
classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing
to handle the large, variable-sized images. Through empirical analysis and
experimentation, it is shown that these approaches cause crucial information
loss that can be exploited. The proposed solution divides the images into
patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a
convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for
classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit superior performance in various machine
learning tasks, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, biometric
recognition, object detection, etc. However, it is essential to analyze their
sensitivity to parameter perturbations before deploying them in real-world
applications. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against
perturbations to their weight and bias parameters. The sensitivity analysis
involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of
parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling),
and two settings (entire network and layer-wise). We perform experiments in the
context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly
available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. Based on the
sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by perturbing
parameters of the network without undergoing training. We further combine these
perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the
performance over the original model. The ensemble at the parameter-level shows
an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on
the LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to
overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, error
correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that
can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly
than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming
abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce
polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this
slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.
<br />To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model,
using which a developer can analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum
error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. We also present a set of
program-level optimizations, using which a developer can rewrite a program to
reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program
using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a
straightforward strategy.
<br />We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the
Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control
flow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations
recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime
T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on
idealized hardware.
<br />Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit
can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit
and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our
benchmarks, only 2 of 8 existing circuit optimizers recover circuits with
asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire
uses 54x to 2400x less compile time.

<p class="mathjax">Iris recognition systems, operating in the near infrared spectrum (NIR), have
demonstrated vulnerability to presentation attacks, where an adversary uses
artifacts such as cosmetic contact lenses, artificial eyes or printed iris
images in order to circumvent the system. At the same time, a number of
effective presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed.
These methods have demonstrated success in detecting artificial eyes (e.g.,
fake Van Dyke eyes) as presentation attacks. In this work, we seek to alter the
optical characteristics of artificial eyes by affixing Vanadium Dioxide (VO2)
films on their surface in various spatial configurations. VO2 films can be used
to selectively transmit NIR light and can, therefore, be used to regulate the
amount of NIR light from the object that is captured by the iris sensor. We
study the impact of such images produced by the sensor on two state-of-the-art
iris PA detection methods. We observe that the addition of VO2 films on the
surface of artificial eyes can cause the PA detection methods to misclassify
them as bonafide eyes in some cases. This represents a vulnerability that must
be systematically analyzed and effectively addressed.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from
3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as
it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than
NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D
gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no
method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization
term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene.
We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from
the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and
preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied
to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional
refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and
jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting
rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating,
compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by
manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an
editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method,
compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while
providing a better rendering quality.

<p class="mathjax">Production systems use heuristics because they are faster or scale better
than their optimal counterparts. Yet, practitioners are often unaware of the
performance gap between a heuristic and the optimum or between two heuristics
in realistic scenarios. We present MetaOpt, a system that helps analyze
heuristics. Users specify the heuristic and the optimal (or another heuristic)
as input, and MetaOpt automatically encodes these efficiently for a solver to
find performance gaps and their corresponding adversarial inputs. Its suite of
built-in optimizations helps it scale its analysis to practical problem sizes.
To show it is versatile, we used MetaOpt to analyze heuristics from three
domains (traffic engineering, vector bin packing, and packet scheduling). We
found a production traffic engineering heuristic can require 30% more capacity
than the optimal to satisfy realistic demands. Based on the patterns in the
adversarial inputs MetaOpt produced, we modified the heuristic to reduce its
performance gap by 12.5$\times$. We examined adversarial inputs to a vector bin
packing heuristic and proved a new lower bound on its performance.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic assessment of impairment and disease severity is a key challenge in
data-driven medicine. We propose a novel framework to address this challenge,
which leverages AI models trained exclusively on healthy individuals. The
COnfidence-Based chaRacterization of Anomalies (COBRA) score exploits the
decrease in confidence of these models when presented with impaired or diseased
patients to quantify their deviation from the healthy population. We applied
the COBRA score to address a key limitation of current clinical evaluation of
upper-body impairment in stroke patients. The gold-standard Fugl-Meyer
Assessment (FMA) requires in-person administration by a trained assessor for
30-45 minutes, which restricts monitoring frequency and precludes physicians
from adapting rehabilitation protocols to the progress of each patient. The
COBRA score, computed automatically in under one minute, is shown to be
strongly correlated with the FMA on an independent test cohort for two
different data modalities: wearable sensors ($\rho = 0.845$, 95% CI
[0.743,0.908]) and video ($\rho = 0.746$, 95% C.I [0.594, 0.847]). To
demonstrate the generalizability of the approach to other conditions, the COBRA
score was also applied to quantify severity of knee osteoarthritis from
magnetic-resonance imaging scans, again achieving significant correlation with
an independent clinical assessment ($\rho = 0.644$, 95% C.I [0.585,0.696]).

<p class="mathjax">Since the launch of ChatGPT, a powerful AI Chatbot developed by OpenAI, large
language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in both academia and
industry, bringing about a fundamental engineering paradigm shift in many
areas. While LLMs are powerful, it is also crucial to best use their power
where "prompt'' plays a core role. However, the booming LLMs themselves,
including excellent APIs like ChatGPT, have several inherent limitations: 1)
temporal lag of training data, and 2) the lack of physical capabilities to
perform external actions. Recently, we have observed the trend of utilizing
prompt-based tools to better utilize the power of LLMs for downstream tasks,
but a lack of systematic literature and standardized terminology, partly due to
the rapid evolution of this field. Therefore, in this work, we survey related
prompting tools and promote the concept of the "Prompting Framework" (PF), i.e.
the framework for managing, simplifying, and facilitating interaction with
large language models. We define the lifecycle of the PF as a hierarchical
structure, from bottom to top, namely: Data Level, Base Level, Execute Level,
and Service Level. We also systematically depict the overall landscape of the
emerging PF field and discuss potential future research and challenges. To
continuously track the developments in this area, we maintain a repository at
https://github.com/lxx0628/Prompting-Framework-Survey, which can be a useful
resource sharing platform for both academic and industry in this field.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for
developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems,
including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear
importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters
the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does
fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing
ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings
where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and
probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We
perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings,
and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities;
(ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned
on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they
have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden
capabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the
capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few
gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a
model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially
unrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models
trained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic
setup.

<p class="mathjax">Intrinsic decomposition is a fundamental mid-level vision problem that plays
a crucial role in various inverse rendering and computational photography
pipelines. Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently
under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued
shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic
decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense
ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to
estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the
intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations
using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global
coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate
decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the
albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for
generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and
multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We
present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted
intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world applicability of our estimations by performing otherwise
difficult editing tasks such as recoloring and relighting.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of large multi-modal models (LMMs), efficient modality alignment
is crucial yet often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality image-text
data. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the ShareGPT4V dataset, a
pioneering large-scale resource featuring 1.2 million highly descriptive
captions, which surpasses existing datasets in diversity and information
content, covering world knowledge, object properties, spatial relationships,
and aesthetic evaluations. Specifically, ShareGPT4V originates from a curated
100K high-quality captions collected from advanced GPT4-Vision and has been
expanded to 1.2M with a superb caption model trained on this subset. ShareGPT4V
first demonstrates its effectiveness for the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
phase, by substituting an equivalent quantity of detailed captions in existing
SFT datasets with a subset of our high-quality captions, significantly
enhancing the LMMs like LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-1.5-13B, and Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on the MME
and MMBench benchmarks, with respective gains of 222.8/22.0/22.3 and
2.7/1.3/1.5. We further incorporate ShareGPT4V data into both the pre-training
and SFT phases, obtaining ShareGPT4V-7B, a superior LMM based on a simple
architecture that has remarkable performance across a majority of the
multi-modal benchmarks. This project is available at
https://ShareGPT4V.github.io to serve as a pivotal resource for advancing the
LMMs community.

<p class="mathjax">3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes is a long-standing problem in computer
graphics and increasingly difficult the less information is available.
Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry
from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular
camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings.
Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy
or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT
reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model
that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a
regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh
enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video
sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to
extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as
stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain
a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime
by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based
SfT approach.

mortar-and-brick location. This is the first step in a sale. By measuring
visits and sales, the original marketers can determine their return on
advertising and they can prove the efficacy of the marketing investments. We
turn our attention to the measure of lift: we define it as the visit
acceleration during the campaign flight with respect to a controlled baseline.
We present a theoretical description; we describe a general and a simplified
approach in composing the exposed and the control baseline; we develop two
different vertical approaches with different comparable solutions; finally, we
present how to carry the experiments and the measures for a few dozens
campaigns; these campaigns range from hundred thousands devices and counting a
few hundred visits to a handful locations, to sixty million devices and
counting million visits to thousands locations. We care about experiments at
scale.

<p class="mathjax">The quantum image segmentation algorithm is to divide a quantum image into
several parts, but most of the existing algorithms use more quantum
resource(qubit) or cannot process the complex image. In this paper, an improved
two-threshold quantum segmentation algorithm for NEQR image is proposed, which
can segment the complex gray-scale image into a clear ternary image by using
fewer qubits and can be scaled to use n thresholds for n + 1 segmentations. In
addition, a feasible quantum comparator is designed to distinguish the
gray-scale values with two thresholds, and then a scalable quantum circuit is
designed to segment the NEQR image. For a 2^(n)*2^(n) image with q gray-scale
levels, the quantum cost of our algorithm can be reduced to 60q-6, which is
lower than other existing quantum algorithms and does not increase with the
image's size increases. The experiment on IBM Q demonstrates that our algorithm
can effectively segment the image.

<p class="mathjax">Structure-based drug design (SBDD) stands at the forefront of drug discovery,
emphasizing the creation of molecules that target specific binding pockets.
Recent advances in this area have witnessed the adoption of deep generative
models and geometric deep learning techniques, modeling SBDD as a conditional
generation task where the target structure serves as context. Historically,
evaluation of these models centered on docking scores, which quantitatively
depict the predicted binding affinity between a molecule and its target pocket.
Though state-of-the-art models purport that a majority of their generated
ligands exceed the docking score of ground truth ligands in test sets, it begs
the question: Do these scores align with real-world biological needs? In this
paper, we introduce the delta score, a novel evaluation metric grounded in
tangible pharmaceutical requisites. Our experiments reveal that molecules
produced by current deep generative models significantly lag behind ground
truth reference ligands when assessed with the delta score. This novel metric
not only complements existing benchmarks but also provides a pivotal direction
for subsequent research in the domain.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and robust drug response prediction is of utmost importance in
precision medicine. Although many models have been developed to utilize the
representations of drugs and cancer cell lines for predicting cancer drug
responses (CDR), their performances can be improved by addressing issues such
as insufficient data modality, suboptimal fusion algorithms, and poor
generalizability for novel drugs or cell lines. We introduce TransCDR, which
uses transfer learning to learn drug representations and fuses multi-modality
features of drugs and cell lines by a self-attention mechanism, to predict the
IC50 values or sensitive states of drugs on cell lines. We are the first to
systematically evaluate the generalization of the CDR prediction model to novel
(i.e., never-before-seen) compound scaffolds and cell line clusters. TransCDR
shows better generalizability than 8 state-of-the-art models. TransCDR
outperforms its 5 variants that train drug encoders (i.e., RNN and AttentiveFP)
from scratch under various scenarios. The most critical contributors among
multiple drug notations and omics profiles are Extended Connectivity
Fingerprint and genetic mutation. Additionally, the attention-based fusion
module further enhances the predictive performance of TransCDR. TransCDR,
trained on the GDSC dataset, demonstrates strong predictive performance on the
external testing set CCLE. It is also utilized to predict missing CDRs on GDSC.
Moreover, we investigate the biological mechanisms underlying drug response by
classifying 7,675 patients from TCGA into drug-sensitive or drug-resistant
groups, followed by a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. TransCDR emerges as a
potent tool with significant potential in drug response prediction. The source
code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/XiaoqiongXia/TransCDR.

<p class="mathjax">Although fabrication capabilities of Silicon Dangling Bonds have rapidly
advanced from manual labor-driven laboratory work to automated manufacturing in
just recent years, sub-nanometer substrate defects still pose a hindrance to
production due to the need for atomic precision. In essence, unpassivated or
missing surface atoms, contaminants, and structural deformations disturb the
fabricated logic or prevent its realization altogether. Moreover, design
automation techniques in this domain have not yet adopted any defect-aware
behavior to circumvent the present obstacles. In this paper, we derive a
surface defect model for design automation from experimentally verified defect
types that we apply to identify sensitivities in an established gate library in
an effort to generate more robust designs. Furthermore, we present an automatic
placement and routing algorithm that considers scanning tunneling microscope
data obtained from physical experiments to lay out dot-accurate circuitry that
is resilient against the presence of atomic surface defects. This culminates in
a holistic evaluation on surface data of varying defect rates that enables us
to quantify the severity of such defects. We project that fabrication
capabilities must achieve defect rates of around 0.1 %, if charged defects can
be completely eliminated, or &lt; 0.1 %, otherwise. This realization sets the pace
for future efforts to scale up this promising circuit technology.

<p class="mathjax">Single image super-resolution (SISR) is an effective technique to improve the
quality of low-resolution thermal images. Recently, transformer-based methods
have achieved significant performance in SISR. However, in the SR task, only a
small number of pixels are involved in the transformers self-attention (SA)
mechanism due to the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. The
lambda abstraction is a promising alternative to SA in modeling long-range
interactions while being computationally more efficient. This paper presents
lambda abstraction-based thermal image super-resolution (LATIS), a novel
lightweight architecture for SISR of thermal images. LATIS sequentially
captures local and global information using the local and global feature block
(LGFB). In LGFB, we introduce a global feature extraction (GFE) module based on
the lambda abstraction mechanism, channel-shuffle and convolution (CSConv)
layer to encode local context. Besides, to improve the performance further, we
propose a differentiable patch-wise histogram-based loss function. Experimental
results demonstrate that our LATIS, with the least model parameters and
complexity, achieves better or comparable performance with state-of-the-art
methods across multiple datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in producing
high-quality images for medical image translation to aid disease diagnosis,
localization, and treatment. Nevertheless, current diffusion models have
limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately
preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired
datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to
reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can
lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we
introduced a frequency-decoupled diffusion model (FDDM), a novel framework that
decouples the frequency components of medical images in the Fourier domain
during the translation process, to allow structure-preserved high-quality image
conversion. FDDM applies an unsupervised frequency conversion module to
translate the source medical images into frequency-specific outputs and then
uses the frequency-specific information to guide a following diffusion model
for final source-to-target image translation. We conducted extensive
evaluations of FDDM using a public brain MR-to-CT translation dataset, showing
its superior performance against other GAN-, VAE-, and diffusion-based models.
Metrics including the Frechet inception distance (FID), the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) were assessed. FDDM achieves an FID of 29.88, less than half of the
second best. These results demonstrated FDDM's prowess in generating
highly-realistic target-domain images while maintaining the faithfulness of
translated anatomical structures.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) methods combine forward
and noise models with simple object priors. Recent application of deep learning
methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to
addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled
measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid
supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT)
image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity
or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to
simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists
of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in
parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined.
Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image
reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo
Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our
experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors
and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical
priors. Our results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
framework compared to recent low-dose CT reconstruction methods.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) undersampling reconstruction, but their requirement for paired
data limits their generalizability to the diverse MRI acquisition parameters.
Recently, unsupervised controllable generative diffusion models have been
applied to MRI undersampling reconstruction, without paired data or model
retraining for different MRI acquisitions. However, diffusion models are
generally slow in sampling and state-of-the-art acceleration techniques can
lead to sub-optimal results when directly applied to the controllable
generation process. This study introduces a new algorithm called
Predictor-Projector-Noisor (PPN), which enhances and accelerates controllable
generation of diffusion models for MRI undersampling reconstruction. Our
results demonstrate that PPN produces high-fidelity MR images that conform to
undersampled k-space measurements with significantly shorter reconstruction
time than other controllable sampling methods. In addition, the unsupervised
PPN accelerated diffusion models are adaptable to different MRI acquisition
parameters, making them more practical for clinical use than supervised
learning techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised anomaly detection is a popular approach for the analysis of
neuroimaging data as it allows to identify a wide variety of anomalies from
unlabelled data. It relies on building a subject-specific model of healthy
appearance to which a subject's image can be compared to detect anomalies. In
the literature, it is common for anomaly detection to rely on analysing the
residual image between the subject's image and its pseudo-healthy
reconstruction. This approach however has limitations partly due to the
pseudo-healthy reconstructions being imperfect and to the lack of natural
thresholding mechanism. Our proposed method, inspired by Z-scores, leverages
the healthy population variability to overcome these limitations. Our
experiments conducted on FDG PET scans from the ADNI database demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying Alzheimer's disease
related anomalies.

<p class="mathjax">Accelerating compute intensive non-real-time beam-forming algorithms in
ultrasound imaging using deep learning architectures has been gaining momentum
in the recent past. Nonetheless, the complexity of the state-of-the-art deep
learning techniques poses challenges for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel vision transformer based tiny
beamformer (Tiny-VBF), which works on the raw radio-frequency channel data
acquired through single-angle plane wave insonification. The output of our
Tiny-VBF provides fast envelope detection requiring very low frame rate, i.e.
0.34 GOPs/Frame for a frame size of 368 x 128 in comparison to the
state-of-the-art deep learning models. It also exhibited an 8% increase in
contrast and gains of 5% and 33% in axial and lateral resolution respectively
when compared to Tiny-CNN on in-vitro dataset. Additionally, our model showed a
4.2% increase in contrast and gains of 4% and 20% in axial and lateral
resolution respectively when compared against conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS)
beamformer. We further propose an accelerator architecture and implement our
Tiny-VBF model on a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA using a hybrid
quantization scheme with 50% less resource consumption compared to the
floating-point implementation, while preserving the image quality.

epistemic uncertainty for 3D medical image-to-image translation. We propose a
novel model uncertainty quantification method, Multi-Axis Fusion (MAF), which
relies on the integration of complementary information derived from multiple
views on volumetric image data. The proposed approach is applied to the task of
synthesizing contrast enhanced T1-weighted images based on native T1, T2 and
T2-FLAIR scans. The quantitative findings indicate a strong correlation
($\rho_{\text healthy} = 0.89$) between the mean absolute image synthetization
error and the mean uncertainty score for our MAF method. Hence, we consider MAF
as a promising approach to solve the highly relevant task of detecting
synthetization failures at inference time.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine
learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently
started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant
metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical
case, one such examples is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the
quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the classical capacity of
the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this
proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than
their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence and
entanglement. Finally, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to
characterize the physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative
models.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional smart meter measurements lack the granularity needed for
real-time decision-making. To address this practical problem, we create a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) model that enforces temporal consistency
on its high-resolution outputs via hard inequality constraints using a convex
optimization layer. A unique feature of our GAN model is that it is trained
solely on slow timescale aggregated power information obtained from historical
smart meter data. The results demonstrate that the model can successfully
create minutely interval temporally-correlated instantaneous power injection
profiles from 15-minute average power consumption information. This innovative
approach, emphasizing inter-neuron constraints, offers a promising avenue for
improved high-speed state estimation in distribution systems and enhances the
applicability of data-driven solutions for monitoring such systems.

<p class="mathjax">Given measurements from sensors and a set of standard forces, an optimization
based approach to identify weakness in structures is introduced. The key
novelty lies in letting the load and measurements to be random variables.
Subsequently the conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) is minimized subject to the
elasticity equations as constraints. CVaR is a risk measure that leads to
minimization of rare and low probability events which the standard expectation
cannot. The optimization variable is the (deterministic) strength factor which
appears as a coefficient in the elasticity equation, thus making the problem
nonconvex. Due to uncertainty, the problem is high dimensional and, due to
CVaR, the problem is nonsmooth. An adjoint based approach is developed with
quadrature in the random variables. Numerical results are presented in the
context of a plate, a large structure with trusses similar to those used in
solar arrays or cranes, and a footbridge.

<p class="mathjax">Tensor algebras give rise to one of the most powerful measures of similarity
for sequences of arbitrary length called the signature kernel accompanied with
attractive theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. Previous algorithms
to compute the signature kernel scale quadratically in terms of the length and
the number of the sequences. To mitigate this severe computational bottleneck,
we develop a random Fourier feature-based acceleration of the signature kernel
acting on the inherently non-Euclidean domain of sequences. We show uniform
approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature
kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number.
In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two
even more scalable time series features with favourable concentration
properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical
results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible
price in terms of accuracy on moderate-sized datasets, and it enables one to
scale to large datasets up to a million time series.

<p class="mathjax">One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for
evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars
exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water.
A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively
recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this
work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing
"Brain Coral" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and
scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a
consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels)
from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at
resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over
52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we
found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a
classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take
advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a
discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full
spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while
cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the
segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely
processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys
to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the
spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are
available on Github for the community to explore and build upon.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to detect macroscopic changes is important for probing the
behaviors of experimental many-body systems from the classical to the quantum
realm. Although abrupt changes near phase boundaries can easily be detected,
subtle macroscopic changes are much more difficult to detect as the changes can
be obscured by noise. In this study, as a toy model for detecting subtle
macroscopic changes in many-body systems, we try to differentiate scalar field
samples at varying temperatures. We compare different methods for making such
differentiations, from physics method, statistics method, to AI method. Our
finding suggests that the AI method outperforms both the statistical method and
the physics method in its sensitivity. Our result provides a proof-of-concept
that AI can potentially detect macroscopic changes in many-body systems that
elude physical measures.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel approach to neuromorphic audio processing by
integrating the strengths of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Transformers, and
high-performance computing (HPC) into the HPCNeuroNet architecture. Utilizing
the Intel N-DNS dataset, we demonstrate the system's capability to process
diverse human vocal recordings across multiple languages and noise backgrounds.
The core of our approach lies in the fusion of the temporal dynamics of SNNs
with the attention mechanisms of Transformers, enabling the model to capture
intricate audio patterns and relationships. Our architecture, HPCNeuroNet,
employs the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for time-frequency
representation, Transformer embeddings for dense vector generation, and SNN
encoding/decoding mechanisms for spike train conversions. The system's
performance is further enhanced by leveraging the computational capabilities of
NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 GPU and Intel's Core i9 12900H CPU. Additionally, we
introduce a hardware implementation on the Xilinx VU37P HBM FPGA platform,
optimizing for energy efficiency and real-time processing. The proposed
accelerator achieves a throughput of 71.11 Giga-Operations Per Second (GOP/s)
with a 3.55 W on-chip power consumption at 100 MHz. The comparison results with
off-the-shelf devices and recent state-of-the-art implementations illustrate
that the proposed accelerator has obvious advantages in terms of energy
efficiency and design flexibility. Through design-space exploration, we provide
insights into optimizing core capacities for audio tasks. Our findings
underscore the transformative potential of integrating SNNs, Transformers, and
HPC for neuromorphic audio processing, setting a new benchmark for future
research and applications.

<p class="mathjax">Synthesizing medical images while preserving their structural information is
crucial in medical research. In such scenarios, the preservation of anatomical
content becomes especially important. Although recent advances have been made
by incorporating instance-level information to guide translation, these methods
overlook the spatial coherence of structural-level representation and the
anatomical invariance of content during translation. To address these issues,
we introduce hierarchical granularity discrimination, which exploits various
levels of semantic information present in medical images. Our strategy utilizes
three levels of discrimination granularity: pixel-level discrimination using a
Brain Memory Bank, structure-level discrimination on each brain structure with
a re-weighting strategy to focus on hard samples, and global-level
discrimination to ensure anatomical consistency during translation. The image
translation performance of our strategy has been evaluated on three independent
datasets (UK Biobank, IXI, and BraTS 2018), and it has outperformed
state-of-the-art algorithms. Particularly, our model excels not only in
synthesizing normal structures but also in handling abnormal (pathological)
structures, such as brain tumors, despite the variations in contrast observed
across different imaging modalities due to their pathological characteristics.
The diagnostic value of synthesized MR images containing brain tumors has been
evaluated by radiologists. This indicates that our model may offer an
alternative solution in scenarios where specific MR modalities of patients are
unavailable. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the versatility of our
method, providing unique insights into medical image translation.

<p class="mathjax">The tasks of automatic lyrics transcription and lyrics alignment have
witnessed significant performance improvements in the past few years. However,
most of the previous works only focus on English in which large-scale datasets
are available. In this paper, we address lyrics transcription and alignment of
polyphonic Mandarin pop music in a low-resource setting. To deal with the data
scarcity issue, we adapt pretrained Whisper model and fine-tune it on a
monophonic Mandarin singing dataset. With the use of data augmentation and
source separation model, results show that the proposed method achieves a
character error rate of less than 18% on a Mandarin polyphonic dataset for
lyrics transcription, and a mean absolute error of 0.071 seconds for lyrics
alignment. Our results demonstrate the potential of adapting a pretrained

<p class="mathjax">Aerodynamic drag can be partially approximated by the entropy flux across
fluid domain boundaries with a formula due to Oswatitsch. In this paper, we
build the adjoint solution that corresponds to this representation of the drag
and investigate its relation to the entropy variables, which are linked to the
integrated residual of the entropy transport equation. For inviscid isentropic
flows, the resulting adjoint variables are identical to the entropy variables,
an observation originally due to Fidkowski and Roe, while for non-isentropic
flows there is a significant difference that is explicitly demonstrated with
analytic solutions in the shocked quasi-1D case. Both approaches are also
investigated for viscous and inviscid flows in two and three dimensions, where
the adjoint equations and boundary conditions are derived. The application of
both approaches to mesh adaptation is investigated, with especial emphasis on
inviscid flows with shocks.

<p class="mathjax">It has been long known that 2D and 3D inviscid adjoint solutions are
generically singular at sharp trailing edges. In this paper, a concurrent
effect is described by which wall boundary values of 2D and 3D inviscid
continuous and discrete adjoint solutions based on lift and drag are strongly
mesh dependent and do not converge as the mesh is refined. Various numerical
tests are performed to characterize the problem. Lift-based adjoint solutions
are found to be affected for any flow condition, whereas drag-based adjoint
solutions are affected for transonic lifting flows. A (laminar) viscous case is
examined as well, but no comparable behavior is found, which suggests that the
issue is exclusive to inviscid flows. It is argued that this behavior is caused
by the trailing edge adjoint singularity.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques have been recently
proposed for dealing with simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods.
Unlike approximate Bayesian computation, SNPE techniques learn the posterior
from sequential simulation using neural network-based conditional density
estimators. This paper reclaims SNPE-B proposed by Lueckmann et al. (2017),
which suffers from inefficiency and slow inference due to inefficient
utilization of simulated data and high variance of parameter updates. To
address these issues, we firstly introduce a concentrated loss function based
on an adaptive calibration kernel that reweights the simulated data
appropriately to improve the data efficiency. Moreover, we provide a
theoretical analysis of the variance of associated Monte Carlo estimators.
Based on this analysis, we then propose several variance reduction techniques
to further accelerate the process of learning. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms the original method together with other
existing competitors on certain tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Although deep learning models have become the main method for medical image
segmentation, they often cannot be extended to unknown segmentation tasks
involving new anatomical structures, image shapes, or labels. For new
segmentation tasks, researchers often have to retrain or fine-tune the model,
which is time-consuming and poses a significant obstacle to clinical
researchers, who often lack the resources and professional knowledge to train
neural networks. Therefore, we proposed a general method that can solve unknown
medical image segmentation tasks without requiring additional training. Given
an example set of images and prompts for defining new segmentation tasks,
GMISeg applies a novel low-rank fine-tuning strategy based on the proposed
approach to the SAM (Segment Anything Model) image encoder, and works with the
prompt encoder and mask decoder to fine-tune the labeled dataset without the
need for additional training. To achieve generalization of new tasks, we used
medical image datasets with different imaging modes for different parts. We
trained and generalized GMISeg on a different set of anatomical and imaging
modes using cardiac images on other site datasets. We have demonstrated that
GMISeg outperforms the latest methods on unknown tasks and have conducted a
comprehensive analysis and summary of the important performance of the proposed
method.

multi-branch HoVerNet framework for nuclei instance segmentation and

<p class="mathjax">The LIGO, VIRGO and KAGRA Gravitational-wave (GW) observatories are getting
ready for their fourth observational period, O4, scheduled to begin in March
2023, with improved sensitivities and thus higher event rates. GW-related
computing has both large commonalities with HEP computing, particularly in the
domain of offline data processing and analysis, and important differences, for
example in the fact that the amount of raw data doesn't grow much with the
instrument sensitivity, or the need to timely generate and distribute "event
candidate alerts" to EM and neutrino observatories, thus making gravitational
multi-messenger astronomy possible. Data from the interferometers are exchanged
between collaborations both for low-latency and offline processing; in recent
years, the three collaborations designed and built a common distributed
computing infrastructure to prepare for a growing computing demand, and to
reduce the maintenance burden of legacy custom-made tools, by increasingly
adopting tools and architectures originally developed in the context of HEP
computing. So, for example, HTCondor is used for workflow management, Rucio for
many data management needs, CVMFS for code and data distribution, and more. We
will present GW computing use cases and report about the architecture of the
computing infrastructure as will be used during O4, as well as some planned
upgrades for the subsequent observing run O5.

<p class="mathjax">In multi-lingual societies, where multiple languages are spoken in a small
geographic vicinity, informal conversations often involve mix of languages.
Existing speech technologies may be inefficient in extracting information from
such conversations, where the speech data is rich in diversity with multiple
languages and speakers. The DISPLACE (DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in
Conversational Environments) challenge constitutes an open-call for evaluating
and bench-marking the speaker and language diarization technologies on this
challenging condition. The challenge entailed two tracks: Track-1 focused on
speaker diarization (SD) in multilingual situations while, Track-2 addressed
the language diarization (LD) in a multi-speaker scenario. Both the tracks were
evaluated using the same underlying audio data. To facilitate this evaluation,
a real-world dataset featuring multilingual, multi-speaker conversational
far-field speech was recorded and distributed. Furthermore, a baseline system
was made available for both SD and LD task which mimicked the state-of-art in
these tasks. The challenge garnered a total of $42$ world-wide registrations
and received a total of $19$ combined submissions for Track-1 and Track-2. This
paper describes the challenge, details of the datasets, tasks, and the baseline
system. Additionally, the paper provides a concise overview of the submitted
systems in both tracks, with an emphasis given to the top performing systems.
The paper also presents insights and future perspectives for SD and LD tasks,
focusing on the key challenges that the systems need to overcome before
wide-spread commercial deployment on such conversations.

<p class="mathjax">The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes.
While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades,
experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory
elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging.
This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a
paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although
various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ
between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental
challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of
the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language
models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful
downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from
current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but
only capture limited information about long-range features. BEND is available
at https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND.

<p class="mathjax">Big data and large-scale machine learning have had a profound impact on
science and engineering, particularly in fields focused on forecasting and
prediction. Yet, it is still not clear how we can use the superior pattern
matching abilities of machine learning models for scientific discovery. This is
because the goals of machine learning and science are generally not aligned. In
addition to being accurate, scientific theories must also be causally
consistent with the underlying physical process and allow for human analysis,
reasoning, and manipulation to advance the field. In this paper, we present a
case study on discovering a new symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from
data using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection,
and symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal
features from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while
selecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic
regression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that
retains the neural network's predictive capabilities, while allowing for
interpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model
reproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and
achieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory. This
showcases how machine learning can facilitate inductive scientific discovery,
and paves the way for more accurate rogue wave forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">Skin lesion segmentation is of great significance for skin lesion analysis
and subsequent treatment. It is still a challenging task due to the irregular
and fuzzy lesion borders, and diversity of skin lesions. In this paper, we
propose Triple-UNet to automatically segment skin lesions. It is an organic
combination of three UNet architectures with suitable modules. In order to
concatenate the first and second sub-networks more effectively, we design a
region of interest enhancement module (ROIE). The ROIE enhances the target
object region of the image by using the predicted score map of the first UNet.
The features learned by the first UNet and the enhanced image help the second
UNet obtain a better score map. Finally, the results are fine-tuned by the
third UNet. We evaluate our algorithm on a publicly available dataset of skin
lesion segmentation. Experiments show that Triple-UNet outperforms the
state-of-the-art on skin lesion segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Cardiovascular diseases stand as the primary global cause of mortality. Among
the various imaging techniques available for visualising the heart and
evaluating its function, echocardiograms emerge as the preferred choice due to
their safety and low cost. Quantifying cardiac function based on
echocardiograms is very laborious, time-consuming and subject to high
interoperator variability. In this work, we introduce EchoAI, an echocardiogram
foundation model, that is trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on 1.5
million echocardiograms. We evaluate our approach by fine-tuning EchoAI to
estimate the ejection fraction achieving a mean absolute percentage error of
9.40%. This level of accuracy aligns with the performance of expert
sonographers.

the right-tail probabilities of continuous random variables with unbounded
support and with semi-bounded support from the left. The presented upper and
lower right-tail bounds depend only on the probability density function (PDF),
its first derivative, and two parameters that are used for tightening the
bounds. These tail bounds hold under certain conditions that depend on the PDF,
its first and second derivatives, and the two parameters. The new tail bounds
are shown to be tight for a wide range of continuous random variables via
numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Koopman operator theory, a data-driven dynamical systems framework, has found
significant success in learning models from complex, real-world data sets,
enabling state-of-the-art prediction and control. The greater interpretability
and lower computational costs of these models, compared to traditional machine
learning methodologies, make Koopman learning an especially appealing approach.
Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with
the ability to learn from its own mistakes. To address this, we equip Koopman
methods - developed for predicting non-stationary time-series - with an
episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods
in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic
implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant
improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data. Our framework has
considerable potential for expansion, allowing for future advances, and opens
exciting new directions for Koopman learning.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning with neural networks is now becoming a more and more
powerful tool for various tasks, such as natural language processing, image
recognition, winning the game, and even for the issues of physics. Although
there are many studies on the application of machine learning to numerical
calculation and the assistance of experimental detection, the methods of
applying machine learning to find the analytical method are poorly studied. In
this paper, we propose the frameworks of developing analytical methods in
physics by using the symbolic regression with the Alpha Zero algorithm, that is
Alpha Zero for physics (AZfP). As a demonstration, we show that AZfP can derive
the high-frequency expansion in the Floquet systems. AZfP may have the
possibility of developing a new theoretical framework in physics.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum annealing (QA) holds promise for optimization problems in quantum
computing, especially for combinatorial optimization. This analog framework
attracts attention for its potential to address complex problems. Its
gate-based homologous, QAOA with proven performance, has brought lots of
attention to the NISQ era. Several numerical benchmarks try to classify these
two metaheuristics however, classical computational power highly limits the
performance insights. In this work, we introduce a new parametrized version of
QA enabling a precise 1-local analysis of the algorithm. We develop a tight
Lieb-Robinson bound for regular graphs, achieving the best-known numerical
value to analyze QA locally. Studying MaxCut over cubic graph as a benchmark
optimization problem, we show that a linear-schedule QA with a 1-local analysis
achieves an approximation ratio over 0.7020, outperforming any known 1-local
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Thermodynamic computing exploits fluctuations and dissipation in physical
systems to efficiently solve various mathematical problems. For example, it was
recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved
thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix
dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully
explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here
we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with
applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple
electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration
can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an
asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the
concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that
thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of
computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic
advantage more generally.

<p class="mathjax">Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in low-level computer
vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution
counterparts. Conventional attention mechanisms have significantly improved
SISR performance but often result in complex network structures and large
number of parameters, leading to slow inference speed and large model size. To
address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network
(SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference
speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention
mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual
connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant
information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this
design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on
multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient
super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed,
achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly
suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios. Notably, our model attains the best PSNR of 27.09 dB, and the test
runtime of our team is reduced by 7.08ms in the NTIRE 2023 efficient
super-resolution challenge. Our code and models are made publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a system for solving binary-valued linear equations using
quantum computers. The system is called Mod2VQLS, which stands for Modulo2
Variational Quantum Linear Solver. As far as we know, this is the first such
proposal. The design is a classical-quantum hybrid. The quantum components are
a new circuit design for implementing matrix multiplication modulo 2, and a
variational circuit to be optimized. The classical components are the optimizer
which measures the cost function and updates the quantum parameters for each
iteration, and the controller that runs the quantum job and classical optimizer
iterations. We propose two alternative ansatze or templates for the variational
circuit, and present results showing that the rotation ansatz designed
specifically for this problem provides the most direct path to a valid
solution. Numerical experiments in low dimensions indicate that Mod2VQLS, using
the custom rotations ansatz, is on-a-par with the block Wiedemann algorithm,
the best-known to date for this problem.

<p class="mathjax">There is growing interest in improving our algorithmic understanding of
fundamental statistical problems such as mean estimation, driven by the goal of
understanding the limits of what we can extract from valuable data. The state
of the art results for mean estimation in $\mathbb{R}$ are 1) the optimal
sub-Gaussian mean estimator by [LV22], with the tight sub-Gaussian constant for
all distributions with finite but unknown variance, and 2) the analysis of the
median-of-means algorithm by [BCL13] and a lower bound by [DLLO16],
characterizing the big-O optimal errors for distributions for which only a
$1+\alpha$ moment exists for $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Both results, however, are
optimal only in the worst case. We initiate the fine-grained study of the mean
estimation problem: Can algorithms leverage useful features of the input
distribution to beat the sub-Gaussian rate, without explicit knowledge of such
features?
<br />We resolve this question with an unexpectedly nuanced answer: "Yes in limited
regimes, but in general no". For any distribution $p$ with a finite mean, we
construct a distribution $q$ whose mean is well-separated from $p$'s, yet $p$
and $q$ are not distinguishable with high probability, and $q$ further
preserves $p$'s moments up to constants. The main consequence is that no
reasonable estimator can asymptotically achieve better than the sub-Gaussian
error rate for any distribution, matching the worst-case result of [LV22]. More
generally, we introduce a new definitional framework to analyze the
fine-grained optimality of algorithms, which we call "neighborhood optimality",
interpolating between the unattainably strong "instance optimality" and the
trivially weak "admissibility" definitions. Applying the new framework, we show
that median-of-means is neighborhood optimal, up to constant factors. It is
open to find a neighborhood-optimal estimator without constant factor
slackness.
