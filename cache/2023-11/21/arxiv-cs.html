<p class="mathjax">Conventional semiconductor-based integrated circuits are gradually
approaching fundamental scaling limits. Many prospective solutions have
recently emerged to supplement or replace both the technology on which basic
devices are built and the architecture of data processing. Neuromorphic
circuits are a promising approach to computing where techniques used by the
brain to achieve high efficiency are exploited. Many existing neuromorphic
circuits rely on unconventional and useful properties of novel technologies to
better mimic the operation of the brain. One such technology is single flux
quantum (SFQ) logic -- a cryogenic superconductive technology in which the data
are represented by quanta of magnetic flux (fluxons) produced and processed by
Josephson junctions embedded within inductive loops. The movement of a fluxon
within a circuit produces a quantized voltage pulse (SFQ pulse), resembling a
neuronal spiking event. These circuits routinely operate at clock frequencies
of tens to hundreds of gigahertz, making SFQ a natural technology for
processing high frequency pulse trains.
<br />Prior proposals for SFQ neural networks often require energy-expensive fluxon
conversions, involve heterogeneous technologies, or exclusively focus on device
level behavior. In this paper, a design methodology for deep single flux
quantum neuromorphic networks is presented. Synaptic and neuronal circuits
based on SFQ technology are presented and characterized. Based on these
primitives, a deep neuromorphic XOR network is evaluated as a case study, both
at the architectural and circuit levels, achieving wide classification margins.
The proposed methodology does not employ unconventional superconductive devices
or semiconductor transistors. The resulting networks are tunable by an external
current, making this proposed system an effective approach for scalable
cryogenic neuromorphic computing.

<p class="mathjax">Smartphones are integral to our daily lives and activities, providing us with
basic functions like texting and phone calls to more complex motion-based
functionalities like navigation, mobile gaming, and fitness-tracking. To
facilitate these functionalities, smartphones rely on integrated sensors like
accelerometers and gyroscopes. These sensors provide personalized measurements
that, in turn, contribute to tasks such as analyzing biometric data for mobile
health purposes. In addition to benefiting smartphone users, biometric data
holds significant value for researchers engaged in biometric identification
research. Nonetheless, utilizing this user data for biometric identification
tasks, such as gait and gender recognition, raises serious privacy, normative,
and ethical concerns, particularly within the queer community. Concerns of
algorithmic bias and algorithmically-driven dysphoria surface from a historical
backdrop of marginalization, surveillance, harassment, discrimination, and
violence against the queer community. In this position paper, we contribute to
the timely discourse on safeguarding human rights within AI-driven systems by
providing a sense of challenges, tensions, and opportunities for new data
protections and biometric collection practices in a way that grapples with the
sociotechnical realities of the queer community.

<p class="mathjax">Immersive technologies (ImT), like Virtual Reality (VR), have several
potential applications in the construction industry. However, the absence of a
cost-benefit analysis discourages construction decision-makers from
implementing these technologies. In this study, we proposed a primary model for
conducting a cost-benefit analysis for implementing virtual reality in
construction companies. The cost and benefit factors were identified through a
literature review and considered input variables for the model, and then using
synthetic data, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to generate a
distribution of outcome. Given the uncertainty in input parameters, this
distribution reflected the potential range of total net benefit. Considering
synthetic data and input factors obtained only through literature and
assumptions, VR implementation could be a promising decision based on the
results. This study's results would benefit decision-makers in construction
companies about the costs and benefits of implementing VR and other researchers
interested in this field.

<p class="mathjax">Spreadsheets are one of the most widely used tools for end users. As a
result, spreadsheets such as Excel are now included in many curricula. However,
digital solutions for assessing spreadsheet assignments are still scarce in the
teaching context. Therefore, we have developed an Intelligent Tutoring System
(ITS) to review students' Excel submissions and provide individualized feedback
automatically. Although the lecturer only needs to provide one reference
solution, the students' submissions are analyzed automatically in several ways:
value matching, detailed analysis of the formulas, and quality assessment of
the solution. To take the students' learning level into account, we have
developed feedback levels for an ITS that provide gradually more information
about the error by using one of the different analyses. Feedback at a higher
level has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of correct submissions and
was also perceived as well understandable and helpful by the students.

<p class="mathjax">The release of the large language model based chatbot ChatGPT in November
2022 has brought considerable attention to the subject of artificial
intelligence, not only in the public. From the perspective of higher education,
ChatGPT challenges various learning and assessment formats as it significantly
reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment functionalities. In
particular, ChatGPT might be applied to formats that require learners to
generate text, such as bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly,
the research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor theses is still
a valid learning and assessment format. Correspondingly, in this study, the
first author was asked to write his bachelor's thesis exploiting ChatGPT. For
tracing the impact of ChatGPT, methodically an autoethnographic approach was
used. First, all considerations on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented
in logs and secondly, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
to be valued as a beneficial tool in thesis writing. However, writing a
conclusive thesis still requires the learner's meaningful engagement.
Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid learning and assessment format.
With further releases of ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected
and the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to time.

<p class="mathjax">SQL is a central component of any database course. Despite the small number
of SQL commands, students struggle to practice the concepts. To overcome this
challenge, we developed an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to guide the
learning process with a small effort by the lecturer. Other systems often give
only basic feedback (correct or incorrect) or require hundreds of instance
specific rules defined by a lecturer. In contrast, our system can provide
individual feedback based on a semi-automatically/intelligent growing pool of
reference solutions, i.e., sensible approaches. Moreover, we introduced the
concept of good and bad reference solutions. The system was developed and
evaluated in three steps based on Design Science research guidelines. The
results of the study demonstrate that providing multiple reference solutions
are useful with the support of harmonization to provide individual and
real-time feedback and thus improve the learning process for students.

<p class="mathjax">Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a prevalent and widespread global health
concern, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of its risk factors. This
study aimed towards learning whether there is any differential impact of age,
Lifestyle, BMI and Waist to height ratio on the risk of Type 2 diabetes
mellitus in males and females in Kolkata, West Bengal, India based on a sample
observed from the out-patient consultation department of Belle Vue Clinic in
Kolkata. Various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, and Support Vector Classifier, were used to predict the risk of
diabetes, and performance was compared based on different predictors. Our
findings indicate a significant age-related increase in risk of diabetes for
both males and females. Although exercising and BMI was found to have
significant impact on the risk of Type 2 diabetes in males, in females both
turned out to be statistically insignificant. For both males and females,
predictive models based on WhtR demonstrated superior performance in risk
assessment compared to those based on BMI. This study sheds light on the
gender-specific differences in the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, offering
valuable insights that can be used towards more targeted healthcare
interventions and public health strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation, but
they must be able to navigate safely in traffic before they can be deployed on
public roads. The goal of this project is to train autonomous vehicles to make
decisions to navigate in uncertain environments using deep reinforcement
learning techniques using the CARLA simulator. The simulator provides a
realistic and urban environment for training and testing self-driving models.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are used to predict driving actions. The study involves
the integration of collision sensors, segmentation, and depth camera for better
object detection and distance estimation. The model is tested on 4 different
trajectories in presence of different types of 4-wheeled vehicles and
pedestrians. The segmentation and depth cameras were utilized to ensure
accurate localization of objects and distance measurement. Our proposed method
successfully navigated the self-driving vehicle to its final destination with a
high success rate without colliding with other vehicles, pedestrians, or going
on the sidewalk. To ensure the optimal performance of our reinforcement
learning (RL) models in navigating complex traffic scenarios, we implemented a
pre-processing step to reduce the state space. This involved processing the
images and sensor output before feeding them into the model. Despite
significantly decreasing the state space, our approach yielded robust models
that successfully navigated through traffic with high levels of safety and
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying driving maneuvers plays an essential role on-board vehicles to
monitor driving and driver states, as well as off-board to train and evaluate
machine learning algorithms for automated driving for example. Maneuvers can be
characterized by vehicle kinematics or data from its surroundings including
other traffic participants. Extracting relevant maneuvers therefore requires
analyzing time-series of (i) structured, multi-dimensional kinematic data, and
(ii) unstructured, large data samples for video, radar, or LiDAR sensors.
However, such data analysis requires scalable and computationally efficient
approaches, especially for non-annotated data. In this paper, we are presenting
a maneuver detection approach based on two variants of space-filling curves
(Z-order and Hilbert) to detect maneuvers when passing roundabouts that do not
use GPS data. We systematically evaluate their respective performance by
including permutations of selections of kinematic signals at varying
frequencies and compare them with two alternative baselines: All manually
identified roundabouts, and roundabouts that are marked by geofences. We find
that encoding just longitudinal and lateral accelerations sampled at 10Hz using
a Hilbert space-filling curve is already successfully identifying roundabout
maneuvers, which allows to avoid the use of potentially sensitive signals such
as GPS locations to comply with data protection and privacy regulations like
GDPR.

<p class="mathjax">Timely formative feedback is considered as one of the most important drivers
for effective learning. Delivering timely and individualized feedback is
particularly challenging in large classes in higher education. Recently Large
Language Models such as GPT-3 became available to the public that showed
promising results on various tasks such as code generation and code
explanation. This paper investigates the potential of AI in providing
personalized code correction and generating feedback. Based on existing student
submissions of two different real-world assignments, the correctness of the
AI-aided e-assessment as well as the characteristics such as fault
localization, correctness of hints, and code style suggestions of the generated
feedback are investigated. The results show that 73 % of the submissions were
correctly identified as either correct or incorrect. In 59 % of these cases,
GPT-3.5 also successfully generated effective and high-quality feedback.
Additionally, GPT-3.5 exhibited weaknesses in its evaluation, including
localization of errors that were not the actual errors, or even hallucinated
errors. Implications and potential new usage scenarios are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Transportation agencies routinely collect weather data to support maintenance
activities. With the proliferation of smartphones, many agencies have begun
using crowdsourced data in operations. This study evaluates a novel unplowed
roads dataset from the largest crowdsourced transportation data provider Waze.
User-reported unplowed roads in Virginia were compared to national and state
weather data for accuracy, and found 81% of reports were near known snow
events, with false positives occurring at a regular rate of approximately 10
per day statewide. Reports were largely located on primary roads, limiting the
usefulness for transportation agencies who may be most concerned with poorly
monitored secondary roads. An effort to encourage unplowed road reporting in
Waze through targeted messages on social media did not increase participation.
Low reporting may be due to the feature's novelty, recent mild winters, or
COVID-19 school and business closures.

<p class="mathjax">This briefing paper focuses on data equity within foundation models, both in
terms of the impact of Generative AI (genAI) on society and on the further
development of genAI tools. GenAI promises immense potential to drive digital
and social innovation, such as improving efficiency, enhancing creativity and
augmenting existing data. GenAI has the potential to democratize access and
usage of technologies. However, left unchecked, it could deepen inequities.
With the advent of genAI significantly increasing the rate at which AI is
deployed and developed, exploring frameworks for data equity is more urgent
than ever. The goals of the briefing paper are threefold: to establish a shared
vocabulary to facilitate collaboration and dialogue; to scope initial concerns
to establish a framework for inquiry on which stakeholders can focus; and to
shape future development of promising technologies. The paper represents a
first step in exploring and promoting data equity in the context of genAI. The
proposed definitions, framework and recommendations are intended to proactively
shape the development of promising genAI technologies.

<p class="mathjax">This article analyzes AI ethics from a distinct business ethics perspective,
i.e., 'ordoliberalism 2.0.' It argues that the ongoing discourse on
(generative) AI relies too much on corporate self-regulation and voluntary
codes of conduct and thus lacks adequate governance mechanisms. To address
these issues, the paper suggests not only introducing hard-law legislation with
a more effective oversight structure but also merging already existing AI
guidelines with an ordoliberal-inspired regulatory and competition policy.
However, this link between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust is not yet
adequately discussed in the academic literature and beyond. The paper thus
closes a significant gap in the academic literature and adds to the
predominantly legal-political and philosophical discourse on AI governance. The
paper's research questions and goals are twofold: First, it identifies
ordoliberal-inspired AI ethics principles that could serve as the foundation
for a 'digital bill of rights.' Second, it shows how those principles could be
implemented at the macro level with the help of ordoliberal competition and
regulatory policy.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are powering the
applications we use, the decisions we make, and the decisions made about us. We
have seen numerous examples of non-equitable outcomes, from facial recognition
algorithms to recidivism algorithms, when they are designed without diversity
in mind. Thus, we must take action to promote diversity among those in this
field. A critical step in this work is understanding why some students who
choose to study ML/AI later leave the field. While the persistence of diverse
populations has been studied in engineering, there is a lack of research
investigating factors that influence persistence in ML/AI. In this work, we
present the advancement of a model of intentional persistence in ML/AI by
surveying students in ML/AI courses. We examine persistence across demographic
groups, such as gender, international student status, student loan status, and
visible minority status. We investigate independent variables that distinguish
ML/AI from other STEM fields, such as the varying emphasis on non-technical
skills, the ambiguous ethical implications of the work, and the highly
competitive and lucrative nature of the field. Our findings suggest that
short-term intentional persistence is associated with academic enrollment
factors such as major and level of study. Long-term intentional persistence is
correlated with measures of professional role confidence. Unique to our study,
we show that wanting your work to have a positive social benefit is a negative
predictor of long-term intentional persistence, and women generally care more
about this. We provide recommendations to educators to meaningfully discuss
ML/AI ethics in classes and encourage the development of interpersonal skills
to help increase diversity in the field.

<p class="mathjax">The growing field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)
presents a unique and unexplored case within persistence research, meaning it
is unclear how past findings from engineering will apply to this developing
field. We conduct an exploratory study to gain an initial understanding of
persistence in this field and identify fruitful directions for future work. One
factor that has been shown to predict persistence in engineering is belonging;
we study belonging through the lens of confidence, and discuss how attention to
social belonging confidence may help to increase diversity in the profession.
In this research paper, we conduct a small set of interviews with students in
ML/AI courses. Thematic analysis of these interviews revealed initial
differences in how students see a career in ML/AI, which diverge based on
interest and programming confidence. We identified how exposure and initiation,
the interpretation of ML and AI field boundaries, and beliefs of the skills
required to succeed might influence students' intentions to persist. We discuss
differences in how students describe being motivated by social belonging and
the importance of close mentorship. We motivate further persistence research in
ML/AI with particular focus on social belonging and close mentorship, the role
of intersectional identity, and introductory ML/AI courses.

passive information delivery are giving way to transformative pedagogical
approaches that prioritize active student engagement. Within the context of
large-scale hybrid classrooms, the challenge lies in fostering meaningful and
active interaction between students and course content. This study delves into
the significance of measuring students' earnestness during interactive lecture

representatION (FUSION), a pioneering methodology conceived to facilitate the
learning of an adaptive end-to-end driving policy by leveraging structured
scenario information. FUSION capitalizes on the causal relationships between
decomposed reward, cost, state, and action space, constructing a framework for
structured sequential reasoning under dynamic traffic environments. We conduct
rigorous evaluations in two typical real-world settings of distribution shift
in autonomous vehicles, demonstrating the good balance between safety cost and
utility reward of FUSION compared to contemporary state-of-the-art safety-aware
LfD baselines. Empirical evidence under diverse driving scenarios attests that
FUSION significantly enhances the safety and generalizability of autonomous
driving agents, even in the face of challenging and unseen environments.
Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal noticeable improvements in the
integration of causal representation into the safe offline RL problem.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an international treaty to reduce risks from the
development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The main provision of the
treaty is a global compute cap: a ban on the development of AI systems above an
agreed-upon computational resource threshold. The treaty also proposes the
development and testing of emergency response plans, negotiations to establish
an international agency to enforce the treaty, the establishment of new
communication channels and whistleblower protections, and a commitment to avoid
an AI arms race. We hope this treaty serves as a useful template for global
leaders as they implement governance regimes to protect civilization from the
dangers of advanced artificial intelligence.

<p class="mathjax">Providing consistent, individualized feedback to teachers on their
instruction can improve student learning outcomes. Such feedback can especially
benefit novice instructors who teach on online platforms and have limited
access to instructional training. To build scalable measures of instruction, we
fine-tune RoBERTa and GPT models to identify five instructional talk moves
inspired by accountable talk theory: adding on, connecting, eliciting, probing
and revoicing students' ideas. We fine-tune these models on a newly annotated
dataset of 2500 instructor utterances derived from transcripts of small group
instruction in an online computer science course, Code in Place. Although we
find that GPT-3 consistently outperforms RoBERTa in terms of precision, its
recall varies significantly. We correlate the instructors' use of each talk
move with indicators of student engagement and satisfaction, including
students' section attendance, section ratings, and assignment completion rates.
We find that using talk moves generally correlates positively with student
outcomes, and connecting student ideas has the largest positive impact. These
results corroborate previous research on the effectiveness of accountable talk
moves and provide exciting avenues for using these models to provide
instructors with useful, scalable feedback.

<p class="mathjax">From ancient water wheels to robotic process automation (RPA), automation
technology has evolved throughout history to liberate human beings from arduous
tasks. Yet, RPA struggles with tasks needing human-like intelligence,
especially in elaborate design of workflow construction and dynamic
decision-making in workflow execution. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged human-like intelligence, this paper introduces Agentic Process
Automation (APA), a groundbreaking automation paradigm using LLM-based agents
for advanced automation by offloading the human labor to agents associated with
construction and execution. We then instantiate ProAgent, an LLM-based agent
designed to craft workflows from human instructions and make intricate
decisions by coordinating specialized agents. Empirical experiments are
conducted to detail its construction and execution procedure of workflow,
showcasing the feasibility of APA, unveiling the possibility of a new paradigm
of automation driven by agents. Our code is public at

<p class="mathjax">Refactoring is the practice of improving software quality without altering
its external behavior. Developers intuitively refactor their code for multiple
purposes, such as improving program comprehension, reducing code complexity,
dealing with technical debt, and removing code smells. However, no prior
studies have exposed the students to an experience of the process of
antipatterns detection and refactoring correction, and provided students with
toolset to practice it. To understand and increase the awareness of refactoring
concepts, in this paper, we aim to reflect on our experience with teaching
refactoring and how it helps students become more aware of bad programming
practices and the importance of correcting them via refactoring. This paper
discusses the results of an experiment in the classroom that involved carrying
out various refactoring activities for the purpose of removing antipatterns
using JDeodorant, an Eclipse plugin that supports antipatterns detection and
refactoring. The results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis with 171
students show that students tend to appreciate the idea of learning refactoring
and are satisfied with various aspects of the JDeodorant plugin's operation.
Through this experiment, refactoring can turn into a vital part of the
computing educational plan. We envision our findings enabling educators to
support students with refactoring tools tuned towards safer and trustworthy
refactoring.

<p class="mathjax">This research presents a novel, robotic pollination system designed for
targeted pollination of apple flowers in modern fruiting wall orchards.
Developed in response to the challenges of global colony collapse disorder,
climate change, and the need for sustainable alternatives to traditional
pollinators, the system utilizes a commercial manipulator, a vision system, and
a spray nozzle for pollen application. Initial tests in April 2022 pollinated
56% of the target flower clusters with at least one fruit with a cycle time of
6.5 s. Significant improvements were made in 2023, with the system accurately
detecting 91% of available flowers and pollinating 84% of target flowers with a
reduced cycle time of 4.8 s. This system showed potential for precision
artificial pollination that can also minimize the need for labor-intensive
field operations such as flower and fruitlet thinning.

<p class="mathjax">Web resources in linked open data (LOD) are comprehensible to humans through
literal textual values attached to them, such as labels, notes, or comments.
Word choices in literals may not always be neutral. When outdated and
culturally stereotyping terminology is used in literals, they may appear as
offensive to users in interfaces and propagate stereotypes to algorithms
trained on them. We study how frequently and in which literals contentious
terms about people and cultures occur in LOD and whether there are attempts to
mark the usage of such terms. For our analysis, we reuse English and Dutch
terms from a knowledge graph that provides opinions of experts from the
cultural heritage domain about terms' contentiousness. We inspect occurrences
of these terms in four widely used datasets: Wikidata, The Getty Art &amp;
Architecture Thesaurus, Princeton WordNet, and Open Dutch WordNet. Some terms
are ambiguous and contentious only in particular senses. Applying word sense
disambiguation, we generate a set of literals relevant to our analysis. We
found that outdated, derogatory, stereotyping terms frequently appear in
descriptive and labelling literals, such as preferred labels that are usually
displayed in interfaces and used for indexing. In some cases, LOD contributors
mark contentious terms with words and phrases in literals (implicit markers) or
properties linked to resources (explicit markers). However, such marking is
rare and non-consistent in all datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative
insights could be helpful in developing more systematic approaches to address
the propagation of stereotypes via LOD.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT, a widely-recognized large language model (LLM), has recently gained
substantial attention for its performance scaling, attributed to the billions
of web-sourced natural language sentences used for training. Its underlying
architecture, Transformer, has found applications across diverse fields,
including video, audio signals, and robotic movement. %The crucial question
this raises concerns the Transformer's generalization-in-learning (GIL)
capacity. However, this raises a crucial question about Transformer's
generalization in learning (GIL) capacity. Is ChatGPT's success chiefly due to
the vast dataset used for training, or is there more to the story? To
investigate this, we compared Transformer's GIL capabilities with those of a
traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in tasks involving attractor
dynamics learning. For performance evaluation, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
method has been employed. Our simulation results suggest that under conditions
of limited data availability, Transformer's GIL abilities are markedly inferior
to those of RNN.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting users' interests from their lifelong behavior sequence is crucial
for predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR). Most current methods employ a
two-stage process for efficiency: they first select historical behaviors
related to the candidate item and then deduce the user's interest from this
narrowed-down behavior sub-sequence. This two-stage paradigm, though effective,
leads to information loss. Solely using users' lifelong click behaviors doesn't
provide a complete picture of their interests, leading to suboptimal
performance. In our research, we introduce the Deep Group Interest Network
(DGIN), an end-to-end method to model the user's entire behavior history. This
includes all post-registration actions, such as clicks, cart additions,
purchases, and more, providing a nuanced user understanding. We start by
grouping the full range of behaviors using a relevant key (like item_id) to
enhance efficiency. This process reduces the behavior length significantly,
from O(10^4) to O(10^2). To mitigate the potential loss of information due to
grouping, we incorporate two categories of group attributes. Within each group,
we calculate statistical information on various heterogeneous behaviors (like
behavior counts) and employ self-attention mechanisms to highlight unique
behavior characteristics (like behavior type). Based on this reorganized
behavior data, the user's interests are derived using the Transformer
technique. Additionally, we identify a subset of behaviors that share the same
item_id with the candidate item from the lifelong behavior sequence. The
insights from this subset reveal the user's decision-making process related to
the candidate item, improving prediction accuracy. Our comprehensive
evaluation, both on industrial and public datasets, validates DGIN's efficacy
and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">The challenge of improving translation accuracy in GPT-4 is being addressed
by harnessing a method known as in-context learning. This paper introduces a
strategic approach to utilize in-context learning specifically for machine
translation, aiming to significantly boost accuracy. The crux of this method
lies in the judicious selection of demonstrations that are most effective for
in-context learning. By selecting these examples carefully, GPT-4 can utilize
them to achieve remarkably accurate machine translations, eliminating the need
for task-specific fine-tuning. This technique is anchored in the semantic
similarities between the user's prompt and the chosen dataset. Sentences from
this dataset, carefully picked for their relevance and clarity, serve as potent
demonstrations for in-context learning. This approach not only enhances
translation accuracy but also enriches the understanding of nuanced linguistic
structures. It represents a significant step forward in machine learning,
leveraging the inherent capabilities of GPT-4 to provide translations that are
not only accurate but also contextually rich and linguistically sophisticated.
This method demonstrates the potential of in-context learning in overcoming
language barriers, opening new avenues for cross-cultural communication and
global collaboration.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted much
attention to value alignment for their responsible development. However, how to
define values in this context remains a largely unexplored question. Existing
work mainly follows the Helpful, Honest, Harmless principle and specifies
values as risk criteria formulated in the AI community, e.g., fairness and
privacy protection, suffering from poor clarity, adaptability and transparency.
Inspired by basic values in humanity and social science across cultures, this
work proposes a novel basic value alignment paradigm and introduces a value
space spanned by basic value dimensions. All LLMs' behaviors can be mapped into
the space by identifying the underlying values, possessing the potential to
address the three challenges. To foster future research, we apply the
representative Schwartz's Theory of Basic Values as an initialized example and
construct FULCRA, a dataset consisting of 5k (LLM output, value vector) pairs.
Our extensive analysis of FULCRA reveals the underlying relation between basic
values and LLMs' behaviors, demonstrating that our approach not only covers
existing mainstream risks but also anticipates possibly unidentified ones.
Additionally, we present an initial implementation of the basic value
evaluation and alignment, paving the way for future research in this line.

<p class="mathjax">In the last years, one of the fields of artificial intelligence that has been
investigated the most is nature-inspired computing. The research done on this
specific topic showcases the interest that sparks in researchers and
practitioners, who put their focus on this paradigm because of the adaptability
and ability of nature-inspired algorithms to reach high-quality outcomes on a
wide range of problems. In fact, this kind of methods has been successfully
applied to solve real-world problems in heterogeneous fields such as medicine,
transportation, industry, or software engineering. Our main objective with this
paper is to describe a tool based on nature-inspired computing for solving a
specific software engineering problem. The problem faced consists of optimizing
Infrastructure as Code deployment configurations. For this reason, the name of
the system is IaC Optimizer Platform. A prototypical version of the IOP was
described in previous works, in which the functionality of this platform was
introduced. With this paper, we take a step forward by describing the final
release of the IOP, highlighting its main contribution regarding the current
state-of-the-art, and justifying the decisions made on its implementation.
Also, we contextualize the IOP within the complete platform in which it is
embedded, describing how a user can benefit from its use. To do that, we also
present and solve a real-world use case.

<p class="mathjax">Scaling up the number of parameters of language models has proven to be an
effective approach to improve performance. For dense models, increasing model
size proportionally increases the model's computation footprint. In this work,
we seek to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary
based routing functions and experts. Our proposed approach, dubbed Mixture of
Word Experts (MoWE), can be seen as a memory augmented model, where a large set
of word-specific experts play the role of a sparse memory. We demonstrate that
MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar
number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks. Additionally, MoWE outperforms
regular MoE models on knowledge intensive tasks and has similar performance to
more complex memory augmented approaches that often require to invoke custom
mechanisms to search the sparse memory.

neurons for individual inferences. As proof, we present FastBERT, a BERT
variant that uses 0.3\% of its neurons during inference while performing on par
with similar BERT models. FastBERT selectively engages just 12 out of 4095
neurons for each layer inference. This is achieved by replacing feedforward
networks with fast feedforward networks (FFFs). While no truly efficient
implementation currently exists to unlock the full acceleration potential of
conditional neural execution, we provide high-level CPU code achieving 78x

<p class="mathjax">Automatic text-based diacritic restoration models generally have high
diacritic error rates when applied to speech transcripts as a result of domain
and style shifts in spoken language. In this work, we explore the possibility
of improving the performance of automatic diacritic restoration when applied to
speech data by utilizing the parallel spoken utterances. In particular, we use
the pre-trained Whisper ASR model fine-tuned on relatively small amounts of
diacritized Arabic speech data to produce rough diacritized transcripts for the
speech utterances, which we then use as an additional input for a
transformer-based diacritic restoration model. The proposed model consistently
improve diacritic restoration performance compared to an equivalent text-only
model, with at least 5\% absolute reduction in diacritic error rate within the
same domain and on two out-of-domain test sets. Our results underscore the
inadequacy of current text-based diacritic restoration models for speech data
sets and provide a new baseline for speech-based diacritic restoration.

<p class="mathjax">Providing a personalized user experience on information dense webpages helps
users in reaching their end-goals sooner. We explore an automated approach to
identifying user personas by leveraging high dimensional trajectory information
from user sessions on webpages. While neural collaborative filtering (NCF)
approaches pay little attention to token semantics, our method introduces
SessionBERT, a Transformer-backed language model trained from scratch on the
masked language modeling (mlm) objective for user trajectories (pages,
metadata, billing in a session) aiming to capture semantics within them. Our
results show that representations learned through SessionBERT are able to
consistently outperform a BERT-base model providing a 3% and 1% relative
improvement in F1-score for predicting page links and next services. We
leverage SessionBERT and extend it to provide recommendations (top-5) for the
next most-relevant services that a user would be likely to use. We achieve a
HIT@5 of 58% from our recommendation model.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and their
integration into large multimodal models (LMMs), there has been impressive
progress in zero-shot completion of user-oriented vision-language tasks.
However, a gap remains in the domain of chart image understanding due to the
distinct abstract components in charts. To address this, we introduce a
large-scale MultiModal Chart Instruction (MMC-Instruction) dataset comprising
600k instances supporting diverse tasks and chart types. Leveraging this data,
we develop MultiModal Chart Assistant (MMCA), an LMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on existing chart QA benchmarks. Recognizing the
need for a comprehensive evaluation of LMM chart understanding, we also propose
a MultiModal Chart Benchmark (MMC-Benchmark), a comprehensive human-annotated
benchmark with 9 distinct tasks evaluating reasoning capabilities over charts.
Extensive experiments on MMC-Benchmark reveal the limitations of existing LMMs
on correctly interpreting charts, even for the most recent GPT-4V model. Our
work provides an instruction-tuning methodology and benchmark to advance
multimodal understanding of charts.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have displayed massive improvements in reasoning
and decision-making skills and can hold natural conversations with users. Many
recent works seek to augment LLM-based assistants with external tools so they
can access private or up-to-date information and carry out actions on behalf of
users. To better measure the performance of these assistants, this paper
introduces ToolTalk, a benchmark consisting of complex user intents requiring
multi-step tool usage specified through dialogue. ToolTalk contains 28 tools
grouped into 7 plugins, and includes a complete simulated implementation of
each tool, allowing for fully automated evaluation of assistants that rely on
execution feedback. ToolTalk also emphasizes tools that externally affect the
world rather than only tools for referencing or searching information. We
evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on ToolTalk resulting in success rates of 26% and
50% respectively. Our analysis of the errors reveals three major categories and
suggests some future directions for improvement. We release ToolTalk at
https://github.com/microsoft/ToolTalk.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) for reaction condition optimization has become
an important topic in the pharmaceutical industry, given that a data-driven AI
model can assist drug discovery and accelerate reaction design. However,
existing AI models lack the chemical insights and real-time knowledge
acquisition abilities of experienced human chemists. This paper proposes a
Large Language Model (LLM) empowered AI agent to bridge this gap. We put forth
a novel three-phase paradigm and applied advanced intelligence-enhancement
methods like in-context learning and multi-LLM debate so that the AI agent can
borrow human insight and update its knowledge by searching the latest chemical
literature. Additionally, we introduce a novel Coarse-label Contrastive
Learning (CCL) based chemical fingerprint that greatly enhances the agent's
performance in optimizing the reaction condition. With the above efforts, the
proposed AI agent can autonomously generate the optimal reaction condition
recommendation without any human interaction. Further, the agent is highly
professional in terms of chemical reactions. It demonstrates close-to-human
performance and strong generalization capability in both dry-lab and wet-lab
experiments. As the first attempt in the chemical AI agent, this work goes a
step further in the field of "AI for chemistry" and opens up new possibilities
for computer-aided synthesis planning.

<p class="mathjax">Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a type of fine-grained sentiment
analysis (SA) that identifies aspects and the associated opinions from a given
text. In the digital era, ABSA gained increasing popularity and applications in
mining opinionated text data to obtain insights and support decisions. ABSA
research employs linguistic, statistical, and machine-learning approaches and
utilises resources such as labelled datasets, aspect and sentiment lexicons and
ontology. By its nature, ABSA is domain-dependent and can be sensitive to the
impact of misalignment between the resource and application domains. However,
to our knowledge, this topic has not been explored by the existing ABSA
literature reviews. In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review
(SLR) of ABSA studies with a focus on the research application domain, dataset
domain, and the research methods to examine their relationships and identify
trends over time. Our results suggest a number of potential systemic issues in
the ABSA research literature, including the predominance of the
``product/service review'' dataset domain among the majority of studies that
did not have a specific research application domain, coupled with the
prevalence of dataset-reliant methods such as supervised machine learning. This
review makes a number of unique contributions to the ABSA research field: 1) To
our knowledge, it is the first SLR that links the research domain, dataset
domain, and research method through a systematic perspective; 2) it is one of
the largest scoped SLR on ABSA, with 519 eligible studies filtered from 4191
search results without time constraint; and 3) our review methodology adopted
an innovative automatic filtering process based on PDF-mining, which enhanced
screening quality and reliability. Suggestions and our review limitations are
also discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a novel computational paradigm that
operates on long-dimensional vectors known as hypervectors. The hypervectors
are constructed as long bit-streams and form the basic building blocks of HDC
systems. In HDC, hypervectors are generated from scalar values without taking
their bit significance into consideration. HDC has been shown to be efficient
and robust in various data processing applications, including computer vision
tasks. To construct HDC models for vision applications, the current
state-of-the-art practice utilizes two parameters for data encoding: pixel
intensity and pixel position. However, the intensity and position information
embedded in high-dimensional vectors are generally not generated dynamically in
the HDC models. Consequently, the optimal design of hypervectors with high
model accuracy requires powerful computing platforms for training. A more
efficient approach to generating hypervectors is to create them dynamically
during the training phase, which results in accurate, low-cost, and highly
performable vectors. To this aim, we use low-discrepancy sequences to generate
intensity hypervectors only, while avoiding position hypervectors. By doing so,
the multiplication step in vector encoding is eliminated, resulting in a
power-efficient HDC system. For the first time in the literature, our proposed
approach employs lightweight vector generators utilizing unary bit-streams for
efficient encoding of data instead of using conventional comparator-based
generators.

<p class="mathjax">The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) provides a promising
opportunity to build human-like systems for various practical applications.
However, when applied to specific task domains, an LLM pre-trained on a
general-purpose corpus may exhibit a deficit or inadequacy in two types of
domain-specific knowledge. One is a comprehensive set of domain data that is
typically large-scale and continuously evolving. The other is specific working
patterns of this domain reflected in the data. The absence or inadequacy of
such knowledge impacts the performance of the LLM. In this paper, we propose a
general paradigm that augments LLMs with DOmain-specific KnowledgE to enhance
their performance on practical applications, namely DOKE. This paradigm relies
on a domain knowledge extractor, working in three steps: 1) preparing effective
knowledge for the task; 2) selecting the knowledge for each specific sample;
and 3) expressing the knowledge in an LLM-understandable way. Then, the
extracted knowledge is incorporated through prompts, without any computational
cost of model fine-tuning. We instantiate the general paradigm on a widespread
application, i.e. recommender systems, where critical item attributes and
collaborative filtering signals are incorporated. Experimental results
demonstrate that DOKE can substantially improve the performance of LLMs in
specific domains.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we extend an available neural network verification technique
to support a wider class of piece-wise linear activation functions.
Furthermore, we extend the algorithms, which provide in their original form
exact respectively over-approximative results for bounded input sets
represented as start sets, to allow also unbounded input set. We implemented
our algorithms and demonstrated their effectiveness in some case studies.

<p class="mathjax">Human moderation of online conversation is essential to maintaining civility
and focus in a dialogue, but is challenging to scale and harmful to moderators.
The inclusion of sophisticated natural language generation modules as a force
multiplier aid moderators is a tantalizing prospect, but adequate evaluation
approaches have so far been elusive. In this paper, we establish a systematic
definition of conversational moderation effectiveness through a
multidisciplinary lens that incorporates insights from social science. We then
propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that uses this definition to asses
models' moderation capabilities independently of human intervention. With our
framework, we conduct the first known study of conversational dialogue models
as moderators, finding that appropriately prompted models can provide specific
and fair feedback on toxic behavior but struggle to influence users to increase
their levels of respect and cooperation.

<p class="mathjax">According to the literature, Product reviews are an important source of
information for customers to support their buying decision. Product reviews
improve customer trust and loyalty. Reviews help customers in understanding
what other customers think about a particular product and helps in driving
purchase decisions. Therefore, for an e-commerce platform it is important to
understand the sentiments in customer reviews to understand their products and
services, and it also allows them to potentially create positive consumer
interaction as well as long lasting relationships. Reviews also provide
innovative ways to market the products for an ecommerce company. One such
approach is Nudge Marketing. Nudge marketing is a subtle way for an ecommerce

<p class="mathjax">ExFake is an explainable fake news detection system based on content and
context-level information. It is concerned with the veracity analysis of online
posts based on their content, social context (i.e., online users' credibility
and historical behaviour), and data coming from trusted entities such as
fact-checking websites and named entities. Unlike state-of-the-art systems, an
Explainable AI (XAI) assistant is also adopted to help online social networks
(OSN) users develop good reflexes when faced with any doubted information that
spreads on social networks. The trustworthiness of OSN users is also addressed
by assigning a credibility score to OSN users, as OSN users are one of the main
culprits for spreading fake news. Experimental analysis on a real-world dataset
demonstrates that ExFake significantly outperforms other baseline methods for
fake news detection.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of information systems, text sanitization techniques are used
to identify and remove sensitive data to comply with security and regulatory
requirements. Even though many methods for privacy preservation have been
proposed, most of them are focused on the detection of entities from specific
domains (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers), lacking
generality and requiring customization for each desirable domain. Moreover,
removing words is, in general, a drastic measure, as it can degrade text
coherence and contextual information. Less severe measures include substituting
a word for a safe alternative, yet it can be challenging to automatically find
meaningful substitutions. We present a zero-shot text sanitization technique
that detects and substitutes potentially sensitive information using Large
Language Models. Our evaluation shows that our method excels at protecting
privacy while maintaining text coherence and contextual information, preserving
data utility for downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">There is a lack of formalism for some key foundational concepts in systems
engineering. One of the most recently acknowledged deficits is the inadequacy
of systems engineering practices for engineering intelligent systems. In our
previous works, we proposed that closed systems precepts could be used to
accomplish a required paradigm shift for the systems engineering of intelligent
systems. However, to enable such a shift, formal foundations for closed systems
precepts that expand the theory of systems engineering are needed. The concept
of closure is a critical concept in the formalism underlying closed systems
precepts. In this paper, we provide formal, systems- and information-theoretic
definitions of closure to identify and distinguish different types of closed
systems. Then, we assert a mathematical framework to evaluate the subjective
formation of the boundaries and constraints of such systems. Finally, we argue
that engineering an intelligent system can benefit from appropriate closed and
open systems paradigms on multiple levels of abstraction of the system. In the
main, this framework will provide the necessary fundamentals to aid in systems
engineering of intelligent systems.

<p class="mathjax">The future success of the Navy will depend, in part, on artificial
intelligence. In practice, many artificially intelligent algorithms, and in
particular deep learning models, rely on continual learning to maintain
performance in dynamic environments. The software requires adaptation to
maintain its initial level of performance in unseen situations. However, if not
monitored properly, continual learning may lead to several issues including
catastrophic forgetting in which a trained model forgets previously learned
tasks when being retrained on new data. The authors created a new framework for
safely performing continual learning with the goal of pairing this safety
framework with a deep learning computer vision algorithm to allow for safe and
high-performing automatic deck tracking on carriers and amphibious assault
ships. The safety framework includes several features, such as an ensemble of
convolutional neural networks to perform image classification, a manager to
record confidences and determine the best answer from the ensemble, a model of
the environment to predict when the system may fail to meet minimum performance
metrics, a performance monitor to log system and domain performance and check
against requirements, and a retraining component to update the ensemble and
manager to maintain performance. The authors validated the proposed method
using extensive simulation studies based on dynamic image classification. The
authors showed the safety framework could probabilistically detect out of
distribution data. The results also show the framework can detect when the
system is no longer performing safely and can significantly extend the working
envelope of an image classifier.

<p class="mathjax">Video DeepFakes are fake media created with Deep Learning (DL) that
manipulate a person's expression or identity. Most current DeepFake detection
methods analyze each frame independently, ignoring inconsistencies and
unnatural movements between frames. Some newer methods employ optical flow
models to capture this temporal aspect, but they are computationally expensive.
In contrast, we propose using the related but often ignored Motion Vectors
(MVs) and Information Masks (IMs) from the H.264 video codec, to detect
temporal inconsistencies in DeepFakes. Our experiments show that this approach
is effective and has minimal computational costs, compared with per-frame
RGB-only methods. This could lead to new, real-time temporally-aware DeepFake
detection methods for video calls and streaming.

<p class="mathjax">Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important technique for
obtaining low dimensional representations of datasets. However, classical NMF
does not take into account data that is collected at different times or in
different locations, which may exhibit heterogeneity. We resolve this problem
by solving a modified NMF objective, Stratified-NMF, that simultaneously learns
strata-dependent statistics and a shared topics matrix. We develop
multiplicative update rules for this novel objective and prove convergence of
the objective. Then, we experiment on synthetic data to demonstrate the
efficiency and accuracy of the method. Lastly, we apply our method to three
real world datasets and empirically investigate their learned features.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding human perceptions presents a formidable multimodal challenge
for computers, encompassing aspects such as sentiment tendencies and sense of
humor. While various methods have recently been introduced to extract
modality-invariant and specific information from diverse modalities, with the
goal of enhancing the efficacy of multimodal learning, few works emphasize this
aspect in large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel multimodal
prompt strategy tailored for tuning large language models. Our method assesses
the correlation among different modalities and isolates the modality-invariant
and specific components, which are then utilized for prompt tuning. This
approach enables large language models to efficiently and effectively
assimilate information from various modalities. Furthermore, our strategy is
designed with scalability in mind, allowing the integration of features from
any modality into pretrained large language models. Experimental results on
public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves
performance compared to previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately predicting the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is pivotal
for optimizing usage and preventing accidents. Previous studies in constructing
prediction models often relied on inputs challenging to measure in real-time
operations and failed to capture intra-cycle and inter-cycle data patterns,
essential features for accurate predictions, comprehensively. In this study, we
employ attention mechanisms (AM) to develop data-driven models for predicting
LIB lifespan using easily measurable inputs such as voltage, current,
temperature, and capacity data. The developed model integrates recurrent neural
network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) components, featuring two
types of attention mechanisms: temporal attention (TA) and cyclic attention
(CA). The inclusion of TA aims to identify important time steps within each
cycle by scoring the hidden states of the RNN, whereas CA strives to capture
key features of inter-cycle correlations through self-attention (SA). This
enhances model accuracy and elucidates critical features in the input data. To
validate our method, we apply it to publicly available cycling data consisting
of three batches of cycling modes. The calculated TA scores highlight the rest
phase as a key characteristic distinguishing LIB data among different batches.
Additionally, CA scores reveal variations in the importance of cycles across
batches. By leveraging CA scores, we explore the potential to reduce the number
of cycles in the input data. The single-head and multi-head attentions enable
us to decrease the input dimension from 100 to 50 and 30 cycles, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing traffic sign-related works are dedicated to detecting and
recognizing part of traffic signs individually, which fails to analyze the
global semantic logic among signs and may convey inaccurate traffic
instruction. Following the above issues, we propose a traffic sign
interpretation (TSI) task, which aims to interpret global semantic interrelated
traffic signs (e.g.,~driving instruction-related texts, symbols, and guide
panels) into a natural language for providing accurate instruction support to
autonomous or assistant driving. Meanwhile, we design a multi-task learning
architecture for TSI, which is responsible for detecting and recognizing
various traffic signs and interpreting them into a natural language like a
human. Furthermore, the absence of a public TSI available dataset prompts us to
build a traffic sign interpretation dataset, namely TSI-CN. The dataset
consists of real road scene images, which are captured from the highway and the
urban way in China from a driver's perspective. It contains rich location
labels of texts, symbols, and guide panels, and the corresponding natural
language description labels. Experiments on TSI-CN demonstrate that the TSI
task is achievable and the TSI architecture can interpret traffic signs from
scenes successfully even if there is a complex semantic logic among signs. The
TSI-CN dataset and the source code of the TSI architecture will be publicly
available after the revision process.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Style Tailoring, a recipe to finetune Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs) in a distinct domain with high visual quality, prompt alignment and
scene diversity. We choose sticker image generation as the target domain, as
the images significantly differ from photorealistic samples typically generated
by large-scale LDMs. We start with a competent text-to-image model, like Emu,
and show that relying on prompt engineering with a photorealistic model to
generate stickers leads to poor prompt alignment and scene diversity. To
overcome these drawbacks, we first finetune Emu on millions of sticker-like
images collected using weak supervision to elicit diversity. Next, we curate
human-in-the-loop (HITL) Alignment and Style datasets from model generations,
and finetune to improve prompt alignment and style alignment respectively.
Sequential finetuning on these datasets poses a tradeoff between better style
alignment and prompt alignment gains. To address this tradeoff, we propose a
novel fine-tuning method called Style Tailoring, which jointly fits the content
and style distribution and achieves best tradeoff. Evaluation results show our
method improves visual quality by 14%, prompt alignment by 16.2% and scene
diversity by 15.3%, compared to prompt engineering the base Emu model for
stickers generation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the selection of machine learning model based on only the data
distribution without concerning the noise of the data. This study aims to
distinguish, which models perform well under noisy data, and establish whether
stacking machine learning models actually provide robustness to otherwise
weak-to-noise models. The electrochemical data were tested with 12 standalone
models and stacking model. This includes XGB, LGBM, RF, GB, ADA, NN, ELAS,
LASS, RIDGE, SVM, KNN, DT, and the stacking model. It is found that linear
models handle noise well with the average error of (slope) to 1.75 F g-1 up to
error per 100% percent noise added; but it suffers from prediction accuracy due
to having an average of 60.19 F g-1 estimated at minimal error at 0% noise
added. Tree-based models fail in terms of noise handling (average slope is
55.24 F g-1 at 100% percent noise), but it can provide higher prediction
accuracy (lowest error of 23.9 F g-1) than that of linear. To address the
controversial between prediction accuracy and error handling, the stacking
model was constructed, which is not only show high accuracy (intercept of 25.03
F g-1), but it also exhibits good noise handling (slope of 43.58 F g-1), making
stacking models a relatively low risk and viable choice for beginner and
experienced machine learning research in electrochemistry. Even though neural
networks (NN) are gaining popularity in the electrochemistry field. However,
this study presents that NN is not suitable for electrochemical data, and
improper tuning resulting in a model that is susceptible to noise. Thus, STACK
models should provide better benefits in that even with untuned base models,
they can achieve an accurate and noise-tolerant model. Overall, this work
provides insight into machine learning model selection for electrochemical
data, which should aid the understanding of data science in chemistry context.

<p class="mathjax">This study addresses the deficiency in conventional music recommendation
systems by focusing on the vital role of emotions in shaping users music
choices. These systems often disregard the emotional context, relying
predominantly on past listening behavior and failing to consider the dynamic
and evolving nature of users emotional preferences. This gap leads to several
limitations. Users may receive recommendations that do not match their current
mood, which diminishes the quality of their music experience. Furthermore,
without accounting for emotions, the systems might overlook undiscovered or
lesser-known songs that have a profound emotional impact on users. To combat
these limitations, this research introduces an AI model that incorporates
emotional context into the song recommendation process. By accurately detecting
users real-time emotions, the model can generate personalized song
recommendations that align with the users emotional state. This approach aims
to enhance the user experience by offering music that resonates with their
current mood, elicits the desired emotions, and creates a more immersive and
meaningful listening experience. By considering emotional context in the song
recommendation process, the proposed model offers an opportunity for a more
personalized and emotionally resonant musical journey.

<p class="mathjax">LLMs such as ChatGPT and PaLM can be utilized to train on a new language and
revitalize low-resource languages. However, it is evidently very costly to
pretrain pr fine-tune LLMs to adopt new languages. Another challenge is the
limitation of benchmark datasets and the metrics used to measure the
performance of models in multilingual settings. This paper proposes
cost-effective solutions to both of the aforementioned challenges. We introduce
the Multilingual Instruction-Tuning Dataset (MITS), which is comprised of the
translation of Alpaca-52K, Dolly-15K, and Vicuna Benchmark in 132 languages.
Also, we propose a new method called \emph{TaCo: Translation-Assisted
Cross-Linguality}, which make uses of translation in a chain-of-thought process
to instruction-tune LLMs on a new languages through a curriculum learning
process. As a proof of concept, we experimented with the instruction-tuned
Guanaco-33B model and performed further instruction tuning using the TaCo
method in three low-resource languages and one high-resource language. Our
results show that the TaCo method impresses the GPT-4 with 82% for a
low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, and boosts performance
by double in contrast to the performance of instruction tuning only. Our
results show that TaCo is a promising method for creating multilingual LLMs,
even for low-resource languages. We have released our datasets and the model
adapters, and encourage the research community to make use of these resources
towards advancing work on multilingual LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Synthesizing information from multiple data sources plays a crucial role in
the practice of modern medicine. Current applications of artificial
intelligence in medicine often focus on single-modality data due to a lack of
publicly available, multimodal medical datasets. To address this limitation, we
introduce INSPECT, which contains de-identified longitudinal records from a
large cohort of patients at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), along with ground
truth labels for multiple outcomes. INSPECT contains data from 19,402 patients,
including CT images, radiology report impression sections, and structured
electronic health record (EHR) data (i.e. demographics, diagnoses, procedures,
vitals, and medications). Using INSPECT, we develop and release a benchmark for
evaluating several baseline modeling approaches on a variety of important PE
related tasks. We evaluate image-only, EHR-only, and multimodal fusion models.
Trained models and the de-identified dataset are made available for
non-commercial use under a data use agreement. To the best of our knowledge,
INSPECT is the largest multimodal dataset integrating 3D medical imaging and
EHR for reproducible methods evaluation and research.

<p class="mathjax">In many real-world datasets, rows may have distinct characteristics and
require different modeling approaches for accurate predictions. In this paper,
we propose an adaptive modeling approach for row-type dependent predictive
analysis(RTDPA). Our framework enables the development of models that can
effectively handle diverse row types within a single dataset. Our dataset from
XXX bank contains two different risk categories, personal loan and agriculture
loan. each of them are categorised into four classes standard, sub-standard,
doubtful and loss. We performed tailored data pre processing and feature
engineering to different row types. We selected traditional machine learning
predictive models and advanced ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that
all predictive approaches consistently achieve a precision rate of no less than
90%. For RTDPA, the algorithms are applied separately for each row type,
allowing the models to capture the specific patterns and characteristics of
each row type. This approach enables targeted predictions based on the row
type, providing a more accurate and tailored classification for the given
dataset.Additionally, the suggested model consistently offers decision makers
valuable and enduring insights that are strategic in nature in banking sector.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been widely praised for their high energy
efficiency and immense potential. However, comprehensive research that
critically contrasts and correlates SNNs with quantized Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) remains scant, often leading to skewed comparisons lacking
fairness towards ANNs. This paper introduces a unified perspective,
illustrating that the time steps in SNNs and quantized bit-widths of activation
values present analogous representations. Building on this, we present a more
pragmatic and rational approach to estimating the energy consumption of SNNs.
Diverging from the conventional Synaptic Operations (SynOps), we champion the
"Bit Budget" concept. This notion permits an intricate discourse on
strategically allocating computational and storage resources between weights,
activation values, and temporal steps under stringent hardware constraints.
Guided by the Bit Budget paradigm, we discern that pivoting efforts towards
spike patterns and weight quantization, rather than temporal attributes,
elicits profound implications for model performance. Utilizing the Bit Budget
for holistic design consideration of SNNs elevates model performance across
diverse data types, encompassing static imagery and neuromorphic datasets. Our
revelations bridge the theoretical chasm between SNNs and quantized ANNs and
illuminate a pragmatic trajectory for future endeavors in energy-efficient
neural computations.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing use of deep learning on data collected by non-perfect
sensors and in non-perfect environments, the robustness of deep learning
systems has become an important issue. A common approach for obtaining
robustness to noise has been to train deep learning systems with data augmented
with Gaussian noise. In this work, we challenge the common choice of Gaussian
noise and explore the possibility of stronger robustness for non-Gaussian
impulsive noise, specifically alpha-stable noise. Justified by the Generalized
Central Limit Theorem and evidenced by observations in various application
areas, alpha-stable noise is widely present in nature. By comparing the testing
accuracy of models trained with Gaussian noise and alpha-stable noise on data
corrupted by different noise, we find that training with alpha-stable noise is
more effective than Gaussian noise, especially when the dataset is corrupted by
impulsive noise, thus improving the robustness of the model. The generality of
this conclusion is validated through experiments conducted on various deep
learning models with image and time series datasets, and other benchmark
corrupted datasets. Consequently, we propose a novel data augmentation method
that replaces Gaussian noise, which is typically added to the training data,
with alpha-stable noise.

<p class="mathjax">Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is the next generation of air transportation that
includes new entrants such as electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL)
aircraft, increasingly autonomous flight operations, and small UAS package
delivery. With these new vehicles and operational concepts comes a desire to
increase densities far beyond what occurs today in and around urban areas, to
utilize new battery technology, and to move toward more autonomously-piloted
aircraft. To achieve these goals, it becomes essential to introduce new safety
management system capabilities that can rapidly assess risk as it evolves
across a span of complex hazards and, if necessary, mitigate risk by executing
appropriate contingencies via supervised or automated decision-making during
flights. Recently, reinforcement learning has shown promise for real-time
decision making across a wide variety of applications including contingency
management. In this work, we formulate the contingency management problem as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and integrate the contingency management MDP into
the AAM-Gym simulation framework. This enables rapid prototyping of
reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluation of existing systems, thus
providing a community benchmark for future algorithm development. We report
baseline statistical information for the environment and provide example
performance metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods have been successful in reducing
label dependency by minimizing the domain discrepancy between a labeled source
domain and an unlabeled target domain. However, these methods face challenges
when dealing with Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data. MTS data typically
consist of multiple sensors, each with its own unique distribution. This
characteristic makes it hard to adapt existing UDA methods, which mainly focus
on aligning global features while overlooking the distribution discrepancies at
the sensor level, to reduce domain discrepancies for MTS data. To address this
issue, a practical domain adaptation scenario is formulated as Multivariate
Time-Series Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MTS-UDA). In this paper, we propose
SEnsor Alignment (SEA) for MTS-UDA, aiming to reduce domain discrepancy at both
the local and global sensor levels. At the local sensor level, we design
endo-feature alignment, which aligns sensor features and their correlations
across domains. To reduce domain discrepancy at the global sensor level, we
design exo-feature alignment that enforces restrictions on global sensor
features. We further extend SEA to SEA++ by enhancing the endo-feature
alignment. Particularly, we incorporate multi-graph-based high-order alignment
for both sensor features and their correlations. Extensive empirical results
have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our SEA and SEA++ on
public MTS datasets for MTS-UDA.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification
by extracting spatial features and enabling state-of-the-art accuracy in
vision-based tasks. The squeeze and excitation network proposed module gathers
channelwise representations of the input. Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) learn
global representation from the data and in most image classification models
used to learn extracted features of the image. In this paper, we introduce a
novel aggregated multilayer perceptron, a multi-branch dense layer, within the
Squeeze excitation residual module designed to surpass the performance of
existing architectures. Our approach leverages a combination of squeeze
excitation network module with dense layers. This fusion enhances the network's
ability to capture channel-wise patterns and have global knowledge, leading to
a better feature representation. This proposed model has a negligible increase
in parameters when compared to SENet. We conduct extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets to validate the model and compare them with established
architectures. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable increase in the
classification accuracy of the proposed model.

<p class="mathjax">This study aimed to utilize text processing and natural language processing
(NLP) models to mine clinical notes for the diagnosis of periodontitis and to
evaluate the performance of a named entity recognition (NER) model on different
regular expression (RE) methods. Two complexity levels of RE methods were used
to extract and generate the training data. The SpaCy package and RoBERTa
transformer models were used to build the NER model and evaluate its
performance with the manual-labeled gold standards. The comparison of the RE
methods with the gold standard showed that as the complexity increased in the
RE algorithms, the F1 score increased from 0.3-0.4 to around 0.9. The NER
models demonstrated excellent predictions, with the simple RE method showing
0.84-0.92 in the evaluation metrics, and the advanced and combined RE method
demonstrating 0.95-0.99 in the evaluation. This study provided an example of
the benefit of combining NER methods and NLP models in extracting target
information from free-text to structured data and fulfilling the need for
missing diagnoses from unstructured notes.

<p class="mathjax">This study explored the usability of prompt generation on named entity
recognition (NER) tasks and the performance in different settings of the
prompt. The prompt generation by GPT-J models was utilized to directly test the
gold standard as well as to generate the seed and further fed to the RoBERTa
model with the spaCy package. In the direct test, a lower ratio of negative
examples with higher numbers of examples in prompt achieved the best results
with a F1 score of 0.72. The performance revealed consistency, 0.92-0.97 in the
F1 score, in all settings after training with the RoBERTa model. The study
highlighted the importance of seed quality rather than quantity in feeding NER
models. This research reports on an efficient and accurate way to mine clinical
notes for periodontal diagnoses, allowing researchers to easily and quickly
build a NER model with the prompt generation approach.

<p class="mathjax">Explanatory systems make the behavior of machine learning models more
transparent, but are often inconsistent. To quantify the differences between
explanatory systems, this paper presents the Shreyan Distance, a novel metric
based on the weighted difference between ranked feature importance lists
produced by such systems. This paper uses the Shreyan Distance to compare two
explanatory systems, SHAP and LIME, for both regression and classification
learning tasks. Because we find that the average Shreyan Distance varies
significantly between these two tasks, we conclude that consistency between
explainers not only depends on inherent properties of the explainers
themselves, but also the type of learning task. This paper further contributes
the XAISuite library, which integrates the Shreyan distance algorithm into
machine learning pipelines.

<p class="mathjax">We propose SplatArmor, a novel approach for recovering detailed and
animatable human models by `armoring' a parameterized body model with 3D
Gaussians. Our approach represents the human as a set of 3D Gaussians within a
canonical space, whose articulation is defined by extending the skinning of the
underlying SMPL geometry to arbitrary locations in the canonical space. To
account for pose-dependent effects, we introduce a SE(3) field, which allows us
to capture both the location and anisotropy of the Gaussians. Furthermore, we
propose the use of a neural color field to provide color regularization and 3D
supervision for the precise positioning of these Gaussians. We show that
Gaussian splatting provides an interesting alternative to neural rendering
based methods by leverging a rasterization primitive without facing any of the
non-differentiability and optimization challenges typically faced in such
approaches. The rasterization paradigms allows us to leverage forward skinning,
and does not suffer from the ambiguities associated with inverse skinning and
warping. We show compelling results on the ZJU MoCap and People Snapshot
datasets, which underscore the effectiveness of our method for controllable
human synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">Human-level driving is an ultimate goal of autonomous driving. Conventional
approaches formulate autonomous driving as a perception-prediction-planning
framework, yet their systems do not capitalize on the inherent reasoning
ability and experiential knowledge of humans. In this paper, we propose a
fundamental paradigm shift from current pipelines, exploiting Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a cognitive agent to integrate human-like intelligence into
autonomous driving systems. Our approach, termed Agent-Driver, transforms the
traditional autonomous driving pipeline by introducing a versatile tool library
accessible via function calls, a cognitive memory of common sense and
experiential knowledge for decision-making, and a reasoning engine capable of
chain-of-thought reasoning, task planning, motion planning, and
self-reflection. Powered by LLMs, our Agent-Driver is endowed with intuitive
common sense and robust reasoning capabilities, thus enabling a more nuanced,
human-like approach to autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the
large-scale nuScenes benchmark, and extensive experiments substantiate that our
Agent-Driver significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art driving methods by
a large margin. Our approach also demonstrates superior interpretability and
few-shot learning ability to these methods. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">Anonymity networks allow messaging with metadata privacy, providing better
privacy than popular encrypted messaging applications. However, contacting a
user on an anonymity network currently requires knowing their public key or
similar high-entropy information, as these systems lack a privacy-preserving
mechanism for contacting a user via a short, human-readable username. Previous
research suggests that this is a barrier to widespread adoption.
<br />In this paper we propose Pudding, a novel private user discovery protocol
that allows a user to be contacted on an anonymity network knowing only their
email address. Our protocol hides contact relationships between users, prevents
impersonation, and conceals which usernames are registered on the network.
Pudding is Byzantine fault tolerant, remaining available and secure as long as
less than one third of servers are crashed, unavailable, or malicious. It can
be deployed on Loopix and Nym without changes to the underlying anonymity
network protocol, and it supports mobile devices with intermittent network
connectivity. We demonstrate the practicality of Pudding with a prototype using
the Nym anonymity network. We also formally define the security and privacy
goals of our protocol and conduct a thorough analysis to assess its compliance
with these definitions.

<p class="mathjax">In the growing world of artificial intelligence, federated learning is a
distributed learning framework enhanced to preserve the privacy of individuals'
data. Federated learning lays the groundwork for collaborative research in
areas where the data is sensitive. Federated learning has several implications
for real-world problems. In times of crisis, when real-time decision-making is
critical, federated learning allows multiple entities to work collectively
without sharing sensitive data. This distributed approach enables us to
leverage information from multiple sources and gain more diverse insights. This
paper is a systematic review of the literature on privacy-preserving machine
learning in the last few years based on the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, we have
presented an extensive review of supervised/unsupervised machine learning
algorithms, ensemble methods, meta-heuristic approaches, blockchain technology,
and reinforcement learning used in the framework of federated learning, in
addition to an overview of federated learning applications. This paper reviews
the literature on the components of federated learning and its applications in
the last few years. The main purpose of this work is to provide researchers and
practitioners with a comprehensive overview of federated learning from the
machine learning point of view. A discussion of some open problems and future
research directions in federated learning is also provided.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, autonomous mobile platforms are finding an increasing range
of applications in inspection or surveillance tasks, or to the transport of
objects, in places such as smart warehouses, factories or hospitals. In these
environments it is useful for the robot to have omnidirectional capability in
the plane, so it can navigate through narrow or cluttered areas, or make
position and orientation changes without having to maneuver. While this
capability is usually achieved with directional sliding wheels, this work
studies a particular robot that achieves omnidirectionality using conventional
wheels, which are easier to manufacture and maintain, and support larger loads
in general. This robot, which we call ``Otbot'' (for omnidirectional
tire-wheeled robot), was already conceived in the late 1990s, but all the
controllers that have been proposed for it are based on purely kinematic models
so far. These controllers may be sufficient if the robot is light, or if its
motors are powerful, but on platforms that have to carry large loads, or that
have more limited motors, it is necessary to resort to control laws based on
dynamic models if the full acceleration capacities are to be exploited. This
work develops a dynamic model of Otbot, proposes a plausible methodology to
identify its parameters, and designs a control law that, using this model, is
able to track prescribed trajectories in an accurate and robust manner.

<p class="mathjax">In times marked by an abundance of news sources and the widespread use of
social media for staying informed, acquiring accurate data faces increasing
challenges. Today, access to information plays a crucial role in shaping public
opinion and is significantly influenced by interactions on social media.
Therefore, studying the dissemination of news on these platforms is vital for
understanding how individuals stay informed. In this paper, we study emergent
properties of media outlet sharing behavior by users in social media. We
quantify this behavior in terms of coordinates in a latent space proposing a
metric called Media Sharing Index (MSI). We observe that the MSI shows a
bimodal distribution in this latent dimension, reflecting the preference of
large groups of users for specific groups of media outlets. This methodology
allows the study of the extent to which communities of interacting users are
permeable to different sources of information. Additionally, it facilitates the
analysis of the relationship between users' media outlet preferences, their
political leanings, and the political leanings of the media outlets.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reviews the challenges hindering the widespread adoption of
artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the healthcare industry, focusing on
computer vision applications for medical imaging, and how interoperability and
enterprise-grade scalability can be used to address these challenges. The
complex nature of healthcare workflows, intricacies in managing large and
secure medical imaging data, and the absence of standardized frameworks for AI
development pose significant barriers and require a new paradigm to address
them. The role of interoperability is examined in this paper as a crucial
factor in connecting disparate applications within healthcare workflows.
Standards such as DICOM, Health Level 7 HL7, and Integrating the Healthcare
Enterprise (IHE) are highlighted as foundational for common imaging workflows.
A specific focus is placed on the role of DICOM gateways, with Laurel Bridge
leading transformational efforts in this area. To drive enterprise scalability,
new tools are needed. Project MONAI, established in 2019, is introduced as an
initiative aiming to redefine the development of medical AI applications. The
MONAI Deploy App SDK, a component of Project MONAI, is identified as a key tool
in simplifying the packaging and deployment process, enabling repeatable,
scalable, and standardized deployment patterns for AI applications. The
abstract underscores the potential impact of successful AI adoption in
healthcare, offering physicians both life-saving and time-saving insights and
driving efficiencies in radiology department workflows. The collaborative
efforts between academia and industry, exemplified by collaborations with
organizations like NVIDIA and Laurel Bridge, are emphasized as essential for
advancing the adoption of healthcare AI solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Point-cloud-based 3D object detection suffers from performance degradation
when encountering data with novel domain gaps. To tackle it, the single-domain
generalization (SDG) aims to generalize the detection model trained in a
limited single source domain to perform robustly on unexplored domains. In this
paper, we propose an SDG method to improve the generalizability of 3D object
detection to unseen target domains. Unlike prior SDG works for 3D object
detection solely focusing on data augmentation, our work introduces a novel
data augmentation method and contributes a new multi-task learning strategy in
the methodology. Specifically, from the perspective of data augmentation, we
design a universal physical-aware density-based data augmentation (PDDA) method
to mitigate the performance loss stemming from diverse point densities. From
the learning methodology viewpoint, we develop a multi-task learning for 3D
object detection: during source training, besides the main standard detection
task, we leverage an auxiliary self-supervised 3D scene restoration task to
enhance the comprehension of the encoder on background and foreground details
for better recognition and detection of objects. Furthermore, based on the
auxiliary self-supervised task, we propose the first test-time adaptation
method for domain generalization of 3D object detection, which efficiently
adjusts the encoder's parameters to adapt to unseen target domains during
testing time, to further bridge domain gaps. Extensive cross-dataset
experiments covering "Car", "Pedestrian", and "Cyclist" detections, demonstrate
our method outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods and even overpass
unsupervised domain adaptation methods under some circumstances. The code will
be made publicly available.

language models to arbitrary downstream tasks. Unlike standard
mixture-of-expert architectures, our method employs a gradient-free routing
function to choose a weighted combination of experts without increasing the

token-level adaptation of LoRA adapters outperforms the base Llama-2-7b model
across mathematical (GSM8K), scientific (ARC-Challenge), reading comprehension

<p class="mathjax">Coding of unstructured clinical free-text to produce interoperable structured
data is essential to improve direct care, support clinical communication and to
enable clinical research.However, manual clinical coding is difficult and time
consuming, which motivates the development and use of natural language
processing for automated coding. This work evaluates the quality and
consistency of both manual and automated clinical coding of diagnoses from
hospital outpatient letters. Using 100 randomly selected letters, two human
clinicians performed coding of diagnosis lists to SNOMED CT. Automated coding
was also performed using IMO's Concept Tagger. A gold standard was constructed
by a panel of clinicians from a subset of the annotated diagnoses. This was
used to evaluate the quality and consistency of both manual and automated
coding via (1) a distance-based metric, treating SNOMED CT as a graph, and (2)
a qualitative metric agreed upon by the panel of clinicians. Correlation
between the two metrics was also evaluated. Comparing human and
computer-generated codes to the gold standard, the results indicate that humans
slightly out-performed automated coding, while both performed notably better
when there was only a single diagnosis contained in the free-text description.
Automated coding was considered acceptable by the panel of clinicians in
approximately 90% of cases.

<p class="mathjax">Several methods have been proposed recently to learn neural network (NN)
controllers for autonomous agents, with unknown and stochastic dynamics, tasked
with complex missions captured by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Due to the
sample-inefficiency of the majority of these works, compositional learning
methods have been proposed decomposing the LTL specification into smaller
sub-tasks. Then, separate controllers are learned and composed to satisfy the
original task. A key challenge within these approaches is that they often lack
safety guarantees or the provided guarantees are impractical. This paper aims
to address this challenge. Particularly, we consider autonomous systems with
unknown and stochastic dynamics and LTL-encoded tasks. We assume that the
system is equipped with a finite set of base skills modeled by trained NN
feedback controllers. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal
composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that
will yield a composite system behavior that satisfies the assigned LTL task
with probability one. We propose a new approach that relies on a novel
integration of automata theory and data-driven reachability analysis tools for
NN-controlled stochastic systems. The resulting neuro-symbolic controller
allows the agent to generate safe behaviors for unseen complex temporal logic
tasks in a zero-shot fashion by leveraging its base skills. We show correctness
of the proposed method and we provide conditions under which it is complete. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that designs verified
temporal compositions of NN controllers for unknown and stochastic systems.
Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations and hardware experiments on
robot navigation tasks to demonstrate the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate image segmentation is crucial in reservoir modelling and material
characterization, enhancing oil and gas extraction efficiency through detailed
reservoir models. This precision offers insights into rock properties,
advancing digital rock physics understanding. However, creating pixel-level
annotations for complex CT and SEM rock images is challenging due to their size
and low contrast, lengthening analysis time. This has spurred interest in
advanced semi-supervised and unsupervised segmentation techniques in digital
rock image analysis, promising more efficient, accurate, and less
labour-intensive methods. Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) revolutionized
image segmentation in 2023, offering interactive and automated segmentation
with zero-shot capabilities, essential for digital rock physics with limited
training data and complex image features. Despite its advanced features, SAM
struggles with rock CT/SEM images due to their absence in its training set and
the low-contrast nature of grayscale images. Our research fine-tunes SAM for
rock CT/SEM image segmentation, optimizing parameters and handling large-scale
images to improve accuracy. Experiments on rock CT and SEM images show that
fine-tuning significantly enhances SAM's performance, enabling high-quality
mask generation in digital rock image analysis. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the fine-tuned SAM model (RockSAM) for rock
images, offering segmentation without extensive training or complex labelling.

<p class="mathjax">The area of temporally fine-grained video representation learning aims to
generate frame-by-frame representations for temporally dense tasks. In this
work, we advance the state-of-the-art for this area by re-examining the design
of transformer architectures for video representation learning. A salient
aspect of our self-supervised method is the improved integration of spatial
information in the temporal pipeline by representing multiple entities per
frame. Prior works use late fusion architectures that reduce frames to a single
dimensional vector before any cross-frame information is shared, while our
method represents each frame as a group of entities or tokens. Our Multi-entity
Video Transformer (MV-Former) architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on
multiple fine-grained video benchmarks. MV-Former leverages image features from
self-supervised ViTs, and employs several strategies to maximize the utility of
the extracted features while also avoiding the need to fine-tune the complex
ViT backbone. This includes a Learnable Spatial Token Pooling strategy, which
is used to identify and extract features for multiple salient regions per
frame. Our experiments show that MV-Former not only outperforms previous
self-supervised methods, but also surpasses some prior works that use
additional supervision or training data. When combined with additional
pre-training data from Kinetics-400, MV-Former achieves a further performance
boost. The code for MV-Former is available at

<p class="mathjax">The image annotation stage is a critical and often the most time-consuming
part required for training and evaluating object detection and semantic
segmentation models. Deployment of the existing models in novel environments
often requires detecting novel semantic classes not present in the training
data. Furthermore, indoor scenes contain significant viewpoint variations,
which need to be handled properly by trained perception models. We propose to
leverage the recent advancements in state-of-the-art models for bottom-up
segmentation (SAM), object detection (Detic), and semantic segmentation
(MaskFormer), all trained on large-scale datasets. We aim to develop a
cost-effective labeling approach to obtain pseudo-labels for semantic
segmentation and object instance detection in indoor environments, with the
ultimate goal of facilitating the training of lightweight models for various
downstream tasks. We also propose a multi-view labeling fusion stage, which
considers the setting where multiple views of the scenes are available and can
be used to identify and rectify single-view inconsistencies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on the Active Vision dataset and the
ADE20K dataset. We evaluate the quality of our labeling process by comparing it
with human annotations. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained
labels in downstream tasks such as object goal navigation and part discovery.
In the context of object goal navigation, we depict enhanced performance using
this fusion approach compared to a zero-shot baseline that utilizes large
monolithic vision-language pre-trained models.

<p class="mathjax">In farming systems, harvesting operations are tedious, time- and
resource-consuming tasks. Based on this, deploying a fleet of autonomous robots
to work alongside farmworkers may provide vast productivity and logistics
benefits. Then, an intelligent robotic system should monitor human behavior,
identify the ongoing activities and anticipate the worker's needs. In this
work, the main contribution consists of creating a benchmark model for
video-based human pickers detection, classifying their activities to serve in
harvesting operations for different agricultural scenarios. Our solution uses
the combination of a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask
R-CNN) for object detection and optical flow for motion estimation with newly
added statistical attributes of flow motion descriptors, named as Correlation
Sensitivity (CS). A classification criterion is defined based on the Kernel

<p class="mathjax">We design algorithms for minimizing $\max_{i\in[n]} f_i(x)$ over a
$d$-dimensional Euclidean or simplex domain. When each $f_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz
and $1$-smooth, our method computes an $\epsilon$-approximate solution using
$\widetilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-1/3} + \epsilon^{-2})$ gradient and function
evaluations, and $\widetilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-4/3})$ additional runtime. For
large $n$, our evaluation complexity is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.
In the special case where each $f_i$ is linear -- which corresponds to finding
a near-optimal primal strategy in a matrix game -- our method finds an
$\epsilon$-approximate solution in runtime $\widetilde{O}(n (d/\epsilon)^{2/3}
+ nd + d\epsilon^{-2})$. For $n&gt;d$ and $\epsilon=1/\sqrt{n}$ this improves over
all existing first-order methods. When additionally $d = \omega(n^{8/11})$ our
runtime also improves over all known interior point methods.
<br />Our algorithm combines three novel primitives: (1) A dynamic data structure
which enables efficient stochastic gradient estimation in small $\ell_2$ or
$\ell_1$ balls. (2) A mirror descent algorithm tailored to our data structure
implementing an oracle which minimizes the objective over these balls. (3) A
simple ball oracle acceleration framework suitable for non-Euclidean geometry.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the field of 3D self-supervised learning has witnessed
significant progress, resulting in the emergence of Multi-Modality Masked
AutoEncoders (MAE) methods that leverage both 2D images and 3D point clouds for
pre-training. However, a notable limitation of these approaches is that they do
not fully utilize the multi-view attributes inherent in 3D point clouds, which
is crucial for a deeper understanding of 3D structures. Building upon this
insight, we introduce a novel approach employing a 3D to multi-view masked
autoencoder to fully harness the multi-modal attributes of 3D point clouds. To
be specific, our method uses the encoded tokens from 3D masked point clouds to
generate original point clouds and multi-view depth images across various
poses. This approach not only enriches the model's comprehension of geometric
structures but also leverages the inherent multi-modal properties of point
clouds. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for
different tasks and under different settings. Remarkably, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts by a large margin in a variety of
downstream tasks, including 3D object classification, few-shot learning, part
segmentation, and 3D object detection. Code will be available at:

<p class="mathjax">Score-based models have achieved remarkable results in the generative
modeling of many domains. By learning the gradient of smoothed data
distribution, they can iteratively generate samples from complex distribution
e.g. natural images.
<br />However, is there any universal structure in the gradient field that will
eventually be learned by any neural network? Here, we aim to find such
structures through a normative analysis of the score function.
<br />First, we derived the closed-form solution to the scored-based model with a
Gaussian score. We claimed that for well-trained diffusion models, the learned
score at a high noise scale is well approximated by the linear score of
Gaussian. We demonstrated this through empirical validation of pre-trained
images diffusion model and theoretical analysis of the score function. This
finding enabled us to precisely predict the initial diffusion trajectory using
the analytical solution and to accelerate image sampling by 15-30\% by skipping
the initial phase without sacrificing image quality. Our finding of the linear
structure in the score-based model has implications for better model design and
data pre-processing.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Deep neural networks have proven to be powerful computational
tools for modeling, prediction, and generation. However, the workings of these
models have generally been opaque. Recent work has shown that the performance
of some models are modulated by overlapping functional networks of connections
within the models. Here the techniques of functional neuroimaging are applied
to an exemplary large language model to probe its functional structure.
Methods: A series of block-designed task-based prompt sequences were generated
to probe the Facebook Galactica-125M model. Tasks included prompts relating to
political science, medical imaging, paleontology, archeology, pathology, and
random strings presented in an off/on/off pattern with prompts about other
random topics. For the generation of each output token, all layer output values
were saved to create an effective time series. General linear models were fit
to the data to identify layer output values which were active with the tasks.
Results: Distinct, overlapping networks were identified with each task. Most
overlap was observed between medical imaging and pathology networks. These
networks were repeatable across repeated performance of related tasks, and
correspondence of identified functional networks and activation in tasks not
used to define the functional networks was shown to accurately identify the
presented task. Conclusion: The techniques of functional neuroimaging can be
applied to deep neural networks as a means to probe their workings. Identified
functional networks hold the potential for use in model alignment, modulation
of model output, and identifying weights to target in fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately detecting rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) is crucial for
understanding how objects are behaving in the space domain. However, detecting
closely-spaced objects (CSO) is challenging for ground-based optical space
domain awareness (SDA) algorithms as two objects close together along the
line-of-sight can appear blended as a single object within the point-spread
function (PSF) of the optical system. Traditional machine learning methods can
be useful for differentiating between singular objects and closely-spaced
objects, but many methods require large training sample sizes or high
signal-to-noise conditions. The quality and quantity of realistic data make
probabilistic classification methods a superior approach, as they are better
suited to handle these data inadequacies. We present CSO classification results
using the Gaussian process python package, MuyGPyS, and examine classification
accuracy as a function of angular separation and magnitude difference between
the simulated satellites. This orbit-independent analysis is done on highly
accurate simulated SDA images that emulate realistic ground-based
commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) optical sensor observations of CSOs. We find
that MuyGPyS outperforms traditional machine learning methods, especially under
more challenging circumstances.

scheme with a residual operator layer for learning mappings between continuous
functions in the 3D Euclidean space. Our proposed model is guaranteed to
achieve SE(3)-equivariance by design. From the graph spectrum view, our method
can be interpreted as convolution on graphons (dense graphs with infinitely
many nodes), which we term InfGCN. By leveraging both the continuous graphon
structure and the discrete graph structure of the input data, our model can
effectively capture the geometric information while preserving equivariance.
Through extensive experiments on large-scale electron density datasets, we
observed that our model significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art
architectures. Multiple ablation studies were also carried out to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

<p class="mathjax">Since about 2003, captchas have been widely used as a barrier against bots,
while simultaneously annoying great multitudes of users worldwide. As their use
grew, techniques to defeat or bypass captchas kept improving, while captchas
themselves evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming
increasingly difficult to solve for both bots and humans. Given this
long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is important to investigate
usability, solving performance, and user perceptions of modern captchas. In
this work, we do so via a large-scale (over 3, 600 distinct users) 13-month
unbiased user study and post-study survey. The study, conducted at a large
public university, was based on a live account creation and password recovery
service with currently prevalent captcha type: reCAPTCHAv2.
<br />Results show that, with more attempts, users improve in solving checkbox
challenges. For website developers and user study designers, results indicate
that the website context directly influences (with statistically significant
differences) solving time between password recovery and account creation. We
consider the impact of participants' major and education level, showing that
certain majors exhibit better performance, while, in general, education level
has a direct impact on solving time. Unsurprisingly, we discover that
participants find image challenges to be annoying, while checkbox challenges
are perceived as easy. We also show that, rated via System Usability Scale
(SUS), image tasks are viewed as "OK", while checkbox tasks are viewed as
"good". We explore the cost and security of reCAPTCHAv2 and conclude that it
has an immense cost and no security. Overall, we believe that this study's
results prompt a natural conclusion: reCAPTCHAv2 and similar reCAPTCHA
technology should be deprecated.

<p class="mathjax">People with dementia (PwD) often present verbal agitation such as cursing,
screaming, and persistently complaining. Verbal agitation can impose mental
distress on informal caregivers (e.g., family, friends), which may cause severe
mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety disorders. To improve informal
caregivers' mental health, we explore design opportunities by interviewing 11
informal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation of PwD. In particular, we
first characterize how the predictability of verbal agitation impacts informal
caregivers' mental health and how caregivers' coping strategies vary before,
during, and after verbal agitation. Based on our findings, we propose design
opportunities to improve the mental health of informal caregivers suffering
from verbal agitation: distracting PwD (in-situ support; before), prompting
just-in-time maneuvers (information support; during), and comfort and education
(social &amp; information support; after). We discuss our reflections on cultural
disparities between participants. Our work envisions a broader design space for
supporting informal caregivers' well-being and describes when and how that
support could be provided.

energy-aware motion planning problem. The motion primitives are defined as
sequences of control inputs to a simplified four-DOF dynamics model and are
used to replace the traditional continuous control space used in many
sampling-based motion planners. The primitives are implemented in a Stable
Sparse Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (SST) motion planner and compared to an
identical planner using a continuous control space. The planner using
primitives was found to run 11.0\% faster but yielded solution paths that were
on average worse with higher variance. Also, the solution path travel time is
improved by about 50\%. Using motion primitives for sampling spaces in SST can
effectively reduce the run time of the algorithm, although at the cost of
solution quality.

methods, as well as a discussion of which pose estimation method should be used
in two types of architectural design scenarios. Taking the latest pose
estimation research Gen6d as an example, we make a qualitative assessment of
the current openset methods in terms of application level, prediction speed,
resistance to occlusion, accuracy, resistance to environmental interference,
etc. In addition, we try to combine 6D pose estimation and building wind
environment assessment to create tangible architectural design approach, we
discuss the limitations of the method and point out the direction in which 6d

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning algorithms are typically exposed to untrusted sources that
contain training data inserted by adversaries and bad actors. An adversary can
insert a small number of poisoned samples, such as mislabeled samples from
previously learned tasks, or intentional adversarial perturbed samples, into
the training datasets, which can drastically reduce the model's performance. In
this work, we demonstrate that continual learning systems can be manipulated by
malicious misinformation and present a new category of data poisoning attacks
specific for continual learners, which we refer to as {\em Poisoning Attacks
Against Continual Learners} (PACOL). The effectiveness of labeling flipping
attacks inspires PACOL; however, PACOL produces attack samples that do not
change the sample's label and produce an attack that causes catastrophic
forgetting. A comprehensive set of experiments shows the vulnerability of
commonly used generative replay and regularization-based continual learning
approaches against attack methods. We evaluate the ability of label-flipping
and a new adversarial poison attack, namely PACOL proposed in this work, to
force the continual learning system to forget the knowledge of a learned
task(s). More specifically, we compared the performance degradation of
continual learning systems trained on benchmark data streams with and without
poisoning attacks. Moreover, we discuss the stealthiness of the attacks in
which we test the success rate of data sanitization defense and other outlier
detection-based defenses for filtering out adversarial samples.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art NLP methods achieve human-like performance on many tasks,
but make errors nevertheless. Characterizing these errors in easily
interpretable terms gives insight into whether a classifier is prone to making
systematic errors, but also gives a way to act and improve the classifier. We
propose to discover those patterns of tokens that distinguish correct and
erroneous predictions as to obtain global and interpretable descriptions for
arbitrary NLP classifiers. We formulate the problem of finding a succinct and
non-redundant set of such patterns in terms of the Minimum Description Length
principle. Through an extensive set of experiments, we show that our method,
Premise, performs well in practice. Unlike existing solutions, it recovers
ground truth, even on highly imbalanced data over large vocabularies. In VQA
and NER case studies, we confirm that it gives clear and actionable insight
into the systematic errors made by NLP classifiers.

<p class="mathjax">Airfoil shape optimization plays a critical role in the design of
high-performance aircraft. However, the high-dimensional nature of airfoil
representation causes the challenging problem known as the "curse of
dimensionality". To overcome this problem, numerous airfoil parameterization
methods have been developed, which can be broadly classified as
polynomial-based and data-driven approaches. Each of these methods has
desirable characteristics such as flexibility, parsimony, feasibility, and
intuitiveness, but a single approach that encompasses all of these attributes
has yet to be found. For example, polynomial-based methods struggle to balance
parsimony and flexibility, while data-driven methods lack in feasibility and
intuitiveness. In recent years, generative models, such as generative
adversarial networks and variational autoencoders, have shown promising
potential in airfoil parameterization. However, these models still face
challenges related to intuitiveness due to their black-box nature. To address
this issue, we developed a novel airfoil parameterization method using
physics-aware variational autoencoder. The proposed method not only explicitly
separates the generation of thickness and camber distributions to produce
smooth and non-intersecting airfoils, thereby improving feasibility, but it
also directly aligns its latent dimensions with geometric features of the
airfoil, significantly enhancing intuitiveness. Finally, extensive comparative
studies were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The task of assigning internationally accepted commodity codes (aka HS codes)
to traded goods is a critical function of customs offices. Like court decisions
made by judges, this task follows the doctrine of precedent and can be
nontrivial even for experienced officers. Together with the Korea Customs
Service (KCS), we propose a first-ever explainable decision supporting model
that suggests the most likely subheadings (i.e., the first six digits) of the
HS code. The model also provides reasoning for its suggestion in the form of a
document that is interpretable by customs officers. We evaluated the model
using 5,000 cases that recently received a classification request. The results
showed that the top-3 suggestions made by our model had an accuracy of 93.9\%
when classifying 925 challenging subheadings. A user study with 32 customs
experts further confirmed that our algorithmic suggestions accompanied by
explainable reasonings, can substantially reduce the time and effort taken by
customs officers for classification reviews.

<p class="mathjax">Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental algorithmic tool in data mining,
community detection, and clustering. In this problem, one aims to find an
induced subgraph whose edge-to-vertex ratio is maximized.
<br />We study the directed case of this question in the context of semi-streaming
and massively parallel algorithms. In particular, we show that it is possible
to find a $(2+\epsilon)$ approximation on randomized streams even in a single
pass by using $O(n \cdot {\rm poly} \log n)$ memory on $n$-vertex graphs. Our
result improves over prior works, which were designed for arbitrary-ordered
streams: the algorithm by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012) which uses $O(\log n)$
passes, and the work by Esfandiari et al. (2015) which makes one pass but uses
$O(n^{3/2})$ memory. Moreover, our techniques extend to the Massively Parallel
Computation model yielding $O(1)$ rounds in the super-linear and $O(\sqrt{\log
n})$ rounds in the nearly-linear memory regime. This constitutes a quadratic
improvement over state-of-the-art bounds by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012 and WAW
2014), which require $O(\log n)$ rounds even in the super-linear memory regime.
<br />Finally, we empirically evaluate our single-pass semi-streaming algorithm on
$6$ benchmarks and show that, even on non-randomly ordered streams, the quality
of its output is essentially the same as that of Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012)
while it is $2$ times faster on large graphs.

<p class="mathjax">The presence of bugs in video games can bring significant consequences for
developers. To avoid these consequences, developers can leverage gameplay
videos to identify and fix these bugs. Video hosting websites such as YouTube
provide access to millions of game videos, including videos that depict bug
occurrences, but the large amount of content can make finding bug instances
challenging. We present an automated approach that uses machine learning to
predict whether a segment of a gameplay video contains the depiction of a bug.
We analyzed 4,412 segments of 198 gameplay videos to predict whether a segment
contains an instance of a bug. Additionally, we investigated how our approach
performs when applied across different specific genres of video games and on
videos from the same game. We also analyzed the videos in the dataset to
investigate what characteristics of the visual features might explain the
classifier's prediction. Finally, we conducted a user study to examine the
benefits of our automated approach against a manual analysis. Our findings
indicate that our approach is effective at detecting segments of a video that
contain bugs, achieving a high F1 score of 0.88, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art technique for bug classification of gameplay video segments.

<p class="mathjax">We study learning-based design of fair allocation mechanisms for divisible
resources, using proportional fairness (PF) as a benchmark. The learning
setting is a significant departure from the classic mechanism design
literature, in that, we need to learn fair mechanisms solely from data. In
particular, we consider the challenging problem of learning one-shot allocation
mechanisms -- without the use of money -- that incentivize strategic agents to
be truthful when reporting their valuations. It is well-known that the
mechanism that directly seeks to optimize PF is not incentive compatible,
meaning that the agents can potentially misreport their preferences to gain
increased allocations. We introduce the notion of "exploitability" of a
mechanism to measure the relative gain in utility from misreport, and make the
following important contributions in the paper: (i) Using sophisticated
techniques inspired by differentiable convex programming literature, we design
a numerically efficient approach for computing the exploitability of the PF
mechanism. This novel contribution enables us to quantify the gap that needs to
be bridged to approximate PF via incentive compatible mechanisms. (ii) Next, we
modify the PF mechanism to introduce a trade-off between fairness and
exploitability. By properly controlling this trade-off using data, we show that
our proposed mechanism, ExPF-Net, provides a strong approximation to the PF
mechanism while maintaining low exploitability. This mechanism, however, comes
with a high computational cost. (iii) To address the computational challenges,
we propose another mechanism ExS-Net, which is end-to-end parameterized by a
neural network. ExS-Net enjoys similar (slightly inferior) performance and
significantly accelerated training and inference time performance. (iv)
Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the
proposed mechanisms.

outputs of large language models for a range of cognitive biases familiar from
research in judgment and decisionmaking. My aim in this paper is to draw two
lessons from recent discussions of cognitive bias in large language models:
cautious optimism about the prevalence of bias in current models coupled with
an anti-Panglossian willingness to concede the existence of some genuine biases
and work to reduce them. I draw out philosophical implications of this
discussion for the rationality of human cognitive biases as well as the role of
unrepresentative data in driving model biases.

<p class="mathjax">Explainability is a longstanding challenge in deep learning, especially in
high-stakes domains like healthcare. Common explainability methods highlight
image regions that drive an AI model's decision. Humans, however, heavily rely
on language to convey explanations of not only "where" but "what".
Additionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI
predictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in
general. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing,
and potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in
novel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a
vision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual
classification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between
images and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear
combination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its
alignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two
medical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting
descriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of
domain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the
potential for 'shortcut connections' in the public datasets used. Towards a
functional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we
find that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a
specialized medical task at a non-trivial level. Altogether, our results
emphasize the potential of using multimodal foundational models to deliver
intuitive, language-based explanations of visual tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Case studies commonly form the pedagogical backbone in law, ethics, and many
other domains that face complex and ambiguous societal questions informed by
human values. Similar complexities and ambiguities arise when we consider how
AI should be aligned in practice: when faced with vast quantities of diverse
(and sometimes conflicting) values from different individuals and communities,
with whose values is AI to align, and how should AI do so? We propose a
complementary approach to constitutional AI alignment, grounded in ideas from
case-based reasoning (CBR), that focuses on the construction of policies
through judgments on a set of cases. We present a process to assemble such a
case repository by: 1) gathering a set of ``seed'' cases -- questions one may
ask an AI system -- in a particular domain from discussions in online
communities, 2) eliciting domain-specific key dimensions for cases through
workshops with domain experts, 3) using LLMs to generate variations of cases
not seen in the wild, and 4) engaging with the public to judge and improve
cases. We then discuss how such a case repository could assist in AI alignment,
both through directly acting as precedents to ground acceptable behaviors, and
as a medium for individuals and communities to engage in moral reasoning around
AI

<p class="mathjax">Modern IoT and networked systems rely on fast and secure delivery of
time-critical information. Use cases such as teleoperations require fast data
delivery over mobile networks, which despite improvements in 5G are still quite
constrained. Algorithms for encryption and compression provide security and
data size efficiency, but come with time and data size trade-offs. The impact
of these trade-offs is related to the order in which these operations are
applied, and as such necessitates a robust exploration from a performance
perspective. In this paper, we assess several compression and encryption
algorithms, combinations of their execution order, timings and size changes
from such order, and the implications of such changes on 5G teleoperations.
From our assessments we have three major takeaways: (1) Compression-First is
faster and more compressed, except for certain circumstances. (2) In these
specific circumstances, the compression against a raw file leads to a lengthier
time than if applied to an encrypted file first. (3) Applying both encryption
and compression on data samples larger than 10MB is impractical for real time
transmission due to the incurred delay.

<p class="mathjax">Automated driving vehicles~(ADV) promise to enhance driving efficiency and
safety, yet they face intricate challenges in safety-critical scenarios. As a
result, validating ADV within generated safety-critical scenarios is essential
for both development and performance evaluations. This paper investigates the
complexities of employing two major scenario-generation solutions: data-driven
and knowledge-driven methods. Data-driven methods derive scenarios from
recorded datasets, efficiently generating scenarios by altering the existing
behavior or trajectories of traffic participants but often falling short in
considering ADV perception; knowledge-driven methods provide effective coverage
through expert-designed rules, but they may lead to inefficiency in generating
safety-critical scenarios within that coverage. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce BridgeGen, a safety-critical scenario generation framework,
designed to bridge the benefits of both methodologies. Specifically, by
utilizing ontology-based techniques, BridgeGen models the five scenario layers
in the operational design domain (ODD) from knowledge-driven methods, ensuring
broad coverage, and incorporating data-driven strategies to efficiently
generate safety-critical scenarios. An optimized scenario generation toolkit is
developed within BridgeGen. This expedites the crafting of safety-critical
scenarios through a combination of traditional optimization and reinforcement
learning schemes. Extensive experiments conducted using Carla simulator
demonstrate the effectiveness of BridgeGen in generating diverse
safety-critical scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Ensemble learning combines several individual models to obtain better
generalization performance. In this work we present a practical method for
estimating the joint power of several classifiers which differs from existing
approaches by {\em not relying on labels}, hence enabling the work in
unsupervised setting of huge datasets. It differs from existing methods which
define a "diversity measure".
<br />The heart of the method is a combinatorial bound on the number of mistakes
the ensemble is likely to make. The bound can be efficiently approximated in
time linear in the number of samples. Thus allowing an efficient search for a
combination of classifiers that are likely to produce higher joint accuracy.
Moreover, having the bound applicable to unlabeled data makes it both accurate
and practical in modern setting of unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the
method on popular large-scale face recognition datasets which provide a useful
playground for fine-grain classification tasks using noisy data over many
classes.
<br />The proposed framework fits neatly in trending practices of unsupervised
learning. It is a measure of the inherent independence of a set of classifiers
not relying on extra information such as another classifier or labeled data.

response diversity persists. Prior works have addressed this issue via either
novel objective functions, alternative learning approaches such as variational
frameworks, or architectural extensions such as the Randomized Link (RL)
Transformer. However, these approaches typically entail either additional
difficulties during training/inference, or a significant increase in model size
and complexity. Hence, we propose the \underline{Pa}rtially
\underline{Ra}ndomized trans\underline{Former} (PaRaFormer), a simple extension
of the transformer which involves freezing the weights of selected layers after
random initialization. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the
PaRaformer is comparable to that of the aforementioned approaches, despite not

<p class="mathjax">Deception detection is gaining increasing interest due to ethical and
security concerns. This paper explores the application of convolutional neural
networks for the purpose of multimodal deception detection. We use a dataset
built by interviewing 104 subjects about two topics, with one truthful and one
falsified response from each subject about each topic. In particular, we make
three main contributions. First, we extract linguistic and physiological
features from this data to train and construct the neural network models.
Second, we propose a fused convolutional neural network model using both
modalities in order to achieve an improved overall performance. Third, we
compare our new approach with earlier methods designed for multimodal deception
detection. We find that our system outperforms regular classification methods;
our results indicate the feasibility of using neural networks for deception
detection even in the presence of limited amounts of data.

<p class="mathjax">To engage human users in meaningful conversation, open-domain dialogue agents
are required to generate diverse and contextually coherent dialogue. Despite
recent advancements, which can be attributed to the usage of pretrained
language models, the generation of diverse and coherent dialogue remains an
open research problem. A popular approach to address this issue involves the
adaptation of variational frameworks. However, while these approaches
successfully improve diversity, they tend to compromise on contextual
coherence. Hence, we propose the Bayesian Open-domain Dialogue with Empirical
Bayes (BODEB) framework, an empirical bayes framework for constructing an
Bayesian open-domain dialogue agent by leveraging pretrained parameters to
inform the prior and posterior parameter distributions. Empirical results show
that BODEB achieves better results in terms of both diversity and coherence
compared to variational frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems are widely used in various online services, with
embedding-based models being particularly popular due to their expressiveness
in representing complex signals. However, these models often lack
interpretability, making them less reliable and transparent for both users and
developers. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), we find that
their capabilities in language expression, knowledge-aware reasoning, and
instruction following are exceptionally powerful. Based on this, we propose a
new model interpretation approach for recommender systems, by using LLMs as
surrogate models and learn to mimic and comprehend target recommender models.
Specifically, we introduce three alignment methods: behavior alignment,
intention alignment, and hybrid alignment. Behavior alignment operates in the
language space, representing user preferences and item information as text to
learn the recommendation model's behavior; intention alignment works in the
latent space of the recommendation model, using user and item representations
to understand the model's behavior; hybrid alignment combines both language and
latent spaces for alignment training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods, we conduct evaluation from two perspectives: alignment effect, and
explanation generation ability on three public datasets. Experimental results
indicate that our approach effectively enables LLMs to comprehend the patterns
of recommendation models and generate highly credible recommendation
explanations.

<p class="mathjax">The realm of classical phase retrieval concerns itself with the arduous task
of recovering a signal from its Fourier magnitude measurements, which are
fraught with inherent ambiguities. A single-exposure intensity measurement is
commonly deemed insufficient for the reconstruction of the primal signal, given
that the absent phase component is imperative for the inverse transformation.
In this work, we present a novel single-shot phase retrieval paradigm from a
fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) perspective, which involves integrating the
FrFT-based physical measurement model within a self-supervised reconstruction
scheme. Specifically, the proposed FrFT-based measurement model addresses the
aliasing artifacts problem in the numerical calculation of Fresnel diffraction,
featuring adaptability to both short-distance and long-distance propagation
scenarios. Moreover, the intensity measurement in the FrFT domain proves highly
effective in alleviating the ambiguities of phase retrieval and relaxing the
previous conditions on oversampled or multiple measurements in the Fourier
domain. Furthermore, the proposed self-supervised reconstruction approach
harnesses the fast discrete algorithm of FrFT alongside untrained neural
network priors, thereby attaining preeminent results. Through numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that both amplitude and phase objects can be
effectively retrieved from a single-shot intensity measurement using the
proposed approach and provide a promising technique for support-free coherent
diffraction imaging.

<p class="mathjax">Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in surface
defect detection. However, no CNN architecture is suitable for all detection
tasks and designing effective task-specific requires considerable effort. The
neural architecture search (NAS) technology makes it possible to automatically
generate adaptive data-driven networks. Here, we propose a new method called
NAS-ASDet to adaptively design network for surface defect detection. First, a
refined and industry-appropriate search space that can adaptively adjust the
feature distribution is designed, which consists of repeatedly stacked basic
novel cells with searchable attention operations. Then, a progressive search
strategy with a deep supervision mechanism is used to explore the search space
faster and better. This method can design high-performance and lightweight
defect detection networks with data scarcity in industrial scenarios. The
experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior performance and a relatively lighter model size compared to
other competitive methods, including both manual and NAS-based approaches.

a multi-task deep learning model utilizing news texts and NLP techniques. Using
a corpus of over 53,000 news articles from nine African countries over four
years, we demonstrate that our model, trained solely on news data, outperforms
the baseline method trained on both traditional risk factors and human-curated

<p class="mathjax">Honeyword is a representative ``honey" technique to detect intruders by
luring them with decoy data. This kind of honey technique blends a primary
object (from distribution $P$) with decoy samples (from distribution $Q$). In
this research, we focus on two key Honeyword security metrics: the flatness
function and the success-number function. Previous researchers are engaged in
designing experimental methods to estimate their values. We've derived
theoretical formulas on both metrics of the strongest $\mathcal{A}$ using the
optimal guessing strategy, marking a first in the field.
<br />The mathematical structures of these metrics are intriguing: the flatness
function has an expression as
$\epsilon(i)=\sum_{j=1}^{i}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\tbinom{k-1}{j-1}
f(x)G^{k-j}(x)(1-G(x))^{j-1}dx$. In particular, the most important one,
$\epsilon(1)$ is $\frac{1}{k}(M-\int_{0}^{M}G^k(x)dx)+b$, where $M=\max_{x:
Q(x)\neq 0}\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, $b=\sum_{x: Q(x)=0}P(x)$, and $G$ is a
cumulative distribution function derived from $P$ and $Q$. This formula
provides a criterion to compare different honey distributions: the one with
smaller $M$ and $b$ is more satisfactory. The mathematical structure of the
success-number function is a series of convolutions with beta distribution
kernels: $\lambda_U(i)=U\sum_{j=1}^{i}\int_{\frac{1}{k}}^{1}
\frac{\phi(x)}{1-\phi(x)} \tbinom{U-1}{j-1} x^{U-j}(1-x)^{j-1}dx$, where $U$ is
the number of users in the system and $\phi(x)$ is a monotonically increasing
function. For further elaboration, we made some representative calculations.
Our findings offer insights into security assessments for Honeyword and similar
honey techniques, contributing to enhanced security measures in these systems.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI has significantly reduced the entry barrier to the domain of AI
owing to the ease of use and core capabilities of automation, translation, and
intelligent actions in our day to day lives. Currently, Large language models
(LLMs) that power such chatbots are being utilized primarily for their
automation capabilities for software monitoring, report generation etc. and for
specific personalized question answering capabilities, on a limited scope and
scale. One major limitation of the currently evolving family of LLMs is
'hallucinations', wherein inaccurate responses are reported as factual.
Hallucinations are primarily caused by biased training data, ambiguous prompts
and inaccurate LLM parameters, and they majorly occur while combining
mathematical facts with language-based context. Thus, monitoring and
controlling for hallucinations becomes necessary when designing solutions that
are meant for decision makers. In this work we present the three major stages
in the journey of designing hallucination-minimized LLM-based solutions that
are specialized for the decision makers of the financial domain, namely:
prototyping, scaling and LLM evolution using human feedback. These three stages
and the novel data to answer generation modules presented in this work are
necessary to ensure that the Generative AI chatbots, autonomous reports and
alerts are reliable and high-quality to aid key decision-making processes.

<p class="mathjax">The persistent battle to decrease childhood mortality serves as a commonly
employed benchmark for gauging advancements in the field of medicine. Globally,
the under-5 mortality rate stands at approximately 5 million, with a
significant portion of these deaths being avoidable. Given the significance of
this problem, Machine learning-based techniques have emerged as a prominent
tool for assessing fetal health. In this work, we have analyzed the
classification performance of various machine learning models for fetal health
analysis. Classification performance of various machine learning models, such
as support vector machine (SVM), random forest(RF), and attentive interpretable
tabular learning (TabNet) have been assessed on fetal health. Moreover,
dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal component analysis (PCA)
and Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) have been implemented to obtain better
classification performance with less number of features. A TabNet model on a
fetal health dataset provides a classification accuracy of 94.36%. In general,
this technology empowers doctors and healthcare experts to achieve precise
fetal health classification and identify the most influential features in the
process.

<p class="mathjax">We discuss the problem of learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)
from a confidence oracle. That is, we are given access to an oracle $Q$ with
incomplete knowledge of some target language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$; the
oracle maps a string $x\in\Sigma^*$ to a score in the interval $[-1,1]$
indicating its confidence that the string is in the language. The
interpretation is that the sign of the score signifies whether $x\in L$, while
the magnitude $|Q(x)|$ represents the oracle's confidence. Our goal is to learn
a DFA representation of the oracle that preserves the information that it is
confident in. The learned DFA should closely match the oracle wherever it is
highly confident, but it need not do this when the oracle is less sure of
itself.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the complexity of training a two-layer ReLU neural network
with weight decay regularization. Previous research has shown that the optimal
solution of this problem can be found by solving a standard cone-constrained
convex program. Using this convex formulation, we prove that the hardness of
approximation of ReLU networks not only mirrors the complexity of the Max-Cut
problem but also, in certain special cases, exactly corresponds to it. In
particular, when $\epsilon\leq\sqrt{84/83}-1\approx 0.006$, we show that it is
NP-hard to find an approximate global optimizer of the ReLU network objective
with relative error $\epsilon$ with respect to the objective value. Moreover,
we develop a randomized algorithm which mirrors the Goemans-Williamson rounding
of semidefinite Max-Cut relaxations. To provide polynomial-time approximations,
we classify training datasets into three categories: (i) For orthogonal
separable datasets, a precise solution can be obtained in polynomial-time. (ii)
When there is a negative correlation between samples of different classes, we
give a polynomial-time approximation with relative error $\sqrt{\pi/2}-1\approx
0.253$. (iii) For general datasets, the degree to which the problem can be
approximated in polynomial-time is governed by a geometric factor that controls
the diameter of two zonotopes intrinsic to the dataset. To our knowledge, these
results present the first polynomial-time approximation guarantees along with
first hardness of approximation results for regularized ReLU networks.

<p class="mathjax">Discussing research-sensemaking questions on Community Question and Answering
(CQA) platforms has been an increasingly common practice for the public to
participate in science communication. Nonetheless, how users strategically
craft research-sensemaking questions to engage public participation and
facilitate knowledge construction is a significant yet less understood problem.
To fill this gap, we collected 837 science-related questions and 157,684
answers from Zhihu, and conducted a mixed-methods study to explore
user-developed strategies in proposing research-sensemaking questions, and
their potential effects on public engagement and knowledge construction.
Through open coding, we captured a comprehensive taxonomy of question-crafting
strategies, such as eyecatching narratives with counter-intuitive claims and
rigorous descriptions with data use. Regression analysis indicated that these
strategies correlated with user engagement and answer construction in different
ways (e.g., emotional questions attracted more views and answers), yet there
existed a general divergence between wide participation and quality knowledge
establishment, when most questioning strategies could not ensure both. Based on
log analysis, we further found that collaborative editing afforded unique
values in refining research-sensemaking questions regarding accuracy, rigor,
comprehensiveness and attractiveness. We propose design implications to
facilitate accessible, accurate and engaging science communication on CQA
platforms.

communicating situational information and emotions during health crises.
Despite its prevalence and significance in informational dissemination and
emotional connection, there lacks a comprehensive understanding of visual
crisis communication in the aftermath of a pandemic which is characterized by
uncertain local situations and emotional fatigue. To fill this gap, this work
collected 345,423 crisis-related posts and 65,376 original images during the
Xi'an COVID-19 local outbreak in China, and adopted a mixed-methods approach to
understanding themes, goals, and strategies of crisis imagery. Image clustering
captured the diversity of visual themes during the outbreak, such as text
images embedding authoritative guidelines and ``visual diaries'' recording and
sharing the quarantine life. Through text classification of the post that
visuals were situated in, we found that different visual themes highly
correlated with the informational and emotional goals of the post text, such as
adopting text images to convey the latest policies and sharing food images to
express anxiety. We further unpacked nuanced strategies of crisis image use
through inductive coding, such as signifying authority and triggering empathy.
We discuss the opportunities and challenges of crisis imagery and provide
design implications to facilitate effective visual crisis communication.

<p class="mathjax">Creating high-dynamic videos such as motion-rich actions and sophisticated
visual effects poses a significant challenge in the field of artificial
intelligence. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art video generation methods,
primarily focusing on text-to-video generation, tend to produce video clips
with minimal motions despite maintaining high fidelity. We argue that relying
solely on text instructions is insufficient and suboptimal for video
generation. In this paper, we introduce PixelDance, a novel approach based on
diffusion models that incorporates image instructions for both the first and
last frames in conjunction with text instructions for video generation.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that PixelDance trained with
public data exhibits significantly better proficiency in synthesizing videos
with complex scenes and intricate motions, setting a new standard for video

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we aim to improve the 3D reasoning ability of Transformers in
multi-view 3D human pose estimation. Recent works have focused on end-to-end
learning-based transformer designs, which struggle to resolve geometric
information accurately, particularly during occlusion. Instead, we propose a
novel hybrid model, MVGFormer, which has a series of geometric and appearance
modules organized in an iterative manner. The geometry modules are
learning-free and handle all viewpoint-dependent 3D tasks geometrically which
notably improves the model's generalization ability. The appearance modules are
learnable and are dedicated to estimating 2D poses from image signals
end-to-end which enables them to achieve accurate estimates even when occlusion
occurs, leading to a model that is both accurate and generalizable to new
cameras and geometries. We evaluate our approach for both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, where our model consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, and especially does so by a significant margin in the
out-of-domain setting. We will release the code and models:

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of black hole search by a set of mobile agents, where
the underlying graph is a dynamic cactus. A black hole is a dangerous vertex in
the graph that eliminates any visiting agent without leaving any trace behind.
Key parameters that dictate the complexity of finding the black hole include:
the number of agents required (termed as \textit{size}), the number of moves
performed by the agents in order to determine the black hole location (termed
as \textit{move}) and the \textit{time} (or round) taken to terminate. This
problem has already been studied where the underlying graph is a dynamic ring
\cite{di2021black}. In this paper, we extend the same problem to a dynamic
cactus. We introduce two categories of dynamicity, but still the underlying
graph needs to be connected: first, we examine the scenario where, at most, one
dynamic edge can disappear or reappear at any round. Secondly, we consider the
problem for at most $k$ dynamic edges. In both scenarios, we establish lower
and upper bounds for the necessary number of agents, moves and rounds.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely deployed on IoT devices with the
help of advancements in DL algorithms and chips. However, the limited resources
of edge devices make these on-device DL models hard to be generalizable to
diverse environments and tasks. Although the recently emerged foundation models
(FMs) show impressive generalization power, how to effectively leverage the
rich knowledge of FMs on resource-limited edge devices is still not explored.
In this paper, we propose EdgeFM, a novel edge-cloud cooperative system with
open-set recognition capability. EdgeFM selectively uploads unlabeled data to
query the FM on the cloud and customizes the specific knowledge and
architectures for edge models. Meanwhile, EdgeFM conducts dynamic model
switching at run-time taking into account both data uncertainty and dynamic
network variations, which ensures the accuracy always close to the original FM.
We implement EdgeFM using two FMs on two edge platforms. We evaluate EdgeFM on
three public datasets and two self-collected datasets. Results show that EdgeFM
can reduce the end-to-end latency up to 3.2x and achieve 34.3% accuracy
increase compared with the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Graph Generation (SGG) offers a structured representation critical in
many computer vision applications. Traditional SGG approaches, however, are
limited by a closed-set assumption, restricting their ability to recognize only
predefined object and relation categories. To overcome this, we categorize SGG
scenarios into four distinct settings based on the node and edge: Closed-set
SGG, Open Vocabulary (object) Detection-based SGG (OvD-SGG), Open Vocabulary
Relation-based SGG (OvR-SGG), and Open Vocabulary Detection + Relation-based
SGG (OvD+R-SGG). While object-centric open vocabulary SGG has been studied
recently, the more challenging problem of relation-involved open-vocabulary SGG
remains relatively unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a unified framework
named OvSGTR towards fully open vocabulary SGG from a holistic view. The
proposed framework is an end-toend transformer architecture, which learns a
visual-concept alignment for both nodes and edges, enabling the model to
recognize unseen categories. For the more challenging settings of
relation-involved open vocabulary SGG, the proposed approach integrates
relation-aware pre-training utilizing image-caption data and retains
visual-concept alignment through knowledge distillation. Comprehensive
experimental results on the Visual Genome benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the
unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at
the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism.
Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues
that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally
left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this
centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed
quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma
is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization
and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related
tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the
NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and
collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential
solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial
scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on
the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of
the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve
the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about
the future of NFT and decentralization.

<p class="mathjax">Visual prompting, an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown its
potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP from
standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the scenario
of a robust source model: Whether a visual prompt derived from a robust model
can inherit the robustness while suffering from the generalization performance
decline, albeit for a downstream dataset that is different from the source
dataset? In this work, we get an affirmative answer of the above question and
give an explanation on the visual representation level. Moreover, we introduce
a novel technique named Prompt Boundary Loose (PBL) to effectively mitigates
the suboptimal results of visual prompt on standard accuracy without losing (or
even significantly improving) its adversarial robustness when using a robust
model as source model. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that
our findings are universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of our
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">The last few years have witnessed great success on image generation, which
has crossed the acceptance thresholds of aesthetics, making it directly
applicable to personal and commercial applications. However, images, especially
in marketing and advertising applications, are often created as a means to an
end as opposed to just aesthetic concerns. The goal can be increasing sales,
getting more clicks, likes, or image sales (in the case of stock businesses).
Therefore, the generated images need to perform well on these key performance
indicators (KPIs), in addition to being aesthetically good. In this paper, we
make the first endeavor to answer the question of "How can one infuse the
knowledge of the end-goal within the image generation process itself to create
not just better-looking images but also "better-performing'' images?''. We
propose BoigLLM, an LLM that understands both image content and user behavior.
BoigLLM knows how an image should look to get a certain required KPI. We show
that BoigLLM outperforms 13x larger models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in this
task, demonstrating that while these state-of-the-art models can understand
images, they lack information on how these images perform in the real world. To
generate actual pixels of behavior-conditioned images, we train a
diffusion-based model (BoigSD) to align with a proposed BoigLLM-defined reward.
We show the performance of the overall pipeline on two datasets covering two
different behaviors: a stock dataset with the number of forward actions as the
KPI and a dataset containing tweets with the total likes as the KPI, denoted as
BoigBench. To advance research in the direction of utility-driven image
generation and understanding, we release BoigBench, a benchmark dataset
containing 168 million enterprise tweets with their media, brand account names,
time of post, and total likes.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential to the
early prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Non-invasive and cuff-less BP
estimation algorithm has gained much attention in recent years. Previous
studies have demonstrated that brain bio-impedance (BIOZ) is a promising
technique for non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Clinically,
treatment for patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) requires monitoring
the ICP and BP of patients simultaneously. Estimating BP by brain BIOZ directly
can reduce the number of sensors attached to the patients, thus improving their
comfort. To address the issues, in this study, we explore the feasibility of
leveraging brain BIOZ for BP estimation and propose a novel cuff-less BP
estimation approach called BrainZ-BP. Two electrodes are placed on the forehead
and occipital bone of the head in the anterior-posterior direction for brain
BIOZ measurement. Various features including pulse transit time and
morphological features of brain BIOZ are extracted and fed into four regression
models for BP estimation. Results show that the mean absolute error, root mean
square error, and correlation coefficient of random forest regression model are
2.17 mmHg, 3.91 mmHg, and 0.90 for systolic pressure estimation, and are 1.71
mmHg, 3.02 mmHg, and 0.89 for diastolic pressure estimation. The presented
BrainZ-BP can be applied in the brain BIOZ-based ICP monitoring scenario to
monitor BP simultaneously.

more effectively with the environment and to anticipate or predict objects that
may not be immediately apparent in their perceptual field. In this paper, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach called $LMOD$ ( Label-based
Missing Object Detection) to teach scene contextual knowledge to machines using
an attention mechanism. A distinctive aspect of the proposed approach is its
reliance solely on labels from image datasets to teach scene context, entirely
eliminating the need for the actual image itself. We show how scene-wide
relationships among different objects can be learned using a self-attention
mechanism. We further show that the contextual knowledge gained from label

<p class="mathjax">Every human has their own name, a fundamental aspect of their identity and
cultural heritage. The name often conveys a wealth of information, including
details about an individual's background, ethnicity, and, especially, their
gender. By detecting gender through the analysis of names, researchers can
unlock valuable insights into linguistic patterns and cultural norms, which can
be applied to practical applications. Hence, this work presents a novel dataset
for Japanese name gender detection comprising 64,139 full names in romaji,
hiragana, and kanji forms, along with their biological genders. Moreover, we
propose Gendec, a framework for gender detection from Japanese names that
leverages diverse approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques
or cutting-edge transfer learning models, to predict the gender associated with
Japanese names accurately. Through a thorough investigation, the proposed
framework is expected to be effective and serve potential applications in
various domains.

models with state-of-the-art performance in many applications. In this paper,
we establish convergence guarantees for a general class of SGMs in
2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth
log-concave data distribution. We specialize our result to several concrete
SGMs with specific choices of forward processes modelled by stochastic
differential equations, and obtain an upper bound on the iteration complexity
for each model, which demonstrates the impacts of different choices of the
forward processes. We also provide a lower bound when the data distribution is
Gaussian. Numerically, we experiment SGMs with different forward processes,
some of which are newly proposed in this paper, for unconditional image
generation on CIFAR-10. We find that the experimental results are in good
agreement with our theoretical predictions on the iteration complexity, and the
models with our newly proposed forward processes can outperform existing

<p class="mathjax">Robot manipulation in a physically-constrained environment requires compliant
manipulation. Compliant manipulation is a manipulation skill to adjust hand
motion based on the force imposed by the environment. Recently, reinforcement
learning (RL) has been applied to solve household operations involving
compliant manipulation. However, previous RL methods have primarily focused on
designing a policy for a specific operation that limits their applicability and
requires separate training for every new operation. We propose a
constraint-aware policy that is applicable to various unseen manipulations by
grouping several manipulations together based on the type of physical
constraint involved. The type of physical constraint determines the
characteristic of the imposed force direction; thus, a generalized policy is
trained in the environment and reward designed on the basis of this
characteristic. This paper focuses on two types of physical constraints:
prismatic and revolute joints. Experiments demonstrated that the same policy
could successfully execute various compliant-manipulation operations, both in
the simulation and reality. We believe this study is the first step toward
realizing a generalized household-robot.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions for each utterance
of multiple modalities, which has received increasing attention for its
application in human-machine interaction. Current graph-based methods fail to
simultaneously depict global contextual features and local diverse uni-modal
features in a dialogue. Furthermore, with the number of graph layers
increasing, they easily fall into over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a
method for joint modality fusion and graph contrastive learning for multimodal
emotion recognition (Joyful), where multimodality fusion, contrastive learning,
and emotion recognition are jointly optimized. Specifically, we first design a
new multimodal fusion mechanism that can provide deep interaction and fusion
between the global contextual and uni-modal specific features. Then, we
introduce a graph contrastive learning framework with inter-view and intra-view
contrastive losses to learn more distinguishable representations for samples
with different sentiments. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
indicate that Joyful achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to
all baselines.

<p class="mathjax">While Large Language Models (LLMs) become ever more dominant, classic
pre-trained word embeddings sustain their relevance through computational
efficiency and nuanced linguistic interpretation. Drawing from recent studies
demonstrating that the convergence of GloVe and word2vec optimizations all tend
towards log-co-occurrence matrix variants, we construct a novel word
representation system called Bit-cipher that eliminates the need of
backpropagation while leveraging contextual information and hyper-efficient
dimensionality reduction techniques based on unigram frequency, providing
strong interpretability, alongside efficiency. We use the bit-cipher algorithm
to train word vectors via a two-step process that critically relies on a
hyperparameter -- bits -- that controls the vector dimension. While the first
step trains the bit-cipher, the second utilizes it under two different
aggregation modes -- summation or concatenation -- to produce contextually rich
representations from word co-occurrences. We extend our investigation into
bit-cipher's efficacy, performing probing experiments on part-of-speech (POS)
tagging and named entity recognition (NER) to assess its competitiveness with
classic embeddings like word2vec and GloVe. Additionally, we explore its
applicability in LM training and fine-tuning. By replacing embedding layers
with cipher embeddings, our experiments illustrate the notable efficiency of

<p class="mathjax">Implicit neural SLAM has achieved remarkable progress recently. Nevertheless,
existing methods face significant challenges in non-ideal scenarios, such as
motion blur or lighting variation, which often leads to issues like convergence
failures, localization drifts, and distorted mapping. To address these
challenges, we propose $\textbf{EN-SLAM}$, the first event-RGBD implicit neural
SLAM framework, which effectively leverages the high rate and high dynamic
range advantages of event data for tracking and mapping. Specifically, EN-SLAM
proposes a differentiable CRF (Camera Response Function) rendering technique to
generate distinct RGB and event camera data via a shared radiance field, which
is optimized by learning a unified implicit representation with the captured
event and RGBD supervision. Moreover, based on the temporal difference property
of events, we propose a temporal aggregating optimization strategy for the
event joint tracking and global bundle adjustment, capitalizing on the
consecutive difference constraints of events, significantly enhancing tracking
accuracy and robustness. Finally, we construct the simulated dataset
$\textbf{DEV-Indoors}$ and real captured dataset $\textbf{DEV-Reals}$
containing 6 scenes, 17 sequences with practical motion blur and lighting
changes for evaluations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
the SOTA methods in both tracking ATE and mapping ACC with a real-time $17$ FPS
in various challenging environments. The code and dataset will be released upon
the paper publication.

<p class="mathjax">A variety of computing platform like Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA),
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) in
data centers are suitable for acceleration of data-intensive workloads.
Especially, FPGA platforms in data centers are gaining popularity for
high-performance computations due to their high speed, reconfigurable nature
and cost effectiveness. Such heterogeneous, highly parallel computational
architectures in data centers, combined with high-speed communication
technologies like 5G, are becoming increasingly suitable for real-time
applications. However, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, high computational
capabilities, and energy efficiency remain challenging issues in FPGA based
data centers. In this context an energy efficient scheduling solution is
required to maximize the resource profitability of FPGA. This paper introduces
a power-aware scheduling methodology aimed at accommodating periodic hardware
tasks within the available FPGAs of a data center at their potentially maximum
speed. This proposed methodology guarantees the execution of these tasks us ing
the maximum number of parallel computation units possible to implement in the
FPGAs, with minimum power consumption. The proposed scheduling methodology is
implemented in a data center with multiple Alveo-50 Xilinx-AMD FPGAs and Vitis
2023 tool. The evidence from the implementation shows the proposed scheduling
methodology is efficient compared to existing solutions.

<p class="mathjax">We propose SNI-SLAM, a semantic SLAM system utilizing neural implicit
representation, that simultaneously performs accurate semantic mapping,
high-quality surface reconstruction, and robust camera tracking. In this
system, we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level
semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene.
In addition, to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of
the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features
through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more
multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to
remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then, we design an
internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, Truncated Signed
Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding.
Furthermore, we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at
the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth
loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a
higher-level. Our SNI-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over all
recent NeRF-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on
Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in
accurate semantic segmentation and real-time semantic mapping.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples, which
introduce imperceptible perturbations to benign samples, deceiving DNN
predictions. While some attack methods excel in the white-box setting, they
often struggle in the black-box scenario, particularly against models fortified
with defense mechanisms. Various techniques have emerged to enhance the
transferability of adversarial attacks for the black-box scenario. Among these,
input transformation-based attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness. In
this paper, we explore the potential of leveraging data generated by Stable
Diffusion to boost adversarial transferability. This approach draws inspiration
from recent research that harnessed synthetic data generated by Stable
Diffusion to enhance model generalization. In particular, previous work has
highlighted the correlation between the presence of both real and synthetic
data and improved model generalization. Building upon this insight, we
introduce a novel attack method called Stable Diffusion Attack Method (SDAM),
which incorporates samples generated by Stable Diffusion to augment input
images. Furthermore, we propose a fast variant of SDAM to reduce computational
overhead while preserving high adversarial transferability. Our extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by a substantial margin. Moreover, our approach is compatible with
existing transfer-based attacks to further enhance adversarial transferability.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a self-supervised approach to anomaly detection in tabular data.
Random transformations are applied to the data, and then each transformation is
identified based on its output. These predicted transformations are used to
identify anomalies. In tabular data this approach faces many challenges that
are related to the uncorrelated nature of the data. These challenges affect the
transformations that should be used, as well as the use of their predictions.
To this end, we propose SORTAD, a novel algorithm that is tailor-made to solve
these challenges. SORTAD optimally chooses random transformations that help the
classification process, and have a scoring function that is more sensitive to
the changes in the transformations classification prediction encountered in
tabular data. SORTAD achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple commonly
used anomaly detection data sets, as well as in the overall results across all
data sets tested.

<p class="mathjax">Learning fine-grained embeddings from coarse labels is a challenging task due
to limited label granularity supervision, i.e., lacking the detailed
distinctions required for fine-grained tasks. The task becomes even more
demanding when attempting few-shot fine-grained recognition, which holds
practical significance in various applications. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel method that embeds visual embeddings into a hyperbolic space
and enhances their discriminative ability with a hierarchical cosine margins
manner. Specifically, the hyperbolic space offers distinct advantages,
including the ability to capture hierarchical relationships and increased
expressive power, which favors modeling fine-grained objects. Based on the
hyperbolic space, we further enforce relatively large/small similarity margins
between coarse/fine classes, respectively, yielding the so-called hierarchical
cosine margins manner. While enforcing similarity margins in the regular
Euclidean space has become popular for deep embedding learning, applying it to
the hyperbolic space is non-trivial and validating the benefit for
coarse-to-fine generalization is valuable. Extensive experiments conducted on
five benchmark datasets showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method,
yielding state-of-the-art results surpassing competing methods.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, technology has advanced considerably with the introduction
of many systems including advanced robotics, big data analytics, cloud
computing, machine learning and many more. The opportunities to exploit the yet
to come security that comes with these systems are going toe to toe with new
releases of security protocols to combat this exploitation to provide a secure
system. The digitization of our lives proves to solve our human problems as
well as improve quality of life but because it is digitalized, information and
technology could be misused for other malicious gains. Hackers aim to steal the
data of innocent people to use it for other causes such as identity fraud,
scams and many more. This issue can be corrected during the software
development life cycle, integrating security across the development phases, and
testing of the software is done early to reduce the number of vulnerabilities
that might or might not heavily impact an organisation depending on the range
of the attack. The goal of a secured system software is to prevent such
exploitations from ever happening by conducting a system life cycle where
through planning and testing is done to maximise security while maintaining
functionality of the system. In this paper, we are going to discuss the recent
trends in security for system development as well as our predictions and
suggestions to improve the current security practices in this industry.

<p class="mathjax">Distribution shifts are characterized by differences between the training and
test data distributions. They can significantly reduce the accuracy of machine
learning models deployed in real-world scenarios. This paper explores the
distribution shift problem when classifying pollen grains from microscopic
images collected in the wild with a low-cost camera sensor. We leverage the
domain knowledge that geometric features are highly important for accurate
pollen identification and introduce two novel geometric image augmentation
techniques to significantly narrow the accuracy gap between the model
performance on the train and test datasets. In particular, we show that
Tenengrad and ImageToSketch filters are highly effective to balance the shape
and texture information while leaving out unimportant details that may confuse
the model. Extensive evaluations on various model architectures demonstrate a
consistent improvement of the model generalization to field data of up to 14%
achieved by the geometric augmentation techniques when compared to a wide range
of standard image augmentations. The approach is validated through an ablation
study using pollen hydration tests to recover the shape of dry pollen grains.
The proposed geometric augmentations also receive the highest scores according
to the affinity and diversity measures from the literature.

<p class="mathjax">While users tend to perceive instructional videos as an experience rather
than a lesson with a set of instructions, instructional videos are more
effective and appealing than textual user manuals and eliminate the ambiguity
in text-based descriptions. However, most software vendors only offer document
manuals that describe how to install and use their software, leading burden for
non-professionals to comprehend the instructions. In this paper, we present a
framework called M2V to generate instructional videos automatically based on
the provided instructions and images in user manuals. M2V is a two-step
framework. First, an action sequence is extracted from the given user manual
via natural language processing and computer vision techniques. Second, M2V
operates the software sequentially based on the extracted actions; meanwhile,
the operation procedure is recorded into an instructional video. We evaluate
the usability of automatically generated instructional videos via user studies
and an online survey. The evaluation results show, with our toolkit, the
generated instructional videos can better assist non-professional end users
with the software operations. Moreover, more than 85% of survey participants
prefer to use the instructional videos rather than the original user manuals.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates a multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) uplink system in
which each user is equipped with a multi-antenna fluid antenna system (FAS)
while the base station (BS) has multiple fixed-position antennas. Our primary
objective is to maximize the system capacity by optimizing the transmit
covariance matrices and the antenna position vectors of the users jointly. To
gain deeper insights, we commence by deriving upper bounds and approximations
for the maximum capacity. Then we delve into the capacity maximization problem.
Beginning with the simple scenario of a single user equipped with a
single-antenna FAS, we reveal that a closed-form optimal solution exists when
there are only two propagation paths between the user and the BS. In the case
where multiple propagation paths are present, a near-optimal solution can be
obtained through a one-dimensional search method. Expanding our focus to
multiuser cases, where users are equipped with either single- or multi-antenna
FAS, we show that the original capacity maximization problems can be
reformulated into distinct rank-one programmings. Then, we propose alternating
optimization algorithms to deal with the transformed problems. Simulation
results indicate that FAS can improve the capacity of the multiple access (MAC)
system greatly, and the proposed algorithms outperform all the benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Synthetic data is being used lately for training deep neural networks in
computer vision applications such as object detection, object segmentation and
6D object pose estimation. Domain randomization hereby plays an important role
in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might
not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving
complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images,
are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from
their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just
enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these
cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a
considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper
focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used
in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation
and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in
a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using
combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in
this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production
using artificial intelligence.

<p class="mathjax">This letter investigates the challenge of channel estimation in a multiuser
millimeter-wave (mmWave) time-division duplexing (TDD) system. In this system,
the base station (BS) employs a multi-antenna uniform linear array (ULA), while
each mobile user is equipped with a fluid antenna system (FAS). Accurate
channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in the precise placement
of antennas in FAS. Traditional channel estimation methods designed for
fixed-antenna systems are inadequate due to the high dimensionality of FAS. To
address this issue, we propose a low-sample-size sparse channel reconstruction
(L3SCR) method, capitalizing on the sparse propagation paths characteristic of
mmWave channels. In this approach, each fluid antenna only needs to switch and
measure the channel at a few specific locations. By observing this
reduced-dimensional data, we can effectively extract angular and gain
information related to the sparse channel, enabling us to reconstruct the full
CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method allows us to
obtain precise CSI with minimal hardware switching and pilot overhead. As a
result, the system sum-rate approaches the upper bound achievable with perfect
CSI.

<p class="mathjax">Orca 1 learns from rich signals, such as explanation traces, allowing it to
outperform conventional instruction-tuned models on benchmarks like BigBench
Hard and AGIEval. In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training
signals can enhance smaller LMs' reasoning abilities. Research on training
small LMs has often relied on imitation learning to replicate the output of
more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on imitation may
restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to employ
different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from
the one used by the larger model. For example, while larger models might
provide a direct answer to a complex task, smaller models may not have the same
capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques
(step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer,
etc.). More crucially, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most
effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a
comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100
tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of
similar size and attains performance levels similar or better to those of
models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning
abilities in zero-shot settings. We open-source Orca 2 to encourage further
research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs.

<p class="mathjax">We present CLIPSwarm, an algorithm to generate robot swarm formations from
natural language descriptions. CLIPSwarm receives an input text and finds the
position of the robots to form a shape that corresponds to the given text. To
do so, we implement a variation of the Montecarlo particle filter to obtain a
matching formation iteratively. In every iteration, we generate a set of new
formations and evaluate their Clip Similarity with the given text, selecting
the best formations according to this metric. This metric is obtained using
Clip, [1], an existing foundation model trained to encode images and texts into
vectors within a common latent space. The comparison between these vectors
determines how likely the given text describes the shapes. Our initial proof of
concept shows the potential of this solution to generate robot swarm formations
just from natural language descriptions and demonstrates a novel application of
foundation models, such as CLIP, in the field of multi-robot systems. In this
first approach, we create formations using a Convex-Hull approach. Next steps
include more robust and generic representation and optimization steps in the
process of obtaining a suitable swarm formation.

<p class="mathjax">AI-based medical technologies, including wearables, telemedicine, LLMs, and
digital care twins, significantly impact healthcare. Ensuring AI results are
accurate and interpretable is crucial, especially for clinicians. This paper
reviews processes and challenges of interpretable ML (IML) and explainable AI
(XAI) in healthcare. Objectives include reviewing XAI processes, methods,
applications, and challenges, with a focus on quality control. The IML process
is classified into data pre-processing interpretability, interpretable
modeling, and post-processing interpretability. The paper aims to establish the
importance of robust interpretability in healthcare through experimental
results, providing insights for creating communicable clinician-AI tools.
Research questions, eligibility criteria, and goals were identified following
PRISMA and PICO methods. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically
searched using specific strings. The survey introduces a step-by-step roadmap
for implementing XAI in clinical applications, addressing existing gaps and
acknowledging XAI model limitations.

<p class="mathjax">Simulators have irreplaceable importance for the research and development of
autonomous driving. Besides saving resources, labor, and time, simulation is
the only feasible way to reproduce many severe accident scenarios. Despite
their widespread adoption across academia and industry, there is an absence in
the evolutionary trajectory of simulators and critical discourse on their
limitations.
<br />To bridge the gap in research, this paper conducts an in-depth review of
simulators for autonomous driving. It delineates the three-decade development
into three stages: specialized development period, gap period, and
comprehensive development, from which it detects a trend of implementing
comprehensive functionalities and open-source accessibility. Then it classifies
the simulators by functions, identifying five categories: traffic flow
simulator, vehicle dynamics simulator, scenario editor, sensory data generator,
and driving strategy validator. Simulators that amalgamate diverse features are
defined as comprehensive simulators. By investigating commercial and
open-source simulators, this paper reveals that the critical issues faced by
simulators primarily revolve around fidelity and efficiency concerns. This
paper justifies that enhancing the realism of adverse weather simulation,
automated map reconstruction, and interactive traffic participants will bolster
credibility. Concurrently, headless simulation and multiple-speed simulation
techniques will exploit the theoretic advantages. Moreover, this paper delves
into potential solutions for the identified issues. It explores qualitative and
quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the simulator's performance. This
paper guides users to find suitable simulators efficiently and provides
instructive suggestions for developers to improve simulator efficacy
purposefully.

<p class="mathjax">With the rise of electronic data, particularly Earth observation data,
data-based geospatial modelling using machine learning (ML) has gained
popularity in environmental research. Accurate geospatial predictions are vital
for domain research based on ecosystem monitoring and quality assessment and
for policy-making and action planning, considering effective management of
natural resources. The accuracy and computation speed of ML has generally
proved efficient. However, many questions have yet to be addressed to obtain
precise and reproducible results suitable for further use in both research and
practice. A better understanding of the ML concepts applicable to geospatial
problems enhances the development of data science tools providing transparent
information crucial for making decisions on global challenges such as biosphere
degradation and climate change. This survey reviews common nuances in
geospatial modelling, such as imbalanced data, spatial autocorrelation,
prediction errors, model generalisation, domain specificity, and uncertainty
estimation. We provide an overview of techniques and popular programming tools
to overcome or account for the challenges. We also discuss prospects for
geospatial Artificial Intelligence in environmental applications.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce HIDRO-VQA, a no-reference (NR) video quality assessment model
designed to provide precise quality evaluations of High Dynamic Range (HDR)
videos. HDR videos exhibit a broader spectrum of luminance, detail, and color
than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos. As HDR content becomes increasingly
popular, there is a growing demand for video quality assessment (VQA)
algorithms that effectively address distortions unique to HDR content. To
address this challenge, we propose a self-supervised contrastive fine-tuning
approach to transfer quality-aware features from the SDR to the HDR domain,
utilizing unlabeled HDR videos. Our findings demonstrate that self-supervised
pre-trained neural networks on SDR content can be further fine-tuned in a
self-supervised setting using limited unlabeled HDR videos to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the only publicly available VQA database for
HDR content, the LIVE-HDR VQA database. Moreover, our algorithm can be extended
to the Full Reference VQA setting, also achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Our code is available publicly at https://github.com/avinabsaha/HIDRO-VQA.

<p class="mathjax">Answering the shortest-path distance between two arbitrary locations is a
fundamental problem in road networks. Labelling-based solutions are the current
state-of-the-arts to render fast response time, which can generally be
categorised into hub-based labellings, highway-based labellings, and tree
decomposition labellings. Hub-based and highway-based labellings exploit
hierarchical structures of road networks with the aim to reduce labelling size
for improving query efficiency. However, these solutions still result in large
search spaces on distance labels at query time, particularly when road networks
are large. Tree decomposition labellings leverage a hierarchy of vertices to
reduce search spaces over distance labels at query time, but such a hierarchy
is generated using tree decomposition techniques, which may yield very large
labelling sizes and slow querying. In this paper, we propose a novel solution
\emph{hierarchical cut 2-hop labelling (HC2L)} to address the drawbacks of the
existing works. Our solution combines the benefits of hierarchical structures
from both perspectives - reduce the size of a distance labelling at
preprocessing time and further reduce the search space on a distance labelling
at query time. At its core, we propose a new hierarchy, \emph{balanced tree
hierarchy}, which enables a fast, efficient data structure to reduce the size
of distance labelling and to select a very small subset of labels to compute
the shortest-path distance at query time. To speed up the construction process
of HC2L, we further propose a parallel variant of our method, namely HC2L$^p$.
We have evaluated our solution on 10 large real-world road networks through
extensive experiments.

<p class="mathjax">The HOM-problem, which asks whether the image of a regular tree language
under a tree homomorphism is again regular, is known to be decidable. Since
then, weighted versions of this problem for different semirings have also been
investigated. In this paper, we prove the weighted HOM-problem for all fields
decidable, provided that the tree homomorphism is tetris-free (a condition that
generalizes injectivity). To this end, we reduce the problem to a property of
the device representing the homomorphic image in question; to prove this
property decidable, we then derive a pumping lemma for such devices from the
well-known pumping lemma for regular tree series over fields, proved by Berstel
and Reutenauer in 1982.

<p class="mathjax">In distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems,
multiple geographically separated access points (APs) communicate
simultaneously with a user, leveraging the benefits of multi-antenna coherent
MIMO processing and macro-diversity gains from the distributed setups. However,
time and frequency synchronization of the multiple APs is crucial to achieve
good performance and enable joint precoding. In this paper, we analyze the
synchronization requirement among multiple APs from a reciprocity perspective,
taking into account the multiplicative impairments caused by mismatches in
radio frequency (RF) hardware. We demonstrate that a phase calibration of
reciprocity-calibrated APs is sufficient for the joint coherent transmission of
data to the user. To achieve synchronization, we propose a novel over-the-air
synchronization protocol, named BeamSync, to calibrate the geographically
separated APs without sending any measurements to the central processing unit
(CPU) through fronthaul. We show that sending the synchronization signal in the
dominant direction of the channel between APs is optimal. Additionally, we
derive the optimal phase and frequency offset estimators. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed BeamSync method enhances performance by 3 dB when
the number of antennas at the APs is doubled. Moreover, the method performs
well compared to traditional beamforming techniques.

<p class="mathjax">When traveling to an unfamiliar city for holidays, tourists often rely on
guidebooks, travel websites, or recommendation systems to plan their daily
itineraries and explore popular points of interest (POIs). However, these
approaches may lack optimization in terms of time feasibility, localities, and
user preferences. In this paper, we propose the SBTRec algorithm: a BERT-based
Trajectory Recommendation with sentiment analysis, for recommending
personalized sequences of POIs as itineraries. The key contributions of this
work include analyzing users' check-ins and uploaded photos to understand the
relationship between POI visits and distance. We introduce SBTRec, which
encompasses sentiment analysis to improve recommendation accuracy by
understanding users' preferences and satisfaction levels from reviews and
comments about different POIs. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated against
other sequence prediction methods using datasets from 8 cities. The results
demonstrate that SBTRec achieves an average F1 score of 61.45%, outperforming
baseline algorithms.
<br />The paper further discusses the flexibility of the SBTRec algorithm, its
ability to adapt to different scenarios and cities without modification, and
its potential for extension by incorporating additional information for more
reliable predictions. Overall, SBTRec provides personalized and relevant POI
recommendations, enhancing tourists' overall trip experiences. Future work
includes fine-tuning personalized embeddings for users, with evaluation of
users' comments on POIs,~to further enhance prediction accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as one of the
optimal solutions for various supervised tasks at the node level. However, for
unsupervised and structure-related tasks such as community detection, current
GCL algorithms face difficulties in acquiring the necessary community-level
information, resulting in poor performance. In addition, general contrastive
learning algorithms improve the performance of downstream tasks by increasing
the number of negative samples, which leads to severe class collision and
unfairness of community detection. To address above issues, we propose a novel
Community-aware Efficient Graph Contrastive Learning Framework (CEGCL) to
jointly learn community partition and node representations in an end-to-end
manner. Specifically, we first design a personalized self-training (PeST)
strategy for unsupervised scenarios, which enables our model to capture precise
community-level personalized information in a graph. With the benefit of the
PeST, we alleviate class collision and unfairness without sacrificing the
overall model performance. Furthermore, the aligned graph clustering (AlGC) is
employed to obtain the community partition. In this module, we align the
clustering space of our downstream task with that in PeST to achieve more
consistent node embeddings. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model for community detection both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive
experimental results also show that our CEGCL exhibits state-of-the-art
performance on three benchmark datasets with different scales.

<p class="mathjax">The research in the field of music is rapidly growing, and this trend
emphasizes the need for comprehensive data. Though researchers have made an
effort to contribute their own datasets, many data collections lack the
requisite inclusivity for comprehensive study because they are frequently
focused on particular components of music or other specific topics. We have
endeavored to address data scarcity by employing an instrument-based approach
to provide a complete corpus related to the Persian piano. Our piano corpus
includes relevant labels for Persian music mode (Dastgah) and comprehensive
metadata, allowing for utilization in various popular research areas. The
features extracted from 2022 Persian piano pieces in The Persian Piano Corpus
(PPC) have been collected and made available to researchers, aiming for a more
thorough understanding of Persian music and the role of the piano in it in
subsequent steps.

<p class="mathjax">Influence maximization aims to find a subset of seeds that maximize the
influence spread under a given budget. In this paper, we mainly address the
data-driven version of this problem, where the diffusion model is not given but
needs to be inferred from the history cascades. Several previous works have
addressed this topic in a statistical way and provided efficient algorithms
with theoretical guarantee. However, in their settings, though the diffusion
parameters are inferred, they still need users to preset the diffusion model,
which can be an intractable problem in real-world practices. In this paper, we
reformulate the problem on the attributed network and leverage the node
attributes to estimate the closeness between the connected nodes. Specifically,
we propose a machine learning-based framework, named DSCom, to address this
problem in a heuristic way. Under this framework, we first infer the users'
relationship from the diffusion dataset through attention mechanism and then
leverage spectral clustering to overcome the influence overlap problem in the
lack of exact diffusion formula. Compared to the previous theoretical works, we
carefully designed empirical experiments with parameterized diffusion models
based on real-world social networks, which prove the efficiency and
effectiveness of our algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Research within sociotechnical domains, such as Software Engineering,
fundamentally requires a thorough consideration of the human perspective.
However, traditional qualitative data collection methods suffer from challenges
related to scale, labor intensity, and the increasing difficulty of participant
recruitment. This vision paper proposes a novel approach to qualitative data
collection in software engineering research by harnessing the capabilities of
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT. We explore the potential of AI-generated synthetic text as an
alternative source of qualitative data, by discussing how LLMs can replicate
human responses and behaviors in research settings. We examine the application
of AI in automating data collection across various methodologies, including
persona-based prompting for interviews, multi-persona dialogue for focus
groups, and mega-persona responses for surveys. Additionally, we discuss the
prospective development of new foundation models aimed at emulating human
behavior in observational studies and user evaluations. By simulating human
interaction and feedback, these AI models could offer scalable and efficient
means of data generation, while providing insights into human attitudes,
experiences, and performance. We discuss several open problems and research
opportunities to implement this vision and conclude that while AI could augment
aspects of data gathering in software engineering research, it cannot replace
the nuanced, empathetic understanding inherent in human subjects in some cases,
and an integrated approach where both AI and human-generated data coexist will
likely yield the most effective outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">Pairwise sequence comparison is one of the most fundamental problems in
string processing. The most common metric to quantify the similarity between
sequences S and T is edit distance, d(S,T), which corresponds to the number of
characters that need to be substituted, deleted from, or inserted into S to
generate T. However, fewer edit operations may be sufficient for some string
pairs to transform one string to the other if larger rearrangements are
permitted. Block edit distance refers to such changes in substring level (i.e.,
blocks) that "penalizes" entire block removals, insertions, copies, and
reversals with the same cost as single-character edits (Lopresti &amp; Tomkins,
1997). Most studies to calculate block edit distance to date aimed only to
characterize the distance itself for applications in sequence nearest neighbor
search without reporting the full alignment details. Although a few tools try
to solve block edit distance for genomic sequences, such as GR-Aligner, they
have limited functionality and are no longer maintained.
<br />Here, we present SABER, an algorithm to solve block edit distance that
supports block deletions, block moves, and block reversals in addition to the
classical single-character edit operations. Our algorithm runs in
O(m^2.n.l_range) time for |S|=m, |T|=n and the permitted block size range of
l_range; and can report all breakpoints for the block operations. We also
provide an implementation of SABER currently optimized for genomic sequences
(i.e., generated by the DNA alphabet), although the algorithm can theoretically
be used for any alphabet.

<p class="mathjax">Pervasive mobile AI applications primarily employ one of the two learning
paradigms: cloud-based learning (with powerful large models) or on-device
learning (with lightweight small models). Despite their own advantages, neither
paradigm can effectively handle dynamic edge environments with frequent data
distribution shifts and on-device resource fluctuations, inevitably suffering
from performance degradation. In this paper, we propose ECLM, an edge-cloud
collaborative learning framework for rapid model adaptation for dynamic edge
environments. We first propose a novel block-level model decomposition design
to decompose the original large cloud model into multiple combinable modules.
By flexibly combining a subset of the modules, this design enables the
derivation of compact, task-specific sub-models for heterogeneous edge devices
from the large cloud model, and the seamless integration of new knowledge
learned on these devices into the cloud model periodically. As such, ECLM
ensures that the cloud model always provides up-to-date sub-models for edge
devices. We further propose an end-to-end learning framework that incorporates
the modular model design into an efficient model adaptation pipeline including
an offline on-cloud model prototyping and training stage, and an online

18.89% accuracy increase) and resource efficiency (e.g., 7.12x communication

<p class="mathjax">Embeddings in AI convert symbolic structures into fixed-dimensional vectors,
effectively fusing multiple signals. However, the nature of this fusion in
real-world data is often unclear. To address this, we introduce two methods:
(1) Correlation-based Fusion Detection, measuring correlation between known
attributes and embeddings, and (2) Additive Fusion Detection, viewing
embeddings as sums of individual vectors representing attributes.
<br />Applying these methods, word embeddings were found to combine semantic and
morphological signals. BERT sentence embeddings were decomposed into individual
word vectors of subject, verb and object. In the knowledge graph-based
recommender system, user embeddings, even without training on demographic data,
exhibited signals of demographics like age and gender.
<br />This study highlights that embeddings are fusions of multiple signals, from
Word2Vec components to demographic hints in graph embeddings.

<p class="mathjax">Electroencephalography (EEG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be
applied for education to measure students' comprehension in classroom lectures;
currently, the two measures have been used separately. In this work, we propose
a classification framework for predicting students' lecture comprehension in
two tasks: (i) students' confusion after listening to the simulated lecture and
(ii) the correctness of students' responses to the post-lecture assessment. The
proposed framework includes EEG and NLP feature extraction, processing, and
classification. EEG and NLP features are extracted to construct integrated
features obtained from recorded EEG signals and sentence-level syntactic
analysis, which provide information about specific biomarkers and sentence
structures. An ensemble stacking classification method -- a combination of
multiple individual models that produces an enhanced predictive model -- is
studied to learn from the features to make predictions accurately. Furthermore,
we also utilized subjective confusion ratings as another integrated feature to
enhance classification performance. By doing so, experiment results show that
this framework performs better than the baselines, which achieved F1 up to 0.65
for predicting confusion and 0.78 for predicting correctness, highlighting that
utilizing this has helped improve the classification performance.

<p class="mathjax">Image-to-text radiology report generation aims to automatically produce
radiology reports that describe the findings in medical images. Most existing
methods focus solely on the image data, disregarding the other patient
information accessible to radiologists. In this paper, we present a novel
multi-modal deep neural network framework for generating chest X-rays reports
by integrating structured patient data, such as vital signs and symptoms,
alongside unstructured clinical notes.We introduce a conditioned
cross-multi-head attention module to fuse these heterogeneous data modalities,
bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual data. Experiments
demonstrate substantial improvements from using additional modalities compared
to relying on images alone. Notably, our model achieves the highest reported
performance on the ROUGE-L metric compared to relevant state-of-the-art models
in the literature. Furthermore, we employed both human evaluation and clinical
semantic similarity measurement alongside word-overlap metrics to improve the
depth of quantitative analysis. A human evaluation, conducted by a
board-certified radiologist, confirms the model's accuracy in identifying
high-level findings, however, it also highlights that more improvement is
needed to capture nuanced details and clinical context.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has attracted
increasing attention. However, it faces two significant challenges: how to
maximize the subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) and how to enhance the
energy efficiency, which are particularly pronounced in widely adopted
Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based AIGC services for image generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for
service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework, prioritizing
efficient and collaborative GDM deployment. Specifically, we restructure the
GDM's inference process, i.e., the denoising chain, to enable users'
semantically similar prompts to share a portion of diffusion steps.
Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach,
i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI),
which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to
replicate users interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback
that reflects a spectrum of user personalities. Lastly, we present the
GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (G-DDPG) algorithm, adapted to the
proposed RLLI framework, for effective communication and computing resource
allocation while considering user subjective personalities and dynamic wireless
environments in decision-making. Simulation results show that G-DDPG can
increase the sum QoE by 15%, compared with the conventional DDPG algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Tracing serves as a key method for evaluating the performance of
microservices-based architectures, which are renowned for their scalability,
resource efficiency, and high availability. Despite their advantages, these
architectures often pose unique debugging challenges that necessitate
trade-offs, including the burden of instrumentation overhead. With Node.js
emerging as a leading development environment, recognized for its rapidly
growing ecosystem, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches that
reduce the telemetry data collection efforts, and the overhead incurred by the
environment instrumentation. In response, we introduce a new approach designed
for transparent tracing and seamless deployment of microservices in cloud
settings. This approach is centered around our newly developed Internal
Transparent Tracing and Context Reconstruction (ITTCR) algorithm. ITTCR is
adept at correlating internal metrics from various distributed trace files, to
reconstruct the intricate execution contexts of microservices operating in a
Node.js environment. Our method achieves transparency by directly instrumenting
the Node.js virtual machine, enabling the collection and analysis of trace
events in a transparent manner. This process facilitates the creation of
visualization tools, enhancing the understanding and analysis of microservice
performance in cloud environments.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image interpretation is central to most clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognostication. In clinical
practice, radiologists examine medical images and manually compile their
findings into reports, which can be a time-consuming process. Automated
approaches to radiology report generation, therefore, can reduce radiologist
workload and improve efficiency in the clinical pathway. While recent
deep-learning approaches for automated report generation from medical images
have seen some success, most studies have relied on image-derived features
alone, ignoring non-imaging patient data. Although a few studies have included
the word-level contexts along with the image, the use of patient demographics
is still unexplored. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal transformer
network that integrates chest x-ray (CXR) images and associated patient
demographic information, to synthesise patient-specific radiology reports. The
proposed network uses a convolutional neural network to extract visual features
from CXRs and a transformer-based encoder-decoder network that combines the
visual features with semantic text embeddings of patient demographic
information, to synthesise full-text radiology reports. Data from two public
databases were used to train and evaluate the proposed approach. CXRs and
reports were extracted from the MIMIC-CXR database and combined with
corresponding patients' data MIMIC-IV. Based on the evaluation metrics used
including patient demographic information was found to improve the quality of
reports generated using the proposed approach, relative to a baseline network
trained using CXRs alone. The proposed approach shows potential for enhancing
radiology report generation by leveraging rich patient metadata and combining
semantic text embeddings derived thereof, with medical image-derived visual
features.

<p class="mathjax">Single cell analysis of skeletal muscle (SM) tissue is a fundamental tool for
understanding many neuromuscular disorders. For this analysis to be reliable
and reproducible, identification of individual fibres within microscopy images
(segmentation) of SM tissue should be precise. There is currently no tool or
pipeline that makes automatic and precise segmentation and curation of images
of SM tissue cross-sections possible. Biomedical scientists in this field rely
on custom tools and general machine learning (ML) models, both followed by
labour intensive and subjective manual interventions to get the segmentation
right. We believe that automated, precise, reproducible segmentation is
possible by training ML models. However, there are currently no good quality,
publicly available annotated imaging datasets available for ML model training.
In this paper we release NCL-SM: a high quality bioimaging dataset of 46 human
tissue sections from healthy control subjects and from patients with
genetically diagnosed muscle pathology. These images include $&gt;$ 50k manually
segmented muscle fibres (myofibres). In addition we also curated high quality
myofibres and annotated reasons for rejecting low quality myofibres and regions
in SM tissue images, making this data completely ready for downstream analysis.
This, we believe, will pave the way for development of a fully automatic
pipeline that identifies individual myofibres within images of tissue sections
and, in particular, also classifies individual myofibres that are fit for
further analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Hedonic Games (HGs) are a classical framework modeling coalition formation of
strategic agents guided by their individual preferences. According to these
preferences, it is desirable that a coalition structure (i.e. a partition of
agents into coalitions) satisfies some form of stability. The most well-known
and natural of such notions is arguably core-stability. Informally, a partition
is core-stable if no subset of agents would like to deviate by regrouping in a
so-called core-blocking coalition. Unfortunately, core-stable partitions seldom
exist and even when they do, it is often computationally intractable to find
one. To circumvent these problems, we propose the notion of
$\varepsilon$-fractional core-stability, where at most an
$\varepsilon$-fraction of all possible coalitions is allowed to core-block. It
turns out that such a relaxation may guarantee both existence and
polynomial-time computation. Specifically, we design efficient algorithms
returning an $\varepsilon$-fractional core-stable partition, with $\varepsilon$
exponentially decreasing in the number of agents, for two fundamental classes
of HGs: Simple Fractional and Anonymous. From a probabilistic point of view,
being the definition of $\varepsilon$-fractional core equivalent to requiring
that uniformly sampled coalitions core-block with probability lower than
$\varepsilon$, we further extend the definition to handle more complex sampling
distributions. Along this line, when valuations have to be learned from samples
in a PAC-learning fashion, we give positive and negative results on which
distributions allow the efficient computation of outcomes that are
$\varepsilon$-fractional core-stable with arbitrarily high confidence.

<p class="mathjax">AI and NLP publication venues have increasingly encouraged researchers to
reflect on possible ethical considerations, adverse impacts, and other
responsible AI issues their work might engender. However, for specific NLP
tasks our understanding of how prevalent such issues are, or when and why these
issues are likely to arise, remains limited. Focusing on text summarization --
a common NLP task largely overlooked by the responsible AI community -- we
examine research and reporting practices in the current literature. We conduct
a multi-round qualitative analysis of 333 summarization papers from the ACL
Anthology published between 2020-2022. We focus on how, which, and when
responsible AI issues are covered, which relevant stakeholders are considered,
and mismatches between stated and realized research goals. We also discuss
current evaluation practices and consider how authors discuss the limitations
of both prior work and their own work. Overall, we find that relatively few
papers engage with possible stakeholders or contexts of use, which limits their
consideration of potential downstream adverse impacts or other responsible AI
issues. Based on our findings, we make recommendations on concrete practices
and research directions.

typing. Karlsson and Haller proposed improvements to Selectable to support
extensible records. In this paper, we review several Scala 3 projects that
involve structural typing. We find that their implementation or usability would
benefit from the extensible records proposal from Karlsson and Haller. We
investigate the remaining common challenges when working with structural types.
In particular, we identify that a dedicated syntax for both record types and
record literals would be the most beneficial addition to the language.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present ShapeMaker, a unified self-supervised learning
framework for joint shape canonicalization, segmentation, retrieval and
deformation. Given a partially-observed object in an arbitrary pose, we first
canonicalize the object by extracting point-wise affine-invariant features,
disentangling inherent structure of the object with its pose and size. These
learned features are then leveraged to predict semantically consistent part
segmentation and corresponding part centers. Next, our lightweight retrieval
module aggregates the features within each part as its retrieval token and
compare all the tokens with source shapes from a pre-established database to
identify the most geometrically similar shape. Finally, we deform the retrieved
shape in the deformation module to tightly fit the input object by harnessing
part center guided neural cage deformation. The key insight of ShapeMaker is
the simultaneous training of the four highly-associated processes:
canonicalization, segmentation, retrieval, and deformation, leveraging
cross-task consistency losses for mutual supervision. Extensive experiments on
synthetic datasets PartNet, ComplementMe, and real-world dataset Scan2CAD
demonstrate that ShapeMaker surpasses competitors by a large margin. Codes will
be released soon.

<p class="mathjax">This paper discusses the application of condition monitoring to a battery
system used in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Battery condition management
systems (BCMSs) are employed to ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable
operation of a battery, ultimately to guarantee the availability of electric
power. This is critical for the case of the HEV to ensure greater overall
energy efficiency and the availability of reliable electrical supply. This
paper considers the use of state and parameter estimation techniques for the
condition monitoring of batteries. A comparative study is presented in which
the Kalman and the extended Kalman filters (KF/EKF), the particle filter (PF),
the quadrature Kalman filter (QKF), and the smooth variable structure filter
(SVSF) are used for battery condition monitoring. These comparisons are made
based on estimation error, robustness, sensitivity to noise, and computational

<p class="mathjax">The increasing use of neural networks in various applications has lead to
increasing apprehensions, underscoring the necessity to understand their
operations beyond mere final predictions. As a solution to enhance model
transparency, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have gained popularity since
their introduction. CBMs essentially limit the latent space of a model to
human-understandable high-level concepts. While beneficial, CBMs have been
reported to often learn irrelevant concept representations that consecutively
damage model performance. To overcome the performance trade-off, we propose
cooperative-Concept Bottleneck Model (coop-CBM). The concept representation of
our model is particularly meaningful when fine-grained concept labels are
absent. Furthermore, we introduce the concept orthogonal loss (COL) to
encourage the separation between the concept representations and to reduce the
intra-concept distance. This paper presents extensive experiments on real-world
datasets for image classification tasks, namely CUB, AwA2, CelebA and TIL. We
also study the performance of coop-CBM models under various distributional
shift settings. We show that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy in
all distributional shift settings even compared to the black-box models with
the highest concept accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce the concept of spot beamfocusing (SBF) in the
Fresnel zone through extremely large-scale programmable metasurfaces (ELPMs) as
a key enabling technology for 6G networks. A smart SBF scheme aims to
adaptively concentrate the aperture's radiating power exactly at a desired
focal point (DFP) in the 3D space utilizing some Machine Learning (ML) method.
This offers numerous advantages for next-generation networks including
efficient wireless power transfer (WPT), interference mitigation, reduced RF
pollution, and improved information security. SBF necessitates ELPMs with
precise channel state information (CSI) for all ELPM elements. However,
obtaining exact CSI for ELPMs is not feasible in all environments; we alleviate
this by proposing an adaptive novel CSI-independent ML scheme based on the TD3
deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) method. While the proposed ML-based scheme is
well-suited for relatively small-size arrays, the computational complexity is
unaffordable for ELPMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a modular
highly scalable structure composed of multiple sub-arrays, each equipped with a
TD3-DRL optimizer. This setup enables collaborative optimization of the
radiated power at the DFP, significantly reducing computational complexity
while enhancing learning speed. The proposed structures benefits in terms of 3D
spot-like power distribution, convergence rate, and scalability are validated
through simulation results.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to evaluate the economic viability of the
energy-water-hydrogen (EWH) nexus as a new solution for reducing carbon
emissions from power systems. The urgency around climate change emphasizes the
pressing need to mitigate carbon emissions, especially from the electricity
sector, which accounts for a significant portion of total emissions in the US.
In response, incorporating more renewable energy sources (RESs) and green
hydrogen, created through water electrolysis and RES, stands out as a crucial
strategy to combat climate challenges. We delve into various aspects of the EWH
nexus, including carbon emissions from different power plants, capturing these
emissions, and potential options for their reuse or storage. This paper
involves modeling different sections of the EWH nexus and conducting an
economic analysis across scenarios in power plants to determine optimal water
supply methods, suitable chemical products for carbon reuse, and an appropriate
carbon emission penalty to encourage emission reduction through the EWH nexus.
The results indicate that reusing captured carbon emissions emerges as the most
beneficial option across all power plant types. This finding underscores the
potential of carbon reuse as a pivotal strategy within the EWH nexus framework
for addressing carbon emissions.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) are increasingly pervasive in
exploiting spatio-temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing works
fail to generalize under distribution shifts, which are common in real-world
scenarios. As the generation of dynamic graphs is heavily influenced by latent
environments, investigating their impacts on the out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization is critical. However, it remains unexplored with the following
two major challenges: (1) How to properly model and infer the complex
environments on dynamic graphs with distribution shifts? (2) How to discover
invariant patterns given inferred spatio-temporal environments? To solve these
challenges, we propose a novel Environment-Aware dynamic Graph LEarning (EAGLE)
framework for OOD generalization by modeling complex coupled environments and
exploiting spatio-temporal invariant patterns. Specifically, we first design
the environment-aware EA-DGNN to model environments by multi-channel
environments disentangling. Then, we propose an environment instantiation
mechanism for environment diversification with inferred distributions. Finally,
we discriminate spatio-temporal invariant patterns for out-of-distribution
prediction by the invariant pattern recognition mechanism and perform
fine-grained causal interventions node-wisely with a mixture of instantiated
environment samples. Experiments on real-world and synthetic dynamic graph
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art
baselines under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to study OOD generalization on dynamic graphs from the environment
learning perspective.

<p class="mathjax">Emotional well-being significantly influences mental health and overall
quality of life. As therapy chatbots become increasingly prevalent, their
ability to comprehend and respond empathetically to users' emotions remains
limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an approach to
enhance therapy chatbots with auditory perception, enabling them to understand
users' feelings and provide human-like empathy. The proposed method
incorporates speech emotion recognition (SER) techniques using Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models and the ShEMO dataset to accurately detect and
classify negative emotions, including anger, fear, and sadness. The SER model
achieves a validation accuracy of 88%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
recognizing emotional states from speech signals. Furthermore, a recommender
system is developed, leveraging the SER model's output to generate personalized
recommendations for managing negative emotions, for which a new bilingual
dataset was generated as well since there is no such dataset available for this
task. The recommender model achieves an accuracy of 98% by employing a
combination of global vectors for word representation (GloVe) and LSTM models.
To provide a more immersive and empathetic user experience, a text-to-speech
model called GlowTTS is integrated, enabling the therapy chatbot to audibly
communicate the generated recommendations to users in both English and Persian.
The proposed approach offers promising potential to enhance therapy chatbots by
providing them with the ability to recognize and respond to users' emotions,
ultimately improving the delivery of mental health support for both English and
Persian-speaking users.

<p class="mathjax">Inspired by the classic problem of Boolean function monotonicity testing, we
investigate the testability of other well-studied properties of combinatorial
finite set systems, specifically \emph{intersecting} families and
\emph{union-closed} families. A function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is
intersecting (respectively, union-closed) if its set of satisfying assignments
corresponds to an intersecting family (respectively, a union-closed family) of
subsets of $[n]$.
<br />Our main results are that -- in sharp contrast with the property of being a
monotone set system -- the property of being an intersecting set system, and
the property of being a union-closed set system, both turn out to be
information-theoretically difficult to test. We show that:
<br />$\bullet$ For $\epsilon \geq \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, any non-adaptive two-sided
$\epsilon$-tester for intersectingness must make
$2^{\Omega(n^{1/4}/\sqrt{\epsilon})}$ queries. We also give a
$2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n \log(1/\epsilon)})}$-query lower bound for non-adaptive
one-sided $\epsilon$-testers for intersectingness.
<br />$\bullet$ For $\epsilon \geq 1/2^{\Omega(n^{0.49})}$, any non-adaptive
two-sided $\epsilon$-tester for union-closedness must make
$n^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$ queries.
<br />Thus, neither intersectingness nor union-closedness shares the
$\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)$-query non-adaptive testability that is enjoyed by
monotonicity.
<br />To complement our lower bounds, we also give a simple
$\mathrm{poly}(n^{\sqrt{n\log(1/\epsilon)}},1/\epsilon)$-query, one-sided,
non-adaptive algorithm for $\epsilon$-testing each of these properties
(intersectingness and union-closedness). We thus achieve nearly tight upper and
lower bounds for two-sided testing of intersectingness when $\epsilon =
\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, and for one-sided testing of intersectingness when
$\epsilon=\Theta(1).$

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence(AI) widely applies in Image Classification and
Recognition, Text Understanding and Natural Language Processing, which makes
great progress. In this paper, we introduced AI into the fruit quality
detection field. We designed a fruit sugar degree regression model using an
Artificial Neural Network based on spectra of fruits within the
visible/near-infrared(V/NIR)range. After analysis of fruit spectra, we
innovatively proposed a new neural network structure: low layers consist of a
Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), a middle layer is a 2-dimensional correlation
matrix layer, and high layers consist of several Convolutional Neural
Network(CNN) layers. In this study, we used fruit sugar value as a detection
target, collecting two fruits called Gan Nan Navel and Tian Shan Pear as
samples, doing experiments respectively, and comparing their results. We used
Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) to evaluate the reliability of the dataset we
collected. Then, we tried multiple strategies to process spectrum data,
evaluating their effects. In this paper, we tried to add Wavelet
Decomposition(WD) to reduce feature dimensions and a Genetic Algorithm(GA) to
find excellent features. Then, we compared Neural Network models with
traditional Partial Least Squares(PLS) based models. We also compared the
neural network structure we designed(MLP-CNN) with other traditional neural
network structures. In this paper, we proposed a new evaluation standard
derived from dataset standard deviation(STD) for evaluating detection
performance, validating the viability of using an artificial neural network
model to do fruit sugar degree nondestructive detection.

applications. Downstream application developers often access LLMs through APIs

<p class="mathjax">Category-level object pose estimation, aiming to predict the 6D pose and 3D
size of objects from known categories, typically struggles with large
intra-class shape variation. Existing works utilizing mean shapes often fall
short of capturing this variation. To address this issue, we present
SecondPose, a novel approach integrating object-specific geometric features
with semantic category priors from DINOv2. Leveraging the advantage of DINOv2
in providing SE(3)-consistent semantic features, we hierarchically extract two
types of SE(3)-invariant geometric features to further encapsulate
local-to-global object-specific information. These geometric features are then
point-aligned with DINOv2 features to establish a consistent object
representation under SE(3) transformations, facilitating the mapping from
camera space to the pre-defined canonical space, thus further enhancing pose
estimation. Extensive experiments on NOCS-REAL275 demonstrate that SecondPose
achieves a 12.4% leap forward over the state-of-the-art. Moreover, on a more
complex dataset HouseCat6D which provides photometrically challenging objects,
SecondPose still surpasses other competitors by a large margin. The code will
be released soon.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian neural networks use random variables to describe the neural networks
rather than deterministic neural networks and are mostly trained by variational
inference which updates the mean and variance at the same time. Here, we
formulate the Bayesian neural networks as a minimax game problem. We do the
experiments on the MNIST data set and the primary result is comparable to the
existing closed-loop transcription neural network. Finally, we reveal the
connections between Bayesian neural networks and closed-loop transcription
neural networks, and show our framework is rather practical, and provide
another view of Bayesian neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">Thermodynamic and flash equilibrium calculations are the cornerstones of
simulation process calculations. The iterative approach, a widely used
nonlinear problem-solving technique, relies on derivative calculations
throughout the procedure that directly affect the stability and effectiveness
of the solution. In this study, we use state-of-the-art automatic
differentiation frameworks for thermodynamic calculations to obtain precise
derivatives without altering the logic of the algorithm. This contrasts with
traditional numerical differentiation algorithms and significantly improves the
convergence and computational efficiency of process simulations in contrast to
numerical differentiation algorithms. Standard chemical phase equilibrium
calculations such as PT, PV, and PH flash are used to evaluate an automated
differentiation approach with respect to numerical stability and iteration
counts. It is used to evaluate the iteration count. The results of the
experiment showed that the automatic differentiation method has a more uniform
gradient distribution and requires fewer convergence iterations. The
experimental results show that the system shows that the process is more
uniform. The gradient distribution and computational convergence curves help to
highlight the improvements provided by automatic differentiation. In addition,
this method shows greater generalizability and can be used more easily in the
calculation of various other chemical simulation modules.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores visual motion-based invariants, resulting in a new
instantaneous domain where: a) the stationary environment is perceived as
unchanged, even as the 2D images undergo continuous changes due to camera
motion, b) obstacles can be detected and potentially avoided in specific
subspaces, and c) moving objects can potentially be detected. To achieve this,
we make use of nonlinear functions derived from measurable optical flow, which
are linked to geometric 3D invariants.
<br />We present simulations involving a camera that translates and rotates
relative to a 3D object, capturing snapshots of the camera projected images. We
show that the object appears unchanged in the new domain over time. We process
real data from the KITTI dataset and demonstrate how to segment space to
identify free navigational regions and detect obstacles within a predetermined
subspace. Additionally, we present preliminary results, based on the KITTI
dataset, on the identification and segmentation of moving objects, as well as
the visualization of shape constancy.
<br />This representation is straightforward, relying on functions for the simple
de-rotation of optical flow. This representation only requires a single camera,
it is pixel-based, making it suitable for parallel processing, and it
eliminates the necessity for 3D reconstruction techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Landslides are a recurring, widespread hazard. Preparation and mitigation
efforts can be aided by a high-quality, large-scale dataset that covers global
at-risk areas. Such a dataset currently does not exist and is impossible to
construct manually. Recent automated efforts focus on deep learning models for
landslide segmentation (pixel labeling) from satellite imagery. However, it is
also important to characterize the uncertainty or confidence levels of such
segmentations. Accurate and robust uncertainty estimates can enable low-cost
(in terms of manual labor) oversight of auto-generated landslide databases to
resolve errors, identify hard negative examples, and increase the size of
labeled training data. In this paper, we evaluate several methods for assessing
pixel-level uncertainty of the segmentation. Three methods that do not require
architectural changes were compared, including Pre-Threshold activations,
Monte-Carlo Dropout and Test-Time Augmentation -- a method that measures the
robustness of predictions in the face of data augmentation. Experimentally, the
quality of the latter method was consistently higher than the others across a
variety of models and metrics in our dataset.

Institutional Repositories (UIRs) in Canada. UIRs are vital to sharing

collected the data of 57 Canadian UIRs with the aim of analyzing Canadian data
and to assess the quality of its UIRs. This was surprisingly difficult due to
the lack of information about the UIRs, and we attempt to ease future
collection efforts by organizing vital information which are difficult to find,
starting from addresses of UIRs. We furthermore present and analyze the main

<p class="mathjax">The Bangla linguistic variety is a fascinating mix of regional dialects that
adds to the cultural diversity of the Bangla-speaking community. Despite
extensive study into translating Bangla to English, English to Bangla, and
Banglish to Bangla in the past, there has been a noticeable gap in translating
Bangla regional dialects into standard Bangla. In this study, we set out to
fill this gap by creating a collection of 32,500 sentences, encompassing
Bangla, Banglish, and English, representing five regional Bangla dialects. Our
aim is to translate these regional dialects into standard Bangla and detect
regions accurately. To achieve this, we proposed models known as mT5 and
BanglaT5 for translating regional dialects into standard Bangla. Additionally,
we employed mBERT and Bangla-bert-base to determine the specific regions from
where these dialects originated. Our experimental results showed the highest
BLEU score of 69.06 for Mymensingh regional dialects and the lowest BLEU score
of 36.75 for Chittagong regional dialects. We also observed the lowest average
word error rate of 0.1548 for Mymensingh regional dialects and the highest of
0.3385 for Chittagong regional dialects. For region detection, we achieved an
accuracy of 85.86% for Bangla-bert-base and 84.36% for mBERT. This is the first
large-scale investigation of Bangla regional dialects to Bangla machine
translation. We believe our findings will not only pave the way for future work
on Bangla regional dialects to Bangla machine translation, but will also be
useful in solving similar language-related challenges in low-resource language
conditions.

<p class="mathjax">We study the design of goal-oriented communication strategies for remote
inference, where an inferrer (e.g., a trained neural network) on the receiver
side predicts a time-varying target signal (e.g., the position of the car in
front) using the data packet (e.g., video clip) most recently received from a
sensor (e.g., camera). The communication between the sensor and the receiver is
carried out over a two-way channel. The objective is to minimize the expected
inference error per time slot by exploiting the memory of the delay in the
channel. It turns out that the optimal policy is an index-based threshold
policy. The scheduler submits a packet at suitable time slots for which the
index function exceeds a threshold. The index function depends on the current
age of information on the receiver side and the prior knowledge about the delay
in the subsequent packet transmission.

<p class="mathjax">This paper reports a new hierarchical architecture for modeling autonomous
multi-robot systems (MRSs): a non-linear dynamical opinion process is used to
model high-level group choice, and multi-objective behavior optimization is
used to model individual decisions. Using previously reported theoretical
results, we show it is possible to design the behavior of the MRS by the
selection of a relatively small set of parameters. The resulting behavior -
both collective actions and individual actions - can be understood intuitively.
The approach is entirely decentralized and the communication cost scales by the
number of group options, not agents. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this
approach using a hypothetical `explore-exploit-migrate' scenario in a two hour
field demonstration with eight unmanned surface vessels (USVs). The results
from our preliminary field experiment show the collective behavior is robust
even with time-varying network topology and agent dropouts.

Recently, many Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed for

on feature extraction from a full SEM image and possibly a number of regions of
interest. In this study, we propose a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based
approach to defect localization which iteratively extracts features from
increasingly smaller regions of the input image. We compare the results of 18

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, cloud computing has gained more and more popularity. The
motivation towards implementing cloud computing in vehicular networks is due to
the availability of communication, storage, and computing resources represented
by communication, vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and central servers. These
resources can be utilized and provided to vehicles, drivers on the road,
travellers, and customers on the internet. Intelligent Transportation System
(ITS) applications can utilize vehicular cloud computing to provide efficient
real-time services, as well as to improve transportation safety, mobility, and
comfort levels for drivers. In this paper, all possible vehicular cloud models
are presented. Each vehicular cloud model offers different services.
Integrating all vehicular cloud models into one integrated system will provide
all services and serve internet users, passengers, and vehicles. Therefore, a
generic vehicular cloud model is proposed. After that, a new service called
Virtual Vehicle is proposed in vehicular cloud computing. The virtual vehicle
is a virtual machine that migrates from one physical vehicle to another. It
provides the same services as the physical vehicle according to the consumer's
requirements.

paper we study the statistical hardness of learning to stabilize linear
time-invariant systems. Hardness is measured by the number of samples required
to achieve a learning task with a given probability. The work in
\cite{tsiamis2022learning} shows that there exist system classes that are hard
to learn to stabilize with the core reason being the hardness of
identification. Here we present a class of systems that can be easy to
identify, thanks to a non-degenerate noise process that excites all modes, but
the sample complexity of stabilization still increases exponentially with the
system dimension. We tie this result to the hardness of co-stabilizability for
this class of systems using ideas from robust control.

<p class="mathjax">Internet memes have emerged as a novel format for communication and
expressing ideas on the web. Their fluidity and creative nature are reflected
in their widespread use, often across platforms and occasionally for unethical
or harmful purposes. While computational work has already analyzed their
high-level virality over time and developed specialized classifiers for hate
speech detection, there have been no efforts to date that aim to holistically
track, identify, and map internet memes posted on social media. To bridge this
gap, we investigate whether internet memes across social media platforms can be
contextualized by using a semantic repository of knowledge, namely, a knowledge
graph. We collect thousands of potential internet meme posts from two social
media platforms, namely Reddit and Discord, and perform an
extract-transform-load procedure to create a data lake with candidate meme
posts. By using vision transformer-based similarity, we match these candidates
against the memes cataloged in a recently released knowledge graph of internet
memes, IMKG. We provide evidence that memes published online can be identified
by mapping them to IMKG. We leverage this grounding to study the prevalence of
memes on different platforms, discover popular memes, and select common meme
channels and subreddits. Finally, we illustrate how the grounding can enable
users to get context about memes on social media thanks to their link to the
knowledge graph.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of advanced technology in project management (PM) highlights a
crucial need for inclusiveness. This work examines the enhancement of both
inclusivity and efficiency in PM through technological integration, focusing on
defining and measuring inclusiveness. This approach illuminates how
inclusivity-centered technology can significantly elevate project outcomes. The
research navigates through the challenges of achieving inclusivity, mainly
biases in learning databases and the design process of these technologies,
assessment of transformative potential of these technologies, particularly in
automating tasks like data collection and analysis, thus enabling managers to
prioritize human-centric aspects of projects. However, the integration of such
technology transcends efficiency, indicating a paradigm shift in understanding
their societal roles. This shift necessitates a new approach in the development
of these systems to prevent perpetuating social inequalities. We proposed a
methodology involving criteria development for evaluating the inclusiveness and
effectiveness of these technologies. This methodical approach is vital to
comprehensively address the challenges and limitations inherent in these
systems. Emphasizing the importance of inclusivity, the study advocates for a
balance between technological advancement and ethical considerations, calling
for a holistic understanding and regulation. In conclusion, the paper
underscores that while these technologies can significantly improve outcomes,
their mindful integration, ensuring inclusivity, is paramount. This exploration
into the ethical and practical aspects of technology in PM contributes to a
more informed and balanced approach within the field.

<p class="mathjax">This study explores the dynamic relationship between online discourse, as
observed in tweets, and physical hate crimes, focusing on marginalized groups.
Leveraging natural language processing techniques, including keyword extraction
and topic modeling, we analyze the evolution of online discourse after events
affecting these groups. Examining sentiment and polarizing tweets, we establish
correlations with hate crimes in Black and LGBTQ+ communities. Using a
knowledge graph, we connect tweets, users, topics, and hate crimes, enabling
network analyses. Our findings reveal divergent patterns in the evolution of
user communities for Black and LGBTQ+ groups, with notable differences in
sentiment among influential users. This analysis sheds light on distinctive
online discourse patterns and emphasizes the need to monitor hate speech to
prevent hate crimes, especially following significant events impacting
marginalized communities.

generation. However, their demanding computational requirements for training
have prompted ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of generated images
through modifications in the sampling process. A recent approach, known as
Discriminator Guidance, seeks to bridge the gap between the model score and the
data score by incorporating an auxiliary term, derived from a discriminator
network. We show that despite significantly improving sample quality, this
technique has not resolved the persistent issue of Exposure Bias and we propose
SEDM-G++, which incorporates a modified sampling approach, combining
Discriminator Guidance and Epsilon Scaling. Our proposed approach outperforms
the current state-of-the-art, by achieving an FID score of 1.73 on the

<p class="mathjax">Triangulation algorithms often aim to minimize the reprojection ($L_2$)
error, but this only provides the maximum likelihood estimate when there are no
errors in the camera parameters or camera poses. Although recent advancements
have yielded techniques to estimate camera parameters accounting for 3D point
uncertainties, most structure from motion (SfM) pipelines still use older
triangulation algorithms. This work leverages recent discoveries to provide a
fast, scalable, and statistically optimal way to triangulate called LOSTU.
Results show that LOSTU consistently produces lower 3D reconstruction errors
than conventional $L_2$ triangulation methods -- often allowing LOSTU to
successfully triangulate more points. Moreover, in addition to providing a
better 3D reconstruction, LOSTU can be substantially faster than
Levenberg-Marquardt (or similar) optimization schemes.

<p class="mathjax">One of the major bottlenecks in high-resolution Earth Observation (EO) space
systems is the downlink between the satellite and the ground. Due to hardware
limitations, on-board power limitations or ground-station operation costs,
there is a strong need to reduce the amount of data transmitted. Various
processing methods can be used to compress the data. One of them is the use of
on-board deep learning to extract relevant information in the data. However,
most ground-based deep neural network parameters and computations are performed
using single-precision floating-point arithmetic, which is not adapted to the
context of on-board processing. We propose to rely on quantized neural networks
and study how to combine low precision (mini) floating-point arithmetic with a
Quantization-Aware Training methodology. We evaluate our approach with a
semantic segmentation task for ship detection using satellite images from the
Airbus Ship dataset. Our results show that 6-bit floating-point quantization
for both weights and activations can compete with single-precision without
significant accuracy degradation. Using a Thin U-Net 32 model, only a 0.3%
accuracy degradation is observed with 6-bit minifloat quantization (a 6-bit
equivalent integer-based approach leads to a 0.5% degradation). An initial
hardware study also confirms the potential impact of such low-precision
floating-point designs, but further investigation at the scale of a full
inference accelerator is needed before concluding whether they are relevant in
a practical on-board scenario.

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer diagnosis challenges both patients and clinicians, with early
detection being crucial for effective treatment. Ultrasound imaging plays a key
role in this, but its utility is hampered by the need for precise lesion
segmentation-a task that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address
these challenges, we propose a new framework: a morphology-enhanced, Class
Activation Map (CAM)-guided model, which is optimized using a computer vision
foundation model known as SAM. This innovative framework is specifically
designed for weakly supervised lesion segmentation in early-stage breast
ultrasound images. Our approach uniquely leverages image-level annotations,
which removes the requirement for detailed pixel-level annotation. Initially,
we perform a preliminary segmentation using breast lesion morphology knowledge.
Following this, we accurately localize lesions by extracting semantic
information through a CAM-based heatmap. These two elements are then fused
together, serving as a prompt to guide the SAM in performing refined
segmentation. Subsequently, post-processing techniques are employed to rectify
topological errors made by the SAM. Our method not only simplifies the
segmentation process but also attains accuracy comparable to supervised
learning methods that rely on pixel-level annotation. Our framework achieves a
Dice score of 74.39% on the test set, demonstrating compareable performance
with supervised learning methods. Additionally, it outperforms a supervised
learning model, in terms of the Hausdorff distance, scoring 24.27 compared to
Deeplabv3+'s 32.22. These experimental results showcase its feasibility and
superior performance in integrating weakly supervised learning with SAM. The

<p class="mathjax">AI-powered code generation models have been developing rapidly, allowing
developers to expedite code generation and thus improve their productivity.
These models are trained on large corpora of code (primarily sourced from
public repositories), which may contain bugs and vulnerabilities. Several
concerns have been raised about the security of the code generated by these
models. Recent studies have investigated security issues in AI-powered code
generation tools such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, revealing
several security weaknesses in the code generated by these tools. As these
tools evolve, it is expected that they will improve their security protocols to
prevent the suggestion of insecure code to developers. This paper replicates
the study of Pearce et al., which investigated security weaknesses in Copilot
and uncovered several weaknesses in the code suggested by Copilot across
diverse scenarios and languages (Python, C and Verilog). Our replication
examines Copilot security weaknesses using newer versions of Copilot and CodeQL
(the security analysis framework). The replication focused on the presence of
security vulnerabilities in Python code. Our results indicate that, even with
the improvements in newer versions of Copilot, the percentage of vulnerable
code suggestions has reduced from 36.54% to 27.25%. Nonetheless, it remains
evident that the model still suggests insecure code.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable progress
in various zero-shot tasks, such as classification and retrieval. Despite their
performance, because improving performance on new tasks requires task-specific
knowledge, their adaptation is essential. While labels are needed for the
adaptation, acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge,
active learning, a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels
for a small number of samples from experts, has been studied. Active learning
primarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging
them to train models. In this study, we pose the question, "how can the
pre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?" In response
to this inquiry, we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active
learning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to
random selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates, and (2)
the knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before
labeling. Based on these observations, we devise a novel active learning
framework for VLMs, denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets, and
the results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and
random sampling methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
using them for generating robot programs from natural language, with promising
initial results. We investigate the use of LLMs to generate programs for
service mobile robots leveraging mobility, perception, and human interaction
skills, and where accurate sequencing and ordering of actions is crucial for
success. We contribute CodeBotler, an open-source robot-agnostic tool to
program service mobile robots from natural language, and RoboEval, a benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capabilities of generating programs to complete service
robot tasks. CodeBotler performs program generation via few-shot prompting of
LLMs with an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) in Python, and leverages
skill abstractions to deploy generated programs on any general-purpose mobile
robot. RoboEval evaluates the correctness of generated programs by checking
execution traces starting with multiple initial states, and checking whether
the traces satisfy temporal logic properties that encode correctness for each
task. RoboEval also includes multiple prompts per task to test for the
robustness of program generation. We evaluate several popular state-of-the-art
LLMs with the RoboEval benchmark, and perform a thorough analysis of the modes
of failures, resulting in a taxonomy that highlights common pitfalls of LLMs at
generating robot programs. We release our code and benchmark at
https://amrl.cs.utexas.edu/codebotler/.

<p class="mathjax">Shape completion aims to recover the full 3D geometry of an object from a
partial observation. This problem is inherently multi-modal since there can be
many ways to plausibly complete the missing regions of a shape. Such diversity
would be indicative of the underlying uncertainty of the shape and could be
preferable for downstream tasks such as planning. In this paper, we propose a
novel conditional generative adversarial network that can produce many diverse
plausible completions of a partially observed point cloud. To enable our
network to produce multiple completions for the same partial input, we
introduce stochasticity into our network via style modulation. By extracting
style codes from complete shapes during training, and learning a distribution
over them, our style codes can explicitly carry shape category information
leading to better completions. We further introduce diversity penalties and
discriminators at multiple scales to prevent conditional mode collapse and to
train without the need for multiple ground truth completions for each partial
input. Evaluations across several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that
our method achieves significant improvements in respecting the partial
observations while obtaining greater diversity in completions.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce and study the problem of dueling optimization with a monotone
adversary, which is a generalization of (noiseless) dueling convex
optimization. The goal is to design an online algorithm to find a minimizer
$\mathbf{x}^{*}$ for a function $f\colon X \to \mathbb{R}$, where $X \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^d$. In each round, the algorithm submits a pair of guesses, i.e.,
$\mathbf{x}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{x}^{(2)}$, and the adversary responds with any
point in the space that is at least as good as both guesses. The cost of each
query is the suboptimality of the worse of the two guesses; i.e., ${\max}
\left( f(\mathbf{x}^{(1)}), f(\mathbf{x}^{(2)}) \right) - f(\mathbf{x}^{*})$.
The goal is to minimize the number of iterations required to find an
$\varepsilon$-optimal point and to minimize the total cost (regret) of the
guesses over many rounds. Our main result is an efficient randomized algorithm
for several natural choices of the function $f$ and set $X$ that incurs cost
$O(d)$ and iteration complexity $O(d\log(1/\varepsilon)^2)$. Moreover, our
dependence on $d$ is asymptotically optimal, as we show examples in which any
randomized algorithm for this problem must incur $\Omega(d)$ cost and iteration
complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks,
but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through
physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security
concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense
methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high
computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios,
where real-time decisions are crucial.
<br />To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based
defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly
identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their
adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of
the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world
adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also
introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy
through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and
computational cost.

<p class="mathjax">Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and energy communities have garnered much
attention over in recent years due to increasing investments in local energy
generation and storage assets. However, the efficiency to be gained from P2P
trading, and the structure of local energy markets raise many important
challenges. To analyse the efficiency of P2P energy markets, in this work, we
consider two different popular approaches to peer-to-peer trading: centralised
(through a central market maker/clearing entity) vs. fully decentralised (P2P),
and explore the comparative economic benefits of these models. We focus on the
metric of Gains from Trade (GT), given optimal P2P trading schedule computed by
a schedule optimiser. In both local market models, benefits from trading are
realised mainly due to the diversity in consumption behaviour and renewable
energy generation between prosumers in an energy community. Both market models
will lead to the most promising P2P contracts (the ones with the highest Gains
from Trade) to be established first. Yet, we find diversity decreases quickly
as more peer-to-peer energy contracts are established and more prosumers join
the market, leading to significantly diminishing returns. In this work, we aim
to quantify this effect using real-world data from two large-scale smart energy
trials in the UK, i.e. the Low Carbon London project and the Thames Valley
Vision project. Our experimental study shows that, for both market models, only
a small number of P2P contracts, and only a fraction of total prosumers in the
community are required to achieve the majority of the maximal potential Gains
from Trade. We also study the effect that diversity in consumption profiles has
on overall trading potential and dynamics in an energy community.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessments ("AIIAs"), a family of tools that
provide structured processes to imagine the possible impacts of a proposed AI
system, have become an increasingly popular proposal to govern AI systems.
Recent efforts from government or private-sector organizations have proposed
many diverse instantiations of AIIAs, which take a variety of forms ranging
from open-ended questionnaires to graded score-cards. However, to date that has
been limited evaluation of existing AIIA instruments. We conduct a classroom
study (N = 38) at a large research-intensive university (R1) in an elective
course focused on the societal and ethical implications of AI. We assign
students to different organizational roles (for example, an ML scientist or
product manager) and ask participant teams to complete one of three existing AI
impact assessments for one of two imagined generative AI systems. In our
thematic analysis of participants' responses to pre- and post-activity
questionnaires, we find preliminary evidence that impact assessments can
influence participants' perceptions of the potential risks of generative AI
systems, and the level of responsibility held by AI experts in addressing
potential harm. We also discover a consistent set of limitations shared by
several existing AIIA instruments, which we group into concerns about their
format and content, as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the
activity in foreseeing and mitigating potential harms. Drawing on the findings
of this study, we provide recommendations for future work on developing and
validating AIIAs.

<p class="mathjax">We examine the extent to which sublinear-sample property testing and
estimation applies to settings where samples are independently but not
identically distributed. Specifically, we consider the following distributional
property testing framework: Suppose there is a set of distributions over a
discrete support of size $k$, $\textbf{p}_1, \textbf{p}_2,\ldots,\textbf{p}_T$,
and we obtain $c$ independent draws from each distribution. Suppose the goal is
to learn or test a property of the average distribution,
$\textbf{p}_{\mathrm{avg}}$. This setup models a number of important practical
settings where the individual distributions correspond to heterogeneous
entities -- either individuals, chronologically distinct time periods,
spatially separated data sources, etc. From a learning standpoint, even with
$c=1$ samples from each distribution, $\Theta(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are
necessary and sufficient to learn $\textbf{p}_{\mathrm{avg}}$ to within error
$\varepsilon$ in TV distance. To test uniformity or identity -- distinguishing
the case that $\textbf{p}_{\mathrm{avg}}$ is equal to some reference
distribution, versus has $\ell_1$ distance at least $\varepsilon$ from the
reference distribution, we show that a linear number of samples in $k$ is
necessary given $c=1$ samples from each distribution. In contrast, for $c \ge
2$, we recover the usual sublinear sample testing of the i.i.d. setting: we
show that $O(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon^2 + 1/\varepsilon^4)$ samples are sufficient,
matching the optimal sample complexity in the i.i.d. case in the regime where
$\varepsilon \ge k^{-1/4}$. Additionally, we show that in the $c=2$ case, there
is a constant $\rho &gt; 0$ such that even in the linear regime with $\rho k$
samples, no tester that considers the multiset of samples (ignoring which
samples were drawn from the same $\textbf{p}_i$) can perform uniformity
testing.

<p class="mathjax">Online makespan minimization is a classic model in the field of scheduling.
In this paper, we consider the over-time version, where each job is associated
with a release time and a processing time. We only know a job after its release
time and should schedule it on one machine afterward. The Longest Processing
Time First (LPT) algorithm, as proven by Chen and Vestjens in 1997, achieves a
competitive ratio of 1.5. However, for the case of two machines, Noga and
Seiden introduced the SLEEPY algorithm, which achieves a competitive ratio of
1.382. Unfortunately, for the case of $m\geq 3$, there has been no convincing
result that surpasses the performance of LPT. we propose a natural
generalization that involves locking all the other machines for a certain
period after starting a job, thereby preventing them from initiating new jobs.
We show this simple approach can beat the $1.5$ barrier and achieve
$1.482$-competitive when $m=3$. However, when $m$ becomes large, we observe
that this simple generalization fails to beat $1.5$. Meanwhile, we introduce a
novel technique called dynamic locking to overcome the new challenge. As a
result, we achieve a competitive ratio of $1.5-\frac{1}{O(m^2)}$, which beats
the LPT algorithm ($1.5$-comeptitive) for every constant $m$.

<p class="mathjax">The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy
can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required
technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of
microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective
exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown
that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning
intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task
without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task -
image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore
images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural
Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss.
Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were
transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen
encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union
(IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two
supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN.
Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\% pixel drop or
image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation
techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main
task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method
achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78
scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data
sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better,
achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the
supervised method.

<p class="mathjax">Off-road vehicles are susceptible to rollovers in terrains with large
elevation features, such as steep hills, ditches, and berms. One way to protect
them against rollovers is ruggedization through the use of industrial-grade
parts and physical modifications. However, this solution can be prohibitively
expensive for academic research labs. Our key insight is that a software-based
rollover-prevention system (RPS) enables the use of commercial-off-the-shelf
hardware parts that are cheaper than their industrial counterparts, thus
reducing overall cost. In this paper, we present HOUND, a small-scale,
inexpensive, off-road autonomy platform that can handle challenging outdoor
terrains at high speeds through the integration of an RPS. HOUND is integrated
with a complete stack for perception and control, geared towards aggressive
offroad driving. We deploy HOUND in the real world, at high speeds, on four
different terrains covering 50 km of driving and highlight its utility in
preventing rollovers and traversing difficult terrain. Additionally, through
integration with BeamNG, a state-of-the-art driving simulator, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in rollovers without compromising turning ability across
a series of simulated experiments. Supplementary material can be found on our
website, where we will also release all design documents for the platform:

<p class="mathjax">Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by
undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some
unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned
on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations,
i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the
credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw
Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless &amp; Red Team, PKU BeaverTails &amp; SafeRLHF, that
can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and
difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic
framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors,
and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data,
specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With
the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets
constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream
learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label
errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Increasing and massive volumes of trajectory data are being accumulated that
may serve a variety of applications, such as mining popular routes or
identifying ridesharing candidates. As storing and querying massive trajectory
data is costly, trajectory simplification techniques have been introduced that
intuitively aim to reduce the sizes of trajectories, thus reducing storage and
speeding up querying, while preserving as much information as possible.
Existing techniques rely mainly on hand-crafted error measures when deciding
which point to drop when simplifying a trajectory. While the hope may be that
such simplification affects the subsequent usability of the data only
minimally, the usability of the simplified data remains largely unexplored.
Instead of using error measures that indirectly may to some extent yield
simplified trajectories with high usability, we adopt a direct approach to
simplification and present the first study of query accuracy driven trajectory
simplification, where the direct objective is to achieve a simplified
trajectory database that preserves the query accuracy of the original database
as much as possible. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning based solution with two agents working cooperatively to collectively
simplify trajectories in a database while optimizing query usability. Extensive
experiments on four real-world trajectory datasets show that the solution is
capable of consistently outperforming baseline solutions over various query
types and dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (deep RL)
framework for network slicing in a dynamic environment with multiple base
stations and multiple users. In particular, we propose a novel deep RL
framework with multiple actors and centralized critic (MACC) in which actors
are implemented as pointer networks to fit the varying dimension of input. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed deep RL algorithm via simulations to
demonstrate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we develop a deep RL based jammer
with limited prior information and limited power budget. The goal of the jammer
is to minimize the transmission rates achieved with network slicing and thus
degrade the network slicing agents' performance. We design a jammer with both
listening and jamming phases and address jamming location optimization as well
as jamming channel optimization via deep RL. We evaluate the jammer at the
optimized location, generating interference attacks in the optimized set of
channels by switching between the jamming phase and listening phase. We show
that the proposed jammer can significantly reduce the victims' performance
without direct feedback or prior knowledge on the network slicing policies.
Finally, we devise a Nash-equilibrium-supervised policy ensemble mixed strategy
profile for network slicing (as a defensive measure) and jamming. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed policy ensemble algorithm by applying on the
network slicing agents and the jammer agent in simulations to show its
effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs
across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In
addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural
design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression,
e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility
in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models
on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at
which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose
two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a
novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise
schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and
compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule
significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87. Further applications of
advanced image editing tools demonstrate the model's solid understanding of
structure.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring logical consistency in predictions is a crucial yet overlooked
aspect in multi-attribute classification. We explore the potential reasons for
this oversight and introduce two pressing challenges to the field: 1) How can
we ensure that a model, when trained with data checked for logical consistency,
yields predictions that are logically consistent? 2) How can we achieve the
same with data that hasn't undergone logical consistency checks? Minimizing
manual effort is also essential for enhancing automation. To address these
challenges, we introduce two datasets, FH41K and CelebA-logic, and propose
LogicNet, an adversarial training framework that learns the logical
relationships between attributes. Accuracy of LogicNet surpasses that of the
next-best approach by 23.05%, 9.96%, and 1.71% on FH37K, FH41K, and
CelebA-logic, respectively. In real-world case analysis, our approach can
achieve a reduction of more than 50% in the average number of failed cases
compared to other methods.

<p class="mathjax">Gait recognition has achieved promising advances in controlled settings, yet
it significantly struggles in unconstrained environments due to challenges such
as view changes, occlusions, and varying walking speeds. Additionally, efforts
to fuse multiple modalities often face limited improvements because of
cross-modality incompatibility, particularly in outdoor scenarios. To address
these issues, we present a multi-modal Hierarchy in Hierarchy network (HiH)
that integrates silhouette and pose sequences for robust gait recognition. HiH
features a main branch that utilizes Hierarchical Gait Decomposer (HGD) modules
for depth-wise and intra-module hierarchical examination of general gait
patterns from silhouette data. This approach captures motion hierarchies from
overall body dynamics to detailed limb movements, facilitating the
representation of gait attributes across multiple spatial resolutions.
Complementing this, an auxiliary branch, based on 2D joint sequences, enriches
the spatial and temporal aspects of gait analysis. It employs a Deformable
Spatial Enhancement (DSE) module for pose-guided spatial attention and a
Deformable Temporal Alignment (DTA) module for aligning motion dynamics through
learned temporal offsets. Extensive evaluations across diverse indoor and
outdoor datasets demonstrate HiH's state-of-the-art performance, affirming a
well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Scaling laws have allowed Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) into the field
of causal reasoning. Causal reasoning of PLM relies solely on text-based
descriptions, in contrast to causal discovery which aims to determine the
causal relationships between variables utilizing data. Recently, there has been
current research regarding a method that mimics causal discovery by aggregating
the outcomes of repetitive causal reasoning, achieved through specifically
designed prompts. It highlights the usefulness of PLMs in discovering cause and
effect, which is often limited by a lack of data, especially when dealing with
multiple variables. Conversely, the characteristics of PLMs which are that PLMs
do not analyze data and they are highly dependent on prompt design leads to a
crucial limitation for directly using PLMs in causal discovery. Accordingly,
PLM-based causal reasoning deeply depends on the prompt design and carries out
the risk of overconfidence and false predictions in determining causal
relationships. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the aforementioned
limitations of PLM-based causal reasoning through experiments on
physics-inspired synthetic data. Then, we propose a new framework that
integrates prior knowledge obtained from PLM with a causal discovery algorithm.
This is accomplished by initializing an adjacency matrix for causal discovery
and incorporating regularization using prior knowledge. Our proposed framework
not only demonstrates improved performance through the integration of PLM and
causal discovery but also suggests how to leverage PLM-extracted prior
knowledge with existing causal discovery algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Effective cyber threat recognition and prevention demand comprehensible
forecasting systems, as prior approaches commonly offer limited and,
ultimately, unconvincing information. We introduce Simplified Plaintext
Language (SPLAIN), a natural language generator that converts warning data into
user-friendly cyber threat explanations. SPLAIN is designed to generate clear,
actionable outputs, incorporating hierarchically organized explanatory details
about input data and system functionality. Given the inputs of individual
sensor-induced forecasting signals and an overall warning from a fusion module,
SPLAIN queries each signal for information on contributing sensors and data
signals. This collected data is processed into a coherent English explanation,
encompassing forecasting, sensing, and data elements for user review. SPLAIN's
template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary.
SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to
be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand. Our conclusions
emphasize the need for designers to specify the "how" and "why" behind cyber
warnings, advocate for simple structured templates in generating consistent
explanations, and recognize that direct causal links in Machine Learning
approaches may not always be identifiable, requiring some explanations to focus
on general methodologies, such as model and training data.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-3D, known for its efficient generation methods and expansive creative
potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the
amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated
images, posing severe limitations on downstream industrial applications due to
the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently
superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based
methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper
introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian
splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual
Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The
challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly
impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we
explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by
3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view
geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that
produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared
noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap
models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or
proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational
Gaussian splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D
appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive
utilization of Gaussian splatting across the entire spectrum of 3D content
generation processes.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attacks have become a major security threat for deploying machine
learning models in security-critical applications. Existing research endeavors
have proposed many defenses against backdoor attacks. Despite demonstrating
certain empirical defense efficacy, none of these techniques could provide a
formal and provable security guarantee against arbitrary attacks. As a result,
they can be easily broken by strong adaptive attacks, as shown in our
evaluation. In this work, we propose TextGuard, the first provable defense
against backdoor attacks on text classification. In particular, TextGuard first
divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by
splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures
that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger.
Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and
their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when
the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard
guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the
triggers in training and testing inputs. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of TextGuard on three benchmark text classification tasks,
surpassing the certification accuracy of existing certified defenses against
backdoor attacks. Furthermore, we propose additional strategies to enhance the
empirical performance of TextGuard. Comparisons with state-of-the-art empirical
defenses validate the superiority of TextGuard in countering multiple backdoor
attacks. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/AI-secure/TextGuard.

<p class="mathjax">While search is the predominant method of accessing information, formulating
effective queries remains a challenging task, especially for situations where
the users are not familiar with a domain, or searching for documents in other
languages, or looking for complex information such as events, which are not
easily expressible as queries. Providing example documents or passages of
interest, might be easier for a user, however, such query-by-example scenarios
are prone to concept drift, and are highly sensitive to the query generation
method. This demo illustrates complementary approaches of using LLMs
interactively, assisting and enabling the user to provide edits and feedback at
all stages of the query formulation process. The proposed Query Generation
Assistant is a novel search interface which supports automatic and interactive
query generation over a mono-linguial or multi-lingual document collection.
Specifically, the proposed assistive interface enables the users to refine the
queries generated by different LLMs, to provide feedback on the retrieved
documents or passages, and is able to incorporate the users' feedback as
prompts to generate more effective queries. The proposed interface is a
valuable experimental tool for exploring fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs for
query generation to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval and
ranking models, and for conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for
complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries without such
assistance.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing availability of Foundation Models, federated tuning has
garnered attention in the field of federated learning, utilizing data and
computation resources from multiple clients to collaboratively fine-tune
foundation models. However, in real-world federated scenarios, there often
exist a multitude of heterogeneous clients with varying computation and
communication resources, rendering them incapable of supporting the entire
model fine-tuning process. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel
federated tuning algorithm, FedRA. The implementation of FedRA is
straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated into any transformer-based
model without the need for further modification to the original model.
Specifically, in each communication round, FedRA randomly generates an
allocation matrix. For resource-constrained clients, it reorganizes a small
number of layers from the original model based on the allocation matrix and
fine-tunes using LoRA. Subsequently, the server aggregates the updated LoRA
parameters from the clients according to the current allocation matrix into the
corresponding layers of the original model. It is worth noting that FedRA also
supports scenarios where none of the clients can support the entire global
model, which is an impressive advantage. We conduct experiments on two
large-scale image datasets, DomainNet and NICO++, under various non-iid
settings. The results demonstrate that FedRA outperforms the compared methods
significantly. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Molecular sciences address a wide range of problems involving molecules of
different types and sizes and their complexes. Recently, geometric deep
learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in
molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose
targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient
when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their
applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we
present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning
the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and
types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces
a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions
and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive
operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark
studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy
and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA
3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities. Our results highlight the
potential for PAMNet in a broad range of molecular science applications.

<p class="mathjax">We study attribute control in language models through the method of Causal
Average Treatment Effect (Causal ATE). Existing methods for the attribute
control task in Language Models (LMs) check for the co-occurrence of words in a
sentence with the attribute of interest, and control for them. However,
spurious correlation of the words with the attribute in the training dataset,
can cause models to hallucinate the presence of the attribute when presented
with the spurious correlate during inference. We show that the simple
perturbation-based method of Causal ATE removes this unintended effect.
Additionally, we offer a theoretical foundation for investigating Causal ATE in
the classification task, and prove that it reduces the number of false
positives -- thereby mitigating the issue of unintended bias. Specifically, we
ground it in the problem of toxicity mitigation, where a significant challenge
lies in the inadvertent bias that often emerges towards protected groups post
detoxification. We show that this unintended bias can be solved by the use of
the Causal ATE metric.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of microservice architectures has revolutionized application design,
fostering adaptability and resilience. These architectures facilitate scaling
and encourage collaborative efforts among specialized teams, streamlining
deployment and maintenance. Critical to this ecosystem is the demand for low
latency, prompting the adoption of cloud-based structures and in-memory data
storage. This shift optimizes data access times, supplanting direct disk access
and driving the adoption of non-relational databases.
<br />Despite their benefits, microservice architectures present challenges in
system performance and debugging, particularly as complexity grows. Performance
issues can readily cascade through components, jeopardizing user satisfaction
and service quality. Existing monitoring approaches often require code
instrumentation, demanding extensive developer involvement. Recent strategies
like proxies and service meshes aim to enhance tracing transparency, but
introduce added configuration complexities.
<br />Our innovative solution introduces a new framework that transparently
integrates heterogeneous microservices, enabling the creation of tailored tools
for fine-grained performance debugging, especially for in-memory data
store-based microservices. This approach leverages transparent user-level
tracing, employing a two-level abstraction analysis model to pinpoint key
performance influencers. It harnesses system tracing and advanced analysis to
provide visualization tools for identifying intricate performance issues. In a
performance-centric landscape, this approach offers a promising solution to
ensure peak efficiency and reliability for in-memory data store-based cloud
applications.

<p class="mathjax">The ongoing challenges in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), notably the
scarcity of anomaly labels and the variability in anomaly lengths and shapes,
have led to the need for a more efficient solution. As limited anomaly labels
hinder traditional supervised models in TSAD, various SOTA deep learning
techniques, such as self-supervised learning, have been introduced to tackle
this issue. However, they encounter difficulties handling variations in anomaly
lengths and shapes, limiting their adaptability to diverse anomalies.
Additionally, many benchmark datasets suffer from the problem of having
explicit anomalies that even random functions can detect. This problem is
exacerbated by ill-posed evaluation metrics, known as point adjustment (PA),
which can result in inflated model performance. In this context, we propose a
novel self-supervised learning based Tri-domain Anomaly Detector (TriAD), which
addresses these challenges by modeling features across three data domains -
temporal, frequency, and residual domains - without relying on anomaly labels.
Unlike traditional contrastive learning methods, TriAD employs both
inter-domain and intra-domain contrastive loss to learn common attributes among
normal data and differentiate them from anomalies. Additionally, our approach
can detect anomalies of varying lengths by integrating with a discord discovery
algorithm. It is worth noting that this study is the first to reevaluate the
deep learning potential in TSAD, utilizing both rigorously designed datasets
(i.e., UCR Archive) and evaluation metrics (i.e., PA%K and affiliation).
Through experimental results on the UCR dataset, TriAD achieves an impressive
three-fold increase in PA%K based F1 scores over SOTA deep learning models, and
50% increase of accuracy as compared to SOTA discord discovery algorithms.

two-channel convolutional neural network with ring network. This method can
extract emotional information effectively and improve learning efficiency. The
words were vectorized with GloVe, and the word vector was input into the

converter BiSRU channel, the local deep emotion and pre-post sequential emotion

<p class="mathjax">As technological advancements in extended reality (XR) amplify the demand for
more XR content, traditional development processes face several challenges: 1)
a steep learning curve for inexperienced developers, 2) a disconnect between 2D
development environments and 3D user experiences inside headsets, and 3) slow
iteration cycles due to context switching between development and testing
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AtomXR, a streamlined,
immersive, no-code XR prototyping tool designed to empower both experienced and
inexperienced developers in creating applications using natural language,
eye-gaze, and touch interactions. AtomXR consists of: 1) AtomScript, a
high-level human-interpretable scripting language for rapid prototyping, 2) a
natural language interface that integrates LLMs and multimodal inputs for
AtomScript generation, and 3) an immersive in-headset authoring environment.
Empirical evaluation through two user studies offers insights into natural
language-based and immersive prototyping, and shows AtomXR provides significant
improvements in speed and user experience compared to traditional systems.

<p class="mathjax">Recommending suitable items to a group of users, commonly referred to as the
group recommendation task, is becoming increasingly urgent with the development
of group activities. The challenges within the group recommendation task
involve aggregating the individual preferences of group members as the group's
preferences and facing serious sparsity problems due to the lack of
user/group-item interactions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel
approach called Dependency Relationships-Enhanced Attentive Group
Recommendation (DREAGR) for the recommendation task of occasional groups.
Specifically, we introduce the dependency relationship between items as side
information to enhance the user/group-item interaction and alleviate the
interaction sparsity problem. Then, we propose a Path-Aware Attention Embedding
(PAAE) method to model users' preferences on different types of paths. Next, we
design a gated fusion mechanism to fuse users' preferences into their
comprehensive preferences. Finally, we develop an attention aggregator that
aggregates users' preferences as the group's preferences for the group
recommendation task. We conducted experiments on two datasets to demonstrate
the superiority of DREAGR by comparing it with state-of-the-art group
recommender models. The experimental results show that DREAGR outperforms other
models, especially HR@N and NDCG@N (N=5, 10), where DREAGR has improved in the
range of 3.64% to 7.01% and 2.57% to 3.39% on both datasets, respectively.

based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open
vocabulary and rarely involves imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex
scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps,
we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation
(OVCOS) and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\textbf{OVCamo})
which containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and
corresponding object classes. Further, we build a strong single-stage
open-vocabulary \underline{c}amouflaged \underline{o}bject
\underline{s}egmentation transform\underline{er} baseline \textbf{OVCoser}
attached to the parameter-fixed CLIP with iterative semantic guidance and
structure enhancement. By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge
and the supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth
information, the proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects.
Moreover, this effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of
open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo
dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task
with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Story visualization aims to generate a series of images that match the story
described in texts, and it requires the generated images to satisfy high
quality, alignment with the text description, and consistency in character
identities. Given the complexity of story visualization, existing methods
drastically simplify the problem by considering only a few specific characters
and scenarios, or requiring the users to provide per-image control conditions
such as sketches. However, these simplifications render these methods
incompetent for real applications. To this end, we propose an automated story
visualization system that can effectively generate diverse, high-quality, and
consistent sets of story images, with minimal human interactions. Specifically,
we utilize the comprehension and planning capabilities of large language models
for layout planning, and then leverage large-scale text-to-image models to
generate sophisticated story images based on the layout. We empirically find
that sparse control conditions, such as bounding boxes, are suitable for layout
planning, while dense control conditions, e.g., sketches and keypoints, are
suitable for generating high-quality image content. To obtain the best of both
worlds, we devise a dense condition generation module to transform simple
bounding box layouts into sketch or keypoint control conditions for final image
generation, which not only improves the image quality but also allows easy and
intuitive user interactions. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
method to generate multi-view consistent character images, eliminating the
reliance on human labor to collect or draw character images.

<p class="mathjax">As IoT devices become widely, it is crucial to protect them from malicious
intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of
traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To
address this, in this paper we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN)
based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner.
The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich
source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection
for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it
can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in
the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into
a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly
grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously
emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The
dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion.
Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category
separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns
both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the
discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion
classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge,
a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories
and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms
form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to
benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion
datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three
state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9%.

<p class="mathjax">Sentiment analysis (SA) is an emerging field in text mining. It is the
process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a
piece of text over different social media platforms. Social media plays an
essential role in knowing the customer mindset towards a product, services, and
the latest market trends. Most organizations depend on the customer's response
and feedback to upgrade their offered products and services. SA or opinion
mining seems to be a promising research area for various domains. It plays a
vital role in analyzing big data generated daily in structured and unstructured
formats over the internet. This survey paper defines sentiment and its recent

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has shown promising performance in submeter-level mapping
tasks; however, the annotation cost of submeter-level imagery remains a
challenge, especially when applied on a large scale. In this paper, we present
the first submeter-level land cover mapping of Japan with eight classes, at a
relatively low annotation cost. We introduce a human-in-the-loop deep learning
framework leveraging OpenEarthMap, a recently introduced benchmark dataset for
global submeter-level land cover mapping, with a U-Net model that achieves
national-scale mapping with a small amount of additional labeled data. By
adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model
trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall
accuracy of 80\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point
improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial
Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of
eight classes for the entire country of Japan. Our framework, with its low
annotation cost and high-accuracy mapping results, demonstrates the potential
to contribute to the automatic updating of national-scale land cover mapping
using submeter-level optical remote sensing data. The mapping results will be
made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we conduct a thorough and meticulous examination of the Runge
phenomenon. Initially, we engage in an extensive review of relevant literature,
which aids in delineating the genesis and essence of the Runge phenomenon,
along with an exploration of both conventional and contemporary algorithmic
solutions. Subsequently, the paper delves into a diverse array of resolution
methodologies, encompassing classical numerical approaches, regularization
techniques, mock-Chebyshev interpolation, the TISI (Three-Interval
Interpolation Strategy), external pseudo-constraint interpolation, and
interpolation strategies predicated upon Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
<br />For each method, we not only introduce but also innovate a novel algorithm to
effectively address the phenomenon. This paper executes detailed numerical
computations for each method, employing visualization techniques to vividly
illustrate the efficacy of various strategies in mitigating the Runge
phenomenon. Our findings reveal that although traditional methods exhibit
commendable performance in certain instances, novel approaches such as
mock-Chebyshev interpolation and regularization-centric methods demonstrate
marked superiority in specific contexts.
<br />Moreover, the paper provides a critical analysis of these methodologies,
specifically highlighting the constraints and potential avenues for enhancement
in SVD decomposition-based interpolation strategies. In conclusion, we propose
future research trajectories and underscore the imperative of further
exploration into interpolation strategies, with an emphasis on their practical
application validation. This article serves not only as a comprehensive
resource on the Runge phenomenon for researchers but also offers pragmatic
guidance for resolving real-world interpolation challenges.

<p class="mathjax">The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is
experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of
these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images,
videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate
desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines
both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its
nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music
Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's
abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The
M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from
diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through
the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable
music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging
multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the
integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA
model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music
generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct
a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current
state-of-the-art models.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
capacities in bridging the gap between visual and language modalities. However,
these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the
image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial
robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable
text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the
vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter
training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT
improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and
exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing
image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive
capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into
adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to
adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for
future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new
possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available
upon publication of the paper.

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML)
becomes increasingly critical as neural networks (NNs) are being widely adopted
in addressing complex problems across various scientific disciplines.
Representative SciML models are physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators (NOs). While UQ in SciML has been increasingly investigated in
recent years, very few works have focused on addressing the uncertainty caused
by the noisy inputs, such as spatial-temporal coordinates in PINNs and input
functions in NOs. The presence of noise in the inputs of the models can pose
significantly more challenges compared to noise in the outputs of the models,
primarily due to the inherent nonlinearity of most SciML algorithms. As a
result, UQ for noisy inputs becomes a crucial factor for reliable and
trustworthy deployment of these models in applications involving physical
knowledge. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian approach to quantify
uncertainty arising from noisy inputs-outputs in PINNs and NOs. We show that
this approach can be seamlessly integrated into PINNs and NOs, when they are
employed to encode the physical information. PINNs incorporate physics by
including physics-informed terms via automatic differentiation, either in the
loss function or the likelihood, and often take as input the spatial-temporal
coordinate. Therefore, the present method equips PINNs with the capability to
address problems where the observed coordinate is subject to noise. On the
other hand, pretrained NOs are also commonly employed as equation-free
surrogates in solving differential equations and Bayesian inverse problems, in
which they take functions as inputs. The proposed approach enables them to
handle noisy measurements for both input and output functions with UQ.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assets in mental health,
showing promise in both classification tasks and counseling applications. This
paper offers a perspective on using LLMs in mental health applications. It
discusses the instability of generative models for prediction and the potential
for generating hallucinatory outputs, underscoring the need for ongoing audits
and evaluations to maintain their reliability and dependability. The paper also
distinguishes between the often interchangeable terms ``explainability'' and
``interpretability'', advocating for developing inherently interpretable
methods instead of relying on potentially hallucinated self-explanations
generated by LLMs. Despite the advancements in LLMs, human counselors'
empathetic understanding, nuanced interpretation, and contextual awareness
remain irreplaceable in the sensitive and complex realm of mental health
counseling. The use of LLMs should be approached with a judicious and
considerate mindset, viewing them as tools that complement human expertise
rather than seeking to replace it.

<p class="mathjax">Writing assistance is an application closely related to human life and is
also a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field. Its aim is
to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking
being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. From the
perspective of the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority,
characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue
characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true
characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets
and related studies only focus on misspelled characters mainly caused by
phonological or visual confusion, thereby ignoring faked characters which are
more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present
Visual-C$^3$, a human-annotated Visual Chinese Character Checking dataset with
faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge,
Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted
dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also
propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive
empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet
challenging. The Visual-C$^3$ dataset and the baseline methods will be publicly
available to facilitate further research in the community.

<p class="mathjax">Chinese Traditional Opera (Xiqu) is an important type of intangible cultural
heritage and one key characteristic of Xiqu is its visual effects on face
achieved via makeup. However, Xiqu makeup process, especially the eye-area
makeup process, is complex and time-consuming, which poses a learning challenge
for potential younger inheritors. We introduce OperARtistry, an interactive
application based on Augmented Reality (AR) that offers in-situ Xiqu makeup
guidance for beginners. Our application provides a step-by-step guide for Xiqu
eye-area makeup, incorporating AR effects at each stage. Furthermore, we
conducted an initial user study (n=6) to compare our approach with existing
video-based tutorials to assess the effectiveness and usefulness of our
approach. Our findings show that OperARtisty helped participants achieve
high-quality eye-area makeup effects with less learning time.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent advancements, existing story generation systems continue to
encounter difficulties in effectively incorporating contextual and event
features, which greatly influence the quality of generated narratives. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel neural generation model, EtriCA,
that enhances the relevance and coherence of generated stories by employing a
cross-attention mechanism to map context features onto event sequences through
residual mapping. This feature capturing mechanism enables our model to exploit
logical relationships between events more effectively during the story
generation process. To further enhance our proposed model, we employ a
post-training framework for knowledge enhancement (KeEtriCA) on a large-scale
book corpus. This allows EtriCA to adapt to a wider range of data samples. This
results in approximately 5\% improvement in automatic metrics and over 10\%
improvement in human evaluation. We conduct extensive experiments, including
comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models, to evaluate the
performance of our framework on story generation. The experimental results,
encompassing both automated metrics and human assessments, demonstrate the
superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the effectiveness of our model in leveraging context and
event features to improve the quality of generated narratives.

<p class="mathjax">Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has seen burgeoning development and
increasing attention recently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
camo-perceptive vision-language framework (CPVLF), to explore whether LVLM can
generalize to the challenging camouflaged object detection (COD) scenario in a
training-free manner. During the process of generalization, we find that due to
hallucination issues within LVLM, it can erroneously perceive objects in
camouflaged scenes, producing counterfactual concepts. Moreover, as LVLM is not
specifically trained for the precise localization of camouflaged objects, it
exhibits a degree of uncertainty in accurately pinpointing these objects.
Therefore, we propose chain of visual perception, which enhances LVLM's
perception of camouflaged scenes from both linguistic and visual perspectives,
reducing the hallucination issue and improving its capability in accurately
locating camouflaged objects. We validate the effectiveness of CPVLF on three
widely used COD datasets, and the experiments show the potential of LVLM in the
COD task.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle, with performance
deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training
and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these
detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts, rather than learning
features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA
(\underline{L}atent \underline{S}pace \underline{D}ata
\underline{A}ugmentation), which is based on a heuristic idea: representations
with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable
decision boundary, thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific
features (see Figure. 1). Following this idea, we propose to enlarge the
forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across
forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition
of enriched, domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother
transitions between different forgery types, effectively bridging domain gaps.
Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the
distilled knowledge from the enhanced features, striving for a generalizable
deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is
surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several
widely used benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In Part I of this two-part paper (Multi-Timescale Control and Communications
with Deep Reinforcement Learning -- Part I: Communication-Aware Vehicle
Control), we decomposed the multi-timescale control and communications (MTCC)
problem in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) system into a
communication-aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based platoon control
(PC) sub-problem and a control-aware DRL-based radio resource allocation (RRA)
sub-problem. We focused on the PC sub-problem and proposed the MTCC-PC
algorithm to learn an optimal PC policy given an RRA policy. In this paper
(Part II), we first focus on the RRA sub-problem in MTCC assuming a PC policy
is given, and propose the MTCC-RRA algorithm to learn the RRA policy.
Specifically, we incorporate the PC advantage function in the RRA reward
function, which quantifies the amount of PC performance degradation caused by
observation delay. Moreover, we augment the state space of RRA with PC action
history for a more well-informed RRA policy. In addition, we utilize reward
shaping and reward backpropagation prioritized experience replay (RBPER)
techniques to efficiently tackle the multi-agent and sparse reward problems,
respectively. Finally, a sample- and computational-efficient training approach
is proposed to jointly learn the PC and RRA policies in an iterative process.
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MTCC algorithm, we
performed experiments using real driving data for the leading vehicle, where
the performance of MTCC is compared with those of the baseline DRL algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">An intelligent decision-making system enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communications is essential to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving
(AD), where two types of decisions have to be made at different timescales,
i.e., vehicle control and radio resource allocation (RRA) decisions. The
interplay between RRA and vehicle control necessitates their collaborative
design. In this two-part paper (Part I and Part II), taking platoon control
(PC) as an example use case, we propose a joint optimization framework of
multi-timescale control and communications (MTCC) based on Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL). In this paper (Part I), we first decompose the problem into a
communication-aware DRL-based PC sub-problem and a control-aware DRL-based RRA
sub-problem. Then, we focus on the PC sub-problem assuming an RRA policy is
given, and propose the MTCC-PC algorithm to learn an efficient PC policy. To
improve the PC performance under random observation delay, the PC state space
is augmented with the observation delay and PC action history. Moreover, the
reward function with respect to the augmented state is defined to construct an
augmented state Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is proved that the optimal
policy for the augmented state MDP is optimal for the original PC problem with
observation delay. Different from most existing works on communication-aware
control, the MTCC-PC algorithm is trained in a delayed environment generated by
the fine-grained embedded simulation of C-V2X communications rather than by a
simple stochastic delay model. Finally, experiments are performed to compare
the performance of MTCC-PC with those of the baseline DRL algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Fears about the destabilizing impact of misinformation online have motivated
individuals and platforms to respond. Individuals have become empowered to
challenge others' online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier
information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing
opinion. Using Twitter data, here we show the consequences of individual
misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information
and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused
posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were
softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In
Twitter's new platform, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was
peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before the exposure. With collective
misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from diverse
information consumption. Detailed comparison suggests differences in toxicity,
sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective
misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for
differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on
the diversity of information consumption and mobility across the information
ecosystem.

<p class="mathjax">The recent advancements in text-to-3D generation mark a significant milestone
in generative models, unlocking new possibilities for creating imaginative 3D
assets across various real-world scenarios. While recent advancements in
text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering
detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as
many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper
identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and
low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing
effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score
Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes
interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we
incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that our model largely outperforms the
state-of-the-art in quality and training efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Time series is a special type of sequence data, a sequence of real-valued
random variables collected at even intervals of time. The real-world
multivariate time series comes with noises and contains complicated local and
global temporal dynamics, making it difficult to forecast the future time
series given the historical observations. This work proposes a simple and
effective framework, coined as TimeSQL, which leverages multi-scale patching
and smooth quadratic loss (SQL) to tackle the above challenges. The multi-scale
patching transforms the time series into two-dimensional patches with different
length scales, facilitating the perception of both locality and long-term
correlations in time series. SQL is derived from the rational quadratic kernel
and can dynamically adjust the gradients to avoid overfitting to the noises and
outliers. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild conditions, the
effect of the noises on the model with SQL is always smaller than that with
MSE. Based on the two modules, TimeSQL achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on the eight real-world benchmark datasets. Further ablation
studies indicate that the key modules in TimeSQL could also enhance the results
of other models for multivariate time series forecasting, standing as
plug-and-play techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution
of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not
suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation
in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying
manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In
this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic
manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning
(Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the
performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference,
which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL
process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and
adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile
sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we
employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through
free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects
pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks
with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore,
we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method,
which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for
practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">We present a review that unifies decision-support methods for exploring the
solutions produced by multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms. As MOO is
applied to solve diverse problems, approaches for analyzing the trade-offs
offered by MOO algorithms are scattered across fields. We provide an overview
of the advances on this topic, including methods for visualization, mining the
solution set, and uncertainty exploration as well as emerging research
directions, including interactivity, explainability, and ethics. We synthesize
these methods drawing from different fields of research to build a unified
approach, independent of the application. Our goals are to reduce the entry
barrier for researchers and practitioners on using MOO algorithms and to
provide novel research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Video prediction yields future frames by employing the historical frames and
has exhibited its great potential in many applications, e.g., meteorological
prediction, and autonomous driving. Previous works often decode the ultimate
high-level semantic features to future frames without texture details, which
deteriorates the prediction quality. Motivated by this, we develop a Pair-wise
Layer Attention (PLA) module to enhance the layer-wise semantic dependency of
the feature maps derived from the U-shape structure in Translator, by coupling
low-level visual cues and high-level features. Hence, the texture details of
predicted frames are enriched. Moreover, most existing methods capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics by Translator, but fail to sufficiently utilize the
spatial features of Encoder. This inspires us to design a Spatial Masking (SM)
module to mask partial encoding features during pretraining, which adds the
visibility of remaining feature pixels by Decoder. To this end, we present a
Pair-wise Layer Attention with Spatial Masking (PLA-SM) framework for video
prediction to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics, which reflect the motion
trend. Extensive experiments and rigorous ablation studies on five benchmarks
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. The code is available at
GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Continual Learning (CL) often relies on the availability of extensive
annotated datasets, an assumption that is unrealistically time-consuming and
costly in practice. We explore a novel paradigm termed name-only continual
learning where time and cost constraints prohibit manual annotation. In this
scenario, learners adapt to new category shifts using only category names
without the luxury of annotated training data. Our proposed solution leverages
the expansive and ever-evolving internet to query and download uncurated
webly-supervised data for image classification. We investigate the reliability
of our web data and find them comparable, and in some cases superior, to
manually annotated datasets. Additionally, we show that by harnessing the web,
we can create support sets that surpass state-of-the-art name-only
classification that create support sets using generative models or image
retrieval from LAION-5B, achieving up to 25% boost in accuracy. When applied
across varied continual learning contexts, our method consistently exhibits a
small performance gap in comparison to models trained on manually annotated
datasets. We present EvoTrends, a class-incremental dataset made from the web
to capture real-world trends, created in just minutes. Overall, this paper
underscores the potential of using uncurated webly-supervised data to mitigate
the challenges associated with manual data labeling in continual learning.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the energy transition, lots of research has been conducted within the
last decade on the topics of energy management systems or local energy trading
approaches, often on the day-ahead or intraday level. A large majority of these
approaches focuses on 15 or 60-minute time intervals for their operation,
however, the question of how the planned solutions are realized within these
time intervals is often left unanswered. Within this work, we aim to close this
gap and propose a real-time balancing and control approach for a set of
microgrids, which implements the day-ahead solutions. The approach is based on
a three-step framework, in which the first step consists of ensuring the
feasibility of devices within the microgrids. The second step focuses on the
grid constraints of the connecting medium voltage grid using the DC power flow
formulation due to the running time requirements of a real-time approach. The
last step is to propagate the solution into the individual microgrids, where
the allocated power needs to be distributed among the devices and households.
Within a case study, we show that the proposed real-time control approach works
as intended and is comparable to an optimal offline algorithm under some mild
assumptions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the challenging scheduling problem of coflows with
release times, with the objective of minimizing the total weighted completion
time. Previous literature has predominantly concentrated on establishing the
scheduling order of coflows. In advancing this research, we contribute by
optimizing performance through the determination of the flow scheduling order.
The proposed approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratios of $3$ and
$2+\frac{1}{LB}$ for arbitrary and zero release times, respectively, where $LB$
is the minimum lower bound of coflow completion time. To further improve time
complexity, we streamline linear programming by employing interval-indexed
relaxation, thereby reducing the number of variables. As a result, for
$\epsilon&gt;0$, the approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratios of $3 +
\epsilon$ and $2 + \epsilon$ for arbitrary and zero release times,
respectively. Notably, these advancements surpass the previously best-known
approximation ratios of 5 and 4 for arbitrary and zero release times,
respectively, as established by Shafiee and Ghaderi.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the problem of data-driven stabilization for linear
discrete-time switched systems with unknown switching dynamics. In the absence
of noise, a data-based state feedback stabilizing controller can be obtained by
solving a semi-definite program (SDP) on-the-fly, which automatically adapts to
the changes of switching dynamics. However, when noise is present, the
persistency of excitation condition based on the closed-loop data may be
undermined, rendering the SDP infeasible. To address this issue, an auxiliary
function-based switching control law is proposed, which only requires
intermittent SDP solutions when its feasibility is guaranteed. By analyzing the
relationship between the controller and the system switching times, it is shown
that the proposed controller guarantees input-to-state practical stability
(ISpS) of the closed-loop switched linear system, provided that the noise is
bounded and the dynamics switches slowly enough. Two numerical examples are
presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

<p class="mathjax">Various NLP tasks require a complex hierarchical structure over nodes, where
each node is a cluster of items. Examples include generating entailment graphs,
hierarchical cross-document coreference resolution, annotating event and
subevent relations, etc. To enable efficient annotation of such hierarchical
structures, we release CHAMP, an open source tool allowing to incrementally
construct both clusters and hierarchy simultaneously over any type of texts.
This incremental approach significantly reduces annotation time compared to the
common pairwise annotation approach and also guarantees maintaining
transitivity at the cluster and hierarchy levels. Furthermore, CHAMP includes a
consolidation mode, where an adjudicator can easily compare multiple cluster
hierarchy annotations and resolve disagreements.

<p class="mathjax">Change detection is a critical task in earth observation applications.
Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are
quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder
and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures
still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has
problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while
the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview
building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy
with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection
with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves
the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal
features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining
changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change
detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with
18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three
scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU),
single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a
multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS). The experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance with high efficiency
and outperforms all benchmark methods with F1-scores of 97.77%, 83.07%, 94.86%,
92.33%, 91.39%, 74.35% on CDD, SYSU, WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR- CD+, and NJDS
datasets, respectively. The code of this work will be available at

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and websites, Image Aesthetic
Assessment (IAA) has become increasingly crucial. While the significance of
attributes in IAA is widely recognized, many attribute-based methods lack
consideration for the selection and utilization of aesthetic attributes. Our
initial step involves the acquisition of aesthetic attributes from both intra-
and inter-perspectives. Within the intra-perspective, we extract the direct
visual attributes of images, constituting the absolute attribute. In the
inter-perspective, our focus lies in modeling the relative score relationships
between images within the same sequence, forming the relative attribute. Then,
to better utilize image attributes in aesthetic assessment, we propose the
Unified Multi-attribute Aesthetic Assessment Framework (UMAAF) to model both
absolute and relative attributes of images. For absolute attributes, we
leverage multiple absolute-attribute perception modules and an
absolute-attribute interacting network. The absolute-attribute perception
modules are first pre-trained on several absolute-attribute learning tasks and
then used to extract corresponding absolute attribute features. The
absolute-attribute interacting network adaptively learns the weight of diverse
absolute-attribute features, effectively integrating them with generic
aesthetic features from various absolute-attribute perspectives and generating
the aesthetic prediction. To model the relative attribute of images, we
consider the relative ranking and relative distance relationships between
images in a Relative-Relation Loss function, which boosts the robustness of the
UMAAF. Furthermore, UMAAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAD66K and
AVA datasets, and multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each
module and the model's alignment with human preference.

<p class="mathjax">Decision problems encountered in practice often possess a highly dynamic and
uncertain nature. In particular fast changing forecasts for parameters (e.g.,
photovoltaic generation forecasts in the context of energy management) pose
large challenges for the classical rolling horizon framework. Within this work,
we propose an online scheduling algorithm for a rolling horizon framework,
which directly uses short-term forecasts and observations of the uncertainty.
The online scheduling algorithm is based on insights and results from
combinatorial online optimization problems and makes use of key properties of
robust optimization. Applied within a robust energy management approach, we
show that the online scheduling algorithm is able to reduce the total
electricity costs within a local microgrid by more than 85% compared to a
classical rolling horizon framework and by more than 50% compared to a
tailor-made dynamic, yet still offline rolling horizon framework. A detailed
analysis provides insights into the working of the online scheduling algorithm
under different underlying forecast error distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation of RGB-D images involves understanding the appearance
and spatial relationships of objects within a scene, which requires careful
consideration of various factors. However, in indoor environments, the simple
input of RGB and depth images often results in a relatively limited acquisition
of semantic and spatial information, leading to suboptimal segmentation
outcomes. To address this, we propose the Multi-modal Interaction and Pooling
Attention Network (MIPANet), a novel approach designed to harness the
interactive synergy between RGB and depth modalities, optimizing the
utilization of complementary information. Specifically, we incorporate a
Multi-modal Interaction Fusion Module (MIM) into the deepest layers of the
network. This module is engineered to facilitate the fusion of RGB and depth
information, allowing for mutual enhancement and correction. Additionally, we
introduce a Pooling Attention Module (PAM) at various stages of the encoder.
This module serves to amplify the features extracted by the network and
integrates the module's output into the decoder in a targeted manner,
significantly improving semantic segmentation performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MIPANet outperforms existing methods on two indoor
scene datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD, underscoring its effectiveness in
enhancing RGB-D semantic segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in addressing
tasks that necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external
tools that require a blend of task planning and the utilization of external
tools, such as APIs. However, real-world complex systems present three
prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real
system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the
descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited;
(2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs
can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks;
(3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create
challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them. In
response, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing
the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents operating
within real-world systems. Our framework comprises three key components
designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most
pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM
Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for
task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves
different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further
used for in-context learning to boost the final performance. We validate our
methods using a real-world commercial system as well as an open-sourced
academic dataset, and the outcomes clearly showcase the efficacy of each
individual component as well as the integrated framework.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of
approximating the Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivative computations in
scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to
previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we
consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of
explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian
kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the
Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support
region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of
the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying
small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image
data.
<br />We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both
theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by
quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to
the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and
with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the
sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian
kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine
scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding
discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled
Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand,
lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous
results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments
presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of
about 1, in units of the grid spacing.

<p class="mathjax">The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance when
applied to natural image segmentation. However, it struggles with geographical
images like aerial and satellite imagery, especially when segmenting mobility
infrastructure including roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. This inferior
performance stems from the narrow features of these objects, their textures
blending into the surroundings, and interference from objects like trees,
buildings, vehicles, and pedestrians - all of which can disorient the model to
produce inaccurate segmentation maps. To address these challenges, we propose
Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a
fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and
the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The
proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image
segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure,
pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a
momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility
infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in
geographical images.

<p class="mathjax">While recent years have witnessed great progress on using diffusion models
for video generation, most of them are simple extensions of image generation
frameworks, which fail to explicitly consider one of the key differences
between videos and images, i.e., motion. In this paper, we propose a novel
motion-aware video generation (MoVideo) framework that takes motion into
consideration from two aspects: video depth and optical flow. The former
regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the
later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving
fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key
frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion
model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the
corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space
by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical
flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we
use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video
decoding from the latent space to the pixel space. In experiments, MoVideo
achieves state-of-the-art results in both text-to-video and image-to-video
generation, showing promising prompt consistency, frame consistency and visual
quality.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. BO has several well-documented shortcomings, including
computational slowdown with longer optimization runs, poor suitability for
non-stationary or ill-conditioned objective functions, and poor convergence
characteristics. Several algorithms have been proposed that incorporate local
strategies, such as trust regions, into BO to mitigate these limitations;
however, none address all of them satisfactorily. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the LABCAT algorithm, which extends trust-region-based
BO by adding principal-component-aligned rotation and an adaptive rescaling
strategy based on the length-scales of a local Gaussian process surrogate model
with automatic relevance determination. Through extensive numerical experiments
using a set of synthetic test functions and the well-known COCO benchmarking
software, we show that the LABCAT algorithm outperforms several
state-of-the-art BO and other black-box optimization algorithms.

To address this limitation, the present study advocates for the utilization of

investigation focuses on the augmentation of a dataset sourced from the Central
Bank of Brazil FAQ, employing techniques that vary in semantic similarity.
Supervised and unsupervised tasks are conducted to evaluate the impact of

maximum weight (metric/general) $k$-cycle/path packing problem is to find a set

improve the approximation ratio from $7/8\cdot (1-1/k)$ to

recently unleashed in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. While
most existing works in this area focus on contrastive learning, we propose a
conceptually simple yet powerful non-contrastive approach, based on the
data2vec self-distillation framework. The core of our method is a
student-teacher scheme that predicts the latent representation of an input time
series from masked views of the same time series. This strategy avoids strong
modality-specific assumptions and biases typically introduced by the design of
contrastive sample pairs. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach
for classification and forecasting as downstream tasks, comparing with

homogeneous linear multi-agent systems and the H2 suboptimal output containment
control problem for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. For both
problems, given multiple autonomous leaders and a number of followers, we
introduce suitable performance outputs and an associated H2 cost functional,
respectively. The aim is to design a distributed protocol by dynamic output
feedback that achieves state/output containment control while the associated H2
cost is smaller than an a priori given upper bound. To this end, we first show
that the H2 suboptimal state/output containment control problem can be
equivalently transformed into H2 suboptimal control problems for a set of
independent systems. Based on this, design methods are then provided to compute
such distributed dynamic output feedback protocols. Simulation examples are

<p class="mathjax">The widespread deployment of Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) renders
distribution systems susceptible to transmission-level faults. This paper
presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of transmission-level faults on
3-phase and 1-phase distribution IBR operation. Using a real-time transmission
and distribution (T&amp;D) co-simulation platform, we simulate both symmetrical and
unsymmetrical faults at increasing electrical distances within the transmission
system while evaluating IBR tripping across various phases and locations at the
distribution level. The IBR power-to-load ratios (PLRs) at 50%, 100% and 300%
are considered to emulate low, medium, and high IBR conditions. Our results
indicate that, while 1-phase and 2-phase faults typically trigger fewer IBR
trips when compared to 3-phase faults, a significant power imbalance arises
from the tripping of 1-phase IBRs on the affected phases. This imbalance can
result in severe power quality problems and unintended equipment trips. This
suggests that there may be a need for designing fault-ride-through mechanisms
tailored to 1-phase IBRs for mitigating the phase-imbalance caused by
unbalanced faults.

Dataset developed by Reliable Flight Control (Rfly) Group aiming to promote the
development of research fields like fault detection and isolation (FDI) or
health assessment (HA). The entire 114 GB dataset includes 11 types of faults
under 6 flight statuses which are adapted from ADS-33 file to cover more
occasions in which the multicopters have different mobility levels when faults
occur. In the total 5629 flight cases, the fault time is up to 3283 minutes,
and there are 2566 cases for software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation, 2566 cases
for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and 497 cases for real flight. As it
contains simulation data based on RflySim and real flight data, it is possible
to improve the quantity while increasing the data quality. In each case, there
are ULog, Telemetry log, Flight information and processed files for researchers
to use and check. The RflyMAD dataset could be used as a benchmark for fault
diagnosis methods and the support relationship between simulation data and real
flight is verified through transfer learning methods. More methods as a
baseline will be presented in the future, and RflyMAD will be updated with more
data and types. In addition, the dataset and related toolkit can be accessed

<p class="mathjax">Decentralized bilevel optimization has been actively studied in the past few
years since it has widespread applications in machine learning. However,
existing algorithms suffer from large communication complexity caused by the
estimation of stochastic hypergradient, limiting their application to
real-world tasks. To address this issue, we develop a novel decentralized
stochastic bilevel gradient descent algorithm under the heterogeneous setting,
which enjoys a small communication cost in each round and small communication
rounds. As such, it can achieve a much better communication complexity than
existing algorithms. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the more challenging
decentralized multi-level optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time achieving these theoretical results under the heterogeneous
setting. At last, the experimental results confirm the efficacy of our
algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with
desired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable
microstructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is
typically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using
generative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces
the computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a
continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We
investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel
embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary
representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for
normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space
for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to
condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated
microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design.

<p class="mathjax">Controlling and coordinating urban traffic flow through robot vehicles is
emerging as a novel transportation paradigm for the future. While this approach
garners growing attention from researchers and practitioners, effectively
managing and coordinating large-scale mixed traffic remains a challenge. We
introduce an effective framework for large-scale mixed traffic control via
privacy-preserving crowdsourcing and dynamic vehicle routing. Our framework
consists of three modules: a privacy-protecting crowdsensing method, a graph
propagation-based traffic forecasting method, and a privacy-preserving route
selection mechanism. We evaluate our framework using a real-world road network.
The results show that our framework accurately forecasts traffic flow,
efficiently mitigates network-wide RV shortage issue, and coordinates
large-scale mixed traffic. Compared to other baseline methods, our framework
not only reduces the RV shortage issue up to 69.4% but also reduces the average
waiting time of all vehicles in the network up to 27%.

<p class="mathjax">Heterogeneous computing and exploiting integrated CPU-GPU architectures has
become a clear current trend since the flattening of Moore's Law. In this work,
we propose a numerical and algorithmic re-design of a p-adaptive
quadrature-free discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) for the shallow water
equations (SWE). Our new approach separates the computations of the
non-adaptive (lower-order) and adaptive (higher-order) parts of the
discretization form each other. Thereby, we can overlap computations of the
lower-order and the higher-order DG solution components. Furthermore, we
investigate execution times of main computational kernels and use automatic
code generation to optimize their distribution between the CPU and GPU. Several
setups, including a prototype of a tsunami simulation in a tide-driven flow
scenario, are investigated, and the results show that significant performance
improvements can be achieved in suitable setups.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithmic recourse emerges as a prominent technique to promote the
explainability, transparency and hence ethics of machine learning models.
Existing algorithmic recourse approaches often assume an invariant predictive
model; however, the predictive model is usually updated upon the arrival of new
data. Thus, a recourse that is valid respective to the present model may become
invalid for the future model. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel
framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to
model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear
surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated
with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection
between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax
probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different
covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations
for MPM, including the $\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting.
Furthermore, we show that our surrogate pushes the approximate hyperplane
intuitively, facilitating not only robust but also interpretable recourses. The
numerical results demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our framework.

<p class="mathjax">Scaling of neural networks has recently shown great potential to improve the
model capacity in various fields. Specifically, model performance has a
power-law relationship with model size or data size, which provides important
guidance for the development of large-scale models. However, there is still
limited understanding on the scaling effect of user behavior models in
recommender systems, where the unique data characteristics (e.g. data scarcity
and sparsity) pose new challenges to explore the scaling effect in
recommendation tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating the scaling laws
in large sequential recommendation models. Specially, we consider a pure
ID-based task formulation, where the interaction history of a user is formatted
as a chronological sequence of item IDs. We don't incorporate any side
information (e.g. item text), because we would like to explore how scaling law
holds from the perspective of user behavior. With specially improved
strategies, we scale up the model size to 0.8B parameters, making it feasible
to explore the scaling effect in a diverse range of model sizes. As the major
findings, we empirically show that scaling law still holds for these trained
models, even in data-constrained scenarios. We then fit the curve for scaling
law, and successfully predict the test loss of the two largest tested model
scales. Furthermore, we examine the performance advantage of scaling effect on
five challenging recommendation tasks, considering the unique issues (e.g. cold
start, robustness, long-term preference) in recommender systems. We find that
scaling up the model size can greatly boost the performance on these
challenging tasks, which again verifies the benefits of large recommendation
models.

<p class="mathjax">Palmprint biometrics garner heightened attention in palm-scanning payment and
social security due to their distinctive attributes. However, prevailing
methodologies singularly prioritize texture orientation, neglecting the
significant texture scale dimension. We design an innovative network for
concurrently extracting intra-scale and inter-scale features to redress this
limitation. This paper proposes a scale-aware competitive network (SAC-Net),
which includes the Inner-Scale Competition Module (ISCM) and the Across-Scale
Competition Module (ASCM) to capture texture characteristics related to
orientation and scale. ISCM efficiently integrates learnable Gabor filters and
a self-attention mechanism to extract rich orientation data and discern
textures with long-range discriminative properties. Subsequently, ASCM
leverages a competitive strategy across various scales to effectively
encapsulate the competitive texture scale elements. By synergizing ISCM and
ASCM, our method adeptly characterizes palmprint features. Rigorous
experimentation across three benchmark datasets unequivocally demonstrates our
proposed approach's exceptional recognition performance and resilience relative
to state-of-the-art alternatives.

learning. Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct
quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward
pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to
derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the
sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied
in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this
work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification,
quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance
decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance
decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the
class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on
cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based
approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in
active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise
uncertainties as well as between-class correlations. The code is available at
https://github.com/KerryDRX/EvidentialADA. This alternative means of evidential
uncertainty quantification will give researchers more options when class
uncertainties and correlations are important in their applications.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, pretraining methods for the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been
successful at learning effective representations from unlabeled graph data.
However, most of these methods rely on pairwise relations in the graph and do
not capture the underling higher-order relations between entities. Hypergraphs
are versatile and expressive structures that can effectively model higher-order
relationships among entities in the data. Despite the efforts to adapt GNNs to
hypergraphs (HyperGNN), there are currently no fully self-supervised
pretraining methods for HyperGNN on heterogeneous hypergraphs. In this paper,
we present SPHH, a novel self-supervised pretraining framework for
heterogeneous HyperGNNs. Our method is able to effectively capture higher-order
relations among entities in the data in a self-supervised manner. SPHH is
consist of two self-supervised pretraining tasks that aim to simultaneously
learn both local and global representations of the entities in the hypergraph
by using informative representations derived from the hypergraph structure.
Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of
self-supervised pretraining of HyperGNNs, and has the potential to improve the
performance of various graph-based downstream tasks such as node classification
and link prediction tasks which are mapped to hypergraph configuration. Our
experiments on two real-world benchmarks using four different HyperGNN models
show that our proposed SPHH framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SPHH is
able to improve the performance of various HyperGNN models in various
downstream tasks, regardless of their architecture or complexity, which
highlights the robustness of our framework.

<p class="mathjax">We present SOccDPT, a memory-efficient approach for 3D semantic occupancy
prediction from monocular image input using dense prediction transformers. To
address the limitations of existing methods trained on structured traffic
datasets, we train our model on unstructured datasets including the Indian
Driving Dataset and Bengaluru Driving Dataset. Our semi-supervised training
pipeline allows SOccDPT to learn from datasets with limited labels by reducing
the requirement for manual labelling by substituting it with pseudo-ground
truth labels to produce our Bengaluru Semantic Occupancy Dataset. This broader
training enhances our model's ability to handle unstructured traffic scenarios
effectively. To overcome memory limitations during training, we introduce
patch-wise training where we select a subset of parameters to train each epoch,
reducing memory usage during auto-grad graph construction. In the context of
unstructured traffic and memory-constrained training and inference, SOccDPT
outperforms existing disparity estimation approaches as shown by the RMSE score
of 9.1473, achieves a semantic segmentation IoU score of 46.02% and operates at
a competitive frequency of 69.47 Hz. We make our code and semantic occupancy
dataset public.

<p class="mathjax">There are recent shifts in demand for design controllers from simplified to
complex model-based. Although simplification approaches are successful in many
areas of engineering control systems, high-fidelity simulation-based control
design, for example, reinforcement learning, has been rising in robotics areas.
On the other hand, the lack of assurances about the stability and robustness of
simulation-based control design restricts its applications to safety-critical
systems. We develop computational methods to verify the stability and
robustness of safety-critical systems. By extending the inverse Lyapunov
theorem, we present a practical method to compute the constants required to
check the exponential stability conditions of dynamic systems implemented in a
numerical simulator. It is shown that the norm-bound of the propagated states
is a function of the numerical integration steps, where the numerical simulator
may include discontinuous jumps of states. The energy bounds for the transition
states are obtained based on the exponential stability assumption of the
inverse Lyapunov theorem. Finally, a finite sampling algorithm provides the
deterministic stability guarantee for the continuous state space.

<p class="mathjax">Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a fundamental task in the
task-oriented dialogue systems. However, the inevitable errors from automatic
speech recognition (ASR) usually impair the understanding performance and lead
to error propagation. Although there are some attempts to address this problem
through contrastive learning, they (1) treat clean manual transcripts and ASR
transcripts equally without discrimination in fine-tuning; (2) neglect the fact
that the semantically similar pairs are still pushed away when applying
contrastive learning; (3) suffer from the problem of Kullback-Leibler (KL)
vanishing. In this paper, we propose Mutual Learning and Large-Margin
Contrastive Learning (ML-LMCL), a novel framework for improving ASR robustness
in SLU. Specifically, in fine-tuning, we apply mutual learning and train two
SLU models on the manual transcripts and the ASR transcripts, respectively,
aiming to iteratively share knowledge between these two models. We also
introduce a distance polarization regularizer to avoid pushing away the
intra-cluster pairs as much as possible. Moreover, we use a cyclical annealing
schedule to mitigate KL vanishing issue. Experiments on three datasets show
that ML-LMCL outperforms existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer becomes more popular in the vision domain in recent years so
there is a need for finding an effective way to interpret the Transformer model
by visualizing it. In recent work, Chefer et al. can visualize the Transformer
on vision and multi-modal tasks effectively by combining attention layers to
show the importance of each image patch. However, when applying to other
variants of Transformer such as the Swin Transformer, this method can not focus
on the predicted object. Our method, by considering the statistics of tokens in
layer normalization layers, shows a great ability to interpret the
explainability of Swin Transformer and ViT.

<p class="mathjax">The past few years have witnessed a boom of miniapps, as lightweight
applications, miniapps are of great importance in the mobile internet sector.
Consequently, the security of miniapps can directly impact compromising the
integrity of sensitive data, posing a potential threat to user privacy.
However, after a thorough review of the various research efforts in miniapp
security, we found that their actions in researching the safety of miniapp web
interfaces are limited. This paper proposes a triad threat model focusing on
users, servers and attackers to mitigate the security risk of miniapps. By
following the principle of least privilege and the direction of permission
consistency, we design a novel analysis framework for the security risk
assessment of miniapps by this model. Then, we analyzed the correlation between
the security risk assessment and the threat model associated with the miniapp.
This analysis led to identifying potential scopes and categorisations with
security risks. In the case study, we identify nine major categories of
vulnerability issues, such as SQL injection, logical vulnerabilities and
cross-site scripting. We also assessed a total of 50,628 security risk hazards
and provided specific examples.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) which employ explicit likelihood
characterization and a gradual sampling process to synthesize data, have gained
increasing research interest. Despite their huge computational burdens due to
the large number of steps involved during sampling, DPMs are widely appreciated
in various medical imaging tasks for their high-quality and diversity of
generation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important medical imaging
modality with excellent soft tissue contrast and superb spatial resolution,
which possesses unique opportunities for diffusion models. Although there is a
recent surge of studies exploring DPMs in MRI, a survey paper of DPMs
specifically designed for MRI applications is still lacking. This review
article aims to help researchers in the MRI community to grasp the advances of
DPMs in different applications. We first introduce the theory of two dominant
kinds of DPMs, categorized according to whether the diffusion time step is
discrete or continuous, and then provide a comprehensive review of emerging
DPMs in MRI, including reconstruction, image generation, image translation,
segmentation, anomaly detection, and further research topics. Finally, we
discuss the general limitations as well as limitations specific to the MRI
tasks of DPMs and point out potential areas that are worth further exploration.

<p class="mathjax">Bit-serial Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an attractive paradigm for
accelerator architectures, for parallel workloads such as Deep Learning (DL),
because of its capability to achieve massive data parallelism at a low area
overhead and provide orders-of-magnitude data movement savings by moving
computational resources closer to the data. While many PIM architectures have
been proposed, improvements are needed in communicating intermediate results to
consumer kernels, for communication between tiles at scale, for reduction
operations, and for efficiently performing bit-serial operations with
constants.
<br />We present PIMSAB, a scalable architecture that provides spatially aware
communication network for efficient intra-tile and inter-tile data movement and
provides efficient computation support for generally inefficient bit-serial
compute patterns. Our architecture consists of a massive hierarchical array of
compute-enabled SRAMs (CRAMs) and is codesigned with a compiler to achieve high
utilization. The key novelties of our architecture are: (1) providing efficient
support for spatially-aware communication by providing local H-tree network for
reductions, by adding explicit hardware for shuffling operands, and by
deploying systolic broadcasting, and (2) taking advantage of the divisible
nature of bit-serial computations through adaptive precision, bit-slicing and
efficient handling of constant operations.
<br />When compared against a similarly provisioned modern Tensor Core GPU (NVIDIA
A100), across common DL kernels and an end-to-end DL network (Resnet18), PIMSAB
outperforms the GPU by 3x, and reduces energy by 4.2x. We compare PIMSAB with
similarly provisioned state-of-the-art SRAM PIM (Duality Cache) and DRAM PIM
(SIMDRAM) and observe a speedup of 3.7x and 3.88x respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) tackles the long-standing problem of
endowing agents with skills that generalize across a variety of problems. To
this end, sharing representations plays a fundamental role in capturing both
unique and common characteristics of the tasks. Tasks may exhibit similarities
in terms of skills, objects, or physical properties while leveraging their
representations eases the achievement of a universal policy. Nevertheless, the
pursuit of learning a shared set of diverse representations is still an open
challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for representation
learning in MTRL that encapsulates common structures among the tasks using
orthogonal representations to promote diversity. Our method, named Mixture Of
Orthogonal Experts (MOORE), leverages a Gram-Schmidt process to shape a shared
subspace of representations generated by a mixture of experts. When
task-specific information is provided, MOORE generates relevant representations
from this shared subspace. We assess the effectiveness of our approach on two
MTRL benchmarks, namely MiniGrid and MetaWorld, showing that MOORE surpasses
related baselines and establishes a new state-of-the-art result on MetaWorld.

the single most important factor of our success as a species. In this
Perspective, we explore the notion of machine culture, culture mediated or

transform the cultural evolutionary processes of variation, transmission, and
selection. Recommender algorithms are altering social learning dynamics.
Chatbots are forming a new mode of cultural transmission, serving as cultural
models. Furthermore, intelligent machines are evolving as contributors in
generating cultural traits--from game strategies and visual art to scientific
results. We provide a conceptual framework for studying the present and

<p class="mathjax">The adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (ALIF) model is fundamental within
computational neuroscience and has been instrumental in studying our brains
$\textit{in silico}$. Due to the sequential nature of simulating these neural
models, a commonly faced issue is the speed-accuracy trade-off: either
accurately simulate a neuron using a small discretisation time-step (DT), which
is slow, or more quickly simulate a neuron using a larger DT and incur a loss
in simulation accuracy. Here we provide a solution to this dilemma, by
algorithmically reinterpreting the ALIF model, reducing the sequential
simulation complexity and permitting a more efficient parallelisation on GPUs.
We computationally validate our implementation to obtain over a $50\times$
training speedup using small DTs on synthetic benchmarks. We also obtained a
comparable performance to the standard ALIF implementation on different
supervised classification tasks - yet in a fraction of the training time.
Lastly, we showcase how our model makes it possible to quickly and accurately
fit real electrophysiological recordings of cortical neurons, where very fine
sub-millisecond DTs are crucial for capturing exact spike timing.

<p class="mathjax">Multiplication is one of the most important operation in Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) arithmetic. For point addition and point doubling in ECC
scalar (integer) multiplication is required. In higher order classical
(standard) multiplication many intermediate operations are required. Reduced
operation in multiplication will increase the functional speed of ECC
arithmetic. These goals can be achieved using ancient multiplication algorithm
namely Nikhilam Sutra. Nikhilam Sutra is one of the Sutra (algorithm) within 16
Vedic mathematics Sutras (algorithms). Nikhilam Sutra is efficient for
multiplying two large decimal numbers. The Sutra reduces multiplication of two
large numbers into two smaller numbers multiplication. The functional speed of
Elliptic Curve Cryptography can be increased using Nikhilam method for scalar
multiplication.

<p class="mathjax">The proposed framework named IDEAL (Interpretable-by-design DEep learning
ALgorithms) recasts the standard supervised classification problem into a
function of similarity to a set of prototypes derived from the training data,
while taking advantage of existing latent spaces of large neural networks
forming so-called Foundation Models (FM). This addresses the issue of
explainability (stage B) while retaining the benefits from the tremendous
achievements offered by DL models (e.g., visual transformers, ViT) pre-trained
on huge data sets such as IG-3.6B + ImageNet-1K or LVD-142M (stage A). We show
that one can turn such DL models into conceptually simpler,
explainable-through-prototypes ones.
<br />The key findings can be summarized as follows: (1) the proposed models are
interpretable through prototypes, mitigating the issue of confounded
interpretations, (2) the proposed IDEAL framework circumvents the issue of
catastrophic forgetting allowing efficient class-incremental learning, and (3)
the proposed IDEAL approach demonstrates that ViT architectures narrow the gap
between finetuned and non-finetuned models allowing for transfer learning in a
fraction of time \textbf{without} finetuning of the feature space on a target
dataset with iterative supervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the most common forms of heart
disease, which is caused by a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque (known as
stenosis) in the coronary arteries, leading to insufficient supplement of
blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR),
measuring the pressure ratio between the aorta and distal coronary artery, is
an invasive physiologic gold standard for assessing the severity of coronary
artery stenosis. Despite its benefits, invasive FFR assessment is still
underutilized due to its high cost, time-consuming, experimental variability,
and increased risk to patients. In this study, an attention-based
multi-fidelity machine learning model (AttMulFid) is proposed for
computationally efficient and accurate FFR assessment with uncertainty
measurement. Within AttMulFid, an autoencoder is utilized to intelligently
select geometric features from coronary arteries, with additional attention on
the key area. Results show that the geometric features are able to represent
the entirety of the geometric information and intelligently allocate attention
based on crucial properties of geometry. Furthermore, the AttMulFid is a
feasible approach for non-invasive, rapid, and accurate FFR assessment (with
0.002s/simulation).

<p class="mathjax">Most tourist destinations are facing regular and consistent seasonality with
significant economic and social impacts. This phenomenon is more pronounced in
the post-covid era, where demand for travel has increased but unevenly among
different geographic areas. To counter these problems that both customers and
hoteliers are facing, we have developed two auctioning systems that allow
hoteliers of lower popularity tier areas or during low season periods to
auction their rooms in what we call a forward auction model, and also allows
customers to initiate a bidding process whereby hoteliers in an area may make
offers to the customer for their rooms, in what constitutes a reverse auction
model initiated by the customer, similar to the bidding concept of
priceline.com. We develop mathematical programming models that define
explicitly both types of auctions, and show that in each type, there are
significant benefits to be gained both on the side of the hotelier as well as
on the side of the customer. We discuss algorithmic techniques for the
approximate solution of these optimization problems, and present results using
exact optimization solvers to solve them to guaranteed optimality. These
techniques could be beneficial to both customer and hotelier reducing
seasonality during middle and low season and providing the customer with
attractive offers.

<p class="mathjax">Although it has a history that goes back about three decades, Metaverse has
grown to be one of the most talked-about subjects today. Metaverse gradually
increased its influence in the realm of business discourse after initially
being restricted to discussions about entertainment. Before getting deep into
the Metaverse, it should be noted that failure and deviating from the business
path are highly likely for an enterprise that relies heavily on information
technology (IT) because of improper use and thinking about IT. The idea of
enterprise architecture (EA) emerged as a management strategy to address this
issue. As the first school of thought of EA, it sought to transform IT from an
unnecessary burden in an enterprise to a guiding and supporting force. Then an
extended EA model is suggested as a result of the attempt made in this paper to
use the idea of EA to steer virtual enterprises on Metaverse-based platforms.
Finally, to evaluate the conceptual model and demonstrate that the Metaverse
can support businesses, three case studies Decentraland, Battle Infinity, and
Rooom were utilized.

<p class="mathjax">Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is
trained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training
samples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive
rules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly
attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise,
and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of
neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the
training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the
process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we
present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine
learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of
the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a
negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided
labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also
decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization
tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime
machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly
available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated
that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are
sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to
explore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the
community to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related
challenges in other research fields such as continual learning. The Python code
of the experimental setup is uploaded to GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Large pre-trained models have been instrumental in significant advancements
in domains like language and vision making model training for individual
downstream tasks more efficient as well as provide superior performance.
However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and
training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain
expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for
pre-training a general time-series model from multiple heterogeneous
time-series dataset: providing semantically useful inputs to models for
modeling time series of different dynamics from different domains. We observe
that partitioning time-series into segments as inputs to sequential models
produces semantically better inputs and propose a novel model LPTM that
automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy
leveraging self-supervised learning loss during pre-training. LPTM provides
performance similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model and is
significantly more data and compute efficient taking up to 40% less data as
well as 50% less training time to achieve state-of-art performance in a wide
range of time-series analysis tasks from multiple disparate domain.

The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation
to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a
gap in current research by focusing on the security risks posed by LLMs, which
extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work
proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication
pipeline, explicitly focusing on prompt-based attacks on LLMs. We categorize
the attacks by target and attack type within a prompt-based interaction scheme.
The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the
real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the
development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and

<p class="mathjax">This article re-examines integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
operating in the near-field region of a large antenna array while exploiting a
large bandwidth. We first reveal the fundamental characteristics of wideband
sensing and communication (S&amp;C) channels and highlight the key changes that
occur during the transition from the far-field to the near-field region.
Specifically, there are two fundamental changes in the near-field region:
strong angular-delay correlation and element-specific Doppler frequencies. It
is highlighted that the near-field effect can enable the wideband-like S&amp;C
functionalities in terms of signal multiplexing and range sensing due to the
strong angular-delay correlation, thus allowing the trading of large antenna
arrays for large bandwidths. Furthermore, it also introduces the
wideband-unattainable functionalities in high mobility S&amp;C scenarios by
leveraging the element-specific Doppler frequencies. We then delineate certain
paradigm shifts in thinking required to advance toward near-field wideband ISAC
systems, with a particular emphasis on resource allocation, antenna array
arrangement, and transceiver architecture. Lastly, some other promising

<p class="mathjax">This paper endeavors to advance the precision of snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) reconstruction for multispectral image (MSI). To achieve this, we
integrate the advantageous attributes of established SCI techniques and an
image generative model, propose a novel structured zero-shot diffusion model,
dubbed DiffSCI. DiffSCI leverages the structural insights from the deep prior
and optimization-based methodologies, complemented by the generative
capabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion model.
Specifically, firstly, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model, which has been
trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images, as the generative denoiser
within the Plug-and-Play framework for the first time. This integration allows
for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction, especially in the case
that current methods struggle to address effectively. Secondly, we
systematically account for spectral band correlations and introduce a robust
methodology to mitigate wavelength mismatch, thus enabling seamless adaptation
of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs. Thirdly, an accelerated algorithm is
implemented to expedite the resolution of the data subproblem. This
augmentation not only accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the
quality of the reconstruction process. We present extensive testing to show
that DiffSCI exhibits discernible performance enhancements over prevailing
self-supervised and zero-shot approaches, surpassing even supervised
transformer counterparts across both simulated and real datasets. Our code will
be available.

<p class="mathjax">Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and
household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important
feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on
resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled
data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a
hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system
resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high
accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies
to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2)
effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the
resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed
hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware
characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance,
falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With
respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically
reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and
energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed
LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling
efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to
run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a
ubiquitous manner. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">With net-zero emission goals, low-carbon transitions enter a new phase of
development, leading to new challenges for policymaking and research. Multiple
transitions unfold in parallel across different sectors. This involves a broad
range of technologies, while actors engage in increasingly complex discourses.
Here, we study the discourses on hydrogen in Germany. Based on the analysis of
179 newspaper articles from 2016 to 2020, we find that a diverse set of actors,
including many industry incumbents, speak favorably about hydrogen, emphasizing
economic opportunities and its relevance for the energy transition, whereas
skeptics highlight its low energy efficiency and expected scarcity. With the
help of discourse network analysis, we identify three emerging conflicts around
the use, production, and import of hydrogen. We explain these conflicts and the
widespread support of incumbents with a conceptual framework that captures the
complex interplay of sectoral contexts, specific technologies and actor
interests.

<p class="mathjax">There exist a wide range of single number metrics for assessing performance
of classification algorithms, including AUC and the F1-score (Wikipedia lists
17 such metrics, with 27 different names). In this article, I propose a new
metric to answer the following question: when an algorithm is tuned so that it
can no longer distinguish labelled cats from real cats, how often does a
randomly chosen image that has been labelled as containing a cat actually
contain a cat? The steps to construct this metric are as follows. First, we set
a threshold score such that when the algorithm is shown two randomly-chosen
images -- one that has a score greater than the threshold (i.e. a picture
labelled as containing a cat) and another from those pictures that really does
contain a cat -- the probability that the image with the highest score is the
one chosen from the set of real cat images is 50\%. At this decision threshold,
the set of positively labelled images are indistinguishable from the set of
images which are positive. Then, as a second step, we measure performance by
asking how often a randomly chosen picture from those labelled as containing a
cat actually contains a cat. This metric can be thought of as {\it precision at
the indistinguishability threshold}. While this new metric doesn't address the
tradeoff between precision and recall inherent to all such metrics, I do show
why this method avoids pitfalls that can occur when using, for example AUC, and
it is better motivated than, for example, the F1-score.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development of reinforcement learning (RL) has boosted the
adoption of online RL for wireless radio resource management (RRM). However,
online RL algorithms require direct interactions with the environment, which
may be undesirable given the potential performance loss due to the unavoidable
exploration in RL. In this work, we first investigate the use of \emph{offline}
RL algorithms in solving the RRM problem. We evaluate several state-of-the-art
offline RL algorithms, including behavior constrained Q-learning (BCQ),
conservative Q-learning (CQL), and implicit Q-learning (IQL), for a specific
RRM problem that aims at maximizing a linear combination {of sum and}
5-percentile rates via user scheduling. We observe that the performance of
offline RL for the RRM problem depends critically on the behavior policy used
for data collection, and further propose a novel offline RL solution that
leverages heterogeneous datasets collected by different behavior policies. We
show that with a proper mixture of the datasets, offline RL can produce a
near-optimal RL policy even when all involved behavior policies are highly
suboptimal.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications supported
by deep learning (DL), the energy efficiency of these applications has an
increasingly large impact on sustainability. We introduce Smaragdine, a new
energy accounting system for tensor-based DL programs implemented with
TensorFlow. At the heart of Smaragdine is a novel white-box methodology of
energy accounting: Smaragdine is aware of the internal structure of the DL
program, which we call tensor-aware energy accounting. With Smaragdine, the
energy consumption of a DL program can be broken down into units aligned with
its logical hierarchical decomposition structure. We apply Smaragdine for
understanding the energy behavior of BERT, one of the most widely used language
models. Layer-by-layer and tensor-by-tensor, Smaragdine is capable of
identifying the highest energy/power-consuming components of BERT. Furthermore,
we conduct two case studies on how Smaragdine supports downstream toolchain
building, one on the comparative energy impact of hyperparameter tuning of
BERT, the other on the energy behavior evolution when BERT evolves to its next
generation, ALBERT.

<p class="mathjax">We conduct a thorough study of different forms of horizontally explicit and
vertically implicit (HEVI) time-integration strategies for the compressible
Euler equations on spherical domains typical of nonhydrostatic global
atmospheric applications. We compare the computational time and complexity of
two nonlinear variants (NHEVI-GMRES and NHEVI-LU) and a linear variant (LHEVI).
We report on the performance of these three variants for a number of additive
Runge-Kutta Methods ranging in order of accuracy from second through fifth, and
confirm the expected order of accuracy of the HEVI methods for each
time-integrator. To gauge the maximum usable time-step of each HEVI method, we
run simulations of a nonhydrostatic baroclinic instability for 100 days and
then use this time-step to compare the time-to-solution of each method. The
results show that NHEVI-LU is 2x faster than NHEVI-GMRES, and LHEVI is 5x
faster than NHEVI-LU, for the idealized cases tested. The baroclinic
instability and inertia-gravity wave simulations indicate that the optimal
choice of time-integrator is LHEVI with either second or third order schemes,
as both schemes yield similar time to solution and relative L2 error at their
maximum usable time-steps. In the future, we will report on whether these
results hold for more complex problems using, e.g., real atmospheric data
and/or a higher model top typical of space weather applications.

<p class="mathjax">The use of appearance codes in recent work on generative modeling has enabled
novel view renders with variable appearance and illumination, such as day-time
and night-time renders of a scene. A major limitation of this technique is the
need to re-train new appearance codes for every scene on inference, so in this
work we address this problem proposing a framework that learns a joint
embedding space for the appearance and structure of the scene by enforcing a
contrastive loss constraint between different modalities. We apply our
framework to a simple Variational Auto-Encoder model on the RADIATE dataset
\cite{sheeny2021radiate} and qualitatively demonstrate that we can generate new
renders of night-time photos using day-time appearance codes without additional
optimization iterations. Additionally, we compare our model to a baseline VAE
that uses the standard per-image appearance code technique and show that our
approach achieves generations of similar quality without learning appearance
codes for any unseen images on inference.

which generalizes the Light Bulb problem~(\cite{prr89}): Given two sets $A
\subset \{-1,+1\}^d$ and $B \subset \{-1,+1\}^d$ with $|A|=|B| = n$, if there
are exact $k$ pairs whose inner product passes a certain threshold, i.e.,
$\{(a_1, b_1), \cdots, (a_k, b_k)\} \subset A \times B$ such that $\forall i
\in [k], \langle a_i,b_i \rangle \geq \rho \cdot d$, for a threshold $\rho \in
(0,1)$, the goal is to identify those $k$ heavy inner products. We provide an
algorithm that runs in $O(n^{2 \omega / 3+ o(1)})$ time to find the $k$ inner
product pairs that surpass $\rho \cdot d$ threshold with high probability,
where $\omega$ is the current matrix multiplication exponent. By solving this

<p class="mathjax">In semiconductor manufacturing, lithography has often been the manufacturing
step defining the smallest possible pattern dimensions. In recent years,
progress has been made towards high-NA (Numerical Aperture) EUVL
(Extreme-Ultraviolet-Lithography) paradigm, which promises to advance pattern
shrinking (2 nm node and beyond). However, a significant increase in stochastic
defects and the complexity of defect detection becomes more pronounced with
high-NA. Present defect inspection techniques (both non-machine learning and
machine learning based), fail to achieve satisfactory performance at high-NA
dimensions. In this work, we investigate the use of the Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference (SAHI) framework for improving upon current techniques. Using SAHI,
inference is performed on size-increased slices of the SEM images. This leads
to the object detector's receptive field being more effective in capturing
small defect instances. First, the performance on previously investigated
semiconductor datasets is benchmarked across various configurations, and the
SAHI approach is demonstrated to substantially enhance the detection of small
defects, by approx. 2x. Afterwards, we also demonstrated application of SAHI
leads to flawless detection rates on a new test dataset, with scenarios not
encountered during training, whereas previous trained models failed. Finally,
we formulate an extension of SAHI that does not significantly reduce
true-positive predictions while eliminating false-positive predictions.

<p class="mathjax">With the development of generative models like GPT-3, it is increasingly more
challenging to differentiate generated texts from human-written ones. There is
a large number of studies that have demonstrated good results in bot
identification. However, the majority of such works depend on supervised
learning methods that require labelled data and/or prior knowledge about the
bot-model architecture. In this work, we propose a bot identification algorithm
that is based on unsupervised learning techniques and does not depend on a
large amount of labelled data. By combining findings in semantic analysis by
clustering (crisp and fuzzy) and information techniques, we construct a robust
model that detects a generated text for different types of bot. We find that
the generated texts tend to be more chaotic while literary works are more
complex. We also demonstrate that the clustering of human texts results in
fuzzier clusters in comparison to the more compact and well-separated clusters
of bot-generated texts.

<p class="mathjax">Unfoldings are a well known partial-order semantics of P/T Petri nets that
can be applied to various model checking or verification problems. For
high-level Petri nets, the so-called symbolic unfolding generalizes this
notion. A complete finite prefix of a P/T Petri net's unfolding contains all
information to verify, e.g., reachability of markings. We unite these two
concepts and define complete finite prefixes of the symbolic unfolding of
high-level Petri nets. For a class of safe high-level Petri nets, we generalize
the well-known algorithm by Esparza et al. for constructing small such
prefixes. We evaluate this extended algorithm through a prototype
implementation on four novel benchmark families. Additionally, we identify a
more general class of nets with infinitely many reachable markings, for which
an approach with an adapted cut-off criterion extends the complete prefix
methodology, in the sense that the original algorithm cannot be applied to the
P/T net represented by a high-level net.

<p class="mathjax">Be it in the IoT or automotive domain, implicit certificates are gaining ever
more prominence in constrained embedded devices. They present a
resource-efficient security solution against common threat concerns. The
computational requirements are not the main issue anymore. The focus is now
placed on determining a good balance between the provided security level and
the derived threat model. A security aspect that often gets overlooked is the
establishment of secure communication sessions, as most design solutions are
based only on the use of static key derivation, and therefore, lack the perfect
forward secrecy. This leaves the transmitted data open for potential future
exposures by having keys tied to the certificates rather than the communication
sessions. We aim to patch this gap, by presenting a design that utilizes the
Station to Station (STS) protocol with implicit certificates. In addition, we
propose potential protocol optimization implementation steps and run a
comprehensive study on the performance and security level between the proposed
design and the state-of-the-art key derivation protocols. In our comparative
study, we show that with a slight computational increase of 20\% compared to a
static ECDSA key derivation, we are able to mitigate many session-related
security vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain open.

<p class="mathjax">We note that decoupled weight decay regularization is a particular case of
weight norm control where the target norm of weights is set to 0. Any
optimization method (e.g., Adam) which uses decoupled weight decay
regularization (respectively, AdamW) can be viewed as a particular case of a
more general algorithm with weight norm control (respectively, AdamWN). We
argue that setting the target norm of weights to 0 can be suboptimal and other
target norm values can be considered. For instance, any training run where
AdamW achieves a particular norm of weights can be challenged by AdamWN
scheduled to achieve a comparable norm of weights. We discuss various
implications of introducing weight norm control instead of weight decay.

<p class="mathjax">Space weather phenomena like geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and
geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) pose significant risks to critical
technological infrastructure. While traditional predictive models, grounded in
simulation, hold theoretical robustness, they grapple with challenges, notably
the assimilation of imprecise data and extensive computational complexities. In
recent years, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has been adopted to develop
Machine Learning (ML)-enabled magnetometer systems for predicting real-time
terrestrial magnetic perturbations as a proxy measure for GIC. While TinyML
offers efficient, real-time data processing, its intrinsic limitations prevent
the utilization of robust methods with high computational needs. This paper
developed a physics-guided TinyML framework to address the above challenges.
This framework integrates physics-based regularization at the stages of model
training and compression, thereby augmenting the reliability of predictions.
The developed pruning scheme within the framework harnesses the inherent
physical characteristics of the domain, striking a balance between model size
and robustness. The study presents empirical results, drawing a comprehensive
comparison between the accuracy and reliability of the developed framework and
its traditional counterpart. Such a comparative analysis underscores the
prospective applicability of the developed framework in conceptualizing robust,
ML-enabled magnetometer systems for real-time space weather forecasting.

<p class="mathjax">The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years
ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but
focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there
are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of
RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of
the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the
other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE
roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a
straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what
experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging.
In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore
the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental
competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On
this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different
dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations
for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix
details how existing curricula fit into this framework.

<p class="mathjax">Generating high-quality summaries for chat dialogs often requires large
labeled datasets. We propose a method to efficiently use unlabeled data for
extractive summarization of customer-agent dialogs. In our method, we frame
summarization as a question-answering problem and use state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels for a dialog. We then use
these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively
transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We
demonstrate our method on the \tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10\% of
the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L,
whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set
obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L. In other words, in the worst case
(i.e., ROUGE-L) we still effectively retain 94.7% of the performance while
using only 10% of the data.

<p class="mathjax">After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed in clinical practice,
performance monitoring is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
the algorithm over time. The goal of this work is to highlight the complexity
of designing a monitoring strategy and the need for a systematic framework that
compares the multitude of monitoring options. One of the main decisions is
choosing between using real-world (observational) versus interventional data.
Although the former is the most convenient source of monitoring data, it
exhibits well-known biases, such as confounding, selection, and missingness. In
fact, when the ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm
itself may be a primary source of bias. On the other hand, a carefully designed
interventional study that randomizes individuals can explicitly eliminate such
biases, but the ethics, feasibility, and cost of such an approach must be
carefully considered. Beyond the decision of the data source, monitoring
strategies vary in the performance criteria they track, the interpretability of
the test statistics, the strength of their assumptions, and their speed at
detecting performance decay. As a first step towards developing a framework
that compares the various monitoring options, we consider a case study of an
ML-based risk prediction algorithm for postoperative nausea and vomiting
(PONV). Bringing together tools from causal inference and statistical process
control, we walk through the basic steps of defining candidate monitoring
criteria, describing potential sources of bias and the causal model, and
specifying and comparing candidate monitoring procedures. We hypothesize that
these steps can be applied more generally, as causal inference can address
other sources of biases as well.

<p class="mathjax">In contrast to the human vision that mainly depends on the shape for
recognizing the objects, deep image recognition models are widely known to be
biased toward texture. Recently, Meta research team has released the first
foundation model for image segmentation, termed segment anything model (SAM),
which has attracted significant attention. In this work, we understand SAM from
the perspective of texture \textit{v.s.} shape. Different from label-oriented
recognition tasks, the SAM is trained to predict a mask for covering the object
shape based on a promt. With this said, it seems self-evident that the SAM is
biased towards shape. In this work, however, we reveal an interesting finding:
the SAM is strongly biased towards texture-like dense features rather than
shape. This intriguing finding is supported by a novel setup where we
disentangle texture and shape cues and design texture-shape cue conflict for
mask prediction.

generalize model capabilities to unseen mask types, rather than learning

<p class="mathjax">The budgeted model training challenge aims to train an efficient
classification model under resource limitations. To tackle this task in
ImageNet-100, we describe a simple yet effective resource-aware backbone search
framework composed of profile and instantiation phases. In addition, we employ
multi-resolution ensembles to boost inference accuracy on limited resources.
The profile phase obeys time and memory constraints to determine the models'
optimal batch-size, max epochs, and automatic mixed precision (AMP). And the
instantiation phase trains models with the determined parameters from the
profile phase. For improving intra-domain generalizations, the multi-resolution
ensembles are formed by two-resolution images with randomly applied flips. We
present a comprehensive analysis with expensive experiments. Based on our
approach, we win first place in International Conference on Computer Vision
(ICCV) 2023 Workshop Challenge Track 1 on Resource Efficient Deep Learning for
Computer Vision (RCV).

<p class="mathjax">Continuous tracking of boxers across multiple training sessions helps
quantify traits required for the well-known ten-point-must system. However,
continuous tracking of multiple athletes across multiple training sessions
remains a challenge, because it is difficult to precisely segment bout
boundaries in a recorded video stream. Furthermore, re-identification of the
same athlete over different period or even within the same bout remains a
challenge. Difficulties are further compounded when a single fixed view video
is captured in top-view. This work summarizes our progress in creating a system
in an economically single fixed top-view camera. Specifically, we describe
improved algorithm for bout transition detection and in-bout continuous player
identification without erroneous ID updation or ID switching. From our custom
collected data of ~11 hours (athlete count: 45, bouts: 189), our transition
detection algorithm achieves 90% accuracy and continuous ID tracking achieves
IDU=0, IDS=0.

<p class="mathjax">Choreographic programming (CP) is an emerging paradigm for programming
distributed applications that run on multiple nodes. In CP, the programmer
writes one program, called a choreography, that is then transformed to
individual programs for each node via a compilation step called endpoint
projection (EPP). While CP languages have existed for over a decade,
library-level CP -- in which choreographies are expressed as programs in an
existing host language, and choreographic language constructs and EPP are
provided entirely by a host-language library -- is in its infancy.
Library-level CP has great potential, but existing implementations have
portability, efficiency, and practicality drawbacks that hinder its adoption.
<br />In this paper, we aim to advance the state of the art of library-level CP
with two novel techniques for choreographic library design and implementation:
endpoint projection as dependency injection (EPP-as-DI), and choreographic
enclaves. EPP-as-DI is a language-agnostic technique for implementing EPP at
the library level. Unlike existing library-level approaches, EPP-as-DI asks
little from the host language -- support for higher-order functions is all that
is required -- making it usable in a wide variety of host languages.
Choreographic enclaves are a language feature that lets the programmer define
sub-choreographies within a larger choreography. Within an enclave, "knowledge
of choice" is propagated only among the enclave's participants, enabling the
seamless use of the host language's conditional constructs while addressing the
efficiency limitations of existing library-level CP implementations.
<br />We implement EPP-as-DI and choreographic enclaves in ChoRus, the first CP
library for the Rust programming language. Our case studies and benchmarks
demonstrate that the usability and performance of ChoRus compares favorably to
traditional distributed programming in Rust.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
representation learning on graphs, but they often suffer from overfitting and
label noise issues, especially when the data is scarce or imbalanced. Different
from the paradigm of previous methods that rely on single-node confidence, in
this paper, we introduce a novel Class-wise Selection for Graph Neural
Networks, dubbed CSGNN, which employs a neighbor-aggregated latent space to
adaptively select reliable nodes across different classes. Specifically, 1) to
tackle the class imbalance issue, we introduce a dynamic class-wise selection
mechanism, leveraging the clustering technique to identify clean nodes based on
the neighbor-aggregated confidences. In this way, our approach can avoid the
pitfalls of biased sampling which is common with global threshold techniques.
2) To alleviate the problem of noisy labels, built on the concept of the
memorization effect, CSGNN prioritizes learning from clean nodes before noisy
ones, thereby iteratively enhancing model performance while mitigating label
noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CSGNN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of Blockchain technology (BT) revolutionised the way remittance
transactions are recorded. Banks and remittance organisations have shown a
growing interest in exploring blockchain's potential advantages over
traditional practices. This paper presents a data-driven predictive decision
support approach as an innovative artefact designed for the blockchain-oriented
remittance industry. Employing a theory-generating Design Science Research
(DSR) approach, we have uncovered the emergence of predictive capabilities
driven by transactional big data. The artefact integrates predictive analytics
and Machine Learning (ML) to enable real-time remittance monitoring, empowering
management decision-makers to address challenges in the uncertain digitised
landscape of blockchain-oriented remittance companies. Bridging the gap between
theory and practice, this research not only enhances the security of the
remittance ecosystem but also lays the foundation for future predictive
decision support solutions, extending the potential of predictive analytics to
other domains. Additionally, the generated theory from the artifact's
implementation enriches the DSR approach and fosters grounded and stakeholder
theory development in the information systems domain.

environments on triangulation. Given widely accepted algorithmic triangulation
methods, such as O (n ln n) or a simpler O (n^3) method, we can mathematically
prove that triangulation of any two dimensional polygonal region is possible,
albeit impractical in some cases. Further, we consider the implications of
environments in which a z-axis is present, as seen in cellular triangulation.
In many of the cases where consideration of the z-axis is necessary, we
recognize the absence of a fixed or known point of origin and consider methods
of addressing this challenge.

<p class="mathjax">While prior work has investigated the benefits of online health communities
and general purpose social media used for health-related purposes, little work
examines the use of TikTok, an emerging social media platform with a
substantial user base. The platform's multimodal capabilities foster creative
self-expression, while the content-driven network allows users to reach new
audiences beyond their personal connections. To investigate users' challenges
and motivations, we analyzed 160 TikTok videos that center on users' first hand
experiences living with chronic illness. We found that users struggled with a
loss of normalcy and stigmatization in daily life. To contend with these
challenges, they publicly shared their experiences to raise awareness, seek
support from peers, and normalize chronic illness experiences. Based on our
findings, we discuss the modalities of TikTok that facilitate self-expression
around stigmatized topics and provide implications for the design of online
health communities that better support adolescents and young adults.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Meta Prompting, a novel
technique that revolutionizes the way large language models (LLMs), multi-modal
foundation models, and AI systems approach problem-solving and data
interpretation. Meta Prompting, rooted in type theory and category theory,
prioritizes the structure and syntax of information, providing a unique
framework that transcends traditional content-focused methods. We delve into
the formal definitions of Meta Prompting, contrasting it with Few-Shot
Prompting, and highlight its applicability and superiority in various AI
applications.
<br />Key to this exploration is the expansion of Meta Prompting into the realm of
complex reasoning. Here, we demonstrate how this technique adeptly breaks down
intricate problems into manageable sub-problems, facilitating a step-by-step,
detailed approach to problem-solving. This method proves especially
advantageous in terms of token efficiency and offering a fair comparison in
problem-solving scenarios, standing out against few-shot example approaches.
<br />Furthermore, the paper breaks new ground by extending Meta Prompting into
multi-modal foundation model settings. This extension addresses the integration
of diverse data types, such as images, audio, and video, within the structured
framework of Meta Prompting, highlighting both the challenges and the vast
potential of this approach in handling complex, multi-faceted data (The code is

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing
modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks,
making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR
foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients,
demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training
labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions
remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals
and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study
examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation
model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M
Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The
Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via
continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to
baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local
foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical
prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$
matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while
providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels.
With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially
improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to
match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to
90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch.
Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals
provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility
of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development
of healthcare AI.

<p class="mathjax">Existing learning methods often struggle to balance interpretability and
predictive performance. While models like nearest neighbors and non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) offer high interpretability, their predictive
performance on supervised learning tasks is often limited. In contrast, neural
networks based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) support the modular
construction of expressive architectures and tend to have better recognition
accuracy but are often regarded as black boxes in terms of interpretability.
Our approach aims to strike a better balance between these two aspects through
the use of a building block based on NMF that incorporates supervised neural
network training methods to achieve high predictive performance while retaining
the desirable interpretability properties of NMF. We evaluate our Predictive
Factorized Coupling (PFC) block on small datasets and show that it achieves
competitive predictive performance with MLPs while also offering improved
interpretability. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in various
scenarios, such as continual learning, training on non-i.i.d. data, and
knowledge removal after training. Additionally, we show examples of using the
PFC block to build more expressive architectures, including a fully-connected
residual network as well as a factorized recurrent neural network (RNN) that
performs competitively with vanilla RNNs while providing improved
interpretability. The PFC block uses an iterative inference algorithm that
converges to a fixed point, making it possible to trade off accuracy vs
computation after training but also currently preventing its use as a general
MLP replacement in some scenarios such as training on very large datasets. We
provide source code at https://github.com/bkvogel/pfc

<p class="mathjax">Abortion is a controversial topic that has long been debated in the US. With
the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, access to safe and
legal reproductive care is once again in the national spotlight. A key issue
central to this debate is patient privacy, as in the post-HITECH Act era it has
become easier for medical records to be electronically accessed and shared.
This study analyzed a large Twitter dataset from May to December 2022 to
examine the public's reactions to Roe v. Wade's overruling and its implications
for privacy. Using a mixed-methods approach consisting of computational and
qualitative content analysis, we found a wide range of concerns voiced from the
confidentiality of patient-physician information exchange to medical records
being shared without patient consent. These findings may inform policy making
and healthcare industry practices concerning medical privacy related to
reproductive rights and women's health.

<p class="mathjax">The Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) structure has shown great potential in
approximating complex solution operators with low generalization errors.
Recently, a sequential DeepONet (S-DeepONet) was proposed to use sequential
learning models in the branch of DeepONet to predict final solutions given
time-dependent inputs. In this novel work, the S-DeepONet architecture is
further extended by modifying the information combination mechanism between the
branch and trunk networks to simultaneously predict vector solutions with
multiple components at multiple time steps of the evolution history. Two
example problems, one on transient fluid flow and the other on path-dependent
plastic loading were shown to demonstrate the capabilities of the model to
handle different physics problems. The use of a trained S-DeepONet model in
inverse parameter identification via the genetic algorithm is shown to
demonstrate the application of the model. In almost all cases, the trained
model achieved an $R^2$ value of above 0.99 and relative $L_2$ error of less
than 10\% with only 3200 training data points, indicating superior accuracy.
The vector S-DeepONet model, having only 0.4\% more parameters than a scalar
model, can predict two output components simultaneously at an accuracy similar
to the two independently trained scalar models with a 20.8\% faster training
time. The S-DeepONet inference is at least three orders of magnitude faster
than direct numerical simulations, and inverse parameter identifications using
the trained model is highly efficient and accurate.

<p class="mathjax">LoRA achieves remarkable resource efficiency and comparable performance when
adapting LLMs for specific tasks. Since ChatGPT demonstrated superior
performance on various tasks, there has been a growing desire to adapt one
model for all tasks. However, the explicit low-rank of LoRA limits the
adaptation performance in complex multi-task scenarios. LoRA is dominated by a
small number of top singular vectors while fine-tuning decomposes into a set of
less important unitary transforms. In this paper, we propose MultiLoRA for
better multi-task adaptation by reducing the dominance of top singular vectors
observed in LoRA. MultiLoRA scales LoRA modules horizontally and change
parameter initialization of adaptation matrices to reduce parameter dependency,
thus yields more balanced unitary subspaces. We unprecedentedly construct
specialized training data by mixing datasets of instruction follow, natural
language understanding, world knowledge, to cover semantically and
syntactically different samples. With only 2.5% of additional parameters,
MultiLoRA outperforms single LoRA counterparts and fine-tuning on multiple
benchmarks and model scales. Further investigation into weight update matrices
of MultiLoRA exhibits reduced dependency on top singular vectors and more
democratic unitary transform contributions.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in
various applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial
prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that lead to
undesirable outputs. The inherent vulnerability of LLMs stems from their
input-output mechanisms, especially when presented with intensely
out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This paper proposes a token-level detection
method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to
predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's
perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the
detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. As a result, we propose
two methods: one that identifies each token as either being part of an
adversarial prompt or not, and another that estimates the probability of each
token being part of an adversarial prompt.

<p class="mathjax">Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in power
systems. Due to the inherently low inertia of inverters, there is a heightened
risk of disruptive voltage oscillations. A particular challenge in the
operation of grid connected IBRs is the variations in the grid side voltage.
The changes in the grid side voltage introduces nonlinear and time-varying
constriants on the inverter voltages themselves. For an operator, it would be
useful to know the set of active and reactive powers that can be tracked under
these time-varying conditons. This paper introduces an optimization model
designed to assess the achievability of power setpoints within the framework of
constrained static state-feedback power control. Additionally, we present a
Monte Carlo simulation-based method to optimize the set of achievable power
setpoints. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through
simulation results.

<p class="mathjax">The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic make people wear masks more frequently than
ever. Current general face recognition system suffers from serious performance
degradation,when encountering occluded scenes. The potential reason is that
face features are corrupted by occlusions on key facial regions. To tackle this
problem, previous works either extract identity-related embeddings on feature
level by additional mask prediction, or restore the occluded facial part by
generative models. However, the former lacks visual results for model
interpretation, while the latter suffers from artifacts which may affect
downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-task gEnerative
mask dEcoupling face Recognition (MEER) network to jointly handle these two
tasks, which can learn occlusionirrelevant and identity-related representation
while achieving unmasked face synthesis. We first present a novel mask
decoupling module to disentangle mask and identity information, which makes the
network obtain purer identity features from visible facial components. Then, an
unmasked face is restored by a joint-training strategy, which will be further
used to refine the recognition network with an id-preserving loss. Experiments
on masked face recognition under realistic and synthetic occlusions benchmarks
demonstrate that the MEER can outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.

regulation-caused uncertain state-of-charge and random departure behavior
complicate the evaluation and badly impact the evaluation accuracy. To resolve
this issue, this letter proposes a distributionally robust real-time

<p class="mathjax">Serving foundation model inference is a pivotal component of contemporary AI
applications, where this service is usually hosted in a centralized data center
on a group of homogeneous high-performance GPUs. In this paper, we explore how
to deploy such a service in a heterogeneous environment in terms of both
computation capacity and network connection as an alternative to reduce the
high inference cost. We propose HexGen, a distributed inference engine that
supports asymmetric partitioning of the inference computation according to
tensor model parallelism and pipeline parallelism. HexGen can be deployed with
a set of different GPUs connected by a fully heterogeneous network, where the
key technique contribution is a scheduling algorithm that allocates the
asymmetric inference tasklets among these GPUs connected by different networks.
We define the scheduling problem as a constrained optimization problem and
further propose an efficient evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal
allocation strategy. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate the
efficiency of HexGen by serving the state-of-the-art Llama-2 (70B) model. The
experimental results suggest that HexGen can choose to achieve up to 2.3 times
lower latency deadlines or tolerate up to 4 times more traffic request rates
compared with the homogeneous baseline given the same budget. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/HexGen.

<p class="mathjax">There is an increasing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
for managing structured data and enhancing data science processes. Despite the
potential benefits, this integration poses significant questions regarding
their reliability and decision-making methodologies. It highlights the
importance of various factors in the model selection process, including the
nature of the data, problem type, performance metrics, computational resources,
interpretability vs accuracy, assumptions about data, and ethical
considerations. Our objective is to elucidate and express the factors and
assumptions guiding GPT-4's model selection recommendations. We employ a
variability model to depict these factors and use toy datasets to evaluate both
the model and the implementation of the identified heuristics. By contrasting
these outcomes with heuristics from other platforms, our aim is to determine
the effectiveness and distinctiveness of GPT-4's methodology. This research is
committed to advancing our comprehension of AI decision-making processes,
especially in the realm of model selection within data science. Our efforts are
directed towards creating AI systems that are more transparent and

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores a novel setting called Generalized Category Discovery in
Semantic Segmentation (GCDSS), aiming to segment unlabeled images given prior
knowledge from a labeled set of base classes. The unlabeled images contain
pixels of the base class or novel class. In contrast to Novel Category
Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), there is no prerequisite for prior
knowledge mandating the existence of at least one novel class in each unlabeled
image. Besides, we broaden the segmentation scope beyond foreground objects to
include the entire image. Existing NCDSS methods rely on the aforementioned
priors, making them challenging to truly apply in real-world situations. We
propose a straightforward yet effective framework that reinterprets the GCDSS
challenge as a task of mask classification. Additionally, we construct a
baseline method and introduce the Neighborhood Relations-Guided Mask Clustering
Algorithm (NeRG-MaskCA) for mask categorization to address the fragmentation in
semantic representation. A benchmark dataset, Cityscapes-GCD, derived from the
Cityscapes dataset, is established to evaluate the GCDSS framework. Our method
demonstrates the feasibility of the GCDSS problem and the potential for
discovering and segmenting novel object classes in unlabeled images. We employ
the generated pseudo-labels from our approach as ground truth to supervise the
training of other models, thereby enabling them with the ability to segment
novel classes. It paves the way for further research in generalized category
discovery, broadening the horizons of semantic segmentation and its
applications. For details, please visit https://github.com/JethroPeng/GCDSS

<p class="mathjax">Optimizers are essential components for successfully training deep neural
network models. In order to achieve the best performance from such models,
designers need to carefully choose the optimizer hyperparameters. However, this
can be a computationally expensive and time-consuming process. Although it is
known that all optimizer hyperparameters must be tuned for maximum performance,
there is still a lack of clarity regarding the individual influence of minor
priority hyperparameters, including the safeguard factor $\epsilon$ and
momentum factor $\beta$, in leading adaptive optimizers (specifically, those
based on the Adam optimizers). In this manuscript, we introduce a new framework
based on gradient histograms to analyze and justify important attributes of
adaptive optimizers, such as their optimal performance and the relationships
and dependencies among hyperparameters. Furthermore, we propose a novel
gradient histogram-based algorithm that automatically estimates a reduced and
accurate search space for the safeguard hyperparameter $\epsilon$, where the
optimal value can be easily found.

<br />Transferring achievements from dense RGB pre-training directly to event
camera data yields subpar performance. This is attributed to the spatial
sparsity inherent in an event image (converted from event data), where many
pixels do not contain information. To mitigate this sparsity issue, we encode
an event image into event patch features, automatically mine contextual
similarity relationships among patches, group the patch features into
distinctive contexts, and enforce context-to-context similarities to learn
discriminative event features.
<br />For training our framework, we curate a synthetic event camera dataset
featuring diverse scene and motion patterns. Transfer learning performance on
downstream dense prediction tasks illustrates the superiority of our method
over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, our single model secured the top
position in the challenging DSEC-Flow benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents frequently face challenges in
adapting to tasks outside their training distribution, including issues with
over-fitting, catastrophic forgetting and sample inefficiency. Although the
application of adapters has proven effective in supervised learning contexts
such as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential within
the DRL domain remains largely unexplored. This paper delves into the
integration of adapters in reinforcement learning, presenting an innovative
adaptation strategy that demonstrates enhanced training efficiency and
improvement of the base-agent, experimentally in the nanoRTS environment, a
real-time strategy (RTS) game simulation. Our proposed universal approach is
not only compatible with pre-trained neural networks but also with rule-based

<p class="mathjax">In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT has
been widely used in various applications. The new feature: customization of
ChatGPT models by users to cater to specific needs has opened new frontiers in
AI utility. However, this study reveals a significant security vulnerability
inherent in these user-customized GPTs: prompt injection attacks. Through
comprehensive testing of over 200 user-designed GPT models via adversarial
prompts, we demonstrate that these systems are susceptible to prompt
injections. Through prompt injection, an adversary can not only extract the
customized system prompts but also access the uploaded files. This paper
provides a first-hand analysis of the prompt injection, alongside the
evaluation of the possible mitigation of such attacks. Our findings underscore
the urgent need for robust security frameworks in the design and deployment of
customizable GPT models. The intent of this paper is to raise awareness and
prompt action in the AI community, ensuring that the benefits of GPT
customization do not come at the cost of compromised security and privacy.

<p class="mathjax">For a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem, the information of
alternatives under different attributes is given in the form of intuitionistic
fuzzy number(IFN). Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) plays an important role in
dealing with un-certain and incomplete information. The similarity measure of
intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) has always been a research hotspot. A new
similarity measure of IFSs based on the projection technology and cosine
similarity measure, which con-siders the direction and length of IFSs at the
same time, is first proposed in this paper. The objective of the presented
pa-per is to develop a MADM method and medical diagnosis method under IFS using
the projection technology and cosine similarity measure. Some examples are used
to illustrate the comparison results of the proposed algorithm and some
exist-ing methods. The comparison result shows that the proposed algorithm is
effective and can identify the optimal scheme accurately. In medical diagnosis
area, it can be used to quickly diagnose disease. The proposed method enriches
the exist-ing similarity measure methods and it can be applied to not only
IFSs, but also other interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets(IVIFSs) as well.

<p class="mathjax">Our focus is on projects, i.e., business processes, which are emerging as the
economic drivers of our times. Differently from day-to-day operational
processes that do not require detailed planning, a project requires planning
and resource-constrained scheduling for coordinating resources across sub- or
related projects and organizations. A planner in charge of project planning has
to select a set of activities to perform, determine their precedence
constraints, and schedule them according to temporal project constraints. We
suggest a data-driven project planning approach for classes of projects such as
infrastructure building and information systems development projects. A project
network is first learned from historical records. The discovered network
relaxes temporal constraints embedded in individual projects, thus uncovering
where planning and scheduling flexibility can be exploited for greater benefit.
Then, the network, which contains multiple project plan variations, from which
one has to be selected, is enriched by identifying decision rules and frequent
paths. The planner can rely on the project network for: 1) decoding a project
variation such that it forms a new project plan, and 2) applying
resource-constrained project scheduling procedures to determine the project's
schedule and resource allocation. Using two real-world project datasets, we
show that the suggested approach may provide the planner with significant
flexibility (up to a 26% reduction of the critical path of a real project) to
adjust the project plan and schedule. We believe that the proposed approach can
play an important part in supporting decision making towards automated
data-driven project planning.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker
controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the
goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained
model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability
to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's
behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on
disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different
subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness
of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a
family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset
separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less
separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on
individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial
subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean
dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the
subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss
difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional
benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find
semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the
susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations. The results in this
paper are accompanied by a fully interactive web-based visualization of
subpopulation poisoning attacks found at

<p class="mathjax">The Terahertz band, spanning from 0.1~THz to 10~THz, is envisioned as a key
technology to realize ultra-high data rates in the 6G and beyond mobile
communication systems, due to its abundant bandwidth resource. However, to
realize THz communications, one substantial step is to fully understand the THz
channels, which relies on extensive channel measurements. In this paper, using
a correlation-based time domain channel sounder, measurement campaigns are
conducted in a laboratory at 140~GHz and 220~GHz. In the data post-processing
procedures, the time drift of clock signals is corrected using a linear
interpolation/extrapolation method. Based on the measured results, the main
objects that provide significant once-scattering clusters are found, based on
which the scattering losses are calculated and analyzed. Furthermore, the
channel characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, K-factor, etc. are
calculated and compared to 3GPP standard values. The propagation analysis and
channel characteristics are helpful to study channel modeling and guide system
design for THz communications.

<p class="mathjax">Context and motivation: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks. Their application in Requirements Engineering (RE), especially in
requirements classification, has gained increasing interest. Question/problem:
In our research, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of ChatGPT
models including text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4 in both zero-shot
and few-shot settings for requirements classification. The question arises as
to how these models compare to traditional classification methods, specifically
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Principal
ideas/results: Based on five diverse datasets, our results show that ChatGPT
consistently outperforms LSTM, and while ChatGPT is more effective than SVM in
classifying functional requirements (FR), SVM is better in classifying
non-functional requirements (NFR). Our results also show that contrary to our
expectations, the few-shot setting does not always lead to enhanced
performance; in most instances, it was found to be suboptimal. Contribution:
Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in the RE domain, suggesting that
they could play a pivotal role in future software engineering processes,
particularly as tools to enhance requirements classification.

<p class="mathjax">Deepfake has emerged for several years, yet efficient detection techniques
could generalize over different manipulation methods require further research.
While current image-level detection method fails to generalize to unseen
domains, owing to the domain-shift phenomenon brought by CNN's strong inductive
bias towards Deepfake texture, video-level one shows its potential to have both
generalization across multiple domains and robustness to compression. We argue
that although distinct face manipulation tools have different inherent bias,
they all disrupt the consistency between frames, which is a natural
characteristic shared by authentic videos. Inspired by this, we proposed a
detection approach by capturing frame inconsistency that broadly exists in
different forgery techniques, termed unearthing-common-inconsistency (UCI).
Concretely, the UCI network based on self-supervised contrastive learning can
better distinguish temporal consistency between real and fake videos from
multiple domains. We introduced a temporally-preserved module method to
introduce spatial noise perturbations, directing the model's attention towards
temporal information. Subsequently, leveraging a multi-view cross-correlation
learning module, we extensively learn the disparities in temporal
representations between genuine and fake samples. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generalization ability of our method on unseen Deepfake
domains.

more network attacks. Traditional abnormal traffic detection methods have
complex algorithms and find it difficult to detect abnormalities in the network
promptly, which cannot meet the demand for abnormal detection in the SDN
environment. Therefore, we propose an abnormal traffic detection system based
on deep learning hybrid model. The system adopts a hierarchical detection
technique, which first achieves rough detection of abnormal traffic based on
port information. Then it uses wavelet transform and deep learning techniques
for fine detection of all traffic data flowing through suspicious switches. The
experimental results show that the proposed detection method based on port

abnormal traffic. the accuracy, precision, and recall of the fine detection are

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have showcased their capability with few-shot
inference known as in-context learning. However, in-domain demonstrations are
not always readily available in real scenarios, leading to cross-domain
in-context learning. Besides, LLMs are still facing challenges in long-tail
knowledge in unseen and unfamiliar domains. The above limitations demonstrate
the necessity of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). In this paper, we study
the UDA problem under an in-context learning setting to adapt language models
from the source domain to the target domain without any target labels. The core
idea is to retrieve a subset of cross-domain elements that are the most similar
to the query, and elicit language model to adapt in an in-context manner by
learning both target domain distribution and the discriminative task signal
simultaneously with the augmented cross-domain in-context examples. We devise
different prompting and training strategies, accounting for different LM
architectures to learn the target distribution via language modeling. With
extensive experiments on Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Named Entity Recognition
(NER) tasks, we thoroughly study the effectiveness of ICL for domain transfer
and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models.

address the ill-posed inverse rendering from multi-view images. Contrary to
previous methods that recover the geometry, material, and illumination in
multiple stages and extract the properties from various multi-layer perceptrons
across different neural fields, we question such complexities and introduce our
method - a single-stage framework that uniformly recovers all properties. NePF
achieves this unification by fully utilizing the physical implication behind
the weight function of neural implicit surfaces and the view-dependent
radiance. Moreover, we introduce an innovative coordinate-based illumination
model for rapid volume physically-based rendering. To regularize this
illumination, we implement the subsurface scattering model for diffuse
estimation. We evaluate our method on both real and synthetic datasets. The
results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in recovering high-fidelity

<p class="mathjax">Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for
averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However,
some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious
failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement
learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous
tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most
reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the
previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient
to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial
rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the
expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning
on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift
between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in
forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that
greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks
while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in
continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on
approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality
and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World
benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect
memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against
state-of-the-art continual learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Most biomedical pretrained language models are monolingual and cannot handle
the growing cross-lingual requirements. The scarcity of non-English domain
corpora, not to mention parallel data, poses a significant hurdle in training
multilingual biomedical models. Since knowledge forms the core of
domain-specific corpora and can be translated into various languages
accurately, we propose a model called KBioXLM, which transforms the
multilingual pretrained model XLM-R into the biomedical domain using a
knowledge-anchored approach. We achieve a biomedical multilingual corpus by
incorporating three granularity knowledge alignments (entity, fact, and passage
levels) into monolingual corpora. Then we design three corresponding training
tasks (entity masking, relation masking, and passage relation prediction) and
continue training on top of the XLM-R model to enhance its domain cross-lingual
ability. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we translate the English
benchmarks of multiple tasks into Chinese. Experimental results demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms monolingual and multilingual
pretrained models in cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving
improvements of up to 10+ points. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/ngwlh-gl/KBioXLM.

are a promising and viable solution to meet the increasing heterogeneous
bandwidth demands. The extra capacity gained due to spatial parameters in
SDM-EONs could encounter detrimental losses if any link fails and timely
restoration is not done. This paper proposes a Protected and Unprotected
Working Core Groups assignment (PWCG/ UPWCG) scheme for differentiated
connection requests in multicore fiber-enabled SDM-EONs. A PWCG is inherently
protected by resources in a Dedicated Spare Core Group (DSCG). First, we divide
the cores into three groups using traffic and crosstalk considerations. In the
second step, we use the obtained core groups for resource provisioning in
dynamic network scenarios. The effectiveness of our proposed technique is
compared with a Link Disjoint Path Protection (LDPP) technique, and the
simulation study verifies our assertions and the findings.

<p class="mathjax">Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) has been extensively studied,
particularly in the visible spectrum. With the advancement of sensing
technology beyond the visible range, multispectral imaging has gained
significant attention in this direction. We present PAD based on multispectral
images constructed for eight different presentation artifacts resulted from
three different artifact species. In this work, we introduce Face Presentation
Attack Multispectral (FPAMS) database to demonstrate the significance of
employing multispectral imaging. The goal of this work is to study
complementary information that can be combined in two different ways (image
fusion and score fusion) from multispectral imaging to improve the face PAD.
The experimental evaluation results present an extensive qualitative analysis
of 61650 sample multispectral images collected for bonafide and artifacts. The
PAD based on the score fusion and image fusion method presents superior
performance, demonstrating the significance of employing multispectral imaging
to detect presentation artifacts.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly prominent in the
field of artificial intelligence. These models not only excel in traditional
vision-language tasks but also demonstrate impressive performance in
contemporary multi-modal benchmarks. Although many of these benchmarks attempt
to holistically evaluate MLLMs, they typically concentrate on basic reasoning
tasks, often yielding only simple yes/no or multi-choice responses. These
methods naturally lead to confusion and difficulties in conclusively
determining the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To mitigate this issue, we
manually curate a benchmark dataset specifically designed for MLLMs, with a
focus on complex reasoning tasks. Our benchmark comprises three key reasoning
categories: deductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. The queries in our
dataset are intentionally constructed to engage the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in the process of generating answers. For a fair comparison across
various MLLMs, we incorporate intermediate reasoning steps into our evaluation
criteria. In instances where an MLLM is unable to produce a definitive answer,
its reasoning ability is evaluated by requesting intermediate reasoning steps.
If these steps align with our manual annotations, appropriate scores are
assigned. This evaluation scheme resembles methods commonly used in human
assessments, such as exams or assignments, and represents what we consider a
more effective assessment technique compared with existing benchmarks. We
evaluate a selection of representative MLLMs using this rigorously developed
open-ended multi-step elaborate reasoning benchmark, designed to challenge and
accurately measure their reasoning capabilities. The code and data will be
released at https://core-mm.github.io/

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot object detection (FSOD), an efficient method for addressing the
severe data-hungry problem, has been extensively discussed. Current works have
significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the
overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired
accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue
of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias
from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the
parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in
various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for
FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and
decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the
intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we
build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers
as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as
PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. Our results indicate that our proposed module could
achieve stable improvements of 5% to 10% in both fine-tuning and meta-learning
paradigms and has outperformed the highest score in recent works.

<p class="mathjax">Mathematical representations of graphs often resemble adjacency matrices or
lists, representations that facilitate whiteboard reasoning and algorithm
design. In the realm of proof assistants, inductive representations effectively
define semantics for formal reasoning. This highlights a gap where algorithm
design and proof assistants require a fundamentally different structure of
graphs, particularly for process theories which represent programs using
graphs. To address this gap, we present VyZX, a verified library for reasoning
about inductively defined graphical languages. These inductive constructs arise
naturally from category theory definitions. A key goal for VyZX is to Verify
the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation.
The ZX-calculus comes with a collection of diagrammatic rewrite rules that
preserve the graph's semantic interpretation. We show how inductive graphs in
VyZX are used to prove the correctness of the ZX-calculus rewrite rules and
apply them in practice using standard proof assistant techniques. VyZX
integrates easily with the proof engineer's workflow through visualization and
automation.

<p class="mathjax">Compute-in-memory (CIM) presents an attractive approach for energy-efficient
computing in data-intensive applications. However, the development of suitable
memory designs to achieve high-performance CIM remains a challenging task.
Here, we propose a cryogenic quasi-static embedded DRAM to address the
logic-memory mismatch of CIM. Guided by the re-calibrated cryogenic device
model, the designed four-transistor bit-cell achieves full-swing data storage,
low power consumption, and extended retention time at cryogenic temperatures.
Combined with the adoption of cryogenic write bitline biasing technique and
readout circuitry optimization, our 4Kb cryogenic eDRAM chip demonstrates a
1.37$\times$10$^6$ times improvement in retention time, while achieving a 75
times improvement in retention variability, compared to room-temperature
operation. Moreover, it also achieves outstanding power performance with a
retention power of 112 fW and a dynamic power of 108 $\mu$W at 4.2 K, which can
be further decreased by 7.1% and 13.6% using the dynamic voltage scaling
technique. This work reveals the great potential of cryogenic CMOS for
high-density data storage and lays a solid foundation for energy-efficient CIM
implementations.

<p class="mathjax">Matrix-variate optimization plays a central role in advanced wireless system
designs. In this paper, we aim to explore optimal solutions of matrix variables
under two special structure constraints using complex matrix derivatives,
including diagonal structure constraints and constant modulus constraints, both
of which are closely related to the state-of-the-art wireless applications.
Specifically, for diagonal structure constraints mostly considered in the
uplink multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system and the
amplitude-adjustable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system, the capacity maximization problem, the
mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem and their variants are rigorously
investigated. By leveraging complex matrix derivatives, the optimal solutions
of these problems are directly obtained in closed forms. Nevertheless, for
constant modulus constraints with the intrinsic nature of element-wise
decomposability, which are often seen in the hybrid analog-digital MIMO system
and the fully-passive IRS-aided MIMO system, we firstly explore inherent
structures of the element-wise phase derivatives associated with different
optimization problems. Then, we propose a novel alternating optimization (AO)
algorithm with the aid of several arbitrary feasible solutions, which avoids
the complicated matrix inversion and matrix factorization involved in
conventional element-wise iterative algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal
that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the computational
complexity without loss of system performance.

<p class="mathjax">An essential facet of achieving climate neutrality by 2045 is the
decarbonization of municipal energy systems. To accomplish this, it is
necessary to establish implementation concepts that detail the timing,
location, and specific measures required to achieve decarbonization. This
restructuring process involves identifying the measures that offer the most
compelling techno-economic and ecological advantages. In particular, measures
that contribute to the interconnection of energy vectors and domains, e.g.
heating, cooling, and electricity supply, in the sense of decentralized
multi-energy systems are a promising future development option. Due to the high
complexity resulting from a multitude of decision options as well as a temporal
coupling across the transformation path, the use of optimization methods is
required, which enable a bottom-up identification of suitable transformation
solutions in a high spatial resolution. For the design of reasonable concepts,
we develop a multistage optimization problem for the derivation of
transformation pathways in the context of a multi-location structure,
expansion, and operation problem. The results show that the heat supply in the
future will mainly be provided by heat pumps with a share of 60%. It can also
be shown that an early dismantling of the gas network will lead to the need for
transitional technologies such as pellet heating. Overall, the conversion of
the municipal energy system can significantly reduce emissions (97%).

self-training segmentation phases. Considering heterogeneous distributions and
various image sizes in multi-institutional scans, we first utilize the min-max
normalization, voxel size resampling, and center cropping to obtain fixed-size
sub-volumes from ceT1 and hrT2 scans for training. Then, we perform the
multi-style image translation phase to overcome the intensity distribution
discrepancy between unpaired multi-modal scans. Specifically, we design three
different translation networks with 2D or 2.5D inputs to generate multi-style
and realistic target-like volumes from labeled ceT1 volumes. Finally, we
perform the self-training volumetric segmentation phase in the target domain,
which employs the nnU-Net framework and iterative self-training method using
pseudo-labels for training accurate segmentation models in the unlabeled target
domain. On the crossMoDA2023 validation dataset, our method produces promising
results and achieves the mean DSC values of 72.78% and 80.64% and ASSD values
of 5.85 mm and 0.25 mm for VS tumor and cochlea regions, respectively.
Moreover, for intra- and extra-meatal regions, our method achieves the DSC
values of 59.77% and 77.14%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Neufeld and Wu (<a href="/abs/2310.12545">arXiv:2310.12545</a>) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP)
algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with
gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of
the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular
stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac
representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and
second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique
viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of
their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP
schema in <a href="/abs/2310.12545">arXiv:2310.12545</a> does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In
this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in <a href="/abs/2310.12545">arXiv:2310.12545</a> indeed can
overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity
only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal
of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been an upsurge in the research on maritime vision, where
a lot of works are influenced by the application of computer vision for
Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Various sensor modalities such as camera,
radar, and lidar have been used to perform tasks such as object detection,
segmentation, object tracking, and motion planning. A large subset of this
research is focused on the video analysis, since most of the current vessel
fleets contain the camera's onboard for various surveillance tasks. Due to the
vast abundance of the video data, video scene change detection is an initial
and crucial stage for scene understanding of USVs. This paper outlines our
approach to detect dynamic scene changes in USVs. To the best of our
understanding, this work represents the first investigation of scene change
detection in the maritime vision application. Our objective is to identify
significant changes in the dynamic scenes of maritime video data, particularly
those scenes that exhibit a high degree of resemblance. In our system for
dynamic scene change detection, we propose completely unsupervised learning
method. In contrast to earlier studies, we utilize a modified cutting-edge
generative picture model called VQ-VAE-2 to train on multiple marine datasets,
aiming to enhance the feature extraction. Next, we introduce our innovative
similarity scoring technique for directly calculating the level of similarity
in a sequence of consecutive frames by utilizing grid calculation on retrieved
features. The experiments were conducted using a nautical video dataset called
RoboWhaler to showcase the efficient performance of our technique.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the performance of a randomly RIS-assisted multi-target
localization system, in which the configurations of the RIS are randomly set to
avoid high-complexity optimization. We first focus on the scenario where the
number of RIS elements is significantly large, and then obtain the scaling law
of Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) under certain conditions, which shows that CRB
decreases in the third or fourth order as the RIS dimension increases. Second,
we extend our analysis to large systems where both the number of targets and
sensors is substantial. Under this setting, we explore two common RIS models:
the constant module model and the discrete amplitude model, and illustrate how
the random RIS configuration impacts the value of CRB. Numerical results
demonstrate that asymptotic formulas provide a good approximation to the exact
CRB in the proposed randomly configured RIS systems.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, ChatGPT has attracted a lot of interest from both researchers and
the general public. While the performance of ChatGPT in named entity
recognition and relation extraction from Standard English texts is
satisfactory, it remains to be seen if it can perform similarly for Malaysian
English. Malaysian English is unique as it exhibits morphosyntactic and
semantical adaptation from local contexts. In this study, we assess ChatGPT's
capability in extracting entities and relations from the Malaysian English News
(MEN) dataset. We propose a three-step methodology referred to as
\textbf{\textit{educate-predict-evaluate}}. The performance of ChatGPT is
assessed using F1-Score across 18 unique prompt settings, which were carefully
engineered for a comprehensive review. From our evaluation, we found that
ChatGPT does not perform well in extracting entities from Malaysian English
news articles, with the highest F1-Score of 0.497. Further analysis shows that
the morphosyntactic adaptation in Malaysian English caused the limitation.
However, interestingly, this morphosyntactic adaptation does not impact the
performance of ChatGPT for relation extraction.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks based on convolutional operations have achieved remarkable
results in the field of deep learning, but there are two inherent flaws in
standard convolutional operations. On the one hand, the convolution operation
be confined to a local window and cannot capture information from other
locations, and its sampled shapes is fixed. On the other hand, the size of the
convolutional kernel is fixed to k $\times$ k, which is a fixed square shape,
and the number of parameters tends to grow squarely with size. It is obvious
that the shape and size of targets are various in different datasets and at
different locations. Convolutional kernels with fixed sample shapes and squares
do not adapt well to changing targets. In response to the above questions, the
Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) is explored in this work, which gives the
convolution kernel an arbitrary number of parameters and arbitrary sampled
shapes to provide richer options for the trade-off between network overhead and
performance. In AKConv, we define initial positions for convolutional kernels
of arbitrary size by means of a new coordinate generation algorithm. To adapt
to changes for targets, we introduce offsets to adjust the shape of the samples
at each position. Moreover, we explore the effect of the neural network by
using the AKConv with the same size and different initial sampled shapes.
AKConv completes the process of efficient feature extraction by irregular
convolutional operations and brings more exploration options for convolutional
sampling shapes. Object detection experiments on representative datasets
COCO2017, VOC 7+12 and VisDrone-DET2021 fully demonstrate the advantages of
AKConv. AKConv can be used as a plug-and-play convolutional operation to
replace convolutional operations to improve network performance. The code for
the relevant tasks can be found at https://github.com/CV-ZhangXin/AKConv.

<p class="mathjax">Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of
the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their
architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse
architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary
research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine
learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade
images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district
renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent
in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new
methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades,
utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By
classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several
realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images,
supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our
approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity
in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban
renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate
alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues
of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic
variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image
generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more
comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical
districts.

<p class="mathjax">Trees inside cities are important for the urban microclimate, contributing
positively to the physical and mental health of the urban dwellers. Despite
their importance, often only limited information about city trees is available.
Therefore in this paper, we propose a method for mapping urban trees in
high-resolution aerial imagery using limited datasets and deep learning. Deep
learning has become best-practice for this task, however, existing approaches
rely on large and accurately labelled training datasets, which can be difficult
and expensive to obtain. However, often noisy and incomplete data may be
available that can be combined and utilized to solve more difficult tasks than
those datasets were intended for. This paper studies how to combine accurate
point labels of urban trees along streets with crowd-sourced annotations from
an open geographic database to delineate city trees in remote sensing images, a
task which is challenging even for humans. To that end, we perform semantic
segmentation of very high resolution aerial imagery using a fully convolutional
neural network. The main challenge is that our segmentation maps are sparsely
annotated and incomplete. Small areas around the point labels of the street
trees coming from official and crowd-sourced data are marked as foreground
class. Crowd-sourced annotations of streets, buildings, etc. define the
background class. Since the tree data is incomplete, we introduce a masking to
avoid class confusion. Our experiments in Hamburg, Germany, showed that the
system is able to produce tree cover maps, not limited to trees along streets,
without providing tree delineations. We evaluated the method on manually
labelled trees and show that performance drastically deteriorates if the open
geographic database is not used.

<p class="mathjax">The ultimate goal of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on visual
modulation paradigms is to achieve high-speed performance without the burden of
extensive calibration. Code-modulated visual evoked potential-based BCIs
(cVEP-BCIs) modulated by broadband white noise (WN) offer various advantages,
including increased communication speed, expanded encoding target capabilities,
and enhanced coding flexibility. However, the complexity of the
spatial-temporal patterns under broadband stimuli necessitates extensive
calibration for effective target identification in cVEP-BCIs. Consequently, the
information transfer rate (ITR) of cVEP-BCI under limited calibration usually
stays around 100 bits per minute (bpm), significantly lagging behind
state-of-the-art steady-state visual evoked potential-based BCIs (SSVEP-BCIs),
which achieve rates above 200 bpm. To enhance the performance of cVEP-BCIs with
minimal calibration, we devised an efficient calibration stage involving a
brief single-target flickering, lasting less than a minute, to extract
generalizable spatial-temporal patterns. Leveraging the calibration data, we
developed two complementary methods to construct cVEP temporal patterns: the
linear modeling method based on the stimulus sequence and the transfer learning
techniques using cross-subject data. As a result, we achieved the highest ITR
of 250 bpm under a minute of calibration, which has been shown to be comparable
to the state-of-the-art SSVEP paradigms. In summary, our work significantly
improved the cVEP performance under few-shot learning, which is expected to
expand the practicality and usability of cVEP-BCIs.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning ability and the
maintenance of world knowledge not only in natural language tasks, but also in
some vision-language tasks such as open-domain knowledge-based visual question
answering (OK-VQA). As images are invisible to LLMs, researchers convert images
to text to engage LLMs into the visual question reasoning procedure. This leads
to discrepancies between images and their textual representations presented to
LLMs, which consequently impedes final reasoning performance. To fill the
information gap and better leverage the reasoning capability, we design a
framework that enables LLMs to proactively ask relevant questions to unveil
more details in the image, along with filters for refining the generated
information. We validate our idea on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. Our method
continuously boosts the performance of baselines methods by an average gain of
2.15% on OK-VQA, and achieves consistent improvements across different LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods aim to use diffusion models to
recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images and achieve promising
performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most of these
methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step. As
a result, it leads to expensive sampling time and high computation costs.
Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship
between the restoration results and the inputs since it is hard to compute the
gradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the
diffusion-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system. Specifically, we derive an analytical
solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in diffusion-based IR models as
a joint multivariate fixed point system. With the help of the analytical
solution, we are able to conduct single-image sampling in a parallel way and
restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients in
DEQ and found that initialization optimization can boost performance and
control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on typical IR tasks and
real-world settings. The code and models will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Document-level neural machine translation (DNMT) has shown promising results
by incorporating more context information. However, this approach also
introduces a length bias problem, whereby DNMT suffers from significant
translation quality degradation when decoding documents that are much shorter
or longer than the maximum sequence length during training. %i.e., the length
bias problem. To solve the length bias problem, we propose to improve the DNMT
model in training method, attention mechanism, and decoding strategy. Firstly,
we propose to sample the training data dynamically to ensure a more uniform
distribution across different sequence lengths. Then, we introduce a
length-normalized attention mechanism to aid the model in focusing on target
information, mitigating the issue of attention divergence when processing
longer sequences. Lastly, we propose a sliding window strategy during decoding
that integrates as much context information as possible without exceeding the
maximum sequence length. The experimental results indicate that our method can
bring significant improvements on several open datasets, and further analysis
shows that our method can significantly alleviate the length bias problem.

<p class="mathjax">In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have
predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and
warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive
performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations
when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative
models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not
a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting
accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations
still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI
method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to
effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a
novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the
spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method
achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and
UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Visual geolocalization is a cost-effective and scalable task that involves
matching one or more query images, taken at some unknown location, to a set of
geo-tagged reference images. Existing methods, devoted to semantic features
representation, evolving towards robustness to a wide variety between query and
reference, including illumination and viewpoint changes, as well as scale and
seasonal variations. However, practical visual geolocalization approaches need
to be robust in appearance changing and extreme viewpoint variation conditions,
while providing accurate global location estimates. Therefore, inspired by
curriculum design, human learn general knowledge first and then delve into
professional expertise. We first recognize semantic scene and then measure
geometric structure. Our approach, termed CurriculumLoc, involves a delicate
design of multi-stage refinement pipeline and a novel keypoint detection and
description with global semantic awareness and local geometric verification. We
rerank candidates and solve a particular cross-domain perspective-n-point (PnP)
problem based on these keypoints and corresponding descriptors, position
refinement occurs incrementally. The extensive experimental results on our
collected dataset, TerraTrack and a benchmark dataset, ALTO, demonstrate that
our approach results in the aforementioned desirable characteristics of a
practical visual geolocalization solution. Additionally, we achieve new high
recall@1 scores of 62.6% and 94.5% on ALTO, with two different distances
metrics, respectively. Dataset, code and trained models are publicly available

<p class="mathjax">Embedded devices are specialised devices designed for one or only a few
purposes. They are often part of a larger system, through wired or wireless
connection. Those embedded devices that are connected to other computers or
embedded systems through the Internet are called Internet of Things (IoT for
short) devices.
<br />With their widespread usage and their insufficient protection, these devices
are increasingly becoming the target of malware attacks. Companies often cut
corners to save manufacturing costs or misconfigure when producing these
devices. This can be lack of software updates, ports left open or security
defects by design. Although these devices may not be as powerful as a regular
computer, their large number makes them suitable candidates for botnets. Other
types of IoT devices can even cause health problems since there are even
pacemakers connected to the Internet. This means, that without sufficient
defence, even directed assaults are possible against people.
<br />The goal of this thesis project is to provide better security for these
devices with the help of machine learning algorithms and reverse engineering
tools. Specifically, I study the applicability of control-flow related data of
executables for malware detection. I present a malware detection method with
two phases. The first phase extracts control-flow related data using static
binary analysis. The second phase classifies binary executables as either
malicious or benign using a neural network model. I train the model using a
dataset of malicious and benign ARM applications.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most time-consuming tasks for developers is the comprehension of
new code bases. An effective approach to aid this process is to label source
code files with meaningful annotations, which can help developers understand
the content and functionality of a code base quicker. However, most existing
solutions for code annotation focus on project-level classification: manually
labelling individual files is time-consuming, error-prone and hard to scale.
<br />The work presented in this paper aims to automate the annotation of files by
leveraging project-level labels; and using the file-level annotations to
annotate items at larger levels of granularity, for example, packages and a
whole project.
<br />We propose a novel approach to annotate source code files using a weak
labelling approach and a subsequent hierarchical aggregation. We investigate
whether this approach is effective in achieving multi-granular annotations of
software projects, which can aid developers in understanding the content and
functionalities of a code base more quickly.
<br />Our evaluation uses a combination of human assessment and automated metrics
to evaluate the annotations' quality. Our approach correctly annotated 50% of
files and more than 50\% of packages. Moreover, the information captured at the
file-level allowed us to identify, on average, three new relevant labels for
any given project.
<br />We can conclude that the proposed approach is a convenient and promising way
to generate noisy (not precise) annotations for files. Furthermore,
hierarchical aggregation effectively preserves the information captured at
file-level, and it can be propagated to packages and the overall project
itself.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
results across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The
application of LLMs to specific domains, such as biomedicine, has achieved
increased attention. However, most biomedical LLMs focus on enhancing
performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation
tasks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the LLMs on diverse
biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, we present Taiyi, a bilingual
(English and Chinese) fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. In this
work, we first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical
text mining datasets across over 10 task types. Subsequently, a two-stage
strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model
performance across varied tasks. Experimental results on 13 test sets covering
named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification, question
answering tasks demonstrate Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to
general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further
shows Taiyi's considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking.

(DORA) was launched, an initiative that caused opposing viewpoints. However,
the discussion topics about DORA have not been formally identified, especially
in participatory environments outside the scholarly communication process, such

DORA-related tweets published from 2015 to 2022. The results show an increasing
volume of tweets, mainly promotional and informative, but with limited
participation of users, either commenting or engaging with the tweets,
generating a scarcely polarized conversation driven primarily by a few DORA
promoters. While a varied list of discussion topics is found (especially "Open
science and research assessment," "Academics career assessment &amp; innovation,"
and "Journal Impact Factor"), the DORA debate appears as part of broader
conversations (research evaluation, open science). Further studies are needed
to check whether these results are restricted to Twitter or reveal more general
patterns. The findings might interest the different evaluators and evaluated
agents regarding their interests and concerns around the reforms in the
research evaluation.

communication between road users and aerial drones. In various mobility
scenarios, diverse levels of integration will be explored, ranging from
leveraging communication capabilities to coordinate different radars to
achieving deep integration through a unified waveform. In this paper, we have
identified use cases and derive five higher-level Tech Cases (TCs). Technical
and functional requirements for the 6G system architecture for a
device-oriented JCAS approach will be extracted from the TCs and used to
conceptualize the architectural views.

<p class="mathjax">Soil temperature is one of the most significant parameters that plays a
crucial role in glacier energy, dynamics of mass balance, processes of surface
hydrological, coaction of glacier-atmosphere, nutrient cycling, ecological
stability, the management of soil, water, and field crop. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach using transformer models for the purpose of
forecasting soil temperature prediction. To the best of our knowledge, the
usage of transformer models in this work is the very first attempt to predict
soil temperature. Experiments are carried out using six different FLUXNET
stations by modeling them with five different transformer models, namely,
Vanilla Transformer, Informer, Autoformer, Reformer, and ETSformer. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiment results are
compared with both deep learning approaches and literature studies. Experiment
results show that the utilization of transformer models ensures a significant
contribution to the literature, thence determining the new state-of-the-art.

serialization sensitivity and biases. We introduce two strategies utilizing
LLMs for ranking categorical variables and generating priors on correlations

employs a non-linear monotonic function for mapping ordinals to cardinals while
preserving LLM-determined orders. Validation against baseline models reveals

<p class="mathjax">Counterfactual reasoning is often used in a clinical setting to explain
decisions or weigh alternatives. Therefore, for imaging based modalities such
as ophthalmology, it would be beneficial to be able to create counterfactual
images, illustrating the answer to the question: "If the subject had had
diabetic retinopathy, how would the fundus image have looked?" Here, we
demonstrate that using a diffusion model in combination with an adversarially
robust classifier trained on retinal disease classification tasks enables
generation of highly realistic counterfactuals of retinal fundus images and
optical coherence tomorgraphy (OCT) B-scans. Ideally, these classifiers encode
the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the
diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related
lesions in a realistic way. Importantly, in a user study, domain experts found
the counterfactuals generated using our method significantly more realistic
than counterfactuals generated from a previous method, and even
indistiguishable from realistic images.

<p class="mathjax">Systems in the built environment continuously emit time series data about
resource usage (e.g., energy and water), embedded electrical
generation/storage, status of equipment, patterns of building occupancy, and
readings from IoT sensors. This presents opportunities for new analytics and
supervisory control applications that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions due
to energy demand, if the barrier of data heterogeneity can be overcome.
Semantic models of buildings -- representing structure, integrated equipment,
and the many internal connections -- can help achieve interoperable data re-use
by describing overall context, in addition to metadata. In this paper, we
describe the Data Clearing House (DCH), a semantic building platform that hosts
sensor data, building models, and analytics applications. This fulfills the key
phases in the lifecycle of semantic building data, which includes:
cost-effective ingestion of Building Management System (BMS), IoT, metering and
meteorological time series data from a wide range of open and proprietary
systems; importing and validating semantic models of sites and buildings using
the Brick Schema; interacting with a discovery API via a high-level
domain-specific query language; and deploying applications to modelled
buildings. Having onboarded multiple buildings belonging to our own
organisation and external partners, we are able to comment on the challenges to
success of this approach. As an example use-case of the semantic building
platform, we describe a measurement and verification (M&amp;V) application
implementing the 'whole facility' (Option C) method of the International
Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) for evaluating
electrical metering data. This compares energy consumption between nominated
baseline and analysis time periods, to quantify the energy savings achieved
after implementing an intervention on a site.

<p class="mathjax">Digitalization enables the automation required to operate modern
cyber-physical energy systems (CPESs), leading to a shift from hierarchical to
organic systems. However, digitalization increases the number of factors
affecting the state of a CPES (e.g., software bugs and cyber threats). In
addition to established factors like functional correctness, others like
security become relevant but are yet to be integrated into an operational
viewpoint, i.e. a holistic perspective on the system state. Trust in organic
computing is an approach to gain a holistic view of the state of systems. It
consists of several facets (e.g., functional correctness, security, and
reliability), which can be used to assess the state of CPES. Therefore, a trust
assessment on all levels can contribute to a coherent state assessment. This
paper focuses on the trust in ICT-enabled grid services in a CPES. These are
essential for operating the CPES, and their performance relies on various data
aspects like availability, timeliness, and correctness. This paper proposes to
assess the trust in involved components and data to estimate data correctness,
which is crucial for grid services. The assessment is presented considering two
exemplary grid services, namely state estimation and coordinated voltage
control. Furthermore, the interpretation of different trust facets is also
discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Self-orthogonal codes are an important subclass of linear codes which have
nice applications in quantum codes and lattices. It is known that a binary
linear code is self-orthogonal if its every codeword has weight divisible by
four, and a ternary linear code is self-orthogonal if and only if its every
codeword has weight divisible by three. It remains open for a long time to
establish the relationship between the self-orthogonality of a general $q$-ary
linear code and the divisibility of its weights, where $q=p^m$ for a prime $p$.
In this paper, we mainly prove that any $p$-divisible code containing the all-1
vector over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is self-orthogonal for odd prime
$p$, which solves this open problem under certain conditions.
<br />Thanks to this result, we characterize that any projective two-weight code
containing the all-1 codeword over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is self-orthogonal.
Furthermore, by the extending and augmentation techniques, we construct six new
families of self-orthogonal divisible codes from known cyclic codes. Finally,
we construct two more families of self-orthogonal divisible codes with locality
2 which have nice application in distributed storage systems.

<p class="mathjax">Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve
the visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of
deteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion model (DM)-based
methods have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy
computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the
image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM
within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce
a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Reti-Diff comprises two
key components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided
transformer (RGformer). To ensure detailed reconstruction and illumination
correction, RLDM is empowered to acquire Retinex knowledge and extract
reflectance and illumination priors. These priors are subsequently utilized by
RGformer to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective
reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further
enhances and consolidates the decomposed features, resulting in the production
of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex
degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Reti-Diff outperforms
existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications. Code
will be available at \url{https://github.com/ChunmingHe/Reti-Diff}.

<p class="mathjax">Video face re-aging deals with altering the apparent age of a person to the
target age in videos. This problem is challenging due to the lack of paired
video datasets maintaining temporal consistency in identity and age. Most
re-aging methods process each image individually without considering the
temporal consistency of videos. While some existing works address the issue of
temporal coherence through video facial attribute manipulation in latent space,
they often fail to deliver satisfactory performance in age transformation. To
tackle the issues, we propose (1) a novel synthetic video dataset that features
subjects across a diverse range of age groups; (2) a baseline architecture
designed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, and (3) the
development of three novel metrics tailored explicitly for evaluating the
temporal consistency of video re-aging techniques. Our comprehensive
experiments on public datasets, such as VFHQ and CelebV-HQ, show that our
method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both age transformation
and temporal consistency.

<p class="mathjax">Many industrial processes require suitable controllers to meet their
performance requirements. More often, a sophisticated digital twin is
available, which is a highly complex model that is a virtual representation of
a given physical process, whose parameters may not be properly tuned to capture
the variations in the physical process. In this paper, we present a sim2real,
direct data-driven controller tuning approach, where the digital twin is used
to generate input-output data and suitable controllers for several
perturbations in its parameters. State-of-the art neural-network architectures
are then used to learn the controller tuning rule that maps input-output data
onto the controller parameters, based on artificially generated data from
perturbed versions of the digital twin. In this way, as far as we are aware, we
tackle for the first time the problem of re-calibrating the controller by
meta-learning the tuning rule directly from data, thus practically replacing
the control engineer with a machine learning model. The benefits of this
methodology are illustrated via numerical simulations for several choices of
neural-network architectures.

<p class="mathjax">The unprecedented rapid growth of computing demand for AI is projected to
increase annual datacenter (DC) growth from 7.2% to 11.3%. Some power grids
already face difficulty accommodating new datacenters, so the availability of
grid capacity will constrain datacenter capacity needed by AI growth. We
project AI datacenter demand for the next five years and consider several
``desperate measures'' -- grid policies that enable more DC growth by
sacrificing new DC reliability while maintaining grid reliability.
<br />In EirGrid where DC growth is already constrained, relaxing new DC
reliability guarantees can increase the power available for DC growth to
1.6x--4.1x, sufficient to meet 5-year AI demand. Despite lower guarantees, we
project the new datacenters will receive 99.6% power availability. In another
challenged grid, Dominion, relaxing reliability guarantees increases available
DC capacity similarly (1.5x--4.6x), and meets 70% of 5-year AI demand. Study of
other grids -- SPP, CAISO, ERCOT -- shows that excess capacity exists for
projected AI load growth.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection in aerial images is a pivotal task for various earth
observation applications, whereas current algorithms learn to detect only a
pre-defined set of object categories demanding sufficient bounding-box
annotated training samples and fail to detect novel object categories. In this
paper, we consider open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in aerial images that
enables the characterization of new objects beyond training categories on the
earth surface without annotating training images for these new categories. The
performance of OVD depends on the quality of class-agnostic region proposals
and pseudo-labels that can generalize well to novel object categories. To
simultaneously generate high-quality proposals and pseudo-labels, we propose
CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher open-vocabulary object Detection
framework. Our end-to-end framework within the student-teacher mechanism
employs the CLIP model as an extra omniscient teacher of rich knowledge into
the student-teacher self-learning process. By doing so, our approach boosts
novel object proposals and classification. Furthermore, we design a dynamic
label queue technique to maintain high-quality pseudo labels during batch
training and mitigate label imbalance. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple existing aerial object detection datasets, which are set up for the
OVD task. Experimental results demonstrate our CastDet achieving superior
open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., reaching 40.0 HM (Harmonic Mean),
which outperforms previous methods Detic/ViLD by 26.9/21.1 on the VisDroneZSD
dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The recent introduction of synthetic correlated diffusion (CDI$^s$) imaging
has demonstrated significant potential in the realm of clinical decision
support for prostate cancer (PCa). CDI$^s$ is a new form of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) designed to characterize tissue characteristics through the joint
correlation of diffusion signal attenuation across different Brownian motion
sensitivities. Despite the performance improvement, the CDI$^s$ data for PCa
has not been previously made publicly available. In our commitment to advance
research efforts for PCa, we introduce Cancer-Net PCa-Data, an open-source
benchmark dataset of volumetric CDI$^s$ imaging data of PCa patients.
Cancer-Net PCa-Data consists of CDI$^s$ volumetric images from a patient cohort
of 200 patient cases, along with full annotations (gland masks, tumor masks,
and PCa diagnosis for each tumor). We also analyze the demographic and label
region diversity of Cancer-Net PCa-Data for potential biases. Cancer-Net
PCa-Data is the first-ever public dataset of CDI$^s$ imaging data for PCa, and
is a part of the global open-source initiative dedicated to advancement in
machine learning and imaging research to aid clinicians in the global fight
against cancer.

<p class="mathjax">This letter re-visits the problem of visual-inertial navigation system (VINS)
and presents a novel filter design we dub the multi state constraint
equivariant filter (MSCEqF, in analogy to the well known MSCKF). We define a
symmetry group and corresponding group action that allow specifically the
design of an equivariant filter for the problem of visual-inertial odometry
(VIO) including IMU bias, and camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration
states. In contrast to state-of-the-art invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF)
approaches that simply tack IMU bias and other states onto the
$\mathbf{SE}_2(3)$ group, our filter builds upon a symmetry that properly
includes all the states in the group structure. Thus, we achieve improved
behavior, particularly when linearization points largely deviate from the truth
(i.e., on transients upon state disturbances). Our approach is inherently
consistent even during convergence phases from significant errors without the
need for error uncertainty adaptation, observability constraint, or other
consistency enforcing techniques. This leads to greatly improved estimator
behavior for significant error and unexpected state changes during, e.g.,
long-duration missions. We evaluate our approach with a multitude of different
experiments using three different prominent real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual
understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in
discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in
isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to
track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and
grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in
sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event
development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health
crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional
natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often
fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to
domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge.
However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study
investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess
past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with
additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering
news timeline generation practical for professional use. This work has been
deployed as a publicly accessible browser extension which is adopted within our
network.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable Artificial Intelligence is a concept aimed at making complex
algorithms transparent to users through a uniform solution. Researchers have
highlighted the importance of integrating domain specific contexts to develop
explanations tailored to end users. In this study, we focus on the Schufa
housing scoring system in Germany and investigate how users information needs
and expectations for explanations vary based on their roles. Using the
speculative design approach, we asked business information students to imagine
user interfaces that provide housing credit score explanations from the
perspectives of both tenants and landlords. Our preliminary findings suggest
that although there are general needs that apply to all users, there are also
conflicting needs that depend on the practical realities of their roles and how
credit scores affect them. We contribute to Human centered XAI research by
proposing future research directions that examine users explanatory needs
considering their roles and agencies.

<p class="mathjax">The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has
shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively
prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently
limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces
their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating
WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous
heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as
150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding
relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3)
the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies
struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To
ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality
Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning
framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the
genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate
the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel
WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<p class="mathjax">Recovering temporally consistent 3D human body pose, shape and motion from a
monocular video is a challenging task due to (self-)occlusions, poor lighting
conditions, complex articulated body poses, depth ambiguity, and limited
availability of annotated data. Further, doing a simple perframe estimation is
insufficient as it leads to jittery and implausible results. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for temporally consistent motion estimation from a
monocular video. Instead of using generic ResNet-like features, our method uses
a body-aware feature representation and an independent per-frame pose and
camera initialization over a temporal window followed by a novel
spatio-temporal feature aggregation by using a combination of self-similarity
and self-attention over the body-aware features and the perframe
initialization. Together, they yield enhanced spatiotemporal context for every
frame by considering remaining past and future frames. These features are used
to predict the pose and shape parameters of the human body model, which are
further refined using an LSTM. Experimental results on the publicly available
benchmark data show that our method attains significantly lower acceleration
error and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods over all key
quantitative evaluation metrics, including complex scenarios like partial
occlusion, complex poses and even relatively low illumination.

<p class="mathjax">The hardness vs.~randomness paradigm aims to explicitly construct
pseudorandom generators $G:\{0,1\}^r \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ that fool circuits
of size $m$, assuming the existence of explicit hard functions. A ``high-end
PRG'' with seed length $r=O(\log m)$ (implying BPP=P) was achieved in a seminal
work of Impagliazzo and Wigderson (STOC 1997), assuming the high-end hardness
assumption: there exist constants $0&lt;\beta &lt; 1&lt; B$, and functions computable in
time $2^{B \cdot n}$ that cannot be computed by circuits of size $2^{\beta
\cdot n}$.
<br />Recently, motivated by fast derandomization of randomized algorithms, Doron
et al.~(FOCS 2020) and Chen and Tell (STOC 2021), construct ``extreme high-end
PRGs'' with seed length $r=(1+o(1))\cdot \log m$, under qualitatively stronger
assumptions.
<br />We study whether extreme high-end PRGs can be constructed from the following
scaled version of the assumption which we call ``the extreme high-end hardness
assumption'', and in which $\beta=1-o(1)$ and $B=1+o(1)$. We give a partial
negative answer, showing that certain approaches cannot yield a black-box
proof. (A longer abstract with more details appears in the PDF file)

<p class="mathjax">Towards holistic understanding of 3D scenes, a general 3D segmentation method
is needed that can segment diverse objects without restrictions on object
quantity or categories, while also reflecting the inherent hierarchical
structure. To achieve this, we propose OmniSeg3D, an omniversal segmentation
method aims for segmenting anything in 3D all at once. The key insight is to
lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature
field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, which is
accomplished by two steps. Firstly, we design a novel hierarchical
representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the
multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly, image features rendered from
the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels, which can be further
drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between
different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D
segmentations, this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field,
which further enables hierarchical segmentation, multi-object selection, and
global discretization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method on high-quality 3D segmentation and accurate hierarchical structure
understanding. A graphical user interface further facilitates flexible
interaction for omniversal 3D segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Retinal disease is one of the primary causes of visual impairment, and early
diagnosis is essential for preventing further deterioration. Nowadays, many
works have explored Transformers for diagnosing diseases due to their strong
visual representation capabilities. However, retinal diseases exhibit milder
forms and often present with overlapping signs, which pose great difficulties
for accurate multi-class classification. Therefore, we propose a new framework
named Multi-Scale Patch Message Passing Swin Transformer for multi-class
retinal disease classification. Specifically, we design a Patch Message Passing
(PMP) module based on the Message Passing mechanism to establish global
interaction for pathological semantic features and to exploit the subtle
differences further between different diseases. Moreover, considering the
various scale of pathological features we integrate multiple PMP modules for
different patch sizes. For evaluation, we have constructed a new dataset, named
OPTOS dataset, consisting of 1,033 high-resolution fundus images photographed
by Optos camera and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the
efficacy of our proposed method. And the results on both the public dataset and
our dataset demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The notion of Las Vegas algorithm was introduced by Babai (1979) and may be
defined in two ways:
<br />* In Babai's original definition, a randomized algorithm is called Las Vegas
if it has finitely bounded running time and certifiable random failure.
<br />* Alternatively, in a widely accepted definition today, Las Vegas algorithms
mean the zero-error randomized algorithms with random running time.
<br />The equivalence between the two definitions is straightforward. In
particular, by repeatedly running the algorithm until no failure encountered,
one can simulate the correct output of a successful running.
<br />We show that this can also be achieved for distributed local computation.
Specifically, we show that in the LOCAL model, any Las Vegas algorithm that
terminates in finite time with locally certifiable failures, can be converted
to a zero-error Las Vegas algorithm, at a polylogarithmic cost in the time
complexity, such that the resulting algorithm perfectly simulates the output of
the original algorithm on the same instance conditioned on that the algorithm
successfully returns without failure.

<p class="mathjax">Video prediction aims to predict future frames from a video's previous
content. Existing methods mainly process video data where the time dimension
mingles with the space and channel dimensions from three distinct angles: as a
sequence of individual frames, as a 3D volume in spatiotemporal coordinates, or
as a stacked image where frames are treated as separate channels. Most of them
generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the
relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper
introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to
model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The
ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three
levels: frames, channels, and locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art prediction performance on
three benchmark video datasets covering both synthetic and real-world
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Annotation scarcity has become a major obstacle for training powerful
deep-learning models for medical image segmentation, restricting their
deployment in clinical scenarios. To address it, semi-supervised learning by
exploiting abundant unlabeled data is highly desirable to boost the model
training. However, most existing works still focus on limited medical tasks and
underestimate the potential of learning across diverse tasks and multiple
datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a \textbf{Ver}satile
\textbf{Semi}-supervised framework (VerSemi) to point out a new perspective
that integrates various tasks into a unified model with a broad label space, to
exploit more unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a dynamic task-prompted design to segment various
targets from different datasets. Next, this unified model is used to identify
the foreground regions from all labeled data, to capture cross-dataset
semantics. Particularly, we create a synthetic task with a cutmix strategy to
augment foreground targets within the expanded label space. To effectively
utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consistency constraint. This involves
aligning aggregated predictions from various tasks with those from the
synthetic task, further guiding the model in accurately segmenting foreground
regions during training. We evaluated our VerSemi model on four public
benchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that VerSemi can
consistently outperform the second-best method by a large margin (e.g., an
average 2.69\% Dice gain on four datasets), setting new SOTA performance for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The code will be released.

<p class="mathjax">Causal discovery from observational data is pivotal for deciphering complex
relationships. Causal Structure Learning (CSL), which focuses on deriving
causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from data, faces challenges due to vast
DAG spaces and data sparsity. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
recognized for their causal reasoning capabilities, offers a promising
direction to enhance CSL by infusing it with knowledge-based causal inferences.
However, existing approaches utilizing LLMs for CSL have encountered issues,
including unreliable constraints from imperfect LLM inferences and the
computational intensity of full pairwise variable analyses. In response, we
introduce the Iterative LLM Supervised CSL (ILS-CSL) framework. ILS-CSL
innovatively integrates LLM-based causal inference with CSL in an iterative
process, refining the causal DAG using feedback from LLMs. This method not only
utilizes LLM resources more efficiently but also generates more robust and
high-quality structural constraints compared to previous methodologies. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight real-world datasets demonstrates
ILS-CSL's superior performance, setting a new standard in CSL efficacy and
showcasing its potential to significantly advance the field of causal
discovery. The codes are available at

<p class="mathjax">A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that
enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs
easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the
working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus,
it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we
demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to
suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to
encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to
leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the
best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based
on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The
quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by
generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average
cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines
after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct.
Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows outstanding capability in code
formatting, while unnecessary behaviors such as deleting or translating
comments are also observed.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieval augmentation has become an effective solution to empower large
language models (LLMs) with external and verified knowledge sources from the
database, which overcomes the limitations and hallucinations of LLMs in
handling up-to-date and domain-specific information. However, existing
embedding models for text retrieval usually have three non-negligible
limitations. First, the number and diversity of samples in a batch are too
restricted to supervise the modeling of textual nuances at scale. Second, the
high proportional noise are detrimental to the semantic correctness and
consistency of embeddings. Third, the equal treatment to easy and difficult
samples would cause sub-optimum convergence of embeddings with poorer
generalization. In this paper, we propose the PEG, a progressively learned
embeddings for robust text retrieval. Specifically, we increase the training
in-batch negative samples to 80,000, and for each query, we extracted five hard
negatives. Concurrently, we incorporated a progressive learning mechanism,
enabling the model to dynamically modulate its attention to the samples
throughout the entire training process. Additionally, PEG is trained on more
than 100 million data, encompassing a wide range of domains (e.g., finance,
medicine, and tourism) and covering various tasks (e.g., question-answering,
machine reading comprehension, and similarity matching). Extensive experiments
conducted on C-MTEB and DuReader demonstrate that PEG surpasses
state-of-the-art embeddings in retrieving true positives, highlighting its
significant potential for applications in LLMs. Our model is publicly available
at https://huggingface.co/TownsWu/PEG.

<p class="mathjax">Amazon ships billions of packages to its customers annually within the United
States. Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0)
to estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0
profitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies
and delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost
estimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or
fixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping
cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high,
or promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for
estimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require
extensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel
architecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to
encode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier
information and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT
has the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a
shipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For
example, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results
demonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82% less error
compared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the
state-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08%. We
also illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card
that can improve the performance of tree-based models.

<p class="mathjax">The generalization capability of existing image restoration and enhancement
(IRE) methods is constrained by the limited pre-trained datasets, making it
difficult to handle agnostic inputs such as different degradation levels and
scenarios beyond their design scopes. Moreover, they are not equipped with
interactive mechanisms to consider user preferences or feedback, and their
end-to-end settings cannot provide users with more choices. Faced with the
above-mentioned IRE method's limited performance and insufficient
interactivity, we try to solve it from the engineering and system framework
levels. Specifically, we propose Clarity ChatGPT-a transformative system that
combines the conversational intelligence of ChatGPT with multiple IRE methods.
Clarity ChatGPT can automatically detect image degradation types and select
appropriate IRE methods to restore images, or iteratively generate satisfactory
results based on user feedback. Its innovative features include a CLIP-powered
detector for accurate degradation classification, no-reference image quality
evaluation for performance evaluation, region-specific processing for precise
enhancements, and advanced fusion techniques for optimal restoration results.
Clarity ChatGPT marks a significant advancement in integrating language and
vision, enhancing image-text interactions, and providing a robust,
high-performance IRE solution. Our case studies demonstrate that Clarity
ChatGPT effectively improves the generalization and interaction capabilities in
the IRE, and also fills the gap in the low-level domain of the existing

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner
is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the
adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has
demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and
unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice.
Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of
LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that
enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation
process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized
with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the
cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference
stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks,
to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our
approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a
higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of
parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying
scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero
parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental
results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70%
retained parameters and 70% training time.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel framework termed Cut-and-Paste for real-word
semantic video editing under the guidance of text prompt and additional
reference image. While the text-driven video editing has demonstrated
remarkable ability to generate highly diverse videos following given text
prompts, the fine-grained semantic edits are hard to control by plain textual
prompt only in terms of object details and edited region, and cumbersome long
text descriptions are usually needed for the task. We therefore investigate
subject-driven video editing for more precise control of both edited regions
and background preservation, and fine-grained semantic generation. We achieve
this goal by introducing an reference image as supplementary input to the
text-driven video editing, which avoids racking your brain to come up with a
cumbersome text prompt describing the detailed appearance of the object. To
limit the editing area, we refer to a method of cross attention control in
image editing and successfully extend it to video editing by fusing the
attention map of adjacent frames, which strikes a balance between maintaining
video background and spatio-temporal consistency. Compared with current
methods, the whole process of our method is like ``cut" the source object to be
edited and then ``paste" the target object provided by reference image. We
demonstrate that our method performs favorably over prior arts for video
editing under the guidance of text prompt and extra reference image, as
measured by both quantitative and subjective evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{GS-SLAM}$ that first utilizes 3D
Gaussian representation in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
system. It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.
Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our
method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that
offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D re-rendering.
Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or
deletes noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed
scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This
strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the
whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods.
Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique
is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera
pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves
competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time
methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. The source code will be released
upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">The bus admittance matrix is central to many power system simulation
algorithms, but the link between problem size and computation time (i.e., the
time complexity) using modern sparse solvers is not fully understood. It has
recently been suggested that some popular algorithms used in distribution
system power flow analysis have cubic complexity, based on properties of dense
matrix numerical algorithms; a tighter theoretical estimate of complexity using
sparse solvers is not immediately forthcoming due to these solvers'
problem-dependent behaviour. To address this, the time complexity of admittance
matrix-based distribution power flow is considered empirically across a library
of 75 networks, ranging in size from 50 to 300,000 nodes. Results across four
admittance matrix-based methods suggest complexity coefficient values between
1.04 and 1.12, indicating complexity that is instead almost linear. The
proposed empirical approach is suggested as a convenient and practical way of
benchmarking the scalability of power flow algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">The continuous rise in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Internet
of Things (IoT) by businesses has brought unprecedented opportunities for
innovation and growth. However, due to the distinct characteristics of these
emerging IoT technologies like real-time data processing, Self-configuration,
interoperability, and scalability, they have also introduced some unique
cybersecurity challenges, such as malware attacks, advanced persistent threats
(APTs), DoS /DDoS (Denial of Service &amp; Distributed Denial of Service attacks)
and insider threats. As a result of these challenges, there is an increased
need for improved cybersecurity approaches and efficient management solutions
to ensure the privacy and security of communication within IoT networks. One
proposed security approach is the utilization of trust-based systems and is the
focus of this study. This research paper presents a systematic literature
review on the Trust-based cybersecurity security approaches for IoT. A total of
23 articles were identified that satisfy the review criteria. We highlighted
the common trust-based mitigation techniques in existence for dealing with
these threats and grouped them into three major categories, namely:
Observation-Based, Knowledge-Based &amp; Cluster-Based systems. Finally, several
open issues were highlighted, and future research directions presented.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of configuring a power distribution network with
reliability and resilience objectives by satisfying the demands of the
consumers and saturating each production source as little as possible. We
consider power distribution networks containing source nodes producing
electricity, nodes representing electricity consumers and switches between
them. Configuring this network consists in deciding the orientation of the
links between the nodes of the network. The electric flow is a direct
consequence of the chosen configuration and can be computed in polynomial time.
It is valid if it satisfies the demand of each consumer and capacity
constraints on the network. In such a case, we study the problem of determining
a feasible solution that balances the loads of the sources, that is their
production rates. We use three metrics to measure the quality of a solution:
minimizing the maximum load, maximizing the minimum load and minimizing the
difference of the maximum and the minimum loads. This defines optimization
problems called respectively min-M, max-m and min-R. In the case where the
graph of the network is a tree, it is known that the problem of building a
valid configuration is polynomial. We show the three optimization variants have
distinct properties regarding the theoretical complexity and the
approximability. Particularly, we show that min-M is polynomial, that max-m is
NP-Hard but belongs to the class FPTAS and that min-R is NP-Hard, cannot 1 be
approximated to within any exponential relative ratio but, for any $\epsilon$ &gt;
0, there exists an algorithm for which the value of the returned solution
equals the value of an optimal solution shifted by at most $\epsilon$.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection models, a prominent class of machine learning algorithms,
aim to identify and precisely locate objects in images or videos. However, this
task might yield uneven performances sometimes caused by the objects sizes and
the quality of the images and labels used for training. In this paper, we
highlight the importance of large objects in learning features that are
critical for all sizes. Given these findings, we propose to introduce a
weighting term into the training loss. This term is a function of the object
area size. We show that giving more weight to large objects leads to improved
detection scores across all object sizes and so an overall improvement in
Object Detectors performances (+2 p.p. of mAP on small objects, +2 p.p. on
medium and +4 p.p. on large on COCO val 2017 with InternImage-T). Additional
experiments and ablation studies with different models and on a different
dataset further confirm the robustness of our findings.

<p class="mathjax">As an emerging mode of urban transportation, Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand
(AMoD) systems show the potential in improving mobility in cities through
timely and door-to-door services. However, the spatiotemporal imbalances
between mobility demand and supply may lead to inefficiencies and a low quality
of service. Vehicle rebalancing (i.e., dispatching idle vehicles to high-demand
areas), is a potential solution for efficient AMoD fleet management. In this
paper, we formulate the vehicle rebalancing problem as a coverage control
problem for the deployment of a fleet of mobile agents for AMoD operation in
urban areas. Performance is demonstrated via microscopic simulations
representing a large urban road network of Shenzhen, China. Results reveal the
potential of the proposed method in improving service rates and decreasing
passenger waiting times.

<p class="mathjax">Differential Privacy (DP) is a key property to protect data and models from
integrity attacks. In the Deep Learning (DL) field, it is commonly implemented
through the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD).
However, when a model is shared or released, there is no way to check whether
it is differentially private, that is, it required to trust the model provider.
This situation poses a problem when data privacy is mandatory, specially with
current data regulations, as the presence of DP can not be certificated
consistently by any third party. Thus, we face the challenge of determining
whether a DL model has been trained with DP, according to the title question:
Can we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models'
weights? Since the DP-SGD significantly changes the training process of a DL
model, we hypothesize that DP leaves an imprint in the weights of a DL model,
which can be used to predict whether a model has been trained with DP
regardless of its architecture and the training dataset. In this paper, we
propose to employ the imprint in model weights of using DP to infer the
presence of DP training in a DL model. To substantiate our hypothesis, we
developed an experimental methodology based on two datasets of weights of DL
models, each with models with and without DP training and a meta-classifier to
infer whether DP was used in the training process of a DL model, by accessing
its weights. We accomplish both, the removal of the requirement of a trusted
model provider and a strong foundation for this interesting line of research.
Thus, our contribution is an additional layer of security on top of the strict
private requirements of DP training in DL models, towards to DL models.

<p class="mathjax">In the literature, a distributed consensus protocol by which a connected
swarm of agents can generate artistic patterns in 2-dimensional space is
proposed. Motivated by this protocol, in this paper, we design the parameters
of this protocol for a 3-agent swarm of non-holonomic robots of finite size
that results in the generation of periodic trochoidal trajectories that satisfy
a set of geometric and speed constraints; this design also includes selecting
the initial positions of the robots. This problem finds applications in
persistent surveillance and coverage, guarding a region of interest, and target
detection. While the trajectories may be self-intersecting, imposing geometric
constraints i. eliminates collisions between robots; ii. ensures minimum and
maximum separation distance between any robot and a fixed point, thus ensuring
the robots are in communication range. Imposing speed constraints ensure that
tracking these trajectories becomes feasible. It is also shown that robots can
be injected to these paths at specific locations, in order to increase the
refresh rate, without violating any of the geometric constraints. The designs
are implemented in an indoor mobile robot platform.

<p class="mathjax">In autonomous driving perception systems, 3D detection and tracking are the
two fundamental tasks. This paper delves deeper into this field, building upon
the Sparse4D framework. We introduce two auxiliary training tasks (Temporal
Instance Denoising and Quality Estimation) and propose decoupled attention to
make structural improvements, leading to significant enhancements in detection
performance. Additionally, we extend the detector into a tracker using a
straightforward approach that assigns instance ID during inference, further
highlighting the advantages of query-based algorithms. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark validate the effectiveness of the proposed
improvements. With ResNet50 as the backbone, we witnessed enhancements of
3.0\%, 2.2\%, and 7.6\% in mAP, NDS, and AMOTA, achieving 46.9\%, 56.1\%, and
49.0\%, respectively. Our best model achieved 71.9\% NDS and 67.7\% AMOTA on
the nuScenes test set. Code will be released at

<p class="mathjax">Binary classification involves predicting the label of an instance based on
whether the model score for the positive class exceeds a threshold chosen based
on the application requirements (e.g., maximizing recall for a precision
bound). However, model scores are often not aligned with the true positivity
rate. This is especially true when the training involves a differential
sampling across classes or there is distributional drift between train and test
settings. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence
of the dependence of model score estimation bias on both uncertainty and score
itself. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection in terms of both
model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms
based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression. Evaluation of the
proposed algorithms on three real-world datasets yield 25%-40% gain in recall
at high precision bounds over the traditional approach of using model score
alone, highlighting the benefits of leveraging uncertainty.

<p class="mathjax">The use of free and open source software (FOSS) components in all software
systems is estimated to be above 90%. With such high usage and because of the
heterogeneity of FOSS tools, repositories, developers and ecosystem, the level
of complexity of managing software development has also increased. This has
amplified both the attack surface for malicious actors and the difficulty of
making sure that the software products are free from threats. The rise of
security incidents involving high profile attacks is evidence that there is
still much to be done to safeguard software products and the FOSS supply chain.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools and the study of attack trees help
with improving security. However, they still lack the ability to
comprehensively address how interactions within the software supply chain may
impact security. This work presents a novel approach of assessing threat levels
in FOSS supply chains with the log model. This model provides information
capture and threat propagation analysis that not only account for security
risks that may be caused by attacks and the usage of vulnerable software, but
also how they interact with the other elements to affect the threat level for
any element in the model.

<p class="mathjax">We present a secure and private blockchain-based Verifiable Random Function
(VRF) scheme addressing some limitations of classical VRF constructions. Given
the imminent quantum computing adversarial scenario, conventional cryptographic
methods face vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's secure randomness, we adopt
post-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for synthesizing pseudo-random sequences.
Considering computational costs and resultant on-chain gas costs, we suggest a
bifurcated architecture for VRF design, optimizing interactions between
on-chain and off-chain. Our approach employs a secure ring signature supported
by NIZK proof and a delegated key generation method, inspired by the
Chaum-Pedersen equality proof and the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Our VRF scheme
integrates multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized
identifiers (DID), ensuring both security and randomness. We elucidate the
security and privacy aspects of our VRF scheme, analyzing temporal and spatial
complexities. We also approximate the entropy of the VRF scheme and detail its
implementation in a Solidity contract. Also, we delineate a method for
validating the VRF's proof, matching for the contexts requiring both randomness
and verification. Conclusively, using the NIST SP800-22 of the statistical
randomness test suite, our results exhibit a 98.86% pass rate over 11 test
cases, with an average p-value of 0.5459 from 176 total tests.

<p class="mathjax">The Euler characteristic (EC) is a powerful topological descriptor that can
be used to quantify the shape of data objects that are represented as
fields/manifolds. Fast methods for computing the EC are required to enable
processing of high-throughput data and real-time implementations. This
represents a challenge when processing high-resolution 2D field data (e.g.,
images) and 3D field data (e.g., video, hyperspectral images, and space-time
data obtained from fluid dynamics and molecular simulations). In this work, we
present parallel algorithms (and software implementations) to enable fast
computations of the EC for 2D and 3D fields using vertex contributions. We test
the proposed algorithms using synthetic data objects and data objects arising
in real applications such as microscopy, 3D molecular dynamics simulations, and
hyperspectral images. Results show that the proposed implementation can compute
the EC a couple of orders of magnitude faster than ${\tt GUDHI}$ (an
off-the-shelf and state-of-the art tool) and at speeds comparable to ${\tt
CHUNKYEuler}$ (a tool tailored to scalable computation of the EC). The vertex
contributions approach is flexible in that it compute the EC as well as other
topological descriptors such as perimeter, area, and volume (${\tt
CHUNKYEuler}$ can only compute the EC). Scalability with respect to memory use
is also addressed by providing low-memory versions of the algorithms; this
enables processing of data objects beyond the size of dynamic memory. All data
and software needed for reproducing the results are shared as open-source code.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling numerous speakers, which
enables expressing the overall characteristics of speakers in detail like a
trained multi-speaker model without additional training on the target speaker's
dataset. Although various works with similar purposes have been actively
studied, their performance has not yet reached that of trained multi-speaker
models due to their fundamental limitations. To overcome previous limitations,
we propose effective methods for feature learning and representing target
speakers' speech characteristics by discretizing the features and conditioning
them to a speech synthesis model. Our method obtained a significantly higher
similarity mean opinion score (SMOS) in subjective similarity evaluation than
seen speakers of a best-performing multi-speaker model, even with unseen
speakers. The proposed method also outperforms a zero-shot method by
significant margins. Furthermore, our method shows remarkable performance in
generating new artificial speakers. In addition, we demonstrate that the
encoded latent features are sufficiently informative to reconstruct an original
speaker's speech completely. It implies that our method can be used as a
general methodology to encode and reconstruct speakers' characteristics in
various tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Evaluating the risk level of adversarial images is essential for safely
deploying face authentication models in the real world. Popular approaches for
physical-world attacks, such as print or replay attacks, suffer from some
limitations, like including physical and geometrical artifacts. Recently,
adversarial attacks have gained attraction, which try to digitally deceive the
learning strategy of a recognition system using slight modifications to the
captured image. While most previous research assumes that the adversarial image
could be digitally fed into the authentication systems, this is not always the
case for systems deployed in the real world. This paper demonstrates the
vulnerability of face authentication systems to adversarial images in physical
world scenarios. We propose AdvGen, an automated Generative Adversarial
Network, to simulate print and replay attacks and generate adversarial images
that can fool state-of-the-art PADs in a physical domain attack setting. Using
this attack strategy, the attack success rate goes up to 82.01%. We test AdvGen
extensively on four datasets and ten state-of-the-art PADs. We also demonstrate
the effectiveness of our attack by conducting experiments in a realistic,
physical environment.

<p class="mathjax">Automotive related datasets have previously been used for training autonomous
driving systems or vehicle classification tasks. However, there is a lack of
datasets in the field of automotive AI for car parts detection, and most
available datasets are limited in size and scope, struggling to cover diverse
scenarios. To address this gap, this paper presents a large-scale and
fine-grained automotive dataset consisting of 84,162 images for detecting 12
different types of car parts. This dataset was collected from natural cameras
and online websites which covers various car brands, scenarios, and shooting
angles. To alleviate the burden of manual annotation, we propose a novel
semi-supervised auto-labeling method that leverages state-of-the-art
pre-trained detectors. Moreover, we study the limitations of the Grounding DINO
approach for zero-shot labeling. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
proposed dataset through fine-grained car parts detection by training several
lightweight YOLO-series detectors.

<p class="mathjax">Background and objectives: Dynamic handwriting analysis, due to its
non-invasive and readily accessible nature, has recently emerged as a vital
adjunctive method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In this
study, we design a compact and efficient network architecture to analyse the
distinctive handwriting patterns of patients' dynamic handwriting signals,
thereby providing an objective identification for the Parkinson's disease
diagnosis.
<br />Methods: The proposed network is based on a hybrid deep learning approach
that fully leverages the advantages of both long short-term memory (LSTM) and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the LSTM block is adopted
to extract the time-varying features, while the CNN-based block is implemented
using one-dimensional convolution for low computational cost. Moreover, the
hybrid model architecture is continuously refined under ablation studies for
superior performance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method with its
generalization under a five-fold cross-validation, which validates its
efficiency and robustness.
<br />Results: The proposed network demonstrates its versatility by achieving
impressive classification accuracies on both our new DraWritePD dataset
($96.2\%$) and the well-established PaHaW dataset ($90.7\%$). Moreover, the
network architecture also stands out for its excellent lightweight design,
occupying a mere $0.084$M of parameters, with a total of only $0.59$M
floating-point operations. It also exhibits near real-time CPU inference
performance, with inference times ranging from $0.106$ to $0.220$s.
<br />Conclusions: We present a series of experiments with extensive analysis,
which systematically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed hybrid neural network in extracting distinctive handwriting patterns
for precise diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

<p class="mathjax">Non-Contact sensing is an emerging technology with applications across many
industries from driver monitoring in vehicles to patient monitoring in
healthcare. Current state-of-the-art implementations focus on RGB video, but
this struggles in varying/noisy light conditions and is almost completely
unfeasible in the dark. Near Infra-Red (NIR) video, however, does not suffer
from these constraints. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of an
alternative Convolution Attention Network (CAN) architecture, to regress
photoplethysmography (PPG) signal from a sequence of NIR frames. A combination
of two publicly available datasets, which is split into train and test sets, is
used for training the CAN. This combined dataset is augmented to reduce
overfitting to the 'normal' 60 - 80 bpm heart rate range by providing the full
range of heart rates along with corresponding videos for each subject. This
CAN, when implemented over video cropped to the subject's head, achieved a Mean
Average Error (MAE) of just 0.99 bpm, proving its effectiveness on NIR video
and the architecture's feasibility to regress an accurate signal output.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies attempted to utilize multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to solve
semi-supervised node classification on graphs, by training a student MLP by
knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher graph neural network (GNN). While
previous studies have focused mostly on training the student MLP by matching
the output probability distributions between the teacher and student models
during KD, it has not been systematically studied how to inject the structural
information in an explicit and interpretable manner. Inspired by GNNs that
separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\Pi$, we re-frame the KD
process as enabling the student MLP to explicitly learn both $T$ and $\Pi$.
Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation $\Pi^{-1}$
before distillation from the teacher GNN, it still comes with a high
computational cost from large matrix multiplications during training. To solve
this problem, we propose Propagate &amp; Distill (P&amp;D), which propagates the output
of the teacher GNN before KD and can be interpreted as an approximate process
of the inverse propagation $\Pi^{-1}$. Through comprehensive evaluations using
real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of P&amp;D by
showing further performance boost of the student MLP.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in
disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation
has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and
persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature
extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology
datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of
publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain
normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream
performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute.
Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably
robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent
space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach
emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a
weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work
represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL
feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine
tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing
setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by
minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature
extractors.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used for illumination
estimation, which is time-consuming and requires sensor-specific data
collection. Our proposed method uses a dual-mapping strategy and only requires
a simple white point from a test sensor under a D65 condition. This allows us
to derive a mapping matrix, enabling the reconstructions of image data and
illuminants. In the second mapping phase, we transform the re-constructed image
data into sparse features, which are then optimized with a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using the re-constructed illuminants as
ground truths. This approach effectively reduces sensor discrepancies and
delivers performance on par with leading cross-sensor methods. It only requires
a small amount of memory (~0.003 MB), and takes ~1 hour training on an
RTX3070Ti GPU. More importantly, the method can be implemented very fast, with
~0.3 ms and ~1 ms on a GPU or CPU respectively, and is not sensitive to the
input image resolution. Therefore, it offers a practical solution to the great
challenges of data recollection that is faced by the industry.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models
offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest
height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong
correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height)
measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we
proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention
remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by
extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2
PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises
separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale
features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using
individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across
modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious
information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band
redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial
and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved
commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and
RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which
attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained
MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin,
China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet
demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for
the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a
multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical
imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height
estimation.

information about the network topology or the executed algorithm from some
signals obtained during the algorithm's execution. The problem is defined in a
very general form. However, it is mainly motivated by multi-hop ad hoc radio
networks. In contrast to previous work concentrated on single-hop radio
networks, this model is critically more complex due to the number of possible
settings that need to be taken into account when considering different
combinations of topologies and communication models. Moreover, the definition
of the adversary is also ambiguous, and the adequate approach needs to depend
on the adversary's aims and capabilities. This preliminary report presents a
general theoretical background and some basic algorithms. We also propose some
general taxonomy as a framework for future research.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we consider a `cooperative' multi-agent Markov decision process
(MDP) involving m greater than 1 agents, where all agents are aware of the
system model. At each decision epoch, all the m agents cooperatively select
actions in order to maximize a common long-term objective. Since the number of
actions grows exponentially in the number of agents, policy improvement is
computationally expensive. Recent works have proposed using decentralized
policy improvement in which each agent assumes that the decisions of the other
agents are fixed and it improves its decisions unilaterally. Yet, in these
works, exact values are computed. In our work, for cooperative multi-agent
finite and infinite horizon discounted MDPs, we propose suitable approximate
policy iteration algorithms, wherein we use approximate linear programming to
compute the approximate value function and use decentralized policy
improvement. Thus our algorithms can handle both large number of states as well
as multiple agents. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithms and
also demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on some numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the Image Captioning (IC) technique has been widely applied to
describe a given image in text form. However, IC systems can still produce
incorrect captions and lead to misunderstandings. To tackle this problem,
several methods have been proposed to test the IC systems. However, these
approaches still rely on pre-annotated information and hence cannot really
alleviate the oracle problem in the testing. Besides, they adopt AIGC
techniques to create follow-up test images that may generate unrealistic images
as test cases, which leads to meaningless testing results. Thirdly, existing
methods have various restrictions on the eligibility of source test cases, and
hence cannot fully utilize the given images to perform testing.
<br />To tackle these issues, we propose REIC, which conducts metamorphic testing
for IC systems with reduction-based transformations. Instead of relying on the
pre-annotated information, we introduce a localization method to align the
described objects in the caption with the corresponding objects in the test
image and check whether each object in the caption retains or disappears after
transformation. REIC does not artificially manipulate any objects and hence can
effectively avoid generating unreal follow-up images. Besides, it eliminates
the restrictions in the metamorphic transformation process, as well as
decreases the ambiguity, and boosts the diversity among the follow-up test
cases, which consequently enables testing to be performed on any test image,
and reveals more distinct valid violations. Experimental results demonstrate
that REIC can sufficiently leverage provided test images to generate follow-up
cases of good reality, and effectively detect a great number of distinct
violations, without the need for any pre-annotated information.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proves that Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm is universally
optimal in both its running time and number of comparisons when combined with a
sufficiently efficient heap data structure.
<br />Universal optimality is a powerful beyond-worst-case performance guarantee
for graph algorithms that informally states that a single algorithm performs as
well as possible for every single graph topology. We give the first application
of this notion to any sequential algorithm.
<br />We design a new heap data structure with a working-set property guaranteeing
that the heap takes advantage of locality in heap operations. Our heap matches
the optimal (worst-case) bounds of Fibonacci heaps but also provides the
beyond-worst-case guarantee that the cost of extracting the minimum element is
merely logarithmic in the number of elements inserted after it instead of
logarithmic in the number of all elements in the heap. This makes the
extraction of recently added elements cheaper.
<br />We prove that our working-set property is sufficient to guarantee universal
optimality, specifically, for the problem of ordering vertices by their
distance from the source vertex: The locality in the sequence of heap
operations generated by any run of Dijkstra's algorithm on a fixed topology is
strong enough that one can couple the number of comparisons performed by any
heap with our working-set property to the minimum number of comparisons
required to solve the distance ordering problem on this topology.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial
recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into
our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are
vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data
poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks.
In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or
system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as
transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward
developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements
in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively
explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability,
particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into
different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to
highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This
paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various
viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the
implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous
driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we
outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the
landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding
of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different
domains.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language
intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical
performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally,
theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities,
providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in
linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex
reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving
an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in
amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability,
controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research
endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development

<p class="mathjax">Partial differential equations are often used in the spatial-temporal
modeling of complex dynamical systems in many engineering applications. In this
work, we build on the recent progress of operator learning and present a
data-driven modeling framework that is continuous in both space and time. A key
feature of the proposed model is the resolution-invariance with respect to both
spatial and temporal discretizations. To improve the long-term performance of
the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that
leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and
efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We
investigate the performance of the spatial-temporal continuous learning
framework with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers'
equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.
The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling
framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only
short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can
better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a
combined use of short-term and long-term data.

<p class="mathjax">The application of routing algorithms to real-world situations is a widely
studied research topic. Despite this, routing algorithms and applications are
usually developed for a general purpose, meaning that certain groups, such as
ageing people, are often marginalized due to the broad approach of the designed
algorithms. This situation may pose a problem in cities which are suffering a
slow but progressive ageing of their populations. With this motivation in mind,
this paper focuses on describing our implemented Age-Friendly Route Planner,
whose goal is to improve the experience in the city for senior citizens. In
order to measure the age-friendliness of a route, several variables have been
deemed, such as the number of amenities along the route, the amount of
comfortable elements found, or the avoidance of sloppy sections. In this paper,
we describe one of the main features of the Age-Friendly Route Planner: the
preference-based routes, and we also demonstrate how it can contribute to the
creation of adapted friendly routes.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we propose a new flexible method for hand-eye calibration. The
vast majority of existing hand-eye calibration techniques requires a
calibration rig which is used in conjunction with camera pose estimation
methods. Instead, we combine structure-from-motion with known robot motions and
we show that the solution can be obtained in linear form. The latter solves for
both the hand-eye parameters and for the unknown scale factor inherent with
structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible
with such a linear formulation allows to investigate not only the well known
case of general screw motions but also such singular motions as pure
translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted
camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence
and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self calibration process
is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so
forth. We conduct a large number of experiments which validate the quality of
the method by comparing it with existing ones.

LogLead combines three essential steps in log processing: loading, enhancing,
and anomaly detection. The tool leverages Polars, a high-speed DataFrame
library. We currently have 7 Loaders out of which 4 is for public data sets
(HDFS, Hadoop, BGL, and Thunderbird). We have multiple enhancers with three
parsers (Drain, Spell, LenMa), Bert embedding creation and other log
representation techniques like bag-of-words. LogLead integrates to 5 supervised
and 4 unsupervised machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection from
SKLearn. By integrating diverse datasets, log representation methods and
anomaly detectors, LogLead facilitates comprehensive benchmarking in log
analysis research. We demonstrate that log loading from raw file to dataframe
is over 10x faster with LogLead is compared to past solutions. We demonstrate
roughly 2x improvement in Drain parsing speed by off-loading log message
normalization to LogLead. We demonstrate a brief benchmarking on HDFS
suggesting that log representations beyond bag-of-words provide limited
benefits. Screencast demonstrating the tool: https://youtu.be/8stdbtTfJVo

<p class="mathjax">This work presents DocPedia, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) for
versatile OCR-free document understanding, capable of parsing images up to
2,560$\times$2,560 resolution. Unlike existing work either struggle with
high-resolution documents or give up the large language model thus vision or
language ability constrained, our DocPedia directly processes visual input in
the frequency domain rather than the pixel space. The unique characteristic
enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information
using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both
perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage
training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks
covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the
mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks. The
results provide further evidence of the effectiveness and superior performance
of our DocPedia over other methods.

Secondly, we integrate road-network-based Areal Embedding to enhance spatial

appraisal. Then we present the Areal embedding-enabled Masked Multihead
Attention-based Spatial Interpolation for House Price Prediction (AMMASI)

<p class="mathjax">Progress in neural grammatical error correction (GEC) is hindered by the lack
of annotated training data. Sufficient amounts of high-quality manually
annotated data are not available, so recent research has relied on generating
synthetic data, pretraining on it, and then fine-tuning on real datasets;
performance gains have been achieved either by ensembling or by using huge
pretrained models such as XXL-T5 as the backbone. In this work, we explore an
orthogonal direction: how to use available data more efficiently. First, we
propose auxiliary tasks that exploit the alignment between the original and
corrected sentences, such as predicting a sequence of corrections. We formulate
each task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and perform multi-task training.
Second, we discover that the order of datasets used for training and even
individual instances within a dataset may have important effects on the final
performance, so we set out to find the best training schedule. Together, these
two ideas lead to significant improvements, producing results that improve
state of the art with much smaller models; in particular, we outperform the
best models based on T5-XXL (11B parameters) with a BART-based model (400M
parameters).

with coordinate multi-point (CoMP) reception, where multiple destinations adopt
the maximal ratio combination technique to jointly decode the common message
sent from the transmitter equipped with the MA array. Our goal is to maximize
the effective received signal-to-noise ratio, by jointly optimizing the
transmit beamforming and the positions of the MA array. Although the formulated
problem is highly non-convex, we reveal that it is fundamental to maximize the
principal eigenvalue of a hermite channel matrix which is a function of the
positions of the MA array. The corresponding sub-problem is still non-convex,
for which we develop a computationally efficient algorithm. Afterwards, the
optimal transmit beamforming is determined with a closed-form solution. In
addition, the theoretical performance upper bound is analyzed. Since the MA
array brings an additional spatial degree of freedom by flexibly adjusting all
antennas' positions, it achieves significant performance gain compared to
competitive benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the
functional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by
deep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack
detection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend
to treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not
automatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes
of the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle
this problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so
that the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative
adversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes
the front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front
end with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end
with a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order
inconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to
address open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed
CrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the
proposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded
into different neural network models to improve their performances.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a visual-inertial-based control strategy to address the
task space control problem of robot manipulators. To this end, an
observer-based hybrid controller is employed to control end-effector motion. In
addition, a hybrid observer is introduced for a visual-inertial navigation
system to close the control loop directly at the Cartesian space by estimating
the end-effector pose. Accordingly, the robot tip is equipped with an inertial
measurement unit (IMU) and a stereo camera to provide task-space feedback
information for the proposed observer. It is demonstrated through the Lyapunov
stability theorem that the resulting closed-loop system under the proposed
observer-based controller is globally asymptotically stable. Besides this
notable merit (global asymptotic stability), the proposed control method
eliminates the need to compute inverse kinematics and increases trajectory
tracking accuracy in task-space. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed
control scheme are evaluated through computer simulations, where the proposed
control structure is applied to a 6 degrees-of-freedom long-reach hydraulic
robot manipulator.

for rotations and translations. These results may be useful to other problems
that can be formulated in the same mathematical form. We perform a sensitivity
analysis for both our two methods and the linear method developed by Zhuang et
al. This analysis allows the comparison of the three methods. In the light of
this comparison the non-linear optimization method, which solves for rotations
and translations simultaneously, seems to be the most stable one with respect
to noise and to measurement errors.

<p class="mathjax">Graph representation learning is fundamental for analyzing graph-structured
data. Exploring invariant graph representations remains a challenge for most
existing graph representation learning methods. In this paper, we propose a
cross-view graph consistency learning (CGCL) method that learns invariant graph
representations for link prediction. First, two complementary augmented views
are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph
structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential
information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation
techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal,
and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant
graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the
proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency
information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed
from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive
theoretical CGCL analysis. This paper empirically and experimentally
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CGCL method, achieving
competitive results on graph datasets in comparisons with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning using large models have achieved great success in a wide range
of domains. However, training these models on billions of parameters is very
challenging in terms of the training speed, memory cost, and communication
efficiency, especially under the privacy-preserving regime with differential
privacy (DP). On the one hand, DP optimization has comparable efficiency to the
standard non-private optimization on a single GPU, but on multiple GPUs,
existing DP distributed learning (such as pipeline parallel) has suffered from
significantly worse efficiency. On the other hand, the Zero Redundancy
Optimizer (ZeRO) is a state-of-the-art solution to the standard distributed
learning, exhibiting excellent training efficiency on large models, but to work
compatibly with DP is technically complicated. In this work, we develop a new
systematic solution, DP-ZeRO, (I) to scale up the trainable DP model size, e.g.
to GPT-100B, (II) to obtain the same computation and communication efficiency
as the standard ZeRO, and (III) to enable mixed-precision DP training. Our
DP-ZeRO, like the standard ZeRO, has the potential to train models with
arbitrary size and is evaluated on the world's largest DP models in terms of
the number of trainable parameters.

<p class="mathjax">The Arnoldi-Tikhonov method is a well-established regularization technique
for solving large-scale ill-posed linear inverse problems. This method
leverages the Arnoldi decomposition to reduce computational complexity by
projecting the discretized problem into a lower-dimensional Krylov subspace, in
which it is solved. This paper explores the iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov method,
conducting a comprehensive analysis that addresses all approximation errors.
Additionally, it introduces a novel strategy for choosing the regularization
parameter, leading to more accurate approximate solutions compared to the
standard Arnoldi-Tikhonov method. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates
robustness with respect to the regularization parameter, as confirmed by the
numerical results.

<p class="mathjax">The customization of recommended content to users holds significant
importance in enhancing user experiences across a wide spectrum of applications
such as e-commerce, music, and shopping. Graph-based methods have achieved
considerable performance by capturing user-item interactions. However, these
methods tend to utilize randomly constructed embeddings in the dataset used for
training the recommender, which lacks any user preferences. Here, we propose
the concept of variational embeddings as a means of pre-training the
recommender system to improve the feature propagation through the layers of
graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The graph variational embedding
collaborative filtering (GVECF) is introduced as a novel framework to
incorporate representations learned through a variational graph auto-encoder
which are embedded into a GCN-based collaborative filtering. This approach
effectively transforms latent high-order user-item interactions into more
trainable vectors, ultimately resulting in better performance in terms of
recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain(NDCG) metrics. The experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
up to 13.78% improvement in the recall over the test data.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we use multi-view aerial images to reconstruct the geometry,
lighting, and material of facades using neural signed distance fields (SDFs).
Without the requirement of complex equipment, our method only takes simple RGB
images captured by a drone as inputs to enable physically based and
photorealistic novel-view rendering, relighting, and editing. However, a
real-world facade usually has complex appearances ranging from diffuse rocks
with subtle details to large-area glass windows with specular reflections,
making it hard to attend to everything. As a result, previous methods can
preserve the geometry details but fail to reconstruct smooth glass windows or
verse vise. In order to address this challenge, we introduce three spatial- and
semantic-adaptive optimization strategies, including a semantic regularization
approach based on zero-shot segmentation techniques to improve material
consistency, a frequency-aware geometry regularization to balance surface
smoothness and details in different surfaces, and a visibility probe-based
scheme to enable efficient modeling of the local lighting in large-scale
outdoor environments. In addition, we capture a real-world facade aerial 3D
scanning image set and corresponding point clouds for training and
benchmarking. The experiment demonstrates the superior quality of our method on
facade holistic inverse rendering, novel view synthesis, and scene editing
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">The task of multispectral image segmentation (segmentation of images with
numerous channels/bands, each capturing a specific range of wavelengths of
electromagnetic radiation) has been previously explored in contexts with large
amounts of labeled data. However, these models tend not to generalize well to
datasets of smaller size. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using
reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are
generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are
tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves
training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the
dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform
segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives
useful representations without any added risk of overfitting. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach on several multispectral datasets and demonstrate
its effectiveness in boosting the performance of segmentation algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Soft attention in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) is
susceptible to incorporating irrelevant information from the context into its
latent representations, which adversely affects next token generations. To help
rectify these issues, we introduce System 2 Attention (S2A), which leverages
the ability of LLMs to reason in natural language and follow instructions in
order to decide what to attend to. S2A regenerates the input context to only
include the relevant portions, before attending to the regenerated context to
elicit the final response. In experiments, S2A outperforms standard
attention-based LLMs on three tasks containing opinion or irrelevant
information, QA, math word problems and longform generation, where S2A
increases factuality and objectivity, and decreases sycophancy.

<p class="mathjax">Linear system solving is a key tool for computational power system studies.
CPU-based linear system solver speeds, however, have saturated in recent years.
Emerging research shows that GPU-based linear system solvers are beginning to
achieve notable speedup over CPU-based alternatives in some applications. Due
to the architecture of GPU memory access, numerical pivoting represents the new
bottleneck which prevents GPU-based solvers from running even faster.
Accordingly, this paper proposes a matrix perturbation-based method to induce
static pivoting. Using this approach, a series of perturbed, well-conditioned,
pivot-free linear systems are solved in parallel on GPUs. Matrix expansion
routines are then used to linearly combine the results, and the true solution
is recovered to an arbitrarily high degree of theoretical accuracy. We showcase
the validity of our approach on distributed-slack AC power flow solve
iterations associated with the PGLib 300-bus test case.

<p class="mathjax">Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel
classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier
models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this
requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing
the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one
only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration
set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration.
However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel
classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario
where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be
possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level
calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use
of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to
simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be
seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional
(pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over
similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images
available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms
trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon
datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly
improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration
on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors,
indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration.

opened up new opportunities for text analysis in political science. They
promise automation with better results and less programming. In this study, we
evaluate LLMs on three original coding tasks of non-English political science
texts, and we provide a detailed description of a general workflow for using
LLMs for text coding in political science research. Our use case offers a
practical guide for researchers looking to incorporate LLMs into their research

<p class="mathjax">Generalizable NeRF can directly synthesize novel views across new scenes,
eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical
enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D
representation by aggregating source-view features. In this paper, we propose
an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF.
Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar
information independently, EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature
aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance
continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our
approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and
appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions, thus further
boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains
state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstate that, compared to prevailing single-dimensional
aggregation, the entangled network excels in the accuracy of 3D scene geometry
and appearance reconstruction.Our project page is

<p class="mathjax">Segmenting an address into meaningful components, also known as address
parsing, is an essential step in many applications from record linkage to
geocoding and package delivery. Consequently, a lot of work has been dedicated
to develop accurate address parsing techniques, with machine learning and
neural network methods leading the state-of-the-art scoreboard. However, most
of the work on address parsing has been confined to academic endeavours with
little availability of free and easy-to-use open-source solutions.
<br />This paper presents Deepparse, a Python open-source, extendable, fine-tunable
address parsing solution under LGPL-3.0 licence to parse multinational
addresses using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and evaluated on over
60 countries. It can parse addresses written in any language and use any
address standard. The pre-trained model achieves average $99~\%$ parsing
accuracies on the countries used for training with no pre-processing nor
post-processing needed. Moreover, the library supports fine-tuning with new
data to generate a custom address parser.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been a surge in the prevalence of high- and
multi-dimensional temporal data across various scientific disciplines. These
datasets are characterized by their vast size and challenging potential for
analysis. Such data typically exhibit serial and cross-dependency and possess
high dimensionality, thereby introducing additional complexities to
conventional time series analysis methods. To address these challenges, a
recent and complementary approach has emerged, known as network-based analysis
methods for multivariate time series. In univariate settings, Quantile Graphs
have been employed to capture temporal transition properties and reduce data
dimensionality by mapping observations to a smaller set of sample quantiles.
<br />To confront the increasingly prominent issue of high dimensionality, we
propose an extension of Quantile Graphs into a multivariate variant, which we
term "Multilayer Quantile Graphs". In this innovative mapping, each time series
is transformed into a Quantile Graph, and inter-layer connections are
established to link contemporaneous quantiles of pairwise series. This enables
the analysis of dynamic transitions across multiple dimensions. In this study,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new mapping using a synthetic
multivariate time series dataset. We delve into the resulting network's
topological structures, extract network features, and employ these features for
original dataset analysis. Furthermore, we compare our results with a recent
method from the literature. The resulting multilayer network offers a
significant reduction in the dimensionality of the original data while
capturing serial and cross-dimensional transitions. This approach facilitates
the characterization and analysis of large multivariate time series datasets
through network analysis techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems.
However, their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is
reliable and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed
systems in the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce a new
asynchronous multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures,
where processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing. We
augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and
integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes. Our approach
requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a
formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by
crashed/crash handling processes. Our new theory covers the entire spectrum,
ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable
scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions.
Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence
between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom,
protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction,
even in the presence of crashes.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired approach to
computer vision that can lead to more efficient processing of visual data with
reduced energy consumption. However, maintaining homeostasis within these
networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural
responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst
diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges,
we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing
mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive
evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in
image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and

Modulated Fourier expansion used as an {\it ansatz} is a well known and

problems. Although the efficiency of this approach has been recognised, its
error analysis has not been investigated rigorously for general forms of linear

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a
resurgence in LLM-based agents, which demonstrate impressive human-like
behaviors and cooperative capabilities in various interactions and strategy
formulations. However, evaluating the safety of LLM-based agents remains a
complex challenge. This paper elaborately conducts a series of manual jailbreak
prompts along with a virtual chat-powered evil plan development team, dubbed
Evil Geniuses, to thoroughly probe the safety aspects of these agents. Our
investigation reveals three notable phenomena: 1) LLM-based agents exhibit
reduced robustness against malicious attacks. 2) the attacked agents could
provide more nuanced responses. 3) the detection of the produced improper
responses is more challenging. These insights prompt us to question the
effectiveness of LLM-based attacks on agents, highlighting vulnerabilities at
various levels and within different role specializations within the
system/agent of LLM-based agents. Extensive evaluation and discussion reveal
that LLM-based agents face significant challenges in safety and yield insights
for future research. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Document analysis and understanding models often require extensive annotated
data to be trained. However, various document-related tasks extend beyond mere
text transcription, requiring both textual content and precise bounding-box
annotations to identify different document elements. Collecting such data
becomes particularly challenging, especially in the context of invoices, where
privacy concerns add an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we
introduce FATURA, a pivotal resource for researchers in the field of document
analysis and understanding. FATURA is a highly diverse dataset featuring
multi-layout, annotated invoice document images. Comprising $10,000$ invoices
with $50$ distinct layouts, it represents the largest openly accessible image
dataset of invoice documents known to date. We also provide comprehensive
benchmarks for various document analysis and understanding tasks and conduct
experiments under diverse training and evaluation scenarios. The dataset is
freely accessible at https://zenodo.org/record/8261508, empowering researchers
to advance the field of document analysis and understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have endowed LLMs with the ability
to perceive and understand multi-modal signals. However, most of the existing
MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text
pairs, leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To
address this issue, we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (LION), which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual
knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained
spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with
region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained
spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between
image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation, we devise a
dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This
progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between
these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual
evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by
leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by
imperfect predicted tags, we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a
learnable token into the tailored text instruction. Comprehensive experiments
on several multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model
(e.g., improvement of 5% accuracy on VSR and 3% CIDEr on TextCaps over
InstructBLIP, 5% accuracy on RefCOCOg over Kosmos-2).

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly
pre-trained language models (PLMs), have been revealed to be vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial examples generated by many
mainstream word-level adversarial attack models are neither valid nor natural,
leading to the loss of semantic maintenance, grammaticality, and human
imperceptibility. Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding
and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which
aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The
method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the
most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them
with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie
Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline
adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it
outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant
margin. The model can generate adversarial examples that are typically valid
and natural, with the preservation of semantic meaning, grammaticality, and
human imperceptibility.

<p class="mathjax">Human Assumed Central Sensitization is involved in the development and
maintenance of chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Central Sensitization
Inventory (CSI) was developed to evaluate the presence of HACS, with a cut-off
value of 40/100 based on patients with chronic pain. However, various factors
including pain conditions (e.g., CLBP), and gender may influence this cut-off
value. For chronic pain condition such as CLBP, unsupervised clustering
approaches can take these factors into consideration and automatically learn
the HACS-related patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the cut-off
values for a Dutch-speaking population with CLBP, considering the total group
and stratified by gender based on unsupervised machine learning. In this study,
questionnaire data covering pain, physical, and psychological aspects were
collected from patients with CLBP and aged-matched pain-free adults (referred
to as healthy controls, HC). Four clustering approaches were applied to
identify HACS-related clusters based on the questionnaire data and gender. The
clustering performance was assessed using internal and external indicators.
Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted on the
best clustering results to determine the optimal cut-off values. The study
included 151 subjects, consisting of 63 HCs and 88 patients with CLBP.
Hierarchical clustering yielded the best results, identifying three clusters:
healthy group, CLBP with low HACS level, and CLBP with high HACS level groups.
Based on the low HACS levels group (including HC and CLBP with low HACS level)
and high HACS level group, the cut-off value for the overall groups were 35, 34
for females, and 35 for. The findings suggest that the optimal cut-off values
for CLBP is 35. The gender-related cut-off values should be interpreted with
caution due to the unbalanced gender distribution in the sample.

<p class="mathjax">Applying NeRF to downstream perception tasks for scene understanding and
representation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat
semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \textit{i.e.}, the "label
rendering" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering
semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual
information of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear
boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To
solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel
pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly
under a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception.
To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as
well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the
joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two
self-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the
Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality
of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In
evaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks
(\textit{i.e.} semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and
real-world datasets. Notably, our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94\%,
11.76\%, and 8.47\% on generalized semantic segmentation, finetuning semantic
segmentation, and instance segmentation, respectively.

unbreakable security communication systems. The Public Key Cryptography (PKC)
techniques which use larger keys cannot be fitted in tiny resource constrained
Wireless of Things (WoT) devices. Some Symmetric Key Cryptosystems (SKC) use
smaller keys, which can be fitted in the tiny devices. But in large networks
where the number of nodes is in the order of 103, the memory constraint does
not allow the system to do so. The existing secure data communication in
insecure medium uses various conventional encryption methods like Public Key
Cryptography (PKC) and Symmetric Key Cryptosystems (SKC). Generally, modern
encryption methods need huge processing power, memory and time. Also in some
cases, Key Pre-distribution System (KPS) is used among different communicating
devices. With the growing need for larger key size in the conventional secure
communication system, the existing resources in the communicating devices
suffer from resource starvation. Hence, the need of a novel mechanism for
secure communication is inevitable. But the existing secure communication
mechanisms like PKC, SKC or KPS do not ensure elimination of resource
starvation issue in tiny devices during communication. In these existing
conventional mechanisms, the plain text is generally converted into cipher text
with greater size than the plain text at the device level, which leads to
resource starvation. At the time of transmission, the cipher text at the device
end requires more bandwidth than the plain text which puts bandwidth overhead
on the broadcast channel (BC).

<p class="mathjax">Despite the rapid development of video Large Language Models (LLMs), a
comprehensive evaluation is still absent. In this paper, we introduce a unified
evaluation that encompasses multiple video tasks, including captioning,
question and answering, retrieval, and action recognition. In addition to
conventional metrics, we showcase how GPT-based evaluation can match human-like
performance in assessing response quality across multiple aspects. We propose a
simple baseline: Video-LLaVA, which uses a single linear projection and
outperforms existing video LLMs. Finally, we evaluate video LLMs beyond
academic datasets, which show encouraging recognition and reasoning
capabilities in driving scenarios with only hundreds of video-instruction pairs
for fine-tuning. We hope our work can serve as a unified evaluation for video
LLMs, and help expand more practical scenarios. The evaluation code will be

<p class="mathjax">Greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically risen since the early 1900s with
U.S. transportation generating 28% of the U.S' emissions. As such, there is
interest in reducing transportation-related emissions. Specifically,
sustainability research has sprouted around signalized intersections as
intersections allow different streams of traffic to cross and change
directions. Recent research has developed mixed traffic control eco-driving
strategies at signalized intersections to decrease emissions. However, the
inherent structure of a signalized intersection generates increased emissions
by creating frequent acceleration/deceleration events, excessive idling from
traffic congestion, and stop-and-go waves. Thus, we believe unsignalized
intersections hold potential for further sustainability improvements. In this
work, we provide an emissions analysis on unsignalized intersections with
complex, real-world topologies and traffic demands where mixed traffic control
strategies are employed by robot vehicles (RVs) to reduce waiting times and
congestion. We find with at least 10% RV penetration rate, RVs generate less
fuel consumption and NOx emissions than signalized intersections by up to 27%
and 28%, respectively. With at least 30% RVs, CO and HC emissions are reduced
by up to 42% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, RVs can reduce emissions
across the whole network despite only employing their strategies at the
intersections.

<p class="mathjax">It is well established that formulating an effective constraint model of a
problem of interest is crucial to the efficiency with which it can subsequently
be solved. Following from the observation that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to know a priori which of a set of candidate models will perform
best in practice, we envisage a system that explores the space of models
through a process of reformulation from an initial model, guided by performance
on a set of training instances from the problem class under consideration. We
plan to situate this system in a refinement-based approach, where a user writes
a constraint specification describing a problem above the level of abstraction
at which many modelling decisions are made. In this position paper we set out
our plan for an exploratory reformulation system, and discuss progress made so
far.

<p class="mathjax">In the Triangle-Free (Simple) 2-Matching problem we are given an undirected
graph $G=(V,E)$. Our goal is to compute a maximum-cardinality $M\subseteq E$
satisfying the following properties: (1) at most two edges of $M$ are incident
on each node (i.e., $M$ is a 2-matching) and (2) $M$ does not induce any
triangle. In his Ph.D. thesis from 1984, Harvitgsen presents a complex
polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, with a very complex analysis. This
result was never published in a journal nor reproved in a different way, to the
best of our knowledge.
<br />In this paper we have a fresh look at this problem and present a simple PTAS
for it based on local search. Our PTAS exploits the fact that, as long as the
current solution is far enough from the optimum, there exists a short
augmenting trail (similar to the maximum matching case).

to the illicit nature of these marketplaces, quality datasets are scarce and
difficult to produce. The Dark Net Market archives (2015) presented raw scraped

present, specifically for the Evolution DWM, a structured dataset extracted
from Dark Net Market archive data. Uniquely, many of the data quality issues
inherent to crawled data are resolved. The dataset covers over 500 thousand
forum posts and over 80 thousand listings, providing data on forums, topics,

present temporal weighted communication networks extracted from this data. The
presented dataset provides easy access to a high quality DWM dataset to
facilitate the study of criminal behaviour and communication on such DWMs,
which may provide a relevant source of knowledge for researchers across
disciplines, from social science to law to network science.

<p class="mathjax">Rotation symmetric Boolean functions represent an interesting class of
Boolean functions as they are relatively rare compared to general Boolean
functions. At the same time, the functions in this class can have excellent
properties, making them interesting for various practical applications. The
usage of metaheuristics to construct rotation symmetric Boolean functions is a
direction that has been explored for almost twenty years. Despite that, there
are very few results considering evolutionary computation methods. This paper
uses several evolutionary algorithms to evolve rotation symmetric Boolean
functions with different properties. Despite using generic metaheuristics, we
obtain results that are competitive with prior work relying on customized
heuristics. Surprisingly, we find that bitstring and floating point encodings
work better than the tree encoding. Moreover, evolving highly nonlinear general
Boolean functions is easier than rotation symmetric ones.

<p class="mathjax">Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of
classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender
identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent
privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and
others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and
used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets
containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate
data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets
consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they
fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other
hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits
their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces
(MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed
for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race,
gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by
leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to
copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide
detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing
procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL)
models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks.
Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF
data and over raw data crawled from the internet. The reported results
constitute a baseline for further research employing these data. The MTF data
set can be accessed through the following link (please cite the present paper

<p class="mathjax">Bent Boolean functions are important objects in cryptography and coding
theory, and there are several general approaches for constructing such
functions. Metaheuristics proved to be a strong choice as they can provide many
bent functions, even when the size of the Boolean function is large (e.g., more
than 20 inputs). While bent Boolean functions represent only a small part of
all Boolean functions, there are several subclasses of bent functions providing
specific properties and challenges. One of the most interesting subclasses
comprises (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions. This paper provides a
detailed experimentation with evolutionary algorithms with the goal of evolving
(anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions. We experiment with two encodings and
two fitness functions to directly evolve self-dual bent Boolean functions. Our
experiments consider Boolean functions with sizes of up to 16 inputs, and we
successfully construct self-dual bent functions for each dimension. Moreover,
when comparing with the evolution of bent Boolean functions, we notice that the
difficulty for evolutionary algorithms is rather similar. Finally, we also
tried evolving secondary constructions for self-dual bent functions, but this
direction provided no successful results.

visual arts yet their automated recognition poses significant challenges. This
paper introduces the SniffyArt dataset, consisting of 1941 individuals
represented in 441 historical artworks. Each person is annotated with a tightly
fitting bounding box, 17 pose keypoints, and a gesture label. By integrating
these annotations, the dataset enables the development of hybrid classification
approaches for smell gesture recognition. The datasets high-quality human pose
estimation keypoints are achieved through the merging of five separate sets of
keypoint annotations per person. The paper also presents a baseline analysis,
evaluating the performance of representative algorithms for detection, keypoint
estimation, and classification tasks, showcasing the potential of combining
keypoint estimation with smell gesture classification. The SniffyArt dataset

<p class="mathjax">We explore a new pathway to designing unclonable cryptographic primitives. We
propose a new notion called unclonable puncturable obfuscation (UPO) and study
its implications for unclonable cryptography. Using UPO, we present modular
(and arguably, simple) constructions of many primitives in unclonable
cryptography, including public-key quantum money, quantum copy-protection for
many classes of functionalities, unclonable encryption, and single-decryption
encryption. Notably, we obtain the following new results assuming the existence
of UPO: We show that any cryptographic functionality can be copy-protected as
long as this functionality satisfies a notion of security, which we term as
puncturable security. Prior feasibility results focused on copy-protecting
specific cryptographic functionalities. We show that copy-protection exists for
any class of evasive functions as long as the associated distribution satisfies
a preimage-sampleability condition. Prior works demonstrated copy-protection
for point functions, which follows as a special case of our result. We show
that unclonable encryption exists in the plain model. Prior works demonstrated
feasibility results in the quantum random oracle model. We put forward a
candidate construction of UPO and prove two notions of security, each based on
the existence of (post-quantum) sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability
obfuscation and one-way functions, the quantum hardness of learning with
errors, and a new conjecture called simultaneous inner product conjecture.

<p class="mathjax">In real-world scenarios, although data entities may possess inherent
relationships, the specific graph illustrating their connections might not be
directly accessible. Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically
learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a
latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic,
spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled
differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this
work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework,
a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph
inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework
consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous
methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly,
our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to
identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability
techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs,
shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns
to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our
experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing
performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a
general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different
tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in
previous literature on latent graph inference.

<p class="mathjax">Technological advancement and its omnipresent connection have pushed humans
past the boundaries and limitations of a computer screen, physical state, or
geographical location. It has provided a depth of avenues that facilitate
human-computer interaction that was once inconceivable such as audio and body
language detection. Given the complex modularities of emotions, it becomes
vital to study human-computer interaction, as it is the commencement of a
thorough understanding of the emotional state of users and, in the context of
social networks, the producers of multimodal information. This study first
acknowledges the accuracy of classification found within multimodal emotion
detection systems compared to unimodal solutions. Second, it explores the
characterization of multimedia content produced based on their emotions and the
coherence of emotion in different modalities by utilizing deep learning models
to classify emotion across different modalities.

<p class="mathjax">We focus on the problem of how we can enable a robot to collaborate
seamlessly with a human partner, specifically in scenarios like collaborative
manufacturing where prexisting data is sparse. Much prior work in human-robot
collaboration uses observational models of humans (i.e. models that treat the
robot purely as an observer) to choose the robot's behavior, but such models do
not account for the influence the robot has on the human's actions, which may
lead to inefficient interactions. We instead formulate the problem of optimally
choosing a collaborative robot's behavior based on a conditional model of the
human that depends on the robot's future behavior. First, we propose a novel
model-based formulation of conditional behavior prediction that allows the
robot to infer the human's intentions based on its future plan in data-sparse
environments. We then show how to utilize a conditional model for proactive
goal selection and path generation around human collaborators. Finally, we use
our proposed proactive controller in a collaborative task with real users to
show that it can improve users' interactions with a robot collaborator
quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Generating safe behaviors for autonomous systems is important as they
continue to be deployed in the real world, especially around people. In this
work, we focus on developing a novel safe controller for systems where there
are multiple sources of uncertainty. We formulate a novel multimodal safe
control method, called the Multimodal Safe Set Algorithm (MMSSA) for the case
where the agent has uncertainty over which discrete mode the system is in, and
each mode itself contains additional uncertainty. To our knowledge, this is the
first energy-function-based safe control method applied to systems with
multimodal uncertainty. We apply our controller to a simulated human-robot
interaction where the robot is uncertain of the human's true intention and each
potential intention has its own additional uncertainty associated with it,
since the human is not a perfectly rational actor. We compare our proposed safe
controller to existing safe control methods and find that it does not impede
the system performance (i.e. efficiency) while also improving the safety of the
system.

<p class="mathjax">Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of
essential nutrients. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential
process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and
processing. However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with
cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart
agriculture.
<br />In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.
By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI
as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible
kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects
are regarded as anomalies. We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which
is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during
inference. Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and
create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and
maize kernels. Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable
performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly
consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection
efficiency over 20x speedup. The dataset, code and models will be released at
https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image
classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings.
A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class
names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer
from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent
reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the
generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we
term the "explain without seeing" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class
relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar
classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image
classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization
with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent,
employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors.
Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics,
thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method
leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks,
with 3.47\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the
resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can
consistently improve the performance across various backbone models.

<p class="mathjax">Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) are crucial in modern air defense systems. A
critical aspect of their effectiveness is the Engagement Zone (EZ), the spatial
region within which a SAM can effectively engage and neutralize a target.
Notably, the EZ is intrinsically related to the missile's maximum range; it
defines the furthest distance at which a missile can intercept a target. The
accurate computation of this EZ is essential but challenging due to the dynamic
and complex factors involved, which often lead to high computational costs and
extended processing times when using conventional simulation methods. In light
of these challenges, our study investigates the potential of machine learning
techniques, proposing an approach that integrates machine learning with a
custom-designed simulation tool to train supervised algorithms. We leverage a
comprehensive dataset of pre-computed SAM EZ simulations, enabling our model to
accurately predict the SAM EZ for new input parameters. It accelerates SAM EZ
simulations, enhances air defense strategic planning, and provides real-time
insights, improving SAM system performance. The study also includes a
comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, illuminating their
capabilities and performance metrics and suggesting areas for future research,
highlighting the transformative potential of machine learning in SAM EZ
simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow
machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating
knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we
take a step back, and ask: "Why should one care about continual learning in the
first place?". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers
published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that
memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open
problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual
learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be
part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization,
on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally,
by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current
assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future
directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an
interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying
its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it
successful. This work is the result of the many discussions the authors had at
the Dagstuhl seminar on Deep Continual Learning, in March 2023.

<p class="mathjax">In previous works, a mobile application was developed using an unmodified
commercial off-the-shelf smartphone to recognize whole-body exercises. The
working principle was based on the ultrasound Doppler sensing with the device
built-in hardware. Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic
application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus
decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be
manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations
in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse,
which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study
and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and
uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises. We propose two concepts to utilize
small adaption data to successfully improve model generalization in an
uncontrolled environment, increasing the recognition accuracy by two to six
folds compared to the baseline for different users.

<p class="mathjax">Providing formal guarantees of algorithmic fairness is of paramount
importance to socially responsible deployment of machine learning algorithms.
In this work, we study formal guarantees, i.e., certificates, for individual
fairness (IF) of neural networks. We start by introducing a novel convex
approximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational
cost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight
that prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification
and can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus
limiting their practical impact. We propose to certify distributional
individual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and
all distributions within a $\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has
guaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in
quasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on
distributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to
certify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude
larger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world
distribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound
source of IF guarantees.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to construct a realistic simulator of financial exchanges,
including reproducing the dynamics of the limit order book, can give insight
into many counterfactual scenarios, such as a flash crash, a margin call, or
changes in macroeconomic outlook. In recent years, agent-based models have been
developed that reproduce many features of an exchange, as summarised by a set
of stylised facts and statistics. However, the ability to calibrate simulators
to a specific period of trading remains an open challenge. In this work, we
develop a novel approach to the calibration of market simulators by leveraging
recent advances in deep learning, specifically using neural density estimators
and embedding networks. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly
identify high probability parameter sets, both when applied to synthetic and
historical data, and without reliance on manually selected or weighted
ensembles of stylised facts.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of constraining diffusion model outputs with a
user-supplied reference image. Our key objective is to extract multiple
attributes (e.g., color, object, layout, style) from this single reference
image, and then generate new samples with them. One line of existing work
proposes to invert the reference images into a single textual conditioning
vector, enabling generation of new samples with this learned token. These
methods, however, do not learn multiple tokens that are necessary to condition
model outputs on the multiple attributes noted above. Another line of
techniques expand the inversion space to learn multiple embeddings but they do
this only along the layer dimension (e.g., one per layer of the DDPM model) or
the timestep dimension (one for a set of timesteps in the denoising process),
leading to suboptimal attribute disentanglement. To address the aforementioned
gaps, the first contribution of this paper is an extensive analysis to
determine which attributes are captured in which dimension of the denoising
process. As noted above, we consider both the time-step dimension (in reverse
denoising) as well as the DDPM model layer dimension. We observe that often a
subset of these attributes are captured in the same set of model layers and/or
across same denoising timesteps. For instance, color and style are captured
across same U-Net layers, whereas layout and color are captured across same
timestep stages. Consequently, an inversion process that is designed only for
the time-step dimension or the layer dimension is insufficient to disentangle
all attributes. This leads to our second contribution where we design a new
multi-attribute inversion algorithm, MATTE, with associated
disentanglement-enhancing regularization losses, that operates across both
dimensions and explicitly leads to four disentangled tokens (color, style,
layout, and object).

<p class="mathjax">Augmented reality technology has emerged as a promising solution to assist
with wayfinding difficulties, bridging the gap between obtaining navigational
assistance and maintaining an awareness of one's real-world surroundings. This
article presents a systematic review of research literature related to AR
navigation technologies. An in-depth analysis of 65 salient studies was
conducted, addressing four main research topics: 1) current state-of-the-art of
AR navigational assistance technologies, 2) user experiences with these
technologies, 3) the effect of AR on human wayfinding performance, and 4)
impacts of AR on human navigational cognition. Notably, studies demonstrate
that AR can decrease cognitive load and improve cognitive map development, in
contrast to traditional guidance modalities. However, findings regarding
wayfinding performance and user experience were mixed. Some studies suggest
little impact of AR on improving outdoor navigational performance, and certain
information modalities may be distracting and ineffective. This article
discusses these nuances in detail, supporting the conclusion that AR holds
great potential in enhancing wayfinding by providing enriched navigational
cues, interactive experiences, and improved situational awareness.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes a novel approach for generating accurate floor plans and
3D models of building interiors using scanned mesh data. Unlike previous
methods, which begin with a high resolution point cloud from a laser
range-finder, our approach begins with triangle mesh data, as from a Microsoft
HoloLens. It generates two types of floor plans, a "pen-and-ink" style that
preserves details and a drafting-style that reduces clutter. It processes the
3D model for use in applications by aligning it with coordinate axes,
annotating important objects, dividing it into stories, and removing the
ceiling. Its performance is evaluated on commercial and residential buildings,
with experiments to assess quality and dimensional accuracy. Our approach
demonstrates promising potential for automatic digitization and orientation of
scanned mesh data, enabling floor plan and 3D model generation in various
applications such as navigation, interior design, furniture placement,
facilities management, building construction, and HVAC design.

<p class="mathjax">Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep
Learning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and
cancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data
sets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been
published. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer
(e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features.
However, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these
features and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review
aims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying
important aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key
features and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used
to conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies
published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the
analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were
examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven
ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on
detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention
of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse
population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country.
- Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated
analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a
mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and
diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and -
The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only
2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability.

<p class="mathjax">QR decomposition is an essential operation for solving linear equations and
obtaining least-squares solutions. In high-performance computing systems,
large-scale parallel QR decomposition often faces node faults. We address this
issue by proposing a fault-tolerant algorithm that incorporates `coded
computing' into the parallel Gram-Schmidt method, commonly used for QR
decomposition. Coded computing introduces error-correcting codes into
computational processes to enhance resilience against intermediate failures.
While traditional coding strategies cannot preserve the orthogonality of $Q$,
recent work has proven a post-orthogonalization condition that allows low-cost
restoration of the degraded orthogonality. In this paper, we construct a
checksum-generator matrix for multiple-node failures that satisfies the
post-orthogonalization condition and prove that our code satisfies the
maximum-distance separable (MDS) property with high probability. Furthermore,
we consider in-node checksum storage setting where checksums are stored in
original nodes. We obtain the minimal number of checksums required to be
resilient to any $f$ failures under the in-node checksum storage, and also
propose an in-node systematic MDS coding strategy that achieves the lower
bound. Extensive experiments validate our theories and showcase the negligible
overhead of our coded computing framework for fault-tolerant QR decomposition.

<p class="mathjax">FinanceBench is a first-of-its-kind test suite for evaluating the performance
of LLMs on open book financial question answering (QA). It comprises 10,231
questions about publicly traded companies, with corresponding answers and
evidence strings. The questions in FinanceBench are ecologically valid and
cover a diverse set of scenarios. They are intended to be clear-cut and
straightforward to answer to serve as a minimum performance standard. We test
16 state of the art model configurations (including GPT-4-Turbo, Llama2 and
Claude2, with vector stores and long context prompts) on a sample of 150 cases
from FinanceBench, and manually review their answers (n=2,400). The cases are
available open-source. We show that existing LLMs have clear limitations for
financial QA. Notably, GPT-4-Turbo used with a retrieval system incorrectly
answered or refused to answer 81% of questions. While augmentation techniques
such as using longer context window to feed in relevant evidence improve
performance, they are unrealistic for enterprise settings due to increased
latency and cannot support larger financial documents. We find that all models
examined exhibit weaknesses, such as hallucinations, that limit their
suitability for use by enterprises.

narrow diameters, and inaccessible locations. Mobile robots are promising for
autonomous pipeline inspection and mapping. This project aimed to simulate and
implement a robot capable of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in an
indoor maze-like environment representing simplified pipelines. The approach
involved simulating a differential drive robot in Gazebo/ROS, equipping it with
sensors, implementing SLAM using mapping, and path planning with move_base. A
physical robot was then built and tested by manually driving it in a
constructed maze while collecting sensor data and mapping. Sensor fusion of
wheel encoders, Kinect camera, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data was
explored to improve odometry and mapping accuracy without encoders. The final
map had reasonable correspondence to the true maze despite lacking wheel
encoders. In summary, results show the feasibility of using ROS-based SLAM for
pipeline inspection if accounting for real-world complexities.

<p class="mathjax">As robots are deployed in human spaces, it's important that they are able to
coordinate their actions with the people around them. Part of such coordination
involves ensuring that people have a good understanding of how a robot will act
in the environment. This can be achieved through explanations of the robot's
policy. Much prior work in explainable AI and RL focuses on generating
explanations for single-agent policies, but little has been explored in
generating explanations for collaborative policies. In this work, we
investigate how to generate multi-agent strategy explanations for human-robot
collaboration. We formulate the problem using a generic multi-agent planner,
show how to generate visual explanations through strategy-conditioned landmark
states and generate textual explanations by giving the landmarks to an LLM.
Through a user study, we find that when presented with explanations from our
proposed framework, users are able to better explore the full space of
strategies and collaborate more efficiently with new robot partners.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series (MTS) analysis prevails in real-world applications
such as finance, climate science and healthcare. The various self-attention
mechanisms, the backbone of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based models,
efficiently discover the temporal dependencies, yet cannot well capture the
intricate cross-correlation between different features of MTS data, which
inherently stems from complex dynamical systems in practice. To this end, we
propose a novel correlated attention mechanism, which not only efficiently
captures feature-wise dependencies, but can also be seamlessly integrated
within the encoder blocks of existing well-known Transformers to gain
efficiency improvement. In particular, correlated attention operates across
feature channels to compute cross-covariance matrices between queries and keys
with different lag values, and selectively aggregate representations at the
sub-series level. This architecture facilitates automated discovery and
representation learning of not only instantaneous but also lagged
cross-correlations, while inherently capturing time series auto-correlation.
When combined with prevalent Transformer baselines, correlated attention
mechanism constitutes a better alternative for encoder-only architectures,
which are suitable for a wide range of tasks including imputation, anomaly
detection and classification. Extensive experiments on the aforementioned tasks
consistently underscore the advantages of correlated attention mechanism in
enhancing base Transformer models, and demonstrate our state-of-the-art results
in imputation, anomaly detection and classification.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical
events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network
intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in
infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an
unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more
practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from
domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection.
Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data,
resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new
semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm
for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled
anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation
to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named
Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information
from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare
the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation
techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various
existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the
original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through
extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different
data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation
methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the
baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix
yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP
datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at
https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix.

<p class="mathjax">This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental
(continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental
learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and
distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new
tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most
current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the
order &amp; structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation
process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address
these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse
real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this
paper takes a step back by posing the question: "What can AutoML do for
incremental learning?" We outline three key areas of research that can
contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete
opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new
challenges for AutoML research.

<p class="mathjax">We study risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL), where we aim to maximize
the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with a fixed risk tolerance $\tau$. Prior
theoretical work studying risk-sensitive RL focuses on the tabular Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) setting. To extend CVaR RL to settings where state
space is large, function approximation must be deployed. We study CVaR RL in
low-rank MDPs with nonlinear function approximation. Low-rank MDPs assume the
underlying transition kernel admits a low-rank decomposition, but unlike prior
linear models, low-rank MDPs do not assume the feature or state-action
representation is known. We propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
bonus-driven algorithm to carefully balance the interplay between exploration,
exploitation, and representation learning in CVaR RL. We prove that our
algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{H^7 A^2
d^4}{\tau^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ to yield an $\epsilon$-optimal CVaR, where $H$
is the length of each episode, $A$ is the capacity of action space, and $d$ is
the dimension of representations. Computational-wise, we design a novel
discretized Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm for the CVaR
objective as the planning oracle and show that we can find the near-optimal
policy in a polynomial running time with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation
oracle. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient CVaR RL
algorithm in low-rank MDPs.

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing amount of problematic peer reviews in top AI conferences,
the community is urgently in need of automatic quality control measures. In
this paper, we restrict our attention to substantiation -- one popular quality
aspect indicating whether the claims in a review are sufficiently supported by
evidence -- and provide a solution automatizing this evaluation process. To
achieve this goal, we first formulate the problem as claim-evidence pair
extraction in scientific peer reviews, and collect SubstanReview, the first
annotated dataset for this task. SubstanReview consists of 550 reviews from NLP
conferences annotated by domain experts. On the basis of this dataset, we train
an argument mining system to automatically analyze the level of substantiation
in peer reviews. We also perform data analysis on the SubstanReview dataset to
obtain meaningful insights on peer reviewing quality in NLP conferences over
recent years.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, point cloud perception tasks have been garnering increasing
attention. This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh
from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating
human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and
incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an
effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh.
This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and
gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural
information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer
(graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense
reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Large neural networks pretrained on web-scale corpora are central to modern
machine learning. In this paradigm, the distribution of the large,
heterogeneous pretraining data rarely matches that of the application domain.
This work considers modifying the pretraining distribution in the case where
one has a small sample of data reflecting the targeted test conditions. We
propose an algorithm motivated by a recent formulation of this setting as an
online, bilevel optimization problem. With scalability in mind, our algorithm
prioritizes computing gradients at training points which are likely to most
improve the loss on the targeted distribution. Empirically, we show that in
some cases this approach is beneficial over existing strategies from the domain
adaptation literature but may not succeed in other cases. We propose a simple
test to evaluate when our approach can be expected to work well and point
towards further research to address current limitations.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection models are commonly used for people counting (and
localization) in many applications but require a dataset with costly bounding
box annotations for training. Given the importance of privacy in people
counting, these models rely more and more on infrared images, making the task
even harder. In this paper, we explore how weaker levels of supervision can
affect the performance of deep person counting architectures for image
classification and point-level localization. Our experiments indicate that
counting people using a CNN Image-Level model achieves competitive results with
YOLO detectors and point-level models, yet provides a higher frame rate and a
similar amount of model parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the remarkable advancements in machine translation, the current
sentence-level paradigm faces challenges when dealing with highly-contextual
languages like Japanese. In this paper, we explore how context-awareness can
improve the performance of the current Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models
for English-Japanese business dialogues translation, and what kind of context
provides meaningful information to improve translation. As business dialogue
involves complex discourse phenomena but offers scarce training resources, we
adapted a pretrained mBART model, finetuning on multi-sentence dialogue data,
which allows us to experiment with different contexts. We investigate the
impact of larger context sizes and propose novel context tokens encoding
extra-sentential information, such as speaker turn and scene type. We make use
of Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) to explore how much of the
context the model uses and generalise CXMI to study the impact of the
extra-sentential context. Overall, we find that models leverage both preceding
sentences and extra-sentential context (with CXMI increasing with context size)
and we provide a more focused analysis on honorifics translation. Regarding
translation quality, increased source-side context paired with scene and
speaker information improves the model performance compared to previous work
and our context-agnostic baselines, measured in BLEU and COMET metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the ever-increasing complexity of income tax laws in the United
States, the number of US taxpayers filing their taxes using tax preparation
software (henceforth, tax software) continues to increase. According to the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in FY22, nearly 50% of taxpayers filed
their individual income taxes using tax software. Given the legal consequences
of incorrectly filing taxes for the taxpayer, ensuring the correctness of tax
software is of paramount importance. Metamorphic testing has emerged as a
leading solution to test and debug legal-critical tax software due to the
absence of correctness requirements and trustworthy datasets. The key idea
behind metamorphic testing is to express the properties of a system in terms of
the relationship between one input and its slightly metamorphosed twinned
input. Extracting metamorphic properties from IRS tax publications is a tedious
and time-consuming process. As a response, this paper formulates the task of
generating metamorphic specifications as a translation task between properties
extracted from tax documents - expressed in natural language - to a contrastive
first-order logic form. We perform a systematic analysis on the potential and
limitations of in-context learning with Large Language Models(LLMs) for this
task, and outline a research agenda towards automating the generation of
metamorphic specifications for tax preparation software.

<p class="mathjax">People naturally understand emotions, thus permitting a machine to do the
same could open new paths for human-computer interaction. Facial expressions
can be very useful for emotion recognition techniques, as these are the biggest
transmitters of non-verbal cues capable of being correlated with emotions.
Several techniques are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract
information in a machine learning process. However, simple CNNs are not always
sufficient to locate points of interest on the face that can be correlated with
emotions. In this work, we intend to expand the capacity of emotion recognition
techniques by proposing the usage of Facial Action Units (AUs) recognition
techniques to recognize emotions. This recognition will be based on the Facial
Action Coding System (FACS) and computed by a machine learning system. In
particular, our method expands over EmotiRAM, an approach for multi-cue emotion
recognition, in which we improve over their facial encoding module.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid advancement of machine learning models for NLP tasks,
collecting high-fidelity labels from AI models is a realistic possibility.
Firms now make AI available to customers via predictions as a service (PaaS).
This includes PaaS products for healthcare. It is unclear whether these labels
can be used for training a local model without expensive annotation checking by
in-house experts. In this work, we propose a new framework for Human Correction
of AI-Generated Labels (H-COAL). By ranking AI-generated outputs, one can
selectively correct labels and approach gold standard performance (100% human
labeling) with significantly less human effort. We show that correcting 5% of
labels can close the AI-human performance gap by up to 64% relative
improvement, and correcting 20% of labels can close the performance gap by up
to 86% relative improvement.

<p class="mathjax">Dogs have a unique evolutionary relationship with humans and serve many
important roles e.g. search and rescue, blind assistance, emotional support.
However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available
to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their
environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to
categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor
environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the
availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over
these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion
(approx. 600 images or &lt; 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to
fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in
the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies
of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end
model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine
tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual
differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on
buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment. This work takes a step
towards understanding visual behavior of dogs and their interaction with the
physical world.

<p class="mathjax">Lip segmentation is crucial in computer vision, especially for lip reading.
Despite extensive face segmentation research, lip segmentation has received
limited attention. The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip
segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available
dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and
STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance,
inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ
dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess
the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments
are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources.
The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in
terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while
PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference
time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with
PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a
comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their
performance and inference times. The findings contribute to the development of
lightweight techniques and establish benchmarks for future advances in lip
segmentation, especially in IoT and edge computing scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning has gained substantial attention within the deep learning
community, offering promising solutions to the challenging problem of
sequential learning. Yet, a largely unexplored facet of this paradigm is its
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, especially with the aim of inducing
forgetting. In this paper, we introduce "BrainWash," a novel data poisoning
method tailored to impose forgetting on a continual learner. By adding the
BrainWash noise to a variety of baselines, we demonstrate how a trained
continual learner can be induced to forget its previously learned tasks
catastrophically, even when using these continual learning baselines. An
important feature of our approach is that the attacker requires no access to
previous tasks' data and is armed merely with the model's current parameters
and the data belonging to the most recent task. Our extensive experiments
highlight the efficacy of BrainWash, showcasing degradation in performance
across various regularization-based continual learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Digital Twins promise to deliver a step-change in distribution system
operations and planning, but there are few real-world examples that explore the
challenges of combining imperfect model and measurement data, and then use
these as the basis for subsequent analysis. In this work we propose a Digital
Twin framework for electrical distribution systems and implement that framework
on the Smart Energy Network Demonstrator microgrid in the UK. The data and
software implementation are made available open-source, and consist of a
network model, power meter measurements, and unbalanced power flow-based
algorithms. Measurement and network uncertainties are shown to have a
substantial impact on the quality of Digital Twin outputs. The potential
benefits of a dynamic export limit and voltage control are estimated using the
Digital Twin, using simulated measurements to address data quality challenges,
with results showing curtailment for an exemplar day could be reduced by 56%.
Power meter data and a network model are shown to be necessary for developing
algorithms that enable decision-making that is robust to real-world
uncertainties, with possibilities and challenges of Digital Twin development
clearly demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">Designing a perfect reward function that depicts all the aspects of the
intended behavior is almost impossible, especially generalizing it outside of
the training environments. Active Inverse Reward Design (AIRD) proposed the use
of a series of queries, comparing possible reward functions in a single
training environment. This allows the human to give information to the agent
about suboptimal behaviors, in order to compute a probability distribution over
the intended reward function. However, it ignores the possibility of unknown
features appearing in real-world environments, and the safety measures needed
until the agent completely learns the reward function. I improved this method
and created Risk-averse Batch Active Inverse Reward Design (RBAIRD), which
constructs batches, sets of environments the agent encounters when being used
in the real world, processes them sequentially, and, for a predetermined number
of iterations, asks queries that the human needs to answer for each environment
of the batch. After this process is completed in one batch, the probabilities
have been improved and are transferred to the next batch. This makes it capable
of adapting to real-world scenarios and learning how to treat unknown features
it encounters for the first time. I also integrated a risk-averse planner,
similar to that of Inverse Reward Design (IRD), which samples a set of reward
functions from the probability distribution and computes a trajectory that
takes the most certain rewards possible. This ensures safety while the agent is
still learning the reward function, and enables the use of this approach in
situations where cautiousness is vital. RBAIRD outperformed the previous
approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and action certainty, demonstrated
quick adaptability to new, unknown features, and can be more widely used for
the alignment of crucial, powerful AI models.

<p class="mathjax">In modern systems that rely on the use of Battery Management Systems (BMS),
longevity and the re-use of battery packs have always been important topics of
discussion. These battery packs would be stored inside warehouses where they
would need to be properly monitored and configured before their re-integration
into the new systems. Traditional use of wired connections can be very
cumbersome, and sometimes even impossible, due to the outer layers and
packaging. To circumvent these issues, we propose an extension to the
conventional BMS design that incorporates the use of Near Field Communication
(NFC) for the purpose of wireless battery pack status readout. Additionally, to
ensure that these packs are only managed by authenticated devices and that the
data that is communicated with is protected against outside eavesdropping and
tampering, we present a solution in the form of a lightweight security layer on
top of the NFC protocol. To show the feasibility of our design, an accompanying
prototype has been implemented and evaluated.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, I examine questions surrounding AI neutrality through the
prism of existing literature and scholarship about mediation and media
pluralism. Such traditions, I argue, provide a valuable theoretical framework
for how we should approach the (likely) impending era of AI mediation. In
particular, I suggest examining further the notion of algorithmic pluralism.
Contrasting this notion to the dominant idea of algorithmic transparency, I
seek to describe what algorithmic pluralism may be, and present both its
opportunities and challenges. Implemented thoughtfully and responsibly, I
argue, Algorithmic or AI pluralism has the potential to sustain the diversity,
multiplicity, and inclusiveness that are so vital to democracy.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a pipeline that enhances a general-purpose Vision Language
Model, GPT-4V(ision), by integrating observations of human actions to
facilitate robotic manipulation. This system analyzes videos of humans
performing tasks and creates executable robot programs that incorporate
affordance insights. The computation starts by analyzing the videos with GPT-4V
to convert environmental and action details into text, followed by a
GPT-4-empowered task planner. In the following analyses, vision systems
reanalyze the video with the task plan. Object names are grounded using an
open-vocabulary object detector, while focus on the hand-object relation helps
to detect the moment of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding
allows the vision systems to further gather affordance data (e.g., grasp type,
way points, and body postures). Experiments across various scenarios
demonstrate this method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from
human demonstrations in a zero-shot manner. The prompts of GPT-4V/GPT-4 are

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Auto
ML has enabled developers to harness state-of-the-art ML algorithms with
minimal overhead. However, during this accelerated ML development process, said
developers may often make sub-optimal design and implementation decisions,
leading to the introduction of technical debt that, if not addressed promptly,
can have a significant impact on the quality of the ML-based software.
Developers frequently acknowledge these sub-optimal design and development
choices through code comments during software development. These comments,
which often highlight areas requiring additional work or refinement in the
future, are known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD). This paper aims to
investigate SATD in ML code by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across
five domains, along with 318 non-ML projects. We detected SATD in source code
comments throughout the different project snapshots, conducted a manual
analysis of the identified SATD sample to comprehend the nature of technical
debt in the ML code, and performed a survival analysis of the SATD to
understand the evolution of such debts. We observed: i) Machine learning
projects have a median percentage of SATD that is twice the median percentage
of SATD in non-machine learning projects. ii) ML pipeline components for data
preprocessing and model generation logic are more susceptible to debt than
model validation and deployment components. iii) SATDs appear in ML projects
earlier in the development process compared to non-ML projects. iv)
Long-lasting SATDs are typically introduced during extensive code changes that
span multiple files exhibiting low complexity.

<p class="mathjax">We present GPQA, a challenging dataset of 448 multiple-choice questions
written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry. We ensure that
the questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are
pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when
discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly
skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on
average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the
questions are "Google-proof"). The questions are also difficult for
state-of-the-art AI systems, with our strongest GPT-4 based baseline achieving
39% accuracy. If we are to use future AI systems to help us answer very hard
questions, for example, when developing new scientific knowledge, we need to
develop scalable oversight methods that enable humans to supervise their
outputs, which may be difficult even if the supervisors are themselves skilled
and knowledgeable. The difficulty of GPQA both for skilled non-experts and
frontier AI systems should enable realistic scalable oversight experiments,
which we hope can help devise ways for human experts to reliably get truthful
information from AI systems that surpass human capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained
language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each
pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a
memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized
component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present
an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which
enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width,
block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further
explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of
the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during
matrix decomposition. Experiments on adapting RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B)
demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach
(LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and moreover enables
more aggressive quantization. For example, on the OpenAssistant benchmark
LQ-LoRA is able to learn a 2.5-bit LLaMA-2 model that is competitive with a
model finetuned with 4-bit QLoRA. When finetuned on a language modeling
calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this
setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when
including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) is
competitive with the original model in full precision.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a Pose-Free Large Reconstruction Model (PF-LRM) for reconstructing
a 3D object from a few unposed images even with little visual overlap, while
simultaneously estimating the relative camera poses in ~1.3 seconds on a single
A100 GPU. PF-LRM is a highly scalable method utilizing the self-attention
blocks to exchange information between 3D object tokens and 2D image tokens; we
predict a coarse point cloud for each view, and then use a differentiable
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver to obtain camera poses. When trained on a huge
amount of multi-view posed data of ~1M objects, PF-LRM shows strong
cross-dataset generalization ability, and outperforms baseline methods by a
large margin in terms of pose prediction accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality
on various unseen evaluation datasets. We also demonstrate our model's

<p class="mathjax">Numerically robust algorithmic formulations suitable for rate-independent
crystal plasticity are presented. They cover classic local models as well as
gradient-enhanced theories in which the gradients of the plastic slips are
incorporated by means of the micromorphic approach. The elaborated algorithmic
formulations rely on the underlying variational structure of (associative)
crystal plasticity. To be more precise and in line with so-called variational
constitutive updates or incremental energy minimization principles, an
incrementally defined energy derived from the underlying time-continuous
constitutive model represents the starting point of the novel numerically
robust algorithmic formulations. This incrementally defined potential allows to
compute all variables jointly as minimizers of this energy. While such discrete
variational constitutive updates are not new in general, they are considered
here in order to employ powerful techniques from non-linear constrained
optimization theory in order to compute robustly the aforementioned minimizers.
The analyzed prototype models are based on (1) nonlinear complementarity
problem (NCP) functions as well as on (2) the augmented Lagrangian formulation.
Numerical experiments show the numerical robustness of the resulting
algorithmic formulations. Furthermore, it is shown that the novel algorithmic
ideas can also be integrated into classic, non-variational, return-mapping
schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework,
called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose
estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant
frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose
tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model
efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster
(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic
diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we
develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed
spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the
network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast
inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and
MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and
estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying
to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs
without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop,
respectively. Our source code will be open-sourced.

<p class="mathjax">Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy is an effective cancer treatment.
Models based on the Generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD) provide
radiation plans with excellent planning target volume coverage and low
radiation for organs at risk. However, manual adjustment of the parameters
involved in gEUD is required to ensure that the plans meet patient-specific
physical restrictions. This paper proposes a radiotherapy planning methodology
based on bi-level optimization. We evaluated the proposed scheme in a real
patient and compared the resulting irradiation plans with those prepared by
clinical planners in hospital devices. The results in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness are promising.

<p class="mathjax">The realm of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is characterized by rapid
decision-making processes that capitalize on fleeting market inefficiencies. As
the financial markets become increasingly competitive, there is a pressing need
for innovative strategies that can adapt and evolve with changing market
dynamics. Enter Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of machine learning where
agents learn by interacting with their environment, making it an intriguing
candidate for HFT applications. This paper dives deep into the integration of
RL in statistical arbitrage strategies tailored for HFT scenarios. By
leveraging the adaptive learning capabilities of RL, we explore its potential
to unearth patterns and devise trading strategies that traditional methods
might overlook. We delve into the intricate exploration-exploitation trade-offs
inherent in RL and how they manifest in the volatile world of HFT. Furthermore,
we confront the challenges of applying RL in non-stationary environments,
typical of financial markets, and investigate methodologies to mitigate
associated risks. Through extensive simulations and backtests, our research
reveals that RL not only enhances the adaptability of trading strategies but
also shows promise in improving profitability metrics and risk-adjusted
returns. This paper, therefore, positions RL as a pivotal tool for the next
generation of HFT-based statistical arbitrage, offering insights for both
researchers and practitioners in the field.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, high-frequency trading has emerged as a crucial strategy in
stock trading. This study aims to develop an advanced high-frequency trading
algorithm and compare the performance of three different mathematical models:
the combination of the cross-entropy loss function and the quasi-Newton
algorithm, the FCNN model, and the vector machine. The proposed algorithm
employs neural network predictions to generate trading signals and execute buy
and sell operations based on specific conditions. By harnessing the power of
neural networks, the algorithm enhances the accuracy and reliability of the
trading strategy. To assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the study
evaluates the performance of the three mathematical models. The combination of
the cross-entropy loss function and the quasi-Newton algorithm is a widely
utilized logistic regression approach. The FCNN model, on the other hand, is a
deep learning algorithm that can extract and classify features from stock data.
Meanwhile, the vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm recognized for
achieving improved classification results by mapping data into high-dimensional
spaces. By comparing the performance of these three models, the study aims to
determine the most effective approach for high-frequency trading. This research
makes a valuable contribution by introducing a novel methodology for
high-frequency trading, thereby providing investors with a more accurate and
reliable stock trading strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities
for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide
a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial
tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.
<br />First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including
leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on
domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key
models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural
language processing tasks.
<br />Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in
selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints
around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway
from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.
<br />Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in
financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the
state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance
financial AI.

<p class="mathjax">Monkeypox is a zoonotic infectious disease induced by the Monkeypox virus,
part of the poxviridae orthopoxvirus group initially discovered in Africa and
gained global attention in mid-2022 with cases reported outside endemic areas.
Symptoms include headaches, chills, fever, smallpox, measles, and
chickenpox-like skin manifestations and the WHO officially announced monkeypox
as a global public health pandemic, in July-2022. Timely diagnosis is
imperative for assessing disease severity, conducting clinical evaluations, and
determining suitable treatment plans. Traditionally, PCR testing of skin
lesions is considered a benchmark for the primary diagnosis by WHO, with
symptom management as the primary treatment and antiviral drugs like
tecovirimat for severe cases. However, manual analysis within hospitals poses a
substantial challenge during public health emergencies, particularly in the
case of epidemics and pandemics. Therefore, this survey paper provides an
extensive and efficient analysis of deep learning (DL) methods for the
automatic detection of MP in skin lesion images. These DL techniques are
broadly grouped into categories, including deep CNN, Deep CNNs ensemble, deep
hybrid learning, the newly developed, and Vision transformer for diagnosing MP.
Additionally, the paper addresses benchmark datasets and their collection from
various authentic sources, pre-processing techniques, and evaluation metrics.
The survey also briefly delves into emerging concepts, identifies research
gaps, limitations, and applications, and outlines challenges in the diagnosis
process. This survey furnishes valuable insights into the prospective areas of
DL study and is anticipated to serve as a path for researchers.

and compliance with global regulations, such as the EU's MAR and the US's SEC
Rule 10b-5 and RegFD. To comply with disclosure obligations, issuers must
identify nonpublic information with potential material impact on security
prices as only new, relevant and unexpected information materially affects
prices in efficient markets. Financial analysts, assumed to represent public
knowledge on firms' earnings prospects, face limitations in offering
comprehensive coverage and unbiased estimates. This study develops a neural
network to forecast future firm earnings, using four decades of financial data,
addressing analysts' coverage gaps and potentially revealing hidden insights.
The model avoids selectivity and survivorship biases as it allows for missing
data. Furthermore, the model is able to produce both fiscal-year-end and
quarterly earnings predictions. Its performance surpasses benchmark models from
the academic literature by a wide margin and outperforms analysts' forecasts
for fiscal-year-end earnings predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Kernel methods such as kernel ridge regression and Gaussian process
regressions with Matern type kernels have been increasingly used, in
particular, to fit potential energy surfaces (PES) and density functionals, and
for materials informatics. When the dimensionality of the feature space is
high, these methods are used with necessarily sparse data. In this regime, the
optimal length parameter of a Matern-type kernel tends to become so large that
the method effectively degenerates into a low-order polynomial regression and
therefore loses any advantage over such regression. This is demonstrated
theoretically as well as numerically on the examples of six- and
fifteen-dimensional molecular PES using squared exponential and simple
exponential kernels. The results shed additional light on the success of
polynomial approximations such as PIP for medium size molecules and on the
importance of orders-of-coupling based models for preserving the advantages of
kernel methods with Matern type kernels or on the use of physically-motivated
(reproducing) kernels.

<p class="mathjax">Portfolio management (PM) is a fundamental financial trading task, which
explores the optimal periodical reallocation of capitals into different stocks
to pursue long-term profits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown its
potential to train profitable agents for PM through interacting with financial
markets. However, existing work mostly focuses on fixed stock pools, which is
inconsistent with investors' practical demand. Specifically, the target stock
pool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on
market states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire
to trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock
pools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny
change of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable
performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarnMore, a rEinforcement
leARNing framework with Maskable stOck REpresentation to handle PM with CSPs
through one-shot training in a global stock pool (GSP). Specifically, we first
introduce a mechanism to mask out the representation of the stocks outside the
target pool. Second, we learn meaningful stock representations through a
self-supervised masking and reconstruction process. Third, a re-weighting
mechanism is designed to make the portfolio concentrate on favorable stocks and
neglect the stocks outside the target pool. Through extensive experiments on 8
subset stock pools of the US stock market, we demonstrate that EarnMore
significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 popular
financial metrics with over 40% improvement on profit.

fingerprinting method provides fresh perspectives on molecular structure that
are not easily discernible from single-parameter or single-scale analysis.
Besides, in comparison with traditional graph neural networks, multiparameter
persistent homology has the advantage of providing a more comprehensive and
interpretable characterization of the topology of the molecular data. We have
established theoretical stability guarantees for multiparameter persistent
homology, and have conducted extensive experiments on the Lipophilicity,
FreeSolv, and ESOL datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting
molecular properties.

<p class="mathjax">Benders decomposition is widely used to solve large mixed-integer problems.
This paper takes advantage of machine learning and proposes enhanced variants
of Benders decomposition for solving two-stage stochastic security-constrained
unit commitment (SCUC). The problem is decomposed into a master problem and
subproblems corresponding to a load scenario. The goal is to reduce the
computational costs and memory usage of Benders decomposition by creating
tighter cuts and reducing the size of the master problem. Three approaches are
proposed, namely regression Benders, classification Benders, and
regression-classification Benders. A regressor reads load profile scenarios and
predicts subproblem objective function proxy variables to form tighter cuts for
the master problem. A criterion is defined to measure the level of usefulness
of cuts with respect to their contribution to lower bound improvement. Useful
cuts that contain the necessary information to form the feasible region are
identified with and without a classification learner. Useful cuts are
iteratively added to the master problem, and non-useful cuts are discarded to
reduce the computational burden of each Benders iteration. Simulation studies
on multiple test systems show the effectiveness of the proposed learning-aided
Benders decomposition for solving two-stage SCUC as compared to conventional
multi-cut Benders decomposition.

<p class="mathjax">Introduction: Fetal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rs-fMRI) is a rapidly evolving field that provides valuable insight into brain
development before birth. Accurate segmentation of the fetal brain from the
surrounding tissue in nonstationary 3D brain volumes poses a significant
challenge in this domain. Current available tools have 0.15 accuracy. Aim: This
study introduced a novel application of artificial intelligence (AI) for
automated brain segmentation in fetal brain fMRI, magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). Open datasets were employed to train AI models, assess their
performance, and analyze their capabilities and limitations in addressing the
specific challenges associated with fetal brain fMRI segmentation. Method: We
utilized an open-source fetal functional MRI (fMRI) dataset consisting of 160
cases (reference: fetal-fMRI - OpenNeuro). An AI model for fMRI segmentation
was developed using a 5-fold cross-validation methodology. Three AI models were
employed: 3D UNet, VNet, and HighResNet. Optuna, an automated
hyperparameter-tuning tool, was used to optimize these models. Results and
Discussion: The Dice scores of the three AI models (VNet, UNet, and
HighRes-net) were compared, including a comparison between manually tuned and
automatically tuned models using Optuna. Our findings shed light on the
performance of different AI models for fetal resting-state fMRI brain
segmentation. Although the VNet model showed promise in this application,
further investigation is required to fully explore the potential and
limitations of each model, including the HighRes-net model. This study serves
as a foundation for further extensive research into the applications of AI in
fetal brain fMRI segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Objective. Limited access to breast cancer diagnosis globally leads to
delayed treatment. Ultrasound, an effective yet underutilized method, requires
specialized training for sonographers, which hinders its widespread use.
Approach. Volume sweep imaging (VSI) is an innovative approach that enables
untrained operators to capture high-quality ultrasound images. Combined with
deep learning, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it can potentially
transform breast cancer diagnosis, enhancing accuracy, saving time and costs,
and improving patient outcomes. The widely used UNet architecture, known for
medical image segmentation, has limitations, such as vanishing gradients and a
lack of multi-scale feature extraction and selective region attention. In this
study, we present a novel segmentation model known as Wavelet_Attention_UNet
(WATUNet). In this model, we incorporate wavelet gates (WGs) and attention
gates (AGs) between the encoder and decoder instead of a simple connection to
overcome the limitations mentioned, thereby improving model performance. Main
results. Two datasets are utilized for the analysis. The public "Breast
Ultrasound Images" (BUSI) dataset of 780 images and a VSI dataset of 3818
images. Both datasets contained segmented lesions categorized into three types:
no mass, benign mass, and malignant mass. Our segmentation results show
superior performance compared to other deep networks. The proposed algorithm
attained a Dice coefficient of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.94 on the VSI dataset
and scored 0.93 and 0.94 on the public dataset, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive
proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in
quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to
classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash
equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain
and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in
quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU)
method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations
to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this
work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize
MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy,
we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU)
algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as
$\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This
quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new
benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.

<p class="mathjax">Training networks consisting of biophysically accurate neuron models could
allow for new insights into how brain circuits can organize and solve tasks. We
begin by analyzing the extent to which the central algorithm for neural network
learning -- stochastic gradient descent through backpropagation (BP) -- can be
used to train such networks. We find that properties of biophysically based
neural network models needed for accurate modelling such as stiffness, high
nonlinearity and long evaluation timeframes relative to spike times makes BP
unstable and divergent in a variety of cases. To address these instabilities
and inspired by recent work, we investigate the use of "gradient-estimating"
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for training biophysically based neural networks.
We find that EAs have several advantages making them desirable over direct BP,
including being forward-pass only, robust to noisy and rigid losses, allowing
for discrete loss formulations, and potentially facilitating a more global
exploration of parameters. We apply our method to train a recurrent network of
Morris-Lecar neuron models on a stimulus integration and working memory task,
and show how it can succeed in cases where direct BP is inapplicable. To expand
on the viability of EAs in general, we apply them to a general neural ODE
problem and a stiff neural ODE benchmark and find again that EAs can
out-perform direct BP here, especially for the over-parameterized regime. Our
findings suggest that biophysical neurons could provide useful benchmarks for
testing the limits of BP-adjacent methods, and demonstrate the viability of EAs
for training networks with complex components.

<p class="mathjax">We present an unstructured geometrical Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for
handling two-phase flows with a viscoelastic liquid phase. The viscoelastic
behavior is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations. A one-field
formulation is employed, which results from conditional volume averaging of the
local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method
builds on the 'plicRDF-isoAdvector' geometrical VOF solver that is extended and
combined with the modular framework 'DeboRheo' for viscoelastic CFD. A
piecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general
unstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses
across the fluid interface in a numerically consistent and highly accurate way.
Because of the numerical challenges posed by the high Weissenberg number
problem, we employ an appropriate stabilization approach to the constitutive
equation of the viscoelastic phase to increase the robustness of the method at
higher fluid elasticity. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of
different rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address
the high Weissenberg number problem. We discuss the theoretical formulation and
implementation of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness using
numerical examples of viscoelastic flows. The results highlight the method's
ability to accurately capture the behavior of viscoelastic fluids in various
applications. The proposed method holds promise for furthering our
understanding and predictive capabilities of viscoelastic flows in various
industrial and natural processes.

colonies (Apis mellifera) with rich phenotypic measurements. Data were
continuously collected between May-2020 and April-2021 from 53 hives located at
two apiaries in Qu\'ebec, Canada. The sensor data included audio features,
temperature, and relative humidity. The phenotypic measurements contained
beehive population, number of brood cells (eggs, larva and pupa), Varroa
destructor infestation levels, defensive and hygienic behaviors, honey yield,
and winter mortality. Our study is amongst the first to provide a wide variety
of phenotypic trait measurements annotated by apicultural science experts,
which facilitate a broader scope of analysis. We first summarize the data
collection procedure, sensor data pre-processing steps, and data composition.
We then provide an overview of the phenotypic data distribution as well as a
visualization of the sensor data patterns. Lastly, we showcase several hive
monitoring applications based on sensor data analysis and machine learning,
such as winter mortality prediction, hive population estimation, and the

<p class="mathjax">Despite its benefits for tumour detection and treatment, the administration
of contrast agents in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is associated
with a range of issues, including their invasiveness, bioaccumulation, and a
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. This study explores the feasibility of
producing synthetic contrast enhancements by translating pre-contrast
T1-weighted fat-saturated breast MRI to their corresponding first DCE-MRI
sequence leveraging the capabilities of a generative adversarial network (GAN).
Additionally, we introduce a Scaled Aggregate Measure (SAMe) designed for
quantitatively evaluating the quality of synthetic data in a principled manner
and serving as a basis for selecting the optimal generative model. We assess
the generated DCE-MRI data using quantitative image quality metrics and apply
them to the downstream task of 3D breast tumour segmentation. Our results
highlight the potential of post-contrast DCE-MRI synthesis in enhancing the
robustness of breast tumour segmentation models via data augmentation. Our code

<p class="mathjax">Power system protection schemes today rely on currents rising by several
orders of magnitude when faults occur. In inverter-dominated power systems, a
fault current might be just a few percent larger than normal, making fault
detection more difficult. One solution is for the inverter to slightly perturb
its output current and/or voltage, i.e., to inject an auxiliary signal, so as
to make the system's behavior under faults easier to distinguish from normal.
In this paper, we optimize auxiliary signals for fault detection with distance
relays. We begin with a standard auxiliary signal design problem for generic
static systems. We use duality to reformulate the problem as a bilinear
program, which we solve using the convex-concave procedure. We implement the
framework in an example based on distance protection, in which the auxiliary
signal is negative sequence current.

<p class="mathjax">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy are pivotal in
retinal imaging, each presenting unique benefits and limitations. In vivo OCT
offers rapid, non-invasive imaging but can be hampered by clarity issues and
motion artifacts. Ex vivo confocal microscopy provides high-resolution,
cellular detailed color images but is invasive and poses ethical concerns and
potential tissue damage. To bridge these modalities, we developed a 3D CycleGAN
framework for unsupervised translation of in vivo OCT to ex vivo confocal
microscopy images. Applied to our OCT2Confocal dataset, this framework
effectively translates between 3D medical data domains, capturing vascular,
textural, and cellular details with precision. This marks the first attempt to
exploit the inherent 3D information of OCT and translate it into the rich,
detailed color domain of confocal microscopy. Assessed through quantitative and
qualitative metrics, the 3D CycleGAN framework demonstrates commendable image
fidelity and quality, outperforming existing methods despite the constraints of
limited data. This non-invasive generation of retinal confocal images has the
potential to further enhance diagnostic and monitoring capabilities in
ophthalmology.

<p class="mathjax">An adjoint-based procedure to determine weaknesses, or, more generally, the
material properties of structures is developed and tested. Given a series of
load cases and corresponding displacement/strain measurements, the material
properties are obtained by minimizing the weighted differences between the
measured and computed values. In a subsequent step, techniques to minimize the
number of load cases and sensors are proposed and tested.
<br />Several examples show the viability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
methodology and its potential use for high fidelity digital twins.

<p class="mathjax">The fundamental theorem behind financial markets is that stock prices are
intrinsically complex and stochastic. One of the complexities is the volatility
associated with stock prices. Volatility is a tendency for prices to change
unexpectedly [1]. Price volatility is often detrimental to the return
economics, and thus, investors should factor it in whenever making investment
decisions, choices, and temporal or permanent moves. It is, therefore, crucial
to make necessary and regular short and long-term stock price volatility
forecasts for the safety and economics of investors returns. These forecasts
should be accurate and not misleading. Different models and methods, such as
ARCH GARCH models, have been intuitively implemented to make such forecasts.
However, such traditional means fail to capture the short-term volatility
forecasts effectively. This paper, therefore, investigates and implements a
combination of numeric and probabilistic models for short-term volatility and
return forecasting for high-frequency trades. The essence is that one-day-ahead
volatility forecasts were made with Gaussian Processes (GPs) applied to the
outputs of a Numerical market prediction (NMP) model. Firstly, the stock price
data from NMP was corrected by a GP. Since it is not easy to set price limits
in a market due to its free nature and randomness, a Censored GP was used to
model the relationship between the corrected stock prices and returns.
Forecasting errors were evaluated using the implied and estimated data.

<p class="mathjax">The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP), which is an NP-complete problem,
consists of having a graph G with n nodes and m edges and finding the path that
connects each node exactly once. In this paper we compare some algorithms to
solve a Hamiltonian cycle problem, using different models of computations and
especially the probabilistic and quantum ones. Starting from the classical
probabilistic approach of random walks, we take a step to the quantum direction
by involving an ad hoc designed Quantum Turing Machine (QTM), which can be a
useful conceptual project tool for quantum algorithms. Introducing several
constraints to the graphs, our analysis leads to not-exponential speedup
improvements to the best-known algorithms. In particular, the results are based
on bounded degree graphs (graphs with nodes having a maximum number of edges)
and graphs with the right limited number of nodes and edges to allow them to
outperform the other algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">We study the surface composition of asteroids with visible and/or infrared
spectroscopy. For example, asteroid taxonomy is based on the spectral features
or multiple color indices in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The
composition of asteroids gives key information to understand their origin and
evolution. However, we lack compositional information for faint asteroids due
to limits of ground-based observational instruments. In the near future, the
Chinese Space Survey telescope (CSST) will provide multiple colors and
spectroscopic data for asteroids of apparent magnitude brighter than 25 mag and
23 mag, respectively. For the aim of analysis of the CSST spectroscopic data,
we applied an algorithm using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to establish a
preliminary classification model for asteroid taxonomy according to the design
of the survey module of CSST. Using the SMASS II spectra and the Bus-Binzel
taxonomy system, our ANN classification tool composed of 5 individual ANNs is
constructed, and the accuracy of this classification system is higher than 92
%. As the first application of our ANN tool, 64 spectra of 42 asteroids
obtained in 2006 and 2007 by us with the 2.16-m telescope in the Xinglong
station (Observatory Code 327) of National Astronomical Observatory of China
are analyzed. The predicted labels of these spectra using our ANN tool are
found to be reasonable when compared to their known taxonomic labels.
Considering the accuracy and stability, our ANN tool can be applied to analyse
the CSST asteroid spectra in the future.

<p class="mathjax">For an odd prime $p$, we say $f(X) \in {\mathbb F}_p[X]$ computes square
roots in $\mathbb F_p$ if, for all nonzero perfect squares $a \in \mathbb F_p$,
we have $f(a)^2 = a$.
<br />When $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$, it is well known that $f(X) = X^{(p+1)/4}$ computes
square roots. This degree is surprisingly low (and in fact lowest possible),
since we have specified $(p-1)/2$ evaluations (up to sign) of the polynomial
$f(X)$. On the other hand, for $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$ there was previously no
nontrivial bound known on the lowest degree of a polynomial computing square
roots in $\mathbb F_p$; it could have been anywhere between $\frac{p}{4}$ and
$\frac{p}{2}$.
<br />We show that for all $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$, the degree of a polynomial
computing square roots has degree at least $p/3$. Our main new ingredient is a
general lemma which may be of independent interest: powers of a low degree
polynomial cannot have too many consecutive zero coefficients. The proof method
also yields a robust version: any polynomial that computes square roots for
99\% of the squares also has degree almost $p/3$.
<br />In the other direction, we also show that for infinitely many $p \equiv 1
\mod 4$, the degree of a polynomial computing square roots can be $(\frac{1}{2}
- \Omega(1))p$.

<p class="mathjax">X-ray, known for its ability to reveal internal structures of objects, is
expected to provide richer information for 3D reconstruction than visible
light. Yet, existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) algorithms overlook this
important nature of X-ray, leading to their limitations in capturing structural
contents of imaged objects. In this paper, we propose a framework,
Structure-Aware X-ray Neural Radiodensity Fields (SAX-NeRF), for sparse-view
X-ray 3D reconstruction. Firstly, we design a Line Segment-based Transformer
(Lineformer) as the backbone of SAX-NeRF. Linefomer captures internal
structures of objects in 3D space by modeling the dependencies within each line
segment of an X-ray. Secondly, we present a Masked Local-Global (MLG) ray
sampling strategy to extract contextual and geometric information in 2D
projection. Plus, we collect a larger-scale dataset X3D covering wider X-ray
applications. Experiments on X3D show that SAX-NeRF surpasses previous
NeRF-based methods by 12.56 and 2.49 dB on novel view synthesis and CT
reconstruction. Code, models, and data will be released at
https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/SAX-NeRF

<p class="mathjax">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that
affects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even
today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked
to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of
deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex
non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive
biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and
healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine
learning approaches have reported low accuracies. In this study, we used
globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing an
extensive sample of people with MDD (N=2,772) and HC (N=4,240), which allows a
comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that
integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification
performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector
Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the
latter. As we analyzed a multi-site sample, we additionally applied the ComBat
harmonization tool to remove potential nuisance effects of site. We found that
both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy
DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher
classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was
found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites,
indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise
morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to
the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that
MDD classification on this combination of features and classifiers is
unfeasible.

<p class="mathjax">Many environmental remediation and energy applications (conversion and
storage) for sustainability need design and development of green novel
materials. Discovery processes of such novel materials are time taking and
cumbersome due to large number of possible combinations and permutations of
materials structures. Often theoretical studies based on Density Functional
Theory (DFT) and other theories, coupled with Simulations are conducted to
narrow down sample space of candidate materials, before conducting
laboratory-based synthesis and analytical process. With the emergence of
artificial intelligence (AI), AI techniques are being tried in this process too
to ease out simulation time and cost. However tremendous values of previously
published research from various parts of the world are still left as
labor-intensive manual effort and discretion of individual researcher and prone
to human omissions. AIMS-EREA is our novel framework to blend best of breed of
Material Science theory with power of Generative AI to give best impact and
smooth and quickest discovery of material for sustainability. This also helps
to eliminate the possibility of production of hazardous residues and
bye-products of the reactions. AIMS-EREA uses all available resources --
Predictive and Analytical AI on large collection of chemical databases along
with automated intelligent assimilation of deep materials knowledge from
previously published research works through Generative AI. We demonstrate use
of our own novel framework with an example, how this framework can be
successfully applied to achieve desired success in development of
thermoelectric material for waste heat conversion.

<p class="mathjax">Breast cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating early
and accurate detection for effective treatment. This paper introduces a
methodology that combines automated image augmentation selection (RandAugment)
with search optimisation strategies (Tree-based Parzen Estimator) to identify
optimal values for the number of image augmentations and the magnitude of their
associated augmentation parameters, leading to enhanced segmentation
performance. We empirically validate our approach on breast cancer histology
slides, focusing on the segmentation of cancer cells. A comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art transformer-based segmentation models is conducted, including
SegFormer, PoolFormer, and MaskFormer models, to establish a comprehensive
baseline, before applying the augmentation methodology. Our results show that
the proposed methodology leads to segmentation models that are more resilient
to variations in histology slides whilst maintaining high levels of
segmentation performance, and show improved segmentation of the tumour class
when compared to previous research. Our best result after applying the
augmentations is a Dice Score of 84.08 and an IoU score of 72.54 when
segmenting the tumour class. The primary contribution of this paper is the
development of a methodology that enhances segmentation performance while
ensuring model robustness to data variances. This has significant implications
for medical practitioners, enabling the development of more effective machine
learning models for clinical applications to identify breast cancer cells from
histology slides. Furthermore, the codebase accompanying this research will be
released upon publication. This will facilitate further research and
application development based on our methodology, thereby amplifying its
impact.

<p class="mathjax">The accurate segmentation of breast tumors is an important prerequisite for
lesion detection, which has significant clinical value for breast tumor
research. The mainstream deep learning-based methods have achieved a
breakthrough. However, these high-performance segmentation methods are
formidable to implement in clinical scenarios since they always embrace high
computation complexity, massive parameters, slow inference speed, and huge
memory consumption. To tackle this problem, we propose LightBTSeg, a dual-path
joint knowledge distillation framework, for lightweight breast tumor
segmentation. Concretely, we design a double-teacher model to represent the
fine-grained feature of breast ultrasound according to different semantic
feature realignments of benign and malignant breast tumors. Specifically, we
leverage the bottleneck architecture to reconstruct the original Attention
U-Net. It is regarded as a lightweight student model named Simplified U-Net.
Then, the prior knowledge of benign and malignant categories is utilized to
design the teacher network combined dual-path joint knowledge distillation,
which distills the knowledge from cumbersome benign and malignant teachers to a
lightweight student model. Extensive experiments conducted on breast ultrasound
images (Dataset BUSI) and Breast Ultrasound Dataset B (Dataset B) datasets
demonstrate that LightBTSeg outperforms various counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Constructing a robust model that can effectively generalize to test samples
under distribution shifts remains a significant challenge in the field of
medical imaging. The foundational models for vision and language, pre-trained
on extensive sets of natural image and text data, have emerged as a promising
approach. It showcases impressive learning abilities across different tasks
with the need for only a limited amount of annotated samples. While numerous
techniques have focused on developing better fine-tuning strategies to adapt
these models for specific domains, we instead examine their robustness to
domain shifts in the medical image segmentation task. To this end, we compare
the generalization performance to unseen domains of various pre-trained models
after being fine-tuned on the same in-distribution dataset and show that
foundation-based models enjoy better robustness than other architectures. From
here, we further developed a new Bayesian uncertainty estimation for frozen
models and used them as an indicator to characterize the model's performance on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, proving particularly beneficial for real-world
applications. Our experiments not only reveal the limitations of current
indicators like accuracy on the line or agreement on the line commonly used in
natural image applications but also emphasize the promise of the introduced
Bayesian uncertainty. Specifically, lower uncertainty predictions usually tend
to higher out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of collective cooperation in competitive environments is a
well-known phenomenon in biology, economics and social systems. While most
evolutionary game models focus on the evolution of strategies for a fixed game,
how strategic decisions co-evolve with the environment has so far mostly been
overlooked. Here, we consider a game selection model where not only the
strategies but also the game can change over time following evolutionary
principles. Our results show that co-evolutionary dynamics of games and
strategies can induce novel collective phenomena, fostering the emergence of
cooperative environments. When the model is taken on structured populations the
architecture of the interaction network can significantly amplify pro-social
behaviour, with a critical role played by network heterogeneity and the
presence of clustered groups, distinctive features observed in real-world
populations. By unveiling the link between the evolution of strategies and
games for different structured populations, our model sheds new light on the
origin of social dilemmas ubiquitously observed in real-world social systems.

<p class="mathjax">The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of
research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while
simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our
previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical
control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for
the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced
formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information
within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees
for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to
restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety
conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions (CBFs). We provide
conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with
respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm.
We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a
simplified physics-based environment.

<p class="mathjax">Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been
designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization
algorithms. In this paper, we make this analogy explicit across four problem
classes with a unified solution characterization. This novel framework, in
turn, allows for a systematic transformation of algorithms from one domain to
the other. In particular, we identify equivalent optimization and control
algorithms that have already been pointed out in the existing literature, but
mostly in a scattered way. With this unifying framework in mind, we then
exploit two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs for approximating
the Hessian in a second-order-type algorithm from optimization, namely,
Anderson mixing. This leads to a novel first-order control algorithm that
modifies the standard value iteration (VI) algorithm by incorporating two new
directions and adaptive step sizes. While the proposed algorithm, coined as
quasi-policy iteration, has the same computational complexity as VI, it
interestingly exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to policy
iteration with a very low sensitivity to the discount factor.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum
computer systems, which aims to detect and correct errors in the data qubits
within quantum computers. Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in
existing quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical
step when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine
learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge.
However, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To
bridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine
learning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits
result from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can
provide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the
data qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the
information present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our
knowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of
QEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the
capacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To
provide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep
learning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as
convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers.
Our exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the
receptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the
accuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by
a margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could
inspire future research in this field. We will release the code when the paper
is published.

<p class="mathjax">Plane wave imaging (PWI) in medical ultrasound is becoming an important
reconstruction method with high frame rates and new clinical applications.
Recently, single PWI based on deep learning (DL) has been studied to overcome
lowered frame rates of traditional PWI with multiple PW transmissions. However,
due to the lack of appropriate ground truth images, DL-based PWI still remains
challenging for performance improvements. To address this issue, in this paper,
we propose a new unsupervised learning approach, i.e., deep coherence learning
(DCL)-based DL beamformer (DL-DCL), for high-quality single PWI. In DL-DCL, the
DL network is trained to predict highly correlated signals with a unique loss
function from a set of PW data, and the trained DL model encourages
high-quality PWI from low-quality single PW data. In addition, the DL-DCL
framework based on complex baseband signals enables a universal beamformer. To
assess the performance of DL-DCL, simulation, phantom and in vivo studies were
conducted with public datasets, and it was compared with traditional
beamformers (i.e., DAS with 75-PWs and DMAS with 1-PW) and other DL-based
methods (i.e., supervised learning approach with 1-PW and generative
adversarial network (GAN) with 1-PW). From the experiments, the proposed DL-DCL
showed comparable results with DMAS with 1-PW and DAS with 75-PWs in spatial
resolution, and it outperformed all comparison methods in contrast resolution.
These results demonstrated that the proposed unsupervised learning approach can
address the inherent limitations of traditional PWIs based on DL, and it also
showed great potential in clinical settings with minimal artifacts.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a subgradient-based algorithm for constrained nonsmooth
convex optimization that does not require projections onto the feasible set.
While the well-established Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants already avoid
projections, they are primarily designed for smooth objective functions. In
contrast, our proposed algorithm can handle nonsmooth problems with general
convex functional inequality constraints. It achieves an $\epsilon$-suboptimal
solution in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations, with each iteration
requiring only a single (potentially inexact) Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)
call and a (possibly inexact) subgradient computation. This performance is
consistent with existing lower bounds. Similar performance is observed when
deterministic subgradients are replaced with stochastic subgradients. In the
special case where there are no functional inequality constraints, our
algorithm competes favorably with a recent nonsmooth projection-free method
designed for constraint-free problems. Our approach utilizes a simple
separation scheme in conjunction with a new Lagrange multiplier update rule.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised matrix factorization (SMF) is a classical machine learning method
that simultaneously seeks feature extraction and classification tasks, which
are not necessarily a priori aligned objectives. Our goal is to use SMF to
learn low-rank latent factors that offer interpretable, data-reconstructive,
and class-discriminative features, addressing challenges posed by
high-dimensional data. Training SMF model involves solving a nonconvex and
possibly constrained optimization with at least three blocks of parameters.
Known algorithms are either heuristic or provide weak convergence guarantees
for special cases. In this paper, we provide a novel framework that 'lifts' SMF
as a low-rank matrix estimation problem in a combined factor space and propose
an efficient algorithm that provably converges exponentially fast to a global
minimizer of the objective with arbitrary initialization under mild
assumptions. Our framework applies to a wide range of SMF-type problems for
multi-class classification with auxiliary features. To showcase an application,
we demonstrate that our algorithm successfully identified well-known
cancer-associated gene groups for various cancers.

<p class="mathjax">A link stream is a set of possibly weighted triplets (t, u, v) modeling that
u and v interacted at time t. Link streams offer an effective model for
datasets containing both temporal and relational information, making their
proper analysis crucial in many applications. They are commonly regarded as
sequences of graphs or collections of time series. Yet, a recent seminal work
demonstrated that link streams are more general objects of which graphs are
only particular cases. It therefore started the construction of a dedicated
formalism for link streams by extending graph theory. In this work, we
contribute to the development of this formalism by showing that link streams
also generalize time series. In particular, we show that a link stream
corresponds to a time-series extended to a relational dimension, which opens
the door to also extend the framework of signal processing to link streams. We
therefore develop extensions of numerous signal concepts to link streams: from
elementary ones like energy, correlation, and differentiation, to more advanced
ones like Fourier transform and filters.

<p class="mathjax">The power-law distribution plays a crucial role in complex networks as well
as various applied sciences. Investigating whether the degree distribution of a
network follows a power-law distribution is an important concern. The commonly
used inferential methods for estimating the model parameters often yield biased
estimates, which can lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that a model
conforms to a power-law. In this paper, we discuss improved methods that
utilize Bayesian inference to obtain accurate estimates and precise credibility
intervals. The inferential methods are derived for both continuous and discrete
distributions. These methods reveal that objective Bayesian approaches return
nearly unbiased estimates for the parameters of both models. Notably, in the
continuous case, we identify an explicit posterior distribution. This work
enhances the power of goodness-of-fit tests, enabling us to accurately discern
whether a network or any other dataset adheres to a power-law distribution. We
apply the proposed approach to fit degree distributions for more than 5,000
synthetic networks and over 3,000 real networks. The results indicate that our
method is more suitable in practice, as it yields a frequency of acceptance
close to the specified nominal level.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a shape-sensitive loss function for catheter and guidewire
segmentation and utilize it in a vision transformer network to establish a new
state-of-the-art result on a large-scale X-ray images dataset. We transform
network-derived predictions and their corresponding ground truths into signed
distance maps, thereby enabling any networks to concentrate on the essential
boundaries rather than merely the overall contours. These SDMs are subjected to
the vision transformer, efficiently producing high-dimensional feature vectors
encapsulating critical image attributes. By computing the cosine similarity
between these feature vectors, we gain a nuanced understanding of image
similarity that goes beyond the limitations of traditional overlap-based
measures. The advantages of our approach are manifold, ranging from scale and
translation invariance to superior detection of subtle differences, thus
ensuring precise localization and delineation of the medical instruments within
the images. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses substantiate
the significant enhancement in performance over existing baselines,
demonstrating the promise held by our new shape-sensitive loss function for

<p class="mathjax">Endovascular navigation, essential for diagnosing and treating endovascular
diseases, predominantly hinges on fluoroscopic images due to the constraints in
sensory feedback. Current shape reconstruction techniques for endovascular
intervention often rely on either a priori information or specialized
equipment, potentially subjecting patients to heightened radiation exposure.
While deep learning holds potential, it typically demands extensive data. In
this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct the 3D guidewire by
utilizing CathSim, a state-of-the-art endovascular simulator, and a 3D
Fluoroscopy Guidewire Reconstruction Network (3D-FGRN). Our 3D-FGRN delivers
results on par with conventional triangulation from simulated monoplane
fluoroscopic images. Our experiments accentuate the efficiency of the proposed
network, demonstrating it as a promising alternative to traditional methods.

diagnostics is examined in this study, with a focus on interpretability,
effectiveness, and ethical issues. With an altered DenseNet architecture, the
CNN performs admirably in terms of particularity, sensitivity, as well as
accuracy. Its superiority over conventional methods is validated by comparative
analyses, which highlight efficiency gains. Nonetheless, interpretability
issues highlight the necessity of sophisticated methods in addition to
continuous model improvement. Integration issues like interoperability and

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the
global optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. One of the main advantages
of BO is its use of Gaussian processes (GPs) to characterize model uncertainty
which can be leveraged to guide the learning and search process. However, BO
typically treats systems as black-boxes and this limits the ability to exploit
structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections). Composite
functions of the form $f(x, y(x))$, wherein GP modeling is shifted from the
performance function $f$ to an intermediate function $y$, offer an avenue for
exploiting structural knowledge. However, the use of composite functions in a
BO framework is complicated by the need to generate a probability density for
$f$ from the Gaussian density of $y$ calculated by the GP (e.g., when $f$ is
nonlinear it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression). Previous work
has handled this issue using sampling techniques; these are easy to implement
and flexible but are computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a
new paradigm which allows for the efficient use of composite functions in BO;
this uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain closed-form expressions for
the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that this simple
approach (which we call BOIS) enables the exploitation of structural knowledge,
such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed
multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. Using a chemical
process optimization case study, we benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against
standard BO and sampling approaches. Our results indicate that BOIS achieves
performance gains and accurately captures the statistics of composite
functions.

<p class="mathjax">It is a critical challenge to simultaneously gain high interpretability and
efficiency with the current schemes of deep machine learning (ML). Tensor
network (TN), which is a well-established mathematical tool originating from
quantum mechanics, has shown its unique advantages on developing efficient
``white-box'' ML schemes. Here, we give a brief review on the inspiring
progresses made in TN-based ML. On one hand, interpretability of TN ML is
accommodated with the solid theoretical foundation based on quantum information
and many-body physics. On the other hand, high efficiency can be rendered from
the powerful TN representations and the advanced computational techniques
developed in quantum many-body physics. With the fast development on quantum
computers, TN is expected to conceive novel schemes runnable on quantum
hardware, heading towards the ``quantum artificial intelligence'' in the
forthcoming future.

<p class="mathjax">Brehm and K\"uhnel (1992) constructed three 15-vertex combinatorial
8-manifolds `like the quaternionic projective plane' with symmetry groups
$\mathrm{A}_5$, $\mathrm{A}_4$, and $\mathrm{S}_3$, respectively. Gorodkov
(2016) proved that these three manifolds are in fact PL homeomorphic to
$\mathbb{HP}^2$. Note that 15 is the minimal number of vertices of a
combinatorial manifold that is not PL homeomorphic to $S^8$. In the present
paper we construct a lot of new 15-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. A
surprising fact is that such examples are found for very different symmetry
groups, including those not in any way related to the group $\mathrm{A}_5$.
Namely, we find 19 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_7$, one
triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6\times\mathrm{C}_2$, 14
triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6$, 26 triangulations with
symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_5$, one new triangulation with symmetry group
$\mathrm{A}_4$, and 11 new triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{S}_3$.
Further, we obtain the following classification result. We prove that, up to
isomorphism, there are exactly 75 traingulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$ with 15
vertices and symmetry group of order at least 4: the three Brehm-K\"uhnel
triangulations and the 72 new triangulations listed above. On the other hand,
we show that there are plenty of triangulations with symmetry groups
$\mathrm{C}_3$ and $\mathrm{C}_2$, as well as the trivial symmetry group.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE)
estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to
reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially
constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional
representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus
lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE
estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new,
representation-agnostic framework for estimating bounds on the
representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality
reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation.
First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATEs are
non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second,
as our remedy, we propose to perform partial identification of CATEs or,
equivalently, aim at estimating of lower and upper bounds of the
representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our framework is of direct
relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning techniques are essential tools to compute efficient, yet
accurate, force fields for atomistic simulations. This approach has recently
been extended to incorporate quantum computational methods, making use of
variational quantum learning models to predict potential energy surfaces and
atomic forces from ab initio training data. However, the trainability and
scalability of such models are still limited, due to both theoretical and
practical barriers. Inspired by recent developments in geometric classical and
quantum machine learning, here we design quantum neural networks that
explicitly incorporate, as a data-inspired prior, an extensive set of
physically relevant symmetries. We find that our invariant quantum learning
models outperform their more generic counterparts on individual molecules of
growing complexity. Furthermore, we study a water dimer as a minimal example of
a system with multiple components, showcasing the versatility of our proposed
approach and opening the way towards larger simulations. Our results suggest
that molecular force fields generation can significantly profit from leveraging
the framework of geometric quantum machine learning, and that chemical systems
represent, in fact, an interesting and rich playground for the development and
application of advanced quantum machine learning tools.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate the problem of public data-assisted
non-interactive LDP (Local Differential Privacy) learning with a focus on
non-parametric classification. Under the posterior drift assumption, we for the
first time derive the mini-max optimal convergence rate with LDP constraint.
Then, we present a novel approach, the locally private classification tree,
which attains the mini-max optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we design a
data-driven pruning procedure that avoids parameter tuning and produces a fast
converging estimator. Comprehensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real
datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method. Both our
theoretical and experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of public
data compared to private data, which leads to practical suggestions for
prioritizing non-private data collection.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum embedding is indispensable for applying quantum machine learning
techniques to classical data, and has substantial impacts on performance
outcomes. In this study, we present Neural Quantum Embedding (NQE), a method
that efficiently optimizes quantum embedding by leveraging classical deep
learning techniques. NQE enhances the lower bound of the empirical risk,
leading to substantial improvements in classification performance. Moreover,
NQE improves robustness against noise. To validate the effectiveness of NQE, we
conduct experiments on IBM quantum devices for image data classification,
resulting in a remarkable accuracy enhancement from 0.52 to 0.96. Numerical
analysis of the local effective dimension highlights that NQE improves the
trainability and generalization performance of quantum neural networks.
Furthermore, NQE achieves improved generalization in the quantum kernel method,
as evidenced by a reduction in the upper bound of the expected risk.

<p class="mathjax">A multitude of (dis)similarity measures between neural network
representations have been proposed, resulting in a fragmented research
landscape. Most of these measures fall into one of two categories.
<br />First, measures such as linear regression, canonical correlations analysis
(CCA), and shape distances, all learn explicit mappings between neural units to
quantify similarity while accounting for expected invariances. Second, measures
such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel alignment
(CKA), and normalized Bures similarity (NBS) all quantify similarity in summary
statistics, such as stimulus-by-stimulus kernel matrices, which are already
invariant to expected symmetries. Here, we take steps towards unifying these
two broad categories of methods by observing that the cosine of the Riemannian
shape distance (from category 1) is equal to NBS (from category 2). We explore
how this connection leads to new interpretations of shape distances and NBS,
and draw contrasts of these measures with CKA, a popular similarity measure in
the deep learning literature.

control technology for about a century. Yet to this day, designing and tuning
PID controllers relies mostly on either tabulated rules (Ziegler-Nichols) or on
classical graphical techniques (Bode). Our goal in this paper is to take a
fresh look on PID control in the context of optimizing stability margins for
low-order (first- and second-order) linear time-invariant systems.
Specifically, we seek to derive explicit expressions for gain and phase margins
that are achievable using PID control, and thereby gain insights on the role of
unstable poles and nonminimum-phase zeros in attaining robust stability. In
particular, stability margins attained by PID control for minimum-phase systems
match those obtained by more general control, while for nonminimum-phase
systems, PID control achieves margins that are no worse than those of general
control modulo a predetermined factor. Furthermore, integral action does not
contribute to robust stabilization beyond what can be achieved by PD control
alone.

<p class="mathjax">Gaussian denoising has emerged as a powerful principle for constructing
simulation-free continuous normalizing flows for generative modeling. Despite
their empirical successes, theoretical properties of these flows and the
regularizing effect of Gaussian denoising have remained largely unexplored. In
this work, we aim to address this gap by investigating the well-posedness of
simulation-free continuous normalizing flows built on Gaussian denoising.
Through a unified framework termed Gaussian interpolation flow, we establish
the Lipschitz regularity of the flow velocity field, the existence and
uniqueness of the flow, and the Lipschitz continuity of the flow map and the
time-reversed flow map for several rich classes of target distributions. This
analysis also sheds light on the auto-encoding and cycle-consistency properties
of Gaussian interpolation flows. Additionally, we delve into the stability of
these flows in source distributions and perturbations of the velocity field,
using the quadratic Wasserstein distance as a metric. Our findings offer
valuable insights into the learning techniques employed in Gaussian
interpolation flows for generative modeling, providing a solid theoretical
foundation for end-to-end error analyses of learning GIFs with empirical
observations.

unintuitive quantum knowledge associated with quantum programming. Automated
tools relieving the tedium and errors associated with low-level quantum details
would hence be highly desirable. In this paper, we initiate the study of
program synthesis for quantum unitary programs that recursively define a family
of unitary circuits for different input sizes, which are widely used in
existing quantum programming languages. Specifically, we present QSynth, the
first quantum program synthesis framework, including a new inductive quantum
programming language, its specification, a sound logic for reasoning, and an
encoding of the reasoning procedure into SMT instances. By leveraging existing
SMT solvers, QSynth successfully synthesizes ten quantum unitary programs
including quantum adder circuits, quantum eigenvalue inversion circuits and
Quantum Fourier Transformation, which can be readily transpiled to executable
programs on major quantum platforms, e.g., Q#, IBM Qiskit, and AWS Braket.

transformation in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence,
computer vision, and so on. Subsequently, researchers and industries have been
highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse
diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in
analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for
predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a
depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms
(CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in
diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a
Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant
liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver
tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced
attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the
identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to
predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention
mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a
promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor
prediction. It can assist radiologists in their diagnosis and treatment
planning. The proposed system achieved a high accuracy of 95.5% in predicting
liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Time-domain wave scattering in an unbounded two-dimensional acoustic medium
by sound-hard scatterers is considered. Two canonical geometries, namely a
split-ring resonator (SRR) and an array of cylinders, are used to highlight the
theory, which generalises to arbitrary scatterer geometries. The problem is
solved using the generalised eigenfunction expansion method (GEM), which
expresses the time-domain solution in terms of the frequency-domain solutions.
A discrete GEM is proposed to numerically approximate the time-domain solution.
It relies on quadrature approximations of continuous integrals and can be
thought of as a generalisation of the discrete Fourier transform. The solution
then takes a simple form in terms of direct matrix multiplications. In parallel
to the GEM, the singularity expansion method (SEM) is also presented and
applied to the two aforementioned geometries. It expands the time-domain
solution over a discrete set of unforced, complex resonant modes of the
scatterer. Although the coefficients of this expansion are divergent integrals,
we introduce a method of regularising them using analytic continuation. The
results show that while the SEM is usually inaccurate at $t=0$, it converges
rapidly to the GEM solution at all spatial points in the computational domain,
with the most rapid convergence occurring inside the resonant cavity.

accelerate the performance of the so-called deep-BSDE method, which is a deep
learning algorithm to solve high dimensional partial differential equations
through their corresponding backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs).
Recognizing the sensitivity of the solver to the initial guess selection, we
embed a genetic algorithm (GA) into the solver to optimize the selection. We
aim to achieve faster convergence for the nonlinear PDEs on a broader interval
than deep-BSDE. Our proposed method is applied to two nonlinear parabolic PDEs,
i.e., the Black-Scholes (BS) equation with default risk and the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We compare the results of our method
with those of the deep-BSDE and show that our method provides comparable

(RISs) enables the paradigm of smart radio environments in which wireless
system engineers are no longer limited to only controlling the radiated signals
but can in addition also optimize the wireless channels. Many practical radio
environments include complex scattering objects, especially indoor and factory
settings. Multipath propagation therein creates seemingly intractable coupling
effects between RIS elements, leading to the following questions: How can a
RIS-parametrized rich-scattering environment be modelled in a physics-compliant
manner? Can the parameters of such a model be estimated for a specific but
unknown experimental environment? And how can the RIS configuration be
optimized given a calibrated physics-compliant model? This chapter summarizes
the current state of the art in this field, highlighting the recently unlocked
potential of frugal physical-model-based open-loop control of RIS-parametrized

<p class="mathjax">Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States and is
estimated to affect one in five Americans. Recent advances have demonstrated
strong performance on skin cancer detection, as exemplified by state of the art
performance in the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge; however these
solutions leverage ensembles of complex deep neural architectures requiring
immense storage and compute costs, and therefore may not be tractable. A recent
movement for TinyML applications is integrating Double-Condensing Attention
Condensers (DC-AC) into a self-attention neural network backbone architecture
to allow for faster and more efficient computation. This paper explores
leveraging an efficient self-attention structure to detect skin cancer in skin
lesion images and introduces a deep neural network design with DC-AC customized
for skin cancer detection from skin lesion images. The final model is publicly
available as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to
accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight
against cancer.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses how to handle slice resources for 6G networks at
different time scales in an architecture based on an open radio access network
(ORAN). The proposed solution includes artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge
of the network and applies two control-level loops to obtain optimal
performance compared to other techniques. The ORAN facilitates programmable
network architectures to support such multi-time scale management using AI
approaches. The proposed algorithms analyze the maximum utilization of
resources from slice performance to take decisions at the inter-slice level.
Inter-slice intelligent agents work at a non-real-time level to reconfigure
resources within various slices. Further than meeting the slice requirements,
the intra-slice objective must also include the minimization of maximum
resource utilization. This enables smart utilization of the resources within
each slice without affecting slice performance. Here, each xApp that is an
intra-slice agent aims at meeting the optimal QoS of the users, but at the same
time, some inter-slice objectives should be included to coordinate intra- and
inter-slice agents. This is done without penalizing the main intra-slice
objective. All intelligent agents use deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithms to meet their objectives. We have presented results for enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC), and massive
machine type communication (mMTC) slice categories.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of medical imaging, precise segmentation of stroke lesions from
brain MRI images stands as a critical challenge with significant implications
for patient diagnosis and treatment. Addressing this, our study introduces an
innovative approach using a Fuzzy Information Seeded Region Growing (FISRG)
algorithm. Designed to effectively delineate the complex and irregular
boundaries of stroke lesions, the FISRG algorithm combines fuzzy logic with
Seeded Region Growing (SRG) techniques, aiming to enhance segmentation
accuracy.
<br />The research involved three experiments to optimize the FISRG algorithm's
performance, each focusing on different parameters to improve the accuracy of
stroke lesion segmentation. The highest Dice score achieved in these
experiments was 94.2\%, indicating a high degree of similarity between the
algorithm's output and the expert-validated ground truth. Notably, the best
average Dice score, amounting to 88.1\%, was recorded in the third experiment,
highlighting the efficacy of the algorithm in consistently segmenting stroke
lesions across various slices.
<br />Our findings reveal the FISRG algorithm's strengths in handling the
heterogeneity of stroke lesions. However, challenges remain in areas of abrupt
lesion topology changes and in distinguishing lesions from similar intensity
brain regions. The results underscore the potential of the FISRG algorithm in
contributing significantly to advancements in medical imaging analysis for
stroke diagnosis and treatment.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks,
yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability,
especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect
predictions. In this study, we introduce a causal intervention framework to
assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for
next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next
location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility
models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior
dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the
interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into
well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct
mobility behaviors, thus facilitating the simulation of diverse spatial and
temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next
location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior
factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for
exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and
individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the
real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is
expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the
interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.

<p class="mathjax">Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical
cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral
Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising
solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the
spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI
(super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In
this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial
context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the
irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate
context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile
within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we
incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the
training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training
images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical
ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the
limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic
approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even
in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our
carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results
in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN
algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately
contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of robustly reconstructing an integer vector from its erroneous
remainders appears in many applications in the field of multidimensional (MD)
signal processing. To address this problem, a robust MD Chinese remainder
theorem (CRT) was recently proposed for a special class of moduli, where the
remaining integer matrices left-divided by a greatest common left divisor
(gcld) of all the moduli are pairwise commutative and coprime. The strict
constraint on the moduli limits the usefulness of the robust MD-CRT in
practice. In this paper, we investigate the robust MD-CRT for a general set of
moduli. We first introduce a necessary and sufficient condition on the
difference between paired remainder errors, followed by a simple sufficient
condition on the remainder error bound, for the robust MD-CRT for general
moduli, where the conditions are associated with (the minimum distances of)
these lattices generated by gcld's of paired moduli, and a closed-form
reconstruction algorithm is presented. We then generalize the above results of
the robust MD-CRT from integer vectors/matrices to real ones. Finally, we
validate the robust MD-CRT for general moduli by employing numerical
simulations, and apply it to MD sinusoidal frequency estimation based on
multiple sub-Nyquist samplers.

<p class="mathjax">4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive
measurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the
cardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and
image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has
potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have
predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with
limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular
system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across
the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability
of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and
dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across
three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying
convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain
and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired
in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and
stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately
predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico.
Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities
from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in
generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion,
our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with
ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the stochastic gradient method with random reshuffling
($\mathsf{RR}$) for tackling smooth nonconvex optimization problems.
$\mathsf{RR}$ finds broad applications in practice, notably in training neural
networks. In this work, we first investigate the concentration property of
$\mathsf{RR}$'s sampling procedure and establish a new high probability sample
complexity guarantee for driving the gradient (without expectation) below
$\varepsilon$, which effectively characterizes the efficiency of a single
$\mathsf{RR}$ execution. Our derived complexity matches the best existing
in-expectation one up to a logarithmic term while imposing no additional
assumptions nor changing $\mathsf{RR}$'s updating rule. Furthermore, by
leveraging our derived high probability descent property and bound on the
stochastic error, we propose a simple and computable stopping criterion for
$\mathsf{RR}$ (denoted as $\mathsf{RR}$-$\mathsf{sc}$). This criterion is
guaranteed to be triggered after a finite number of iterations, and then
$\mathsf{RR}$-$\mathsf{sc}$ returns an iterate with its gradient below
$\varepsilon$ with high probability. Moreover, building on the proposed
stopping criterion, we design a perturbed random reshuffling method
($\mathsf{p}$-$\mathsf{RR}$) that involves an additional randomized
perturbation procedure near stationary points. We derive that
$\mathsf{p}$-$\mathsf{RR}$ provably escapes strict saddle points and
efficiently returns a second-order stationary point with high probability,
without making any sub-Gaussian tail-type assumptions on the stochastic
gradient errors. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on neural network
training to support our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of
reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in
the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive
tailored, parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with
trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial
impact on the robustness against perturbations in the input data. Further, we
derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly depends on the
parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a
practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by
regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed
and non-trainable encodings as frequently employed in quantum machine learning,
the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus,
trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and
generalization during training. With numerical results, we demonstrate that,
indeed, Lipschitz bound regularization leads to substantially more robust and
generalizable quantum models.

<p class="mathjax">Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used in the design and optimization of
gas turbines and many other industrial/ scientific applications. However, the
practical use is often limited by the high computational cost, and the accurate
resolution of near-wall flow is a significant contributor to this cost. Machine
learning (ML) and other data-driven methods can complement existing wall
models. Nevertheless, training these models is bottlenecked by the large
computational effort and memory footprint demanded by back-propagation. Recent
work has presented alternatives for computing gradients of neural networks
where a separate forward and backward sweep is not needed and storage of
intermediate results between sweeps is not required because an unbiased
estimator for the gradient is computed in a single forward sweep. In this
paper, we discuss the application of this approach for training a subgrid wall
model that could potentially be used as a surrogate in wall-bounded flow CFD
simulations to reduce the computational overhead while preserving predictive
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">The non-life insurance sector operates within a highly competitive and
tightly regulated framework, confronting a pivotal juncture in the formulation
of pricing strategies. Insurers are compelled to harness a range of statistical
methodologies and available data to construct optimal pricing structures that
align with the overarching corporate strategy while accommodating the dynamics
of market competition. Given the fundamental societal role played by insurance,
premium rates are subject to rigorous scrutiny by regulatory authorities. These
rates must conform to principles of transparency, explainability, and ethical
considerations. Consequently, the act of pricing transcends mere statistical
calculations and carries the weight of strategic and societal factors. These
multifaceted concerns may drive insurers to establish equitable premiums,
taking into account various variables. For instance, regulations mandate the
provision of equitable premiums, considering factors such as policyholder
gender or mutualist group dynamics in accordance with respective corporate
strategies. Age-based premium fairness is also mandated. In certain insurance
domains, variables such as the presence of serious illnesses or disabilities
are emerging as new dimensions for evaluating fairness. Regardless of the
motivating factor prompting an insurer to adopt fairer pricing strategies for a
specific variable, the insurer must possess the capability to define, measure,
and ultimately mitigate any ethical biases inherent in its pricing practices
while upholding standards of consistency and performance. This study seeks to
provide a comprehensive set of tools for these endeavors and assess their
effectiveness through practical application in the context of automobile
insurance.

<p class="mathjax">Topological textures in magnetic and electric materials are considered to be
promising candidates for next-generation information technology and
unconventional computing. Here, we discuss how the physical properties of
topological nanoscale systems, such as skyrmions and domain walls, can be
leveraged for reservoir computing, translating non-linear problems into
linearly solvable ones. In addition to the necessary requirements of physical
reservoirs, the topological textures give new opportunities for the downscaling
of devices, enhanced complexity, and versatile input and readout options. Our
perspective article presents topological magnetic and electric defects as an
intriguing platform for non-linear signal conversion, giving a new dimension to
reservoir computing and in-materio computing in general.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of estimating entropy-regularized optimal
transport (EOT) maps with squared-Euclidean cost between source and target
measures that are subGaussian. In the case that the target measure is compactly
supported or strongly log-concave, we show that for a recently proposed
in-sample estimator, the expected squared $L^2$-error decays at least as fast
as $O(n^{-1/3})$ where $n$ is the sample size. For the general subGaussian case
we show that the expected $L^1$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/6})$,
and in both cases we have polynomial dependence on the regularization
parameter. While these results are suboptimal compared to known results in the
case of compactness of both the source and target measures (squared $L^2$-error
converging at a rate $O(n^{-1})$) and for when the source is subGaussian while
the target is compactly supported (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate
$O(n^{-1/2})$), their importance lie in eliminating the compact support
requirements. The proof technique makes use of a bias-variance decomposition
where the variance is controlled using standard concentration of measure
results and the bias is handled by T1-transport inequalities along with sample
complexity results in estimation of EOT cost under subGaussian assumptions. Our
experimental results point to a looseness in controlling the variance terms and
we conclude by posing several open problems.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Liu and Yin (Int. J. Theor. Phys. 60, 2074-2083 (2021)) proposed a
two-party private set intersection protocol based on quantum Fourier transform.
We find the participant can deduce the other party's private information, which
violates the security requirement of private set computation. In order to solve
this problem, an improved private set intersection protocol based on Hadamard
gate is proposed. Firstly, the more feasible Hadamard gates are used to perform
on the original n qubits instead of the quantum Fourier transform, which may
reduce the difficulty of implementation. In addition, through the exclusive OR
calculation, the participant's private information is randomly chosen and
encoded on the additional n qubits, which prevents participants from obtaining
the result of the difference set S-diff , and then avoids the internal leakage
of private information. Finally, the correctness and security analysis are
conducted to show the proposed protocol can guarantee the correctness of
computation result as well as resist outside attacks and participant internal
attacks.

<p class="mathjax">The classical image segmentation algorithm based on grayscale morphology can
effectively segment images with uneven illumination, but with the increase of
the image data, the real-time problem will emerge. In order to solve this
problem, a quantum image segmentation algorithm is proposed in this paper,
which can use quantum mechanism to simultaneously perform morphological
operations on all pixels in a grayscale image, and then quickly segment the
image into a binary image. In addition, several quantum circuit units,
including dilation, erosion, bottom hat transformation, top hat transformation,
etc., are designed in detail, and then they are combined together to construct
the complete quantum circuits for segmenting the NEQR images. For a 2^n * 2^n
image with q grayscale levels, the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced
to O(n^2+q), which is an exponential speedup than the classic counterparts.
Finally, the experiment is conducted on IBM Q to show the feasibility of our
algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

<p class="mathjax">Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved impressive results for natural
image segmentation with input prompts such as points and bounding boxes. Its
success largely owes to massive labeled training data. However, directly
applying SAM to medical image segmentation cannot perform well because SAM
lacks medical knowledge -- it does not use medical images for training. To
incorporate medical knowledge into SAM, we introduce SA-Med2D-20M, a
large-scale segmentation dataset of 2D medical images built upon numerous
public and private datasets. It consists of 4.6 million 2D medical images and
19.7 million corresponding masks, covering almost the whole body and showing
significant diversity. This paper describes all the datasets collected in
SA-Med2D-20M and details how to process these datasets. Furthermore,
comprehensive statistics of SA-Med2D-20M are presented to facilitate the better
use of our dataset, which can help the researchers build medical vision
foundation models or apply their models to downstream medical applications. We
hope that the large scale and diversity of SA-Med2D-20M can be leveraged to
develop medical artificial intelligence for enhancing diagnosis, medical image
analysis, knowledge sharing, and education. The data with the redistribution

<p class="mathjax">Using the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, we develop a machine
learning interatomic potential for fast and accurately modelling the phonon
transport properties of wurtzite aluminum nitride. The predictive power of the
ACE potential against density functional theory (DFT) is demonstrated across a
broad range of properties of w-AlN, including ground-state lattice parameters,
specific heat capacity, coefficients of thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and
harmonic phonon dispersions. Validation of lattice thermal conductivity is
further carried out by comparing the ACE-predicted values to the DFT
calculations and experiments, exhibiting the overall capability of our ACE
potential in sufficiently describing anharmonic phonon interactions. As a
practical application, we perform a lattice dynamics analysis using the
potential to unravel the effects of biaxial strains on thermal conductivity and
phonon properties of w-AlN, which is identified as a significant tuning factor
for near-junction thermal design of w-AlN-based electronics.

<p class="mathjax">Given a local Hamiltonian, how difficult is it to determine the entanglement
structure of its ground state? We show that this problem is computationally
intractable even if one is only trying to decide if the ground state is
volume-law vs near area-law entangled. We prove this by constructing strong
forms of pseudoentanglement in a public-key setting, where the circuits used to
prepare the states are public knowledge. In particular, we construct two
families of quantum circuits which produce volume-law vs near area-law
entangled states, but nonetheless the classical descriptions of the circuits
are indistinguishable under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption.
Indistinguishability of the circuits then allows us to translate our
construction to Hamiltonians. Our work opens new directions in Hamiltonian
complexity, for example whether it is difficult to learn certain phases of
matter.
