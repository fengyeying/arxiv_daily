<p class="mathjax">In this survey, we examine algorithms for conducting credit assignment in
artificial neural networks that are inspired or motivated by neurobiology,
unifying these various processes under one possible taxonomy. Our proposed
taxonomy is constructed based on how a learning algorithm answers a central
question underpinning the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in complex adaptive
neuronal systems: where do the signals that drive the learning in individual
elements of a network come from and how are they produced? In this unified
treatment, we organize the ever-growing set of brain-inspired learning
processes into six general families and consider these in the context of
backpropagation of errors and its known criticisms. The results of this review
are meant to encourage future developments in neuro-mimetic systems and their
constituent learning processes, wherein lies the opportunity to build a strong
bridge between machine learning, computational neuroscience, and cognitive
science.

<p class="mathjax">Visual sensors, including 3D LiDAR, neuromorphic DVS sensors, and
conventional frame cameras, are increasingly integrated into edge-side
intelligent machines. Realizing intensive multi-sensory data analysis directly
on edge intelligent machines is crucial for numerous emerging edge
applications, such as augmented and virtual reality and unmanned aerial
vehicles, which necessitates unified data representation, unprecedented
hardware energy efficiency and rapid model training. However, multi-sensory
data are intrinsically heterogeneous, causing significant complexity in the
system development for edge-side intelligent machines. In addition, the
performance of conventional digital hardware is limited by the physically
separated processing and memory units, known as the von Neumann bottleneck, and
the physical limit of transistor scaling, which contributes to the slowdown of
Moore's law. These limitations are further intensified by the tedious training
of models with ever-increasing sizes. We propose a novel hardware-software
co-design, random resistive memory-based deep extreme point learning machine
(DEPLM), that offers efficient unified point set analysis. We show the system's
versatility across various data modalities and two different learning tasks.
Compared to a conventional digital hardware-based system, our co-design system
achieves huge energy efficiency improvements and training cost reduction when
compared to conventional systems. Our random resistive memory-based deep
extreme point learning machine may pave the way for energy-efficient and
training-friendly edge AI across various data modalities and tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Classical block designs are important combinatorial structures with a wide
range of applications in Computer Science and Statistics. Here we give a new
abstract description of block designs based on the arrow category construction.
We show that models of this structure in the category of matrices and natural
numbers recover the traditional classical combinatorial objects, while models
in the category of completely positive maps yield a new definition of quantum
designs. We show that this generalizes both a previous notion of quantum
designs given by Zauner and the traditional description of block designs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that there exists a functor which relates every
categorical block design to a quantum one.

<p class="mathjax">An acoustic model, trained on a significant amount of unlabeled data,
consists of a self-supervised learned speech representation useful for solving
downstream tasks, perhaps after a fine-tuning of the model in the respective
downstream task. In this work, we build an acoustic model of Brazilian
Portuguese Speech through a Transformer neural network. This model was
pretrained on more than $800$ hours of Brazilian Portuguese Speech, using a
combination of pretraining techniques. Using a labeled dataset collected for
the detection of respiratory insufficiency in Brazilian Portuguese speakers, we
fine-tune the pretrained Transformer neural network on the following tasks:
respiratory insufficiency detection, gender recognition and age group
classification. We compare the performance of pretrained Transformers on these
tasks with that of Transformers without previous pretraining, noting a
significant improvement. In particular, the performance of respiratory
insufficiency detection obtains the best reported results so far, indicating
this kind of acoustic model as a promising tool for speech-as-biomarker
approach. Moreover, the performance of gender recognition is comparable to the
state of the art models in English.

<p class="mathjax">The ongoing biodiversity crisis, driven by factors such as land-use change
and global warming, emphasizes the need for effective ecological monitoring
methods. Acoustic monitoring of biodiversity has emerged as an important
monitoring tool. Detecting human voices in soundscape monitoring projects is
useful both for analysing human disturbance and for privacy filtering. Despite
significant strides in deep learning in recent years, the deployment of large
neural networks on compact devices poses challenges due to memory and latency
constraints. Our approach focuses on leveraging knowledge distillation
techniques to design efficient, lightweight student models for speech detection
in bioacoustics. In particular, we employed the MobileNetV3-Small-Pi model to
create compact yet effective student architectures to compare against the
larger EcoVAD teacher model, a well-regarded voice detection architecture in
eco-acoustic monitoring. The comparative analysis included examining various
configurations of the MobileNetV3-Small-Pi derived student models to identify
optimal performance. Additionally, a thorough evaluation of different
distillation techniques was conducted to ascertain the most effective method
for model selection. Our findings revealed that the distilled models exhibited
comparable performance to the EcoVAD teacher model, indicating a promising
approach to overcoming computational barriers for real-time ecological
monitoring.

particular, it is expected that Metaverse applications will be deployed in the
near future, as 5G and 6G network provide sufficient bandwidth and sufficiently
low latency to provide a satisfying end-user experience. However, networks
still need to evolve to better support this type of application. We present
here a basic taxonomy of the metaverse, which allows to identify some of the

<p class="mathjax">Training large transformer models from scratch for a target task requires
lots of data and is computationally demanding. The usual practice of transfer
learning overcomes this challenge by initializing the model with weights of a
pretrained model of the same size and specification to increase the convergence
and training speed. However, what if no pretrained model of the required size
is available? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective technique to
transfer the knowledge of a pretrained model to smaller variants. Our approach
called weight subcloning expedites the training of scaled-down transformers by
initializing their weights from larger pretrained models.
<br />Weight subcloning involves an operation on the pretrained model to obtain the
equivalent initialized scaled-down model. It consists of two key steps: first,
we introduce neuron importance ranking to decrease the embedding dimension per
layer in the pretrained model. Then, we remove blocks from the transformer
model to match the number of layers in the scaled-down network. The result is a
network ready to undergo training, which gains significant improvements in
training speed compared to random initialization. For instance, we achieve 4x
faster training for vision transformers in image classification and language
models designed for next token prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) may benefit from a reliable
method for assessing their generated content to determine when to abstain or to
selectively generate. While likelihood-based metrics such as perplexity are
widely employed, recent research has demonstrated the limitations of using
sequence-level probability estimates given by LLMs as reliable indicators of
generation quality. Conversely, LLMs have demonstrated strong calibration at
the token level, particularly when it comes to choosing correct answers in
multiple-choice questions or evaluating true/false statements. In this work, we
reformulate open-ended generation tasks into token-level prediction tasks, and
leverage LLMs' superior calibration at the token level. We instruct an LLM to
self-evaluate its answers, employing either a multi-way comparison or a
point-wise evaluation approach, with the option to include a ``None of the
above'' option to express the model's uncertainty explicitly. We benchmark a
range of scoring methods based on self-evaluation and evaluate their
performance in selective generation using TruthfulQA and TL;DR. Through
experiments with PaLM-2 and GPT-3, we demonstrate that self-evaluation based
scores not only improve accuracy, but also correlate better with the overall
quality of generated content.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a trade study analysis to design and evaluate the
perception system architecture for ReachBot. ReachBot is a novel robotic
concept that uses grippers at the end of deployable booms for navigation of
rough terrain such as walls of caves and lava tubes. Previous studies on
ReachBot have discussed the overall robot design, placement and number of
deployable booms, and gripper mechanism design; however, analysis of the
perception and sensing system remains underdeveloped. Because ReachBot can
extend and interact with terrain over long distances on the order of several
meters, a robust perception and sensing strategy is crucial to identify
grasping locations and enable fully autonomous operation. This trade study
focuses on developing the perception trade space and realizing such perception
capabilities for a physical prototype. This work includes analysis of: (1)
multiple-range sensing strategies for ReachBot, (2) sensor technologies for
subsurface climbing robotics, (3) criteria for sensor evaluation, (4) positions
and modalities of sensors on ReachBot, and (5) map representations of grasping
locations. From our analysis, we identify the overall perception strategy and
hardware configuration for a fully-instrumented case study mission to a Martian
lava tube, and identify specific sensors for a hardware prototype. The final
result of our trade study is a system design conducive to benchtop testing and
prototype hardware development.

<p class="mathjax">We extend our previous work on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
multi-label text classification and present a novel approach for addressing the
computational inefficiency of the Label Powerset (LP) ICP, arrising when
dealing with a high number of unique labels. We present experimental results
using the original and the proposed efficient LP-ICP on two English and one
Czech language data-sets. Specifically, we apply the LP-ICP on three deep
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers of two types: one based on
contextualised (bert) and two on non-contextualised (word2vec) word-embeddings.
In the LP-ICP setting we assign nonconformity scores to label-sets from which
the corresponding p-values and prediction-sets are determined. Our approach
deals with the increased computational burden of LP by eliminating from
consideration a significant number of label-sets that will surely have p-values
below the specified significance level. This reduces dramatically the
computational complexity of the approach while fully respecting the standard CP
guarantees. Our experimental results show that the contextualised-based
classifier surpasses the non-contextualised-based ones and obtains
state-of-the-art performance for all data-sets examined. The good performance
of the underlying classifiers is carried on to their ICP counterparts without
any significant accuracy loss, but with the added benefits of ICP, i.e. the
confidence information encapsulated in the prediction sets. We experimentally
demonstrate that the resulting prediction sets can be tight enough to be
practically useful even though the set of all possible label-sets contains more
than $1e+16$ combinations. Additionally, the empirical error rates of the
obtained prediction-sets confirm that our outputs are well-calibrated.

<p class="mathjax">Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has exhibited remarkable performance in
conditional 3D content generation. However, a comprehensive understanding of
the SDS formulation is still lacking, hindering the development of 3D
generation. In this work, we present an interpretation of SDS as a combination
of three functional components: mode-disengaging, mode-seeking and
variance-reducing terms, and analyze the properties of each. We show that
problems such as over-smoothness and color-saturation result from the intrinsic
deficiency of the supervision terms and reveal that the variance-reducing term
introduced by SDS is sub-optimal. Additionally, we shed light on the adoption
of large Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scale for 3D generation. Based on the
analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach named Stable Score
Distillation (SSD) which strategically orchestrates each term for high-quality
3D generation. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating its ability to generate high-fidelity 3D content without
succumbing to issues such as over-smoothness and over-saturation, even under
low CFG conditions with the most challenging NeRF representation.

encompassing and time-consuming task. This has resulted in specialized tools

In this paper, we present the analysis of 26 semi-structured interviews with

<p class="mathjax">While neural fields have made significant strides in view synthesis and scene
reconstruction, editing them poses a formidable challenge due to their implicit
encoding of geometry and texture information from multi-view inputs. In this
paper, we introduce \textsc{LatentEditor}, an innovative framework designed to
empower users with the ability to perform precise and locally controlled
editing of neural fields using text prompts. Leveraging denoising diffusion
models, we successfully embed real-world scenes into the latent space,
resulting in a faster and more adaptable NeRF backbone for editing compared to
traditional methods. To enhance editing precision, we introduce a delta score
to calculate the 2D mask in the latent space that serves as a guide for local
modifications while preserving irrelevant regions. Our novel pixel-level
scoring approach harnesses the power of InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) to discern the
disparity between IP2P conditional and unconditional noise predictions in the
latent space. The edited latents conditioned on the 2D masks are then
iteratively updated in the training set to achieve 3D local editing. Our
approach achieves faster editing speeds and superior output quality compared to
existing 3D editing models, bridging the gap between textual instructions and
high-quality 3D scene editing in latent space. We show the superiority of our
approach on four benchmark 3D datasets, LLFF, IN2N, NeRFStudio and NeRF-Art.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive modeling commonly relies on asking participants to complete a
battery of varied tests in order to estimate attention, working memory, and
other latent variables. In many cases, these tests result in highly variable
observation models. A near-ubiquitous approach is to repeat many observations
for each test, resulting in a distribution over the outcomes from each test
given to each subject. In this paper, we explore the usage of latent variable
modeling to enable learning across many correlated variables simultaneously. We
extend latent variable models (LVMs) to the setting where observed data for
each subject are a series of observations from many different distributions,
rather than simple vectors to be reconstructed. By embedding test battery
results for individuals in a latent space that is trained jointly across a
population, we are able to leverage correlations both between tests for a
single participant and between multiple participants. We then propose an active
learning framework that leverages this model to conduct more efficient
cognitive test batteries. We validate our approach by demonstrating with
real-time data acquisition that it performs comparably to conventional methods
in making item-level predictions with fewer test items.

<p class="mathjax">The objective of this article is to address the discretisation of
fractured/faulted poromechanical models using 3D polyhedral meshes in order to
cope with the geometrical complexity of faulted geological models.
<br />A polytopal scheme is proposed for contact-mechanics, based on a mixed
formulation combining a fully discrete space and suitable reconstruction
operators for the displacement field with a face-wise constant approximation of
the Lagrange multiplier accounting for the surface tractions along the
fracture/fault network. To ensure the inf--sup stability of the mixed
formulation, a bubble-like degree of freedom is included in the discrete space
of displacements (and taken into account in the reconstruction operators). It
is proved that this fully discrete scheme for the displacement is equivalent to
a low-order Virtual Element scheme, with a bubble enrichment of the VEM space.
This $\mathbb{P}^1$-bubble VEM--$\mathbb{P}^0$ mixed discretization is combined
with an Hybrid Finite Volume scheme for the Darcy flow. All together, the
proposed approach is adapted to complex geometry accounting for network of
planar faults/fractures including corners, tips and intersections; it leads to
efficient semi-smooth Newton solvers for the contact-mechanics and preserve the
dissipative properties of the fully coupled model. Our approach is investigated
in terms of convergence and robustness on several 2D and 3D test cases using
either analytical or numerical reference solutions both for the stand alone
static contact mechanical model and the fully coupled poromechanical model.

<p class="mathjax">Modern attacks against enterprises often have multiple targets inside the
enterprise network. Due to the large size of these networks and increasingly
stealthy attacks, attacker activities spanning multiple hosts are extremely
difficult to correlate during a threat-hunting effort. In this paper, we
present a method for an efficient cross-host attack correlation across multiple
hosts. Unlike previous works, our approach does not require lateral movement
detection techniques or host-level modifications. Instead, our approach relies
on an observation that attackers have a few strategic mission objectives on
every host that they infiltrate, and there exist only a handful of techniques
for achieving those objectives. The central idea behind our approach involves
comparing (OS agnostic) activities on different hosts and correlating the hosts
that display the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures. We
implement our approach in a tool called Ostinato and successfully evaluate it
in threat hunting scenarios involving DARPA-led red team engagements spanning
500 hosts and in another multi-host attack scenario. Ostinato successfully
detected 21 additional compromised hosts, which the underlying host-based
detection system overlooked in activities spanning multiple days of the attack
campaign. Additionally, Ostinato successfully reduced alarms generated from the
underlying detection system by more than 90%, thus helping to mitigate the
threat alert fatigue problem

<p class="mathjax">Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs), or dataflow architectures in
general, have gained attention in recent years due to their promising power
efficiency compared to traditional von Neumann architectures. To program these
architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must
transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent
dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This
transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs
allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in
the original imperative programs.
<br />We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique
for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same
behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and
schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow
compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 7 compiler
bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data
race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these
bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide
benchmark suite.

<p class="mathjax">We study the dynamic query evaluation problem: Given a join query Q and a
stream of updates, we would like to construct a data structure that supports
constant-delay enumeration of the query output after each update.
<br />We show that a stream of N insert-only updates (to an initially empty
database) can be executed in total time O(N^{w(Q)}), where w(Q) is the
fractional hypertree width of Q. This matches the complexity of the static
query evaluation problem for Q and a database of size N. One corollary is that
the average time per single-tuple insert is constant for acyclic joins.
<br />In contrast, we show that a stream of N insert-and-delete updates to Q can be
executed in total time O(N^{w(Q')}), where Q' is obtained from Q by extending
every relational atom with extra variables that represent the "lifespans" of
tuples in Q. We show that this reduction is optimal in the sense that the
static evaluation runtime of Q' provides a lower bound on the total update time
of Q. Our approach recovers the optimal single-tuple update time for known
queries such as the hierarchical and Loomis-Whitney join queries.

technology offers the potential to create educational content from text,
speech, to images based on simple input prompts. This can enhance productivity
by summarizing knowledge and improving communication, quickly adjusting to
different types of learners. Moreover, generative AI holds the promise of
making the learning itself more fun, by responding to user inputs and
dynamically generating high-quality creative material. In this paper we present
the multisensory educational game ArchiGuesser that combines various AI
technologies from large language models, image generation, to computer vision
to serve a single purpose: Teaching students in a playful way the diversity of
our architectural history and how generative AI works.

<p class="mathjax">Speculative execution attacks undermine the security of constant-time
programming, the standard technique used to prevent microarchitectural side
channels in security-sensitive software such as cryptographic code.
Constant-time code must therefore also deploy a defense against speculative
execution attacks to prevent leakage of secret data stored in memory or the
processor registers. Unfortunately, contemporary defenses, such as speculative
load hardening (SLH), can only satisfy this strong security guarantee at a very
high performance cost.
<br />This paper proposes DECLASSIFLOW, a static program analysis and protection
framework to efficiently protect constant-time code from speculative leakage.
DECLASSIFLOW models "attacker knowledge" -- data which is inherently
transmitted (or, implicitly declassified) by the code's non-speculative
execution -- and statically removes protection on such data from points in the
program where it is already guaranteed to leak non-speculatively. Overall,
DECLASSIFLOW ensures that data which never leaks during the non-speculative
execution does not leak during speculative execution, but with lower overhead
than conservative protections like SLH.

<p class="mathjax">Customizing robotic behaviors to be aligned with diverse human preferences is
an underexplored challenge in the field of embodied AI. In this paper, we
present Promptable Behaviors, a novel framework that facilitates efficient
personalization of robotic agents to diverse human preferences in complex
environments. We use multi-objective reinforcement learning to train a single
policy adaptable to a broad spectrum of preferences. We introduce three
distinct methods to infer human preferences by leveraging different types of
interactions: (1) human demonstrations, (2) preference feedback on trajectory
comparisons, and (3) language instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in
personalized object-goal navigation and flee navigation tasks in ProcTHOR and
RoboTHOR, demonstrating the ability to prompt agent behaviors to satisfy human
preferences in various scenarios. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces LLM-MARS, first technology that utilizes a Large
Language Model based Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Agent Robot Systems.
LLM-MARS enables dynamic dialogues between humans and robots, allowing the
latter to generate behavior based on operator commands and provide informative
answers to questions about their actions. LLM-MARS is built on a
transformer-based Large Language Model, fine-tuned from the Falcon 7B model. We
employ a multimodal approach using LoRa adapters for different tasks. The first
LoRa adapter was developed by fine-tuning the base model on examples of
Behavior Trees and their corresponding commands. The second LoRa adapter was
developed by fine-tuning on question-answering examples. Practical trials on a
multi-agent system of two robots within the Eurobot 2023 game rules demonstrate
promising results. The robots achieve an average task execution accuracy of
79.28% in compound commands. With commands containing up to two tasks accuracy
exceeded 90%. Evaluation confirms the system's answers on operators questions
exhibit high accuracy, relevance, and informativeness. LLM-MARS and similar
multi-agent robotic systems hold significant potential to revolutionize
logistics, enabling autonomous exploration missions and advancing Industry 5.0.

<p class="mathjax">The power-flow sensitivity coefficients (PFSCs) are widely used in the power
system for expressing linearized dependencies between the controlled (i.e., the
nodal voltages, lines currents) and control variables (e.g., active and
reactive power injections, transformer tap positions, etc.). The PFSCs are
often computed by knowing the compound admittance matrix of a given network and
the grid states. However, when the branch parameters (or admittance matrix) are
inaccurate or known with limited accuracy, the computed PFSCs can not be relied
upon. Uncertain PFSCs, when used in control, can lead to infeasible control
set-points. In this context, this paper presents a method to quantify the
uncertainty of the PFSCs from uncertain branch parameters and noisy grid-state
measurements that can be used for formulating safe control schemes. We derive
an analytical expression using the error-propagation principle. The developed
tool is numerically validated using Monte Carlo simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Older adults habitually encounter misinformation on social media, but there
is little knowledge about their experiences with it. In this study, we combined
a qualitative survey (n=119) with in-depth interviews (n=21) to investigate how
older adults in America conceptualize, discern, and contextualize social media
misinformation. As misinformation on social media in the past was driven
towards influencing voting outcomes, we were particularly interested to
approach our study from a voting intention perspective. We found that 62% of
the participants intending to vote Democrat saw a manipulative political
purpose behind the spread of misinformation while only 5% of those intending to
vote Republican believed misinformation has a political dissent purpose.
Regardless of the voting intentions, most participants relied on source
heuristics combined with fact-checking to discern truth from misinformation on
social media. The biggest concern about the misinformation, among all the
participants, was that it increasingly leads to biased reasoning influenced by
personal values and feelings instead of reasoning based on objective evidence.
The participants intending to vote Democrat were in 74% of the cases concerned
that misinformation will cause escalation of extremism in the future, while
those intending to vote Republican, were undecided, or planned to abstain were
concerned that misinformation will further erode the trust in democratic
institutions, specifically in the context of public health and free and fair
elections. During our interviews, we found that 63% of the participants who
intended to vote Republican, were fully aware and acknowledged that Republican
or conservative voices often time speak misinformation, even though they are
closely aligned to their political ideology.

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging the potential of Virtualised Network Functions (VNFs) requires a
clear understanding of the link between resource consumption and performance.
The current state of the art tries to do that by utilising Machine Learning
(ML) and specifically Supervised Learning (SL) models for given network
environments and VNF types assuming single-objective optimisation targets.
Taking a different approach poses a novel VNF profiler optimising
multi-resource type allocation and performance objectives using adapted
Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our approach can meet Key Performance Indicator
(KPI) targets while minimising multi-resource type consumption and optimising
the VNF output rate compared to existing single-objective solutions. Our
experimental evaluation with three real-world VNF types over a total of 39
study scenarios (13 per VNF), for three resource types (virtual CPU, memory,
and network link capacity), verifies the accuracy of resource allocation
predictions and corresponding successful profiling decisions via a benchmark
comparison between our RL model and SL models. We also conduct a complementary
exhaustive search-space study revealing that different resources impact
performance in varying ways per VNF type, implying the necessity of
multi-objective optimisation, individualised examination per VNF type, and
adaptable online profile learning, such as with the autonomous online learning
approach of iOn-Profiler.

<p class="mathjax">Priority users (e.g., verified profiles on Twitter) are social media users
whose content is promoted by recommendation algorithms. However, the impact of
this heterogeneous user influence on opinion dynamics, such as polarization
phenomena, is unknown. We conduct a computational mechanistic investigation of
such consequences in a stylized setting. First, we allow priority users, whose
content has greater reach (similar to algorithmic boosting), into an opinion
model on adaptive networks. Then, to exploit this gain in influence, we
incorporate stubborn user behavior, i.e., zealot users who remain committed to
opinions throughout the dynamics. Using a novel measure of echo chamber
formation, we find that prioritizing users can inadvertently reduce
polarization if they post according to the same rule but sharpen echo chamber
formation if they behave heterogeneously. Moreover, we show that a minority of
extremist ideologues (i.e., users who are both stubborn and priority) can push
the system into a transition from consensus to polarization with echo chambers.
Our findings imply that the implementation of the platform's prioritization
policy should be carefully monitored in order to ensure there is no abuse of
users with extra influence.

<p class="mathjax">Children encounter misinformation on social media in a similar capacity as
their parents. Unlike their parents, children are an exceptionally vulnerable
population because their cognitive abilities and emotional regulation are still
maturing, rendering them more susceptible to misinformation and falsehoods
online. Yet, little is known about children's experience with misinformation as
well as what their parents think of the misinformation's effect on child
development. To answer these questions, we combined a qualitative survey of
parents (n=87) with semi-structured interviews of both parents and children
(n=12). We found that children usually encounter deep fakes, memes with
political context, or celebrity/influencer rumors on social media. Children
revealed they "ask Siri" whether a social media video or post is true or not
before they search on Google or ask their parents about it. Parents expressed
discontent that their children are impressionable to misinformation, stating
that the burden falls on them to help their children develop critical thinking
skills for navigating falsehoods on social media. Here, the majority of parents
felt that schools should also teach these skills as well as media literacy to
their children. Misinformation, according to both parents and children affects
the family relationships especially with grandparents with different political
views than theirs.

<p class="mathjax">We evaluated whether integration of expert guidance on seizure onset zone
(SOZ) identification from resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectomics
combined with deep learning (DL) techniques enhances the SOZ delineation in
patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), compared to utilizing DL alone. Rs-fMRI
were collected from 52 children with RE who had subsequently undergone ic-EEG
and then, if indicated, surgery for seizure control (n = 25). The resting state
functional connectomics data were previously independently classified by two
expert epileptologists, as indicative of measurement noise, typical resting
state network connectivity, or SOZ. An expert knowledge integrated deep network
was trained on functional connectomics data to identify SOZ. Expert knowledge
integrated with DL showed a SOZ localization accuracy of 84.8&amp; and F1 score,
harmonic mean of positive predictive value and sensitivity, of 91.7%.
Conversely, a DL only model yielded an accuracy of less than 50% (F1 score
63%). Activations that initiate in gray matter, extend through white matter and
end in vascular regions are seen as the most discriminative expert identified
SOZ characteristics. Integration of expert knowledge of functional connectomics
can not only enhance the performance of DL in localizing SOZ in RE, but also
lead toward potentially useful explanations of prevalent co-activation patterns
in SOZ. RE with surgical outcomes and pre-operative rs-fMRI studies can yield
expert knowledge most salient for SOZ identification.

Natural Gradient for loss function optimization. Our approach improves the

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel variational active contour model based on
I-divergence-TV model to segment Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with
multiplicative gamma noise, which hybrides edge-based model with region-based
model. The proposed model can efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred
edges, and can automatically detect the exterior and interior boundaries of
images. We incorporate the global convex segmentation method and split Bregman
technique into the proposed model, and propose a fast fixed point algorithm to
solve the global convex segmentation question[25]. Experimental results for
synthetic images and real SAR images show that the proposed fast fixed point
algorithm is robust and efficient compared with the state-of-the-art approach.

<p class="mathjax">Climate change is one of the most significant challenges we face together as
a society. Creating awareness and educating policy makers the wide-ranging
impact of climate change is an essential step towards a sustainable future.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard have shown
impressive conversational abilities and excel in a wide variety of NLP tasks.
While these models are close-source, recently alternative open-source LLMs such
as Stanford Alpaca and Vicuna have shown promising results. However, these
open-source models are not specifically tailored for climate related domain
specific information and also struggle to generate meaningful responses in
other languages such as, Arabic. To this end, we propose a light-weight Arabic
Mini-ClimateGPT that is built on an open-source LLM and is specifically
fine-tuned on a conversational-style instruction tuning curated Arabic dataset
Clima500-Instruct with over 500k instructions about climate change and
sustainability. Further, our model also utilizes a vector embedding based
retrieval mechanism during inference. We validate our proposed model through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations on climate-related queries. Our model
surpasses the baseline LLM in 88.3% of cases during ChatGPT-based evaluation.
Furthermore, our human expert evaluation reveals an 81.6% preference for our
model's responses over multiple popular open-source models. Our open-source
demos, code-base and models are available here

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art face recognition (FR) models often experience a significant
performance drop when dealing with facial images in surveillance scenarios
where images are in low quality and often corrupted with noise. Leveraging
facial characteristics, such as freckles, scars, gender, and ethnicity, becomes
highly beneficial in improving FR performance in such scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce text-guided face recognition (TGFR) to analyze the impact of
integrating facial attributes in the form of natural language descriptions. We
hypothesize that adding semantic information into the loop can significantly
improve the image understanding capability of an FR algorithm compared to other
soft biometrics. However, learning a discriminative joint embedding within the
multimodal space poses a considerable challenge due to the semantic gap in the
unaligned image-text representations, along with the complexities arising from
ambiguous and incoherent textual descriptions of the face. To address these
challenges, we introduce a face-caption alignment module (FCAM), which
incorporates cross-modal contrastive losses across multiple granularities to
maximize the mutual information between local and global features of the
face-caption pair. Within FCAM, we refine both facial and textual features for
learning aligned and discriminative features. We also design a face-caption
fusion module (FCFM) that applies fine-grained interactions and coarse-grained
associations among cross-modal features. Through extensive experiments
conducted on three face-caption datasets, proposed TGFR demonstrates remarkable
improvements, particularly on low-quality images, over existing FR models and
outperforms other related methods and benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) models are very effective
at reducing word error rates on noisy speech, but require large amounts of
transcribed AV training data. Recently, audio-visual self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches have been developed to reduce this dependence on transcribed
AV data, but these methods are quite complex and computationally expensive. In
this work, we propose replacing these expensive AV-SSL methods with a simple
and fast \textit{audio-only} SSL method, and then performing AV supervised
fine-tuning. We show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art
(SOTA) AV-SSL methods on the LRS3-TED benchmark task (within 0.5% absolute
WER), while being dramatically simpler and more efficient (12-30x faster to
pre-train). Furthermore, we show we can extend this approach to convert a SOTA
audio-only ASR model into an AV model. By doing so, we match SOTA AV-SSL
results, even though no AV data was used during pre-training.

This dataset seeks to encourage the studies of OSS-wide copy-based reuse by
providing copying activity data that captures whole-file reuse in nearly all

<p class="mathjax">A smooth T-surface can be thought of as a generalization of a surface of
revolution in such a way that the axis of rotation is not fixed at one point
but rather traces a smooth path on the base plane. Furthermore, the action, by
which the aforementioned surface is obtained does not need to be merely
rotation but any ``suitable" planar equiform transformation applied to the
points of a certain smooth profile curve. In analogy to the smooth setting, if
the axis footpoints sweep a polyline on the base plane and if the profile curve
is discretely chosen then a T-hedra (discrete T-surface) with trapezoidal faces
is obtained. The goal of this article is to reconstruct a T-hedron from an
already given point cloud of a T-surface. In doing so, a kinematic approach is
taken into account, where the algorithm at first tries to find the
aforementioned axis direction associated with the point cloud. Then the
algorithm finds a polygonal path through which the axis footpoint moves.
Finally, by properly cutting the point cloud with the planes passing through
the axis and its footpoints, it reconstructs the surface. The presented method
is demonstrated on base of examples. From an applied point of view, the
straightforwardness of the generation of these surfaces predestines them for
building and design processes. In fact, one can find many built objects
belonging to the sub-classes of T-surfaces such as \emph{surfaces of
revolution} and \emph{moulding surfaces}. Furthermore, the planarity of the
faces of the discrete version paves the way for steel/glass construction in
industry. Finally, these surfaces are also suitable for transformable designs
as they allow an isometric deformation.

<p class="mathjax">Parker and L\^e introduced random butterfly transforms (RBTs) as a
preprocessing technique to replace pivoting in dense LU factorization.
Unfortunately, their FFT-like recursive structure restricts the dimensions of
the matrix. Furthermore, on multi-node systems, efficient management of the
communication overheads restricts the matrix's distribution even more. To
remove these limitations, we have generalized the RBT to arbitrary matrix sizes
by truncating the dimensions of each layer in the transform. We expanded
Parker's theoretical analysis to generalized RBT, specifically that in exact
arithmetic, Gaussian elimination with no pivoting will succeed with probability
1 after transforming a matrix with full-depth RBTs. Furthermore, we
experimentally show that these generalized transforms improve performance over
Parker's formulation by up to 62\% while retaining the ability to replace
pivoting. This generalized RBT is available in the SLATE numerical software
library.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing adoption of measurement units in electrical power distribution
grids has enabled the deployment of data-driven and measurement-based control
schemes. Such schemes rely on measurement-based estimated models, where the
models are first estimated using raw measurements and then used in the control
problem. This work focuses on measurement-based estimation of the voltage
sensitivity coefficients which can be used for voltage control. In the existing
literature, these coefficients are estimated using regression-based methods,
which do not perform well in the case of high measurement noise. This work
proposes tackling this problem by using neural network (NN)-based estimation of
the voltage sensitivity coefficients which is robust against measurement noise.
In particular, we propose using Feedforward and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
neural networks. The trained NNs take measurements of nodal voltage magnitudes
and active and reactive powers and output the vector of voltage magnitude
sensitivity coefficients. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared
against the regression-based method for a CIGRE benchmark network.

<p class="mathjax">We present the design of a mixed reality (MR) telehealth training system that
aims to close the gap between in-person and distance training and re-training
for medical procedures. Our system uses real-time volumetric capture as a means
for communicating and relating spatial information between the non-colocated
trainee and instructor. The system's design is based on a requirements
elicitation study performed in situ, at a medical school simulation training
center. The focus is on the lightweight real-time transmission of volumetric
data - meaning the use of consumer hardware, easy and quick deployment, and
low-demand computations. We evaluate the MR system design by analyzing the
workload for the users during medical training. We compare in-person, video,
and MR training workloads. The results indicate that the overall workload for
central line placement training with MR does not increase significantly
compared to video communication. Our work shows that, when designed
strategically together with domain experts, an MR communication system can be
used effectively for complex medical procedural training without increasing the
overall workload for users significantly. Moreover, MR systems offer new
opportunities for teaching due to spatial information, hand tracking, and
augmented communication.

<p class="mathjax">In the contemporary security landscape, the incorporation of photonics has
emerged as a transformative force, unlocking a spectrum of possibilities to
enhance the resilience and effectiveness of security primitives. This
integration represents more than a mere technological augmentation; it
signifies a paradigm shift towards innovative approaches capable of delivering
security primitives with key properties for low-power systems. This not only
augments the robustness of security frameworks, but also paves the way for
novel strategies that adapt to the evolving challenges of the digital age. This
paper discusses the security layers and related services that will be
developed, modeled, and evaluated within the Horizon Europe NEUROPULS project.
These layers will exploit novel implementations for security primitives based
on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) using integrated photonics technology.
Their objective is to provide a series of services to support the secure
operation of a neuromorphic photonic accelerator for edge computing
applications.

<p class="mathjax">The functional analysis of the left atrium (LA) is important for evaluating
cardiac health and understanding diseases like atrial fibrillation. Cine MRI is
ideally placed for the detailed 3D characterisation of LA motion and
deformation, but it is lacking appropriate acquisition and analysis tools. In
this paper, we present Analysis for Left Atrial Displacements and Deformations
using unsupervIsed neural Networks, \textit{Aladdin}, to automatically and
reliably characterise regional LA deformations from high-resolution 3D Cine
MRI. The tool includes: an online few-shot segmentation network (Aladdin-S), an
online unsupervised image registration network (Aladdin-R), and a strain
calculations pipeline tailored to the LA. We create maps of LA Displacement
Vector Field (DVF) magnitude and LA principal strain values from images of 10
healthy volunteers and 8 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We
additionally create an atlas of these biomarkers using the data from the
healthy volunteers. Aladdin is able to accurately track the LA wall across the
cardiac cycle and characterize its motion and deformation. The overall DVF
magnitude and principal strain values are significantly higher in the healthy
group vs CVD patients: $2.85 \pm 1.59~mm$ and $0.09 \pm 0.05$ vs $1.96 \pm
0.74~mm$ and $0.03 \pm 0.04$, respectively. The time course of these metrics is
also different in the two groups, with a more marked active contraction phase
observed in the healthy cohort. Finally, utilizing the LA atlas allows us to
identify regional deviations from the population distribution that may indicate
focal tissue abnormalities. The proposed tool for the quantification of novel
regional LA deformation biomarkers should have important clinical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Grover's algorithm is a well-known unstructured quantum search algorithm run
on quantum computers. It constructs an oracle and calls the oracle O($\sqrt N$)
times to locate specific data out of N unsorted data. This represents a
quadratic speedup compared to the classical unstructured data sequential search
algorithm, which requires to call the oracle O(N) times. We are currently in
the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era in which quantum computers have
a limited number of qubits, short decoherence time, and low gate fidelity. It
is thus desirable to design quantum components with three good properties: (i)
a reduced number of qubits, (ii) shorter quantum depth, and (iii) fewer gates.
This paper utilizes novel quantum counters with the above-mentioned three good
properties to construct the oracle of Grover's algorithm to efficiently solve
the dominating set problem (DSP), as defined below. For a given graph G=(V, E),
a dominating set (DS) D is a subset of the vertex set V, such that every vertex
is in D or has an adjacent vertex in D. The DSP is to decide for a given graph
G and an integer k whether there exists a DS with size k. Algorithms solving
the DSP have many applications. For example, they can be applied to check
whether k routers suffice to connect all computers in a computer network. The
DSP is an NP-complete problem, indicating that no classical algorithm exists to
solve the DSP with polynomial time complexity in the worst case. Therefore,
using quantum algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, to exploit the potent
computational capabilities of quantum computers to solve the DSP is highly
promising. We execute the whole quantum circuit of Grover's algorithm using
novel quantum counters through the IBM Quantum Lab service to validate that the
circuit can solve the DSP efficiently and correctly.

<p class="mathjax">Widely used alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on the ability of humans to supervise model behavior -
for example, to evaluate whether a model faithfully followed instructions or
generated safe outputs. However, future superhuman models will behave in
complex ways too difficult for humans to reliably evaluate; humans will only be
able to weakly supervise superhuman models. We study an analogy to this
problem: can weak model supervision elicit the full capabilities of a much
stronger model? We test this using a range of pretrained language models in the
GPT-4 family on natural language processing (NLP), chess, and reward modeling
tasks. We find that when we naively finetune strong pretrained models on labels
generated by a weak model, they consistently perform better than their weak
supervisors, a phenomenon we call weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
are still far from recovering the full capabilities of strong models with naive
finetuning alone, suggesting that techniques like RLHF may scale poorly to
superhuman models without further work. We find that simple methods can often
significantly improve weak-to-strong generalization: for example, when
finetuning GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level supervisor and an auxiliary confidence
loss, we can recover close to GPT-3.5-level performance on NLP tasks. Our
results suggest that it is feasible to make empirical progress today on a
fundamental challenge of aligning superhuman models.

<p class="mathjax">Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are useful in temporal sequence tasks.
However, training RNNs involves dense matrix multiplications which require
hardware that can support a large number of arithmetic operations and memory
accesses. Implementing online training of RNNs on the edge calls for optimized
algorithms for an efficient deployment on hardware. Inspired by the spiking
neuron model, the Delta RNN exploits temporal sparsity during inference by
skipping over the update of hidden states from those inactivated neurons whose
change of activation across two timesteps is below a defined threshold. This
work describes a training algorithm for Delta RNNs that exploits temporal
sparsity in the backward propagation phase to reduce computational requirements
for training on the edge. Due to the symmetric computation graphs of forward
and backward propagation during training, the gradient computation of
inactivated neurons can be skipped. Results show a reduction of $\sim$80% in
matrix operations for training a 56k parameter Delta LSTM on the Fluent Speech
Commands dataset with negligible accuracy loss. Logic simulations of a hardware
accelerator designed for the training algorithm show 2-10X speedup in matrix
computations for an activation sparsity range of 50%-90%. Additionally, we show
that the proposed Delta RNN training will be useful for online incremental
learning on edge devices with limited computing resources.

<p class="mathjax">Even though reinforcement-learning-based algorithms achieved superhuman
performance in many domains, the field of robotics poses significant challenges
as the state and action spaces are continuous, and the reward function is
predominantly sparse. In this work, we propose: 1) HiER: highlight experience
replay that creates a secondary replay buffer for the most relevant
experiences, 2) E2H-ISE: an easy2hard data collection curriculum-learning
method based on controlling the entropy of the initial state-goal distribution
and with it, indirectly, the task difficulty, and 3) HiER+: the combination of
HiER and E2H-ISE. They can be applied with or without the techniques of
hindsight experience replay (HER) and prioritized experience replay (PER).
While both HiER and E2H-ISE surpass the baselines, HiER+ further improves the
results and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the push, slide,
and pick-and-place robotic manipulation tasks. Our implementation and further
media materials are available on the project site.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional research ethics has mainly and rightly been focused on making
sure that participants are treated safely, justly, and ethically, to avoid the
violation of their rights or putting participants in harm's way. Information
integrity research within CSCW has also correspondingly mainly focused on these
issues, and the focus of internet research ethics has primarily focused on
increasing protections of participant data. However, as branches of internet
research focus on more fraught contexts such as information integrity and
problematic information, more explicit consideration of other ethical frames
and subjects is warranted. In this workshop paper, we argue that researcher
protections should be more explicitly considered and acknowledged in these
studies, and should be considered alongside more standard ethical
considerations for participants and for broader society.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving systems are increasingly popular in today's technological
landscape, where vehicles with partial automation have already been widely
available on the market, and the full automation era with ``driverless''
capabilities is near the horizon. However, accurately understanding humans'
commands, particularly for autonomous vehicles that have only passengers
instead of drivers, and achieving a high level of personalization remain
challenging tasks in the development of autonomous driving systems. In this
paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework Talk-to-Drive
(Talk2Drive) to process verbal commands from humans and make autonomous driving
decisions with contextual information, satisfying their personalized
preferences for safety, efficiency, and comfort. First, a speech recognition
module is developed for Talk2Drive to interpret verbal inputs from humans to
textual instructions, which are then sent to LLMs for reasoning. Then,
appropriate commands for the Electrical Control Unit (ECU) are generated,
achieving a 100\% success rate in executing codes. Real-world experiments show
that our framework can substantially reduce the takeover rate for a diverse
range of drivers by up to 90.1\%. To the best of our knowledge, Talk2Drive
marks the first instance of employing an LLM-based system in a real-world
autonomous driving environment.

<p class="mathjax">High-fidelity 3D assets with materials composed of fibers (including hair),
complex layered material shaders, or fine scattering geometry are ubiquitous in
high-end realistic rendering applications. Rendering such models is
computationally expensive due to heavy shaders and long scattering paths.
Moreover, implementing the shading and scattering models is non-trivial and has
to be done not only in the 3D content authoring software (which is necessarily
complex), but also in all downstream rendering solutions. For example, web and
mobile viewers for complex 3D assets are desirable, but frequently cannot
support the full shading complexity allowed by the authoring application. Our
goal is to design a neural representation for 3D assets with complex shading
that supports full relightability and full integration into existing renderers.
We provide an end-to-end shading solution at the first intersection of a ray
with the underlying geometry. All shading and scattering is precomputed and
included in the neural asset; no multiple scattering paths need to be traced,
and no complex shading models need to be implemented to render our assets,
beyond a single neural architecture. We combine an MLP decoder with a feature
grid. Shading consists of querying a feature vector, followed by an MLP
evaluation producing the final reflectance value. Our method provides
high-fidelity shading, close to the ground-truth Monte Carlo estimate even at
close-up views. We believe our neural assets could be used in practical
renderers, providing significant speed-ups and simplifying renderer
implementations.

<p class="mathjax">The log-rank conjecture, a longstanding problem in communication complexity,
has persistently eluded resolution for decades. Consequently, some recent
efforts have focused on potential approaches for establishing the conjecture in
the special case of XOR functions, where the communication matrix is lifted
from a boolean function, and the rank of the matrix equals the Fourier sparsity
of the function, which is the number of its nonzero Fourier coefficients.
<br />In this note, we refute two conjectures. The first has origins in Montanaro
and Osborne (arXiv'09) and is considered in Tsang et al. (FOCS'13), and the
second one is due to Mande and Sanyal (FSTTCS'20). These conjectures were
proposed in order to improve the best-known bound of Lovett (STOC'14) regarding
the log-rank conjecture in the special case of XOR functions. Both conjectures
speculate that the set of nonzero Fourier coefficients of the boolean function
has some strong additive structure. We refute these conjectures by constructing
two specific boolean functions tailored to each.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the potential of a multidisciplinary approach to testing
and aligning artificial general intelligence (AGI) and LLMs. Due to the rapid
development and wide application of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment,
controllability, and predictability of these models have become important
research topics. This study investigates an innovative simulation-based

real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital

demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible
AGI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform
where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby
mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the
LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While
this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and
limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social
dynamics. This research endeavors to contribute to the development and
refinement of AGI, emphasizing the integration of social, ethical, and
theoretical dimensions for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Biased enhanced sampling methods utilizing collective variables (CVs) are
powerful tools for sampling conformational ensembles. Due to high intrinsic
dimensions, efficiently generating conformational ensembles for complex systems
requires enhanced sampling on high-dimensional free energy surfaces. While
methods like temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD) can adopt many
CVs in a simulation, unbiasing the simulation requires accurate modeling of a
high-dimensional CV probability distribution, which is challenging for
traditional density estimation techniques. Here we propose an unbiasing method
based on the score-based diffusion model, a deep generative learning method
that excels in density estimation across complex data landscapes. We test the
score-based diffusion unbiasing method on TAMD simulations. The results
demonstrate that this unbiasing approach significantly outperforms traditional
unbiasing methods, and can generate accurate unbiased conformational ensembles
for simulations with a number of CVs higher than usual ranges.

<p class="mathjax">Exploratory visual analysis (EVA) is an essential stage of the data science
pipeline, where users often lack clear analysis goals at the start and
iteratively refine them as they learn more about their data. Accurate models of
users' exploration behavior are becoming increasingly vital to developing
responsive and personalized tools for exploratory visual analysis. Yet we
observe a discrepancy between the static view of human exploration behavior
adopted by many computational models versus the dynamic nature of EVA. In this
paper, we explore potential parallels between the evolution of users'
interactions with visualization tools during data exploration and assumptions
made in popular online learning techniques. Through a series of empirical
analyses, we seek to answer the question: how might users' exploration behavior
evolve in response to what they have learned from the data during EVA? We
present our findings and discuss their implications for the future of user
modeling for system design.

<p class="mathjax">Compressing a predefined deep neural network (DNN) into a compact sub-network
with competitive performance is crucial in the efficient machine learning
realm. This topic spans various techniques, from structured pruning to neural
architecture search, encompassing both pruning and erasing operators
perspectives. Despite advancements, existing methods suffers from complex,
multi-stage processes that demand substantial engineering and domain knowledge,
limiting their broader applications. We introduce the third-generation
Only-Train-Once (OTOv3), which first automatically trains and compresses a
general DNN through pruning and erasing operations, creating a compact and
competitive sub-network without the need of fine-tuning. OTOv3 simplifies and
automates the training and compression process, minimizes the engineering
efforts required from users. It offers key technological advancements: (i)
automatic search space construction for general DNNs based on dependency graph
analysis; (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) and its enhanced
version with hierarchical search (H2SPG) to reliably solve (hierarchical)
structured sparsity problems and ensure sub-network validity; and (iii)
automated sub-network construction using solutions from DHSPG/H2SPG and
dependency graphs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of OTOv3
across various benchmarks in structured pruning and neural architecture search.
OTOv3 produces sub-networks that match or exceed the state-of-the-arts. The
source code will be available at https://github.com/tianyic/only_train_once.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies
has spurred investigations to optimize dense urban traffic. This paper
considers advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued
to drivers, thus blending the CAV and the human driver. Due to the complexity
of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have resorted to
leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL). Advisory autonomy is formalized as
zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold duration from 0.1 to 40
seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher frequency tasks on CAVs,
a direct application of deep RL fails to be generalized to advisory autonomy
tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select
source tasks, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the
full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the
performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse
mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks
than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory
autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization.

enabling a TM5-900 robotic arm to independently play the four-person card game
Chinese poker. The robot uses a custom sucker mechanism to pick up and play
cards. An object detection model based on YOLOv5 is utilized to recognize the
suit and number of 13 cards dealt to the robot. A greedy algorithm is developed
to divide the 13 cards into optimal hands of 3, 5, and 5 cards to play.
Experiments demonstrate that the robot can successfully obtain the cards,
identify them using computer vision, strategically select hands to play using

<p class="mathjax">We propose multiple techniques for automatic document order generation for
(1) curriculum development and for (2) creation of optimal reading order for
use in learning, training, and other content-sequencing applications. Such
techniques could potentially be used to improve comprehension, identify areas
that need expounding, generate curricula, and improve search engine results. We
advance two main techniques: The first uses document similarities through
various methods. The second uses entropy against the backdrop of topics
generated through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In addition, we try the
same methods on the summarized documents and compare them against the results
obtained using the complete documents. Our results showed that while the
document orders for our control document sets (biographies, novels, and
Wikipedia articles) could not be predicted using our methods, our test
documents (textbooks, courses, journal papers, dissertations) provided more
reliability. We also demonstrated that summarized documents were good stand-ins
for the complete documents for the purposes of ordering.

<p class="mathjax">For many streaming automatic speech recognition tasks, it is important to
provide timely intermediate streaming results, while refining a high quality
final result. This can be done using a multi-stage architecture, where a small
left-context only model creates streaming results and a larger left- and
right-context model produces a final result at the end. While this
significantly improves the quality of the final results without compromising
the streaming emission latency of the system, streaming results do not benefit
from the quality improvements. Here, we propose using a text manipulation
algorithm that merges the streaming outputs of both models. We improve the
quality of streaming results by around 10%, without altering the final results.
Our approach introduces no additional latency and reduces flickering. It is
also lightweight, does not require retraining the model, and it can be applied
to a wide variety of multi-stage architectures.

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory prediction is an important task that involves modeling the
indeterminate nature of traffic actors to forecast future trajectories given
the observed trajectory sequences. However, current methods confine themselves
to presumed data manifolds, assuming that trajectories strictly adhere to these
manifolds, resulting in overly simplified predictions. To this end, we propose
a novel approach called SSWNP (Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction). In
our approach, we first create clean and noise-augmented views of past observed
trajectories across the spatial domain of waypoints. We then compel the
trajectory prediction model to maintain spatial consistency between predictions
from these two views, in addition to the trajectory prediction task.
Introducing the noise-augmented view mitigates the model's reliance on a narrow
interpretation of the data manifold, enabling it to learn more plausible and
diverse representations. We also predict the noise present in the two views of
past observed trajectories as an auxiliary self-supervised task, enhancing the
model's understanding of the underlying representation and future predictions.
Empirical evidence demonstrates that the incorporation of SSWNP into the model
learning process significantly improves performance, even in noisy
environments, when compared to baseline methods. Our approach can complement
existing trajectory prediction methods. To showcase the effectiveness of our
approach, we conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: NBA Sports VU,
ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++, with experimental results highlighting the substantial
improvement achieved in trajectory prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to explore their environments in
order to learn optimal policies. In many environments and tasks, safety is of
critical importance. The widespread use of simulators offers a number of
advantages, including safe exploration which will be inevitable in cases when
RL systems need to be trained directly in the physical environment (e.g. in
human-robot interaction). The popular Safety Gym library offers three mobile
agent types that can learn goal-directed tasks while considering various safety
constraints. In this paper, we extend the applicability of safe RL algorithms
by creating a customized environment with Panda robotic arm where Safety Gym
algorithms can be tested. We performed pilot experiments with the popular PPO
algorithm comparing the baseline with the constrained version and show that the
constrained version is able to learn the equally good policy while better
complying with safety constraints and taking longer training time as expected.

progression, clinical notes are characterized by high levels of duplication and
information redundancy. In general domain text, it has been shown that
deduplication does not harm language model (LM) pretraining, thus helping
reduce the training cost. Although large LMs have proven to learn medical
knowledge, they still require specialized domain adaptation for improved
downstream clinical tasks. By leveraging large real-world clinical corpora, we
first provided a fine-grained characterization of duplicates stemming from
common writing practices and clinical relevancy. Second, we demonstrated that

<p class="mathjax">Many multivariate time series anomaly detection frameworks have been proposed
and widely applied. However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic
relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring
the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection
performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy
Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes
transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying
causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional
networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the
causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time
series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median
absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly
identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 15% average improvement
based on three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the focus on anomaly detection and localization in
industrial inspection tasks has intensified. While existing studies have
demonstrated impressive outcomes, they often rely heavily on extensive training
datasets or robust features extracted from pre-trained models trained on
diverse datasets like ImageNet. In this work, we propose a novel framework
leveraging the visual-linguistic CLIP model to adeptly train a backbone model
tailored to the manufacturing domain. Our approach concurrently considers
visual and text-aligned embedding spaces for normal and abnormal conditions.
The resulting pre-trained backbone markedly enhances performance in industrial
downstream tasks, particularly in anomaly detection and localization. Notably,
this improvement is substantiated through experiments conducted on multiple
datasets such as MVTecAD, BTAD, and KSDD2. Furthermore, using our pre-trained
backbone weights allows previous works to achieve superior performance in
few-shot scenarios with less training data. The proposed anomaly backbone
provides a foundation model for more precise anomaly detection and
localization.

<p class="mathjax">In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks on a
monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as
many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that can
generalize to all types of attacks, including unseen ones, is not realistic
because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and
comprises various unique attacks used by many attackers. The defense system
needs to upgrade itself by utilizing few-shot defense feedback and efficient
memory. Therefore, we propose the first continual adversarial defense (CAD)
framework that adapts to any attacks in a dynamic scenario, where various
attacks emerge stage by stage. In practice, CAD is modeled under four
principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic
forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4)
high accuracy on both clean and adversarial images. We leverage cutting-edge
continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to
qualify the principles. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100
validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of 10 modern
adversarial attacks and significant improvements over 10 baseline methods. In
particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal feedback and a low
cost of defense failure, while maintaining good performance against old
attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense
adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks.

<p class="mathjax">While recent test-time adaptations exhibit efficacy by adjusting batch
normalization to narrow domain disparities, their effectiveness diminishes with
realistic mini-batches due to inaccurate target estimation. As previous
attempts merely introduce source statistics to mitigate this issue, the
fundamental problem of inaccurate target estimation still persists, leaving the
intrinsic test-time domain shifts unresolved. This paper delves into the
problem of mini-batch degradation. By unraveling batch normalization, we
discover that the inexact target statistics largely stem from the substantially
reduced class diversity in batch. Drawing upon this insight, we introduce a
straightforward tool, Test-time Exponential Moving Average (TEMA), to bridge
the class diversity gap between training and testing batches. Importantly, our
TEMA adaptively extends the scope of typical methods beyond the current batch
to incorporate a diverse set of class information, which in turn boosts an
accurate target estimation. Built upon this foundation, we further design a
novel layer-wise rectification strategy to consistently promote test-time
performance. Our proposed method enjoys a unique advantage as it requires
neither training nor tuning parameters, offering a truly hassle-free solution.
It significantly enhances model robustness against shifted domains and
maintains resilience in diverse real-world scenarios with various batch sizes,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several major benchmarks. Code is

<p class="mathjax">Radio signal recognition is a crucial function in electronic warfare. Precise
identification and localisation of radar pulse activities are required by
electronic warfare systems to produce effective countermeasures. Despite the
importance of these tasks, deep learning-based radar pulse activity recognition
methods have remained largely underexplored. While deep learning for radar
modulation recognition has been explored previously, classification tasks are
generally limited to short and non-interleaved IQ signals, limiting their
applicability to military applications. To address this gap, we introduce an
end-to-end multi-stage learning approach to detect and localise pulse
activities of interleaved radar signals across an extended time horizon. We
propose a simple, yet highly effective multi-stage architecture for
incrementally predicting fine-grained segmentation masks that localise radar
pulse activities across multiple channels. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach against several reference models on a novel radar dataset, while
also providing a first-of-its-kind benchmark for radar pulse activity
segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">To reduce the computation cost and the energy consumption in large language
models (LLM), skimming-based acceleration dynamically drops unimportant tokens
of the input sequence progressively along layers of the LLM while preserving
the tokens of semantic importance. However, our work for the first time reveals
the acceleration may be vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this
paper, we propose No-Skim, a general framework to help the owners of
skimming-based LLM to understand and measure the robustness of their
acceleration scheme. Specifically, our framework searches minimal and
unnoticeable perturbations at character-level and token-level to generate
adversarial inputs that sufficiently increase the remaining token ratio, thus
increasing the computation cost and energy consumption. We systematically
evaluate the vulnerability of the skimming acceleration in various LLM
architectures including BERT and RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark. In the worst
case, the perturbation found by No-Skim substantially increases the running
cost of LLM by over 145% on average. Moreover, No-Skim extends the evaluation
framework to various scenarios, making the evaluation conductible with

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), has grabbed significant attention in the field of computer
vision. This project focuses on the application of GAN in image deblurring with
the aim of generating clearer images from blurry inputs caused by factors such
as motion blur. However, traditional image restoration techniques have
limitations in handling complex blurring patterns. Hence, a GAN-based framework
is proposed as a solution to generate high-quality deblurred images. The
project defines a GAN model in Tensorflow and trains it with GoPRO dataset. The
Generator will intake blur images directly to create fake images to convince
the Discriminator which will receive clear images at the same time and
distinguish between the real image and the fake image. After obtaining the
trained parameters, the model was used to deblur motion-blur images taken in
daily life as well as testing set for validation. The result shows that the
pretrained network of GAN can obtain sharper pixels in image, achieving an
average of 29.3 Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and 0.72 Structural
Similarity Assessment (SSIM). This help to effectively address the challenges
posed by image blurring, leading to the generation of visually pleasing and
sharp images. By exploiting the adversarial learning framework, the proposed
approach enhances the potential for real-world applications in image
restoration.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Structure Learning (GSL) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
analysis of graph-unknown non-Euclidean data across a wide range of domains.
However, constructing an end-to-end graph structure learning model poses a
challenge due to the impediment of gradient flow caused by the nearest neighbor
sampling strategy. In this paper, we construct a differential graph structure
learning model by replacing the non-differentiable nearest neighbor sampling
with a differentiable sampling using the reparameterization trick. Under this
framework, we argue that the act of sampling \mbox{nearest} neighbors may not
invariably be essential, particularly in instances where node features exhibit
a significant degree of similarity. To alleviate this issue, the bell-shaped
Gaussian Similarity (GauSim) modeling is proposed to sample non-nearest
neighbors. To adaptively model the similarity, we further propose Neural
Gaussian Similarity (NeuralGauSim) with learnable parameters featuring flexible

the large-scale graph to the transition graph to significantly reduce the
complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

<p class="mathjax">Motion prediction is a crucial task in autonomous driving, and one of its
major challenges lands in the multimodality of future behaviors. Many
successful works have utilized mixture models which require identification of
positive mixture components, and correspondingly fall into two main lines:
prediction-based and anchor-based matching. The prediction clustering
phenomenon in prediction-based matching makes it difficult to pick
representative trajectories for downstream tasks, while the anchor-based
matching suffers from a limited regression capability. In this paper, we
introduce a novel paradigm, named Evolving and Distinct Anchors (EDA), to
define the positive and negative components for multimodal motion prediction
based on mixture models. We enable anchors to evolve and redistribute
themselves under specific scenes for an enlarged regression capacity.
Furthermore, we select distinct anchors before matching them with the ground
truth, which results in impressive scoring performance. Our approach enhances
all metrics compared to the baseline MTR, particularly with a notable relative
reduction of 13.5% in Miss Rate, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Code is available at
https://github.com/Longzhong-Lin/EDA.

<p class="mathjax">Graph-based signal processing techniques have become essential for handling
data in non-Euclidean spaces. However, there is a growing awareness that these
graph models might need to be expanded into `higher-order' domains to
effectively represent the complex relations found in high-dimensional data.
Such higher-order domains are typically modeled either as hypergraphs, or as
simplicial, cubical or other cell complexes. In this context, cell complexes
are often seen as a subclass of hypergraphs with additional algebraic structure
that can be exploited, e.g., to develop a spectral theory. In this article, we
promote an alternative perspective. We argue that hypergraphs and cell
complexes emphasize \emph{different} types of relations, which may have
different utility depending on the application context. Whereas hypergraphs are
effective in modeling set-type, multi-body relations between entities, cell
complexes provide an effective means to model hierarchical,
interior-to-boundary type relations. We discuss the relative advantages of
these two choices and elaborate on the previously introduced concept of a
combinatorial complex that enables co-existing set-type and hierarchical
relations. Finally, we provide a brief numerical experiment to demonstrate that
this modelling flexibility can be advantageous in learning tasks.

<p class="mathjax">There has been significant attention devoted to the effectiveness of various
domains, such as semi-supervised learning, contrastive learning, and
meta-learning, in enhancing the performance of methods for noisy label learning
(NLL) tasks. However, most existing methods still depend on prior assumptions
regarding clean samples amidst different sources of noise (\eg, a pre-defined
drop rate or a small subset of clean samples). In this paper, we propose a
simple yet powerful idea called \textbf{NPN}, which revolutionizes
\textbf{N}oisy label learning by integrating \textbf{P}artial label learning
(PLL) and \textbf{N}egative learning (NL). Toward this goal, we initially
decompose the given label space adaptively into the candidate and complementary
labels, thereby establishing the conditions for PLL and NL. We propose two
adaptive data-driven paradigms of label disambiguation for PLL: hard
disambiguation and soft disambiguation. Furthermore, we generate reliable
complementary labels using all non-candidate labels for NL to enhance model
robustness through indirect supervision. To maintain label reliability during
the later stage of model training, we introduce a consistency regularization
term that encourages agreement between the outputs of multiple augmentations.
Experiments conducted on both synthetically corrupted and real-world noisy
datasets demonstrate the superiority of NPN compared to other state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods. The source code has been made available at

<p class="mathjax">Text-video retrieval, a prominent sub-field within the broader domain of
multimedia content management, has witnessed remarkable growth and innovation
over the past decade. However, existing methods assume the video scenes are
consistent and the description annotators are unbiased. These limitations fail
to align with fluid real-world scenarios, and descriptions can be influenced by
annotator biases, diverse writing styles, and varying textual perspectives. To
overcome the aforementioned problems, we introduce WAVER, a cross-domain
knowledge distillation mechanism designed to tackle the challenge of handling
writing-style agnostics. WAVER capitalizes on the open-vocabulary properties
inherent in pre-trained vision-language models and employs an implicit
knowledge distillation approach to transfer text-based knowledge from a teacher
model to a vision-based student. Empirical studies conducted across four
standard benchmark datasets, encompassing various settings, provide compelling
evidence that \WAVER can achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-video
retrieval tasks while handling writing-style variations.

<p class="mathjax">Image reconstruction from radio-frequency data is pivotal in ultrafast plane
wave ultrasound imaging. Unlike the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) technique,
which relies on somewhat imprecise assumptions, deep learning-based methods
perform image reconstruction by training on paired data, leading to a notable
enhancement in image quality. Nevertheless, these strategies often exhibit
limited generalization capabilities. Recently, denoising diffusion models have
become the preferred paradigm for image reconstruction tasks. However, their
reliance on an iterative sampling procedure results in prolonged generation
time. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling framework that concurrently
enforces data consistency of ultrasound signals and data-driven priors. By
leveraging the advanced diffusion model, the generation of high-quality images
is substantially expedited. Experimental evaluations on an in-vivo dataset
indicate that our approach with a single plane wave surpasses DAS with spatial
coherent compounding of 75 plane waves.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we focus on multimedia recommender systems using graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) where the multimodal features as well as
user-item interactions are employed together. Our study aims to exploit
multimodal features more effectively in order to accurately capture users'
preferences for items. To this end, we point out following two limitations of
existing GCN-based multimedia recommender systems: (L1) although multimodal
features of interacted items by a user can reveal her preferences on items,
existing methods utilize GCN designed to focus only on capturing collaborative
signals, resulting in insufficient reflection of the multimodal features in the
final user/item embeddings; (L2) although a user decides whether to prefer the
target item by considering its multimodal features, existing methods represent
her as only a single embedding regardless of the target item's multimodal
features and then utilize her embedding to predict her preference for the
target item. To address the above issues, we propose a novel multimedia
recommender system, named MONET, composed of following two core ideas:
modality-embracing GCN (MeGCN) and target-aware attention. Through extensive
experiments using four real-world datasets, we demonstrate i) the significant
superiority of MONET over seven state-of-the-art competitors (up to 30.32%
higher accuracy in terms of recall@20, compared to the best competitor) and ii)
the effectiveness of the two core ideas in MONET. All MONET codes are available

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) has immense potential in time series prediction,
but most explainable tools have limited capabilities in providing a systematic
understanding of important features over time. These tools typically rely on
evaluating a single time point, overlook the time ordering of inputs, and
neglect the time-sensitive nature of time series applications. These factors
make it difficult for users, particularly those without domain knowledge, to
comprehend AI model decisions and obtain meaningful explanations. We propose
CGS-Mask, a post-hoc and model-agnostic cellular genetic strip mask-based
saliency approach to address these challenges. CGS-Mask uses consecutive time
steps as a cohesive entity to evaluate the impact of features on the final
prediction, providing binary and sustained feature importance scores over time.
Our algorithm optimizes the mask population iteratively to obtain the optimal
mask in a reasonable time. We evaluated CGS-Mask on synthetic and real-world
datasets, and it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in elucidating the
importance of features over time. According to our pilot user study via a
questionnaire survey, CGS-Mask is the most effective approach in presenting
easily understandable time series prediction results, enabling users to
comprehend the decision-making process of AI models with ease.

<p class="mathjax">Reconstruction of ultrasound (US) images from radio-frequency data can be
conceptualized as a linear inverse problem. Traditional deep learning
approaches, which aim to improve the quality of US images by directly learning
priors, often encounter challenges in generalization. Recently, diffusion-based
generative models have received significant attention within the research
community due to their robust performance in image reconstruction tasks.
However, a limitation of these models is their inherent low speed in generating
image samples from pure Gaussian noise progressively. In this study, we exploit
the inherent similarity between the US images reconstructed from a single plane
wave (PW) and PW compounding PWC). We hypothesize that a single PW can take a
shortcut to reach the diffusion trajectory of PWC, removing the need to begin
with Gaussian noise. By employing an advanced diffusion model, we demonstrate
its effectiveness in US image reconstruction, achieving a substantial reduction
in sampling steps. In-vivo experimental results indicate that our approach can
reduce sampling steps by 60%, while preserving comparable performance metrics
with the conventional diffusion model.

<p class="mathjax">Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a prevalent orthopedic condition in clinical
practice. Inertial measurement unit sensors (IMUs) are an effective tool for
monitoring and assessing gait impairment in patients with lumbar disc
herniation (LDH). However, the current gait assessment of LDH focuses solely on
single-source acceleration signal data, without considering the diversity of
sensor data. It also overlooks the individual differences in motor function
deterioration between the healthy and affected lower limbs in patients with
LDH. To address this issue, we developed an LDH gait feature model that relies
on multi-source adaptive Kalman data fusion of acceleration and angular
velocity. We utilized an adaptive Kalman data fusion algorithm for acceleration
and angular velocity to estimate the attitude angle and segment the gait phase.
Two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) were used to analyze the gait
characteristics of patients with lumbar disc issues and healthy individuals.
This analysis included 12 gait characteristics, such as gait spatiotemporal
parameters, kinematic parameters, and expansibility index numbers. Statistical
methods were employed to analyze the characteristic model and confirm the
biological differences between the healthy affected side of LDH and healthy
subjects. Finally, a classifier based on feature engineering was utilized to
classify the gait patterns of the affected side of patients with lumbar disc
disease and healthy subjects. This approach achieved a classification accuracy
of 95.50%, enhancing the recognition of LDH and healthy gait patterns. It also
provided effective gait feature sets and methods for assessing LDH clinically.

performance) or latency has received limited attention. Existing works on
latency-based attack have focused mainly on object detection, i.e., a component
in camera-based AD perception, overlooking the entire camera-based AD
perception, which hinders them to achieve effective system-level effects, such
as vehicle crashes. In this paper, we propose SlowTrack, a novel framework for
generating adversarial attacks to increase the execution time of camera-based
AD perception. We propose a novel two-stage attack strategy along with the
three new loss function designs. Our evaluation is conducted on four popular
camera-based AD perception pipelines, and the results demonstrate that
SlowTrack significantly outperforms existing latency-based attacks while
maintaining comparable imperceptibility levels. Furthermore, we perform the
evaluation on Baidu Apollo, an industry-grade full-stack AD system, and LGSVL,
a production-grade AD simulator, with two scenarios to compare the system-level
effects of SlowTrack and existing attacks. Our evaluation results show that the
system-level effects can be significantly improved, i.e., the vehicle crash
rate of SlowTrack is around 95% on average while existing works only have
around 30%.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel multi-objective control framework for linear
time-invariant systems in which performance and robustness can be achieved in a
complementary way instead of trade-off. In particular, a state-space solution
is first established for a new stabilizing control structure consisting of two
independently designed controllers coordinated with a Youla-type operator ${\bm
Q}$. It is then shown by performance analysis that these two independently
designed controllers operate in a naturally complementary way for a tracking
control system, due to coordination function of ${\bm Q}$ driven by the
residual signal of a Luenberger observer. Moreover, it is pointed out that
${\bm Q}$ could be further optimized with an additional gain factor to achieve
improved performance, through a data-driven methodology for a measured cost
function.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents DriveTrack, a new benchmark and data generation framework
for long-range keypoint tracking in real-world videos. DriveTrack is motivated
by the observation that the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers depends
strongly on visual attributes around the selected keypoints, such as texture
and lighting. The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in
real-world videos, but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to
a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to
automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release
a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video, which
is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on
par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases
for point tracking in real-world videos. First, we show that fine-tuning
keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to
7%. Second, we analyze the sensitivity of trackers to visual artifacts in real
scenes and motivate the idea of running assistive keypoint selectors alongside
trackers.

<p class="mathjax">The optical flow guidance strategy is ideal for obtaining motion information
of objects in the video. It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks.
However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on
optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow
estimation fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by
the optical flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural
form. This paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)
architecture, dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for
zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of
GNNs in capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues
(\ie, optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the
neighbors of target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder
with message aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion
and appearance features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is
designed for hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed
multi-modal contexts to achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves
state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16,
YouTube-Objects, Long-Videos and DAVIS-17). Code and pre-trained model can be
found at \url{https://github.com/NUST-Machine-Intelligence-Laboratory/HGPU}.

<p class="mathjax">This report describes the solution that secured the first place in the "View
Synthesis Challenge for Human Heads (VSCHH)" at the ICCV 2023 workshop. Given
the sparse view images of human heads, the objective of this challenge is to
synthesize images from novel viewpoints. Due to the complexity of textures on
the face and the impact of lighting, the baseline method TensoRF yields results
with significant artifacts, seriously affecting facial reconstruction. To
address this issue, we propose TI-Face, which improves facial reconstruction
through tensorial radiance fields (T-Face) and implicit surfaces (I-Face),
respectively. Specifically, we employ an SAM-based approach to obtain the
foreground mask, thereby filtering out intense lighting in the background.
Additionally, we design mask-based constraints and sparsity constraints to
eliminate rendering artifacts effectively. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed improvements and superior performance of our
method on face reconstruction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/RuijieZhu94/TI-Face.

<p class="mathjax">A core function of intelligence is grounding, which is the process of
connecting the natural language and abstract knowledge to the internal
representation of the real world in an intelligent being, e.g., a human. Human
cognition is grounded in our sensorimotor experiences in the external world and
subjective feelings in our internal world. We use languages to communicate with
each other and the languages are grounded on our shared sensorimotor
experiences and feelings. Without this shard grounding, it is impossible for us
to understand each other because all natural languages are highly abstract and
are only able to describe a tiny portion of what has happened or is happening
in the real world. Although grounding at high or abstract levels has been
studied in different fields and applications, to our knowledge, limited
systematic work at fine-grained levels has been done. With the rapid progress
of large language models (LLMs), it is imperative that we have a sound
understanding of grounding in order to move to the next level of intelligence.
It is also believed that grounding is necessary for Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). This paper makes an attempt to systematically study this
problem.

<p class="mathjax">The introduction of large, foundational models to computer vision has led to
drastically improved performance on the task of semantic segmentation. However,
these existing methods exhibit a large performance drop when testing on images
degraded by weather conditions such as rain, fog, or snow. We introduce a
general paired-training method that can be applied to all current foundational
model architectures that leads to improved performance on images in adverse
weather conditions. To this end, we create the WeatherProof Dataset, the first
semantic segmentation dataset with accurate clear and adverse weather image
pairs, which not only enables our new training paradigm, but also improves the
evaluation of the performance gap between clear and degraded segmentation. We
find that training on these paired clear and adverse weather frames which share
an underlying scene results in improved performance on adverse weather data.
With this knowledge, we propose a training pipeline which accentuates the
advantages of paired-data training using consistency losses and language
guidance, which leads to performance improvements by up to 18.4% as compared to
standard training procedures.

<p class="mathjax">Hard lattice problems are predominant in constructing post-quantum
cryptosystems. However, we need to continue developing post-quantum
cryptosystems based on other quantum hard problems to prevent a complete
collapse of post-quantum cryptography due to a sudden breakthrough in solving
hard lattice problems. Solving large multivariate quadratic systems is one such
quantum hard problem.
<br />Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar is a signature scheme based on the hardness of solving
multivariate equations. In this work, we present a post-quantum digital
signature algorithm VDOO (Vinegar-Diagonal-Oil-Oil) based on solving
multivariate equations. We introduce a new layer called the diagonal layer over
the oil-vinegar-based signature scheme Rainbow. This layer helps to improve the
security of our scheme without increasing the parameters considerably. Due to
this modification, the complexity of the main computational bottleneck of
multivariate quadratic systems i.e. the Gaussian elimination reduces
significantly. Thus making our scheme one of the fastest multivariate quadratic
signature schemes. Further, we show that our carefully chosen parameters can
resist all existing state-of-the-art attacks. The signature sizes of our scheme
for the National Institute of Standards and Technology's security level of I,
III, and V are 96, 226, and 316 bytes, respectively. This is the smallest
signature size among all known post-quantum signature schemes of similar
security.

<p class="mathjax">We present AEGIS-Net, a novel indoor place recognition model that takes in
RGB point clouds and generates global place descriptors by aggregating
lower-level color, geometry features and higher-level implicit semantic
features. However, rather than simple feature concatenation, self-attention
modules are employed to select the most important local features that best
describe an indoor place. Our AEGIS-Net is made of a semantic encoder, a
semantic decoder and an attention-guided feature embedding. The model is
trained in a 2-stage process with the first stage focusing on an auxiliary
semantic segmentation task and the second one on the place recognition task. We
evaluate our AEGIS-Net on the ScanNetPR dataset and compare its performance
with a pre-deep-learning feature-based method and five state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based methods. Our AEGIS-Net achieves exceptional performance and
outperforms all six methods.

<p class="mathjax">Learning to collaborate has witnessed significant progress in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, promoting coordination among agents and
enhancing exploration capabilities remain challenges. In multi-agent
environments, interactions between agents are limited in specific situations.
Effective collaboration between agents thus requires a nuanced understanding of
when and how agents' actions influence others. To this end, in this paper, we
propose a novel MARL algorithm named Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based
Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SCIC), which incorporates a
novel Intrinsic reward mechanism based on a new cooperation criterion measured
by situation-dependent causal influence among agents. Our approach aims to
detect inter-agent causal influences in specific situations based on the
criterion using causal intervention and conditional mutual information. This
effectively assists agents in exploring states that can positively impact other
agents, thus promoting cooperation between agents. The resulting update links
coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution, which enhance
overall collaboration and performance. Experimental results on various MARL
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Ordinal learning (OL) is a type of machine learning models with broad utility
in health care applications such as diagnosis of different grades of a disease
(e.g., mild, modest, severe) and prediction of the speed of disease progression
(e.g., very fast, fast, moderate, slow). This paper aims to tackle a situation
when precisely labeled samples are limited in the training set due to cost or
availability constraints, whereas there could be an abundance of samples with
imprecise labels. We focus on imprecise labels that are intervals, i.e., one
can know that a sample belongs to an interval of labels but cannot know which
unique label it has. This situation is quite common in health care datasets due
to limitations of the diagnostic instrument, sparse clinical visits, or/and
patient dropout. Limited research has been done to develop OL models with
imprecise/interval labels. We propose a new Hybrid Ordinal Learner (HOL) to
integrate samples with both precise and interval labels to train a robust OL
model. We also develop a tractable and efficient optimization algorithm to
solve the HOL formulation. We compare HOL with several recently developed OL
methods on four benchmarking datasets, which demonstrate the superior
performance of HOL. Finally, we apply HOL to a real-world dataset for
predicting the speed of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for individuals
with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on a combination of multi-modality
neuroimaging and demographic/clinical datasets. HOL achieves high accuracy in
the prediction and outperforms existing methods. The capability of accurately
predicting the speed of progression to AD for each individual with MCI has the
potential for helping facilitate more individually-optimized interventional
strategies.

<p class="mathjax">The Transformer-based models with the multi-head self-attention mechanism are
widely used in natural language processing, and provide state-of-the-art
results. While the pre-trained language backbones are shown to implicitly
capture certain linguistic knowledge, explicitly incorporating structure-aware
features can bring about further improvement on the downstream tasks. However,
such enhancement often requires additional neural components and increases
training parameter size. In this work, we investigate the attention head
selection and manipulation strategy for feature injection from a network
pruning perspective, and conduct a case study on dialogue summarization. We
first rank attention heads in a Transformer-based summarizer with layer-wise
importance. We then select the underused heads through extensive analysis, and
inject structure-aware features by manipulating the selected heads.
Experimental results show that the importance-based head selection is effective
for feature injection, and dialogue summarization can be improved by
incorporating coreference information via head manipulation.

<p class="mathjax">Nestedness is a property of bipartite complex networks that has been shown to
characterize the peculiar structure of biological and economical networks. In a
nested network, a node of low degree has its neighborhood included in the
neighborhood of nodes of higher degree. Emergence of nestedness is commonly due
to two different schemes: i) mutualistic behavior of nodes, where nodes of each
class have an advantage in associating with each other, such as plant
pollination or seed dispersal networks; ii) geographic distribution of species,
captured in a so-called biogeographic network where species represent one class
and geographical areas the other one. Nestedness has useful applications on
real-world networks such as node ranking and link prediction.
<br />Motivated by analogies with biological networks, we study the nestedness
property of the public Internet peering ecosystem, an important part of the
Internet where autonomous systems (ASes) exchange traffic at Internet eXchange
Points (IXPs). We propose two representations of this ecosystem using a
bipartite graph derived from PeeringDB data. The first graph captures the AS
[is member of] IXP relationship which is reminiscent of the mutualistic
networks. The second graph groups IXPs into countries, and we define the AS [is
present at] country relationship to mimic a biogeographic network. We
statistically confirm the nestedness property of both graphs, which has never
been observed before in Internet topology data. From this unique observation,
we show that we can use node metrics to extract new key ASes and make efficient
prediction of newly created links over a two-year period.

<p class="mathjax">As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday
life, their capabilities to understand and emulate human cognition are under
steady examination. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to comprehend
and interpret linguistic pragmatics, an aspect of communication that considers
context and implied meanings. Using Grice's communication principles, LLMs and
human subjects (N=76) were evaluated based on their responses to various
dialogue-based tasks. The findings revealed the superior performance and speed
of LLMs, particularly GPT4, over human subjects in interpreting pragmatics.
GPT4 also demonstrated accuracy in the pre-testing of human-written samples,
indicating its potential in text analysis. In a comparative analysis of LLMs
using human individual and average scores, the models exhibited significant
chronological improvement. The models were ranked from lowest to highest score,
with GPT2 positioned at 78th place, GPT3 ranking at 23rd, Bard at 10th, GPT3.5
placing 5th, Best Human scoring 2nd, and GPT4 achieving the top spot. The
findings highlight the remarkable progress made in the development and
performance of these LLMs. Future studies should consider diverse subjects,
multiple languages, and other cognitive aspects to fully comprehend the
capabilities of LLMs. This research holds significant implications for the
development and application of AI-based models in communication-centered
sectors.

<p class="mathjax">Without an agreed-upon definition of intelligence, asking "is this system
intelligent?"" is an untestable question. This lack of consensus hinders
research, and public perception, on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly
since the rise of generative- and large-language models. Most work on precisely
capturing what we mean by "intelligence" has come from the fields of
philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. Because these perspectives are
intrinsically linked to intelligence as it is demonstrated by natural
creatures, we argue such fields cannot, and will not, provide a sufficiently
rigorous definition that can be applied to artificial means. Thus, we present
an argument for a purely functional, black-box definition of intelligence,
distinct from how that intelligence is actually achieved; focusing on the
"what", rather than the "how". To achieve this, we first distinguish other
related concepts (sentience, sensation, agency, etc.) from the notion of
intelligence, particularly identifying how these concepts pertain to artificial
intelligent systems. As a result, we achieve a formal definition of
intelligence that is conceptually testable from only external observation, that
suggests intelligence is a continuous variable. We conclude by identifying
challenges that still remain towards quantifiable measurement. This work
provides a useful perspective for both the development of AI, and for public
perception of the capabilities and risks of AI.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of mobile social networks (MSNs) has transformed
information dissemination, leading to increased reliance on these platforms for
news consumption. However, this shift has been accompanied by the widespread
propagation of fake news, posing significant challenges in terms of public
panic, political influence, and the obscuring of truth. Traditional data
processing pipelines for fake news detection in MSNs suffer from lengthy
response times and poor scalability, failing to address the unique
characteristics of news in MSNs, such as prompt propagation, large-scale
quantity, and rapid evolution. This paper introduces a novel system named
Decaffe - a DHT Tree-Based Online Federated Fake News Detection system. Decaffe
leverages distributed hash table (DHT)-based aggregation trees for scalability
and real-time detection, and it employs two model fine-tuning methods for
adapting to mobile network dynamics. The system's structure includes a root,
branches, and leaves for effective dissemination of a pre-trained model and
ensemble-based aggregation of predictive results. Decaffe uniquely combines
centralized server-based and decentralized serverless model fine-tuning
approaches with personalized model fine-tuning, addressing the challenges of
real-time detection, scalability, and adaptability in the dynamic environment
of MSNs.

<p class="mathjax">This research study delves into the conceptualization, development, and
deployment of an innovative learning analytics tool, leveraging the
capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This tool is designed to quantify student
engagement, map learning progression, and evaluate the efficacy of diverse
instructional strategies within an educational context. Through the analysis of
various critical data points such as students' stress levels, curiosity,
confusion, agitation, topic preferences, and study methods, the tool offers a
rich, multi-dimensional view of the learning environment. Furthermore, it
employs Bloom's taxonomy as a framework to gauge the cognitive levels addressed
by students' questions, thereby elucidating their learning progression. The
information gathered from these measurements can empower educators by providing
valuable insights to enhance teaching methodologies, pinpoint potential areas
for improvement, and craft personalized interventions for individual students.
The study articulates the design intricacies, implementation strategy, and
thorough evaluation of the learning analytics tool, underscoring its
prospective contributions to enhancing educational outcomes and bolstering
student success. Moreover, the practicalities of integrating the tool within
existing educational platforms and the requisite robust, secure, and scalable

<p class="mathjax">Recently, despite the unprecedented success of large pre-trained
visual-language models (VLMs) on a wide range of downstream tasks, the
real-world unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem is still not well
explored. Therefore, in this paper, we first experimentally demonstrate that
the unsupervised-trained VLMs can significantly reduce the distribution
discrepancy between source and target domains, thereby improving the
performance of UDA. However, a major challenge for directly deploying such
models on downstream UDA tasks is prompt engineering, which requires aligning
the domain knowledge of source and target domains, since the performance of UDA
is severely influenced by a good domain-invariant representation. We further
propose a Prompt-based Distribution Alignment (PDA) method to incorporate the
domain knowledge into prompt learning. Specifically, PDA employs a two-branch
prompt-tuning paradigm, namely base branch and alignment branch. The base
branch focuses on integrating class-related representation into prompts,
ensuring discrimination among different classes. To further minimize domain
discrepancy, for the alignment branch, we construct feature banks for both the
source and target domains and propose image-guided feature tuning (IFT) to make
the input attend to feature banks, which effectively integrates self-enhanced
and cross-domain features into the model. In this way, these two branches can
be mutually promoted to enhance the adaptation of VLMs for UDA. We conduct
extensive experiments on three benchmarks to demonstrate that our proposed PDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/BaiShuanghao/Prompt-based-Distribution-Alignment.

<p class="mathjax">As physical adversarial attacks become extensively applied in unearthing the
potential risk of security-critical scenarios, especially in autonomous
driving, their vulnerability to environmental changes has also been brought to
light. The non-robust nature of physical adversarial attack methods brings
less-than-stable performance consequently. To enhance the robustness of
physical adversarial attacks in the real world, instead of statically
optimizing a robust adversarial example via an off-line training manner like
the existing methods, this paper proposes a brand new robust adversarial attack
framework: Embodied Adversarial Attack (EAA) from the perspective of dynamic
adaptation, which aims to employ the paradigm of embodied intelligence:
Perception-Decision-Control to dynamically adjust the optimal attack strategy
according to the current situations in real time. For the perception module,
given the challenge of needing simulation for the victim's viewpoint, EAA
innovatively devises a Perspective Transformation Network to estimate the
target's transformation from the attacker's perspective. For the decision and
control module, EAA adopts the laser-a highly manipulable medium to implement
physical attacks, and further trains an attack agent with reinforcement
learning to make it capable of instantaneously determining the best attack
strategy based on the perceived information. Finally, we apply our framework to
the autonomous driving scenario. A variety of experiments verify the high
effectiveness of our method under complex scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Compared with transferable untargeted attacks, transferable targeted
adversarial attacks could specify the misclassification categories of
adversarial samples, posing a greater threat to security-critical tasks. In the
meanwhile, 3D adversarial samples, due to their potential of multi-view
robustness, can more comprehensively identify weaknesses in existing deep
learning systems, possessing great application value. However, the field of
transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this
work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable
targeted 3D adversarial examples, filling the gap in this field. To achieve
this goal, we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly
reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured
meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute
gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima,
leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions, TT3D
innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space, which
significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness.
Experimental results show that TT3D not only exhibits superior cross-model
transferability but also maintains considerable adaptability across different
renders and vision tasks. More importantly, we produce 3D adversarial examples
with 3D printing techniques in the real world and verify their robust
performance under various scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Driving Automation Systems (DAS) are subject to complex road environments and
vehicle behaviors and increasingly rely on sophisticated sensors and Artificial
Intelligence (AI). These properties give rise to unique safety faults stemming
from specification insufficiencies and technological performance limitations,
where sensors and AI introduce errors that vary in magnitude and temporal
patterns, posing potential safety risks. The Safety of the Intended
Functionality (SOTIF) standard emerges as a promising framework for addressing
these concerns, focusing on scenario-based analysis to identify hazardous
behaviors and their causes. Although the current standard provides a basic
cause-and-effect model and high-level process guidance, it lacks concepts
required to identify and evaluate hazardous errors, especially within the
context of AI.
<br />This paper introduces two key contributions to bridge this gap. First, it
defines the SOTIF Temporal Error and Failure Model (STEAM) as a refinement of
the SOTIF cause-and-effect model, offering a comprehensive system-design
perspective. STEAM refines error definitions, introduces error sequences, and
classifies them as error sequence patterns, providing particular relevance to
systems employing advanced sensors and AI. Second, this paper proposes the
Model-based SOTIF Analysis of Failures and Errors (MoSAFE) method, which allows
instantiating STEAM based on system-design models by deriving hazardous error
sequence patterns at module level from hazardous behaviors at vehicle level via
weakest precondition reasoning. Finally, the paper presents a case study
centered on an automated speed-control feature, illustrating the practical
applicability of the refined model and the MoSAFE method in addressing complex
safety challenges in DAS.

<p class="mathjax">Scientific research organizations that are developing and deploying
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are at the intersection of technological
progress and ethical considerations. The push for Responsible AI (RAI) in such
institutions underscores the increasing emphasis on integrating ethical
considerations within AI design and development, championing core values like
fairness, accountability, and transparency. For scientific research
organizations, prioritizing these practices is paramount not just for
mitigating biases and ensuring inclusivity, but also for fostering trust in AI
systems among both users and broader stakeholders. In this paper, we explore
the practices at a research organization concerning RAI practices, aiming to
assess the awareness and preparedness regarding the ethical risks inherent in
AI design and development. We have adopted a mixed-method research approach,
utilising a comprehensive survey combined with follow-up in-depth interviews
with selected participants from AI-related projects. Our results have revealed
certain knowledge gaps concerning ethical, responsible, and inclusive AI, with
limitations in awareness of the available AI ethics frameworks. This revealed
an overarching underestimation of the ethical risks that AI technologies can
present, especially when implemented without proper guidelines and governance.
Our findings reveal the need for a holistic and multi-tiered strategy to uplift
capabilities and better support science research teams for responsible,
ethical, and inclusive AI development and deployment.

moving on the surface of a spherical manifold. Toward this end, we develop the
notion of a collision triangle on such manifolds. We use this to determine
analytical conditions governing the speed ratios and direcions of motion of

<p class="mathjax">In software development, developers extensively utilize third-party libraries
to avoid implementing existing functionalities. When a new third-party library
vulnerability is disclosed, project maintainers need to determine whether their
projects are affected by the vulnerability, which requires developers to invest
substantial effort in assessment. However, existing tools face a series of
issues: static analysis tools produce false alarms, dynamic analysis tools
require existing tests and test generation tools have low success rates when
facing complex vulnerabilities.
<br />Vulnerability exploits, as code snippets provided for reproducing
vulnerabilities after disclosure, contain a wealth of vulnerability-related
information. This study proposes a new method based on vulnerability exploits,
called VESTA (Vulnerability Exploit-based Software Testing Auto-Generator),
which provides vulnerability exploit tests as the basis for developers to
decide whether to update dependencies. VESTA extends the search-based test
generation methods by adding a migration step, ensuring the similarity between
the generated test and the vulnerability exploit, which increases the
likelihood of detecting potential library vulnerabilities in a project.
<br />We perform experiments on 30 vulnerabilities disclosed in the past five
years, involving 60 vulnerability-project pairs, and compare the experimental
results with the baseline method, TRANSFER. The success rate of VESTA is 71.7\%
which is a 53.4\% improvement over TRANSFER in the effectiveness of verifying
exploitable vulnerabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Providing safety guarantees for learning-based controllers is important for
real-world applications. One approach to realizing safety for arbitrary control
policies is safety filtering. If necessary, the filter modifies control inputs
to ensure that the trajectories of a closed-loop system stay within a given
state constraint set for all future time, referred to as the set being positive
invariant or the system being safe. Under the assumption of fully known
dynamics, safety can be certified using control barrier functions (CBFs).
However, the dynamics model is often either unknown or only partially known in
practice. Learning-based methods have been proposed to approximate the CBF
condition for unknown or uncertain systems from data; however, these techniques
do not account for input constraints and, as a result, may not yield a valid
CBF condition to render the safe set invariant. In this work, we study
conditions that guarantee control invariance of the system under input
constraints and propose an optimization problem to reduce the conservativeness
of CBF-based safety filters. Building on these theoretical insights, we further
develop a probabilistic learning approach that allows us to build a safety
filter that guarantees safety for uncertain, input-constrained systems with
high probability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in
simulation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor and show that we can
achieve safe closed-loop behavior for a learned system while satisfying state
and input constraints.

<p class="mathjax">We address the challenge of generating 3D articulated objects in a
controllable fashion. Currently, modeling articulated 3D objects is either
achieved through laborious manual authoring, or using methods from prior work
that are hard to scale and control directly. We leverage the interplay between
part shape, connectivity, and motion using a denoising diffusion-based method
with attention modules designed to extract correlations between part
attributes. Our method takes an object category label and a part connectivity
graph as input and generates an object's geometry and motion parameters. The
generated objects conform to user-specified constraints on the object category,
part shape, and part articulation. Our experiments show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in articulated object generation, producing
more realistic objects while conforming better to user constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) often impose limitations on
the length of the text input to ensure the generation of fluent and relevant
responses. This constraint restricts their applicability in scenarios involving
long texts. We propose a novel semantic compression method that enables
generalization to texts that are 6-8 times longer, without incurring
significant computational costs or requiring fine-tuning. Our proposed
framework draws inspiration from source coding in information theory and
employs a pre-trained model to reduce the semantic redundancy of long inputs
before passing them to the LLMs for downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively extends the context window of LLMs
across a range of tasks including question answering, summarization, few-shot
learning, and information retrieval. Furthermore, the proposed semantic
compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while
reducing the associated computational overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Data lakes, increasingly adopted for their ability to store and analyze
diverse types of data, commonly use columnar storage formats like Parquet and
ORC for handling relational tables. However, these traditional setups fall
short when it comes to efficiently managing graph data, particularly those
conforming to the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. To address this gap, this
paper introduces GraphAr, a specialized storage scheme designed to enhance
existing data lakes for efficient graph data management. Leveraging the
strengths of Parquet, GraphAr captures LPG semantics precisely and facilitates
graph-specific operations such as neighbor retrieval and label filtering.
Through innovative data organization, encoding, and decoding techniques,
GraphAr dramatically improves performance. Our evaluations reveal that GraphAr
outperforms conventional Parquet and Acero-based methods, achieving an average
speedup of $3283\times$ for neighbor retrieval, $6.0\times$ for label
filtering, and $29.5\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These findings highlight
GraphAr's potential to extend the utility of data lakes by enabling efficient
graph data management.

<p class="mathjax">Segment anything model (SAM) addresses two practical yet challenging
segmentation tasks: \textbf{segment anything (SegAny)}, which utilizes a
certain point to predict the mask for a single object of interest, and
\textbf{segment everything (SegEvery)}, which predicts the masks for all
objects on the image. What makes SegAny slow for SAM is its heavyweight image
encoder, which has been addressed by MobileSAM via decoupled knowledge
distillation. The efficiency bottleneck of SegEvery with SAM, however, lies in
its mask decoder because it needs to first generate numerous masks with
redundant grid-search prompts and then perform filtering to obtain the final
valid masks. We propose to improve its efficiency by directly generating the
final masks with only valid prompts, which can be obtained through object
discovery. Our proposed approach not only helps reduce the total time on the
mask decoder by at least 16 times but also achieves superior performance.
Specifically, our approach yields an average performance boost of 3.6\% (42.5\%
\textit{v.s.} 38.9\%) for zero-shot object proposal on the LVIS dataset with
the mask AR@$K$ metric. Qualitative results show that our approach generates
fine-grained masks while avoiding over-segmenting things. This project
targeting faster SegEvery than the original SAM is termed MobileSAMv2 to
differentiate from MobileSAM which targets faster SegAny. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our new prompt sampling is also compatible with the distilled
image encoders in MobileSAM, contributing to a unified framework for efficient
SegAny and SegEvery. The code is available at the same link as MobileSAM

<p class="mathjax">Low power deep learning accelerators on the speech processing enable
real-time applications on edge devices. However, most of the existing
accelerators suffer from high power consumption and focus on image applications
only. This paper presents a low power accelerator for speech separation through
algorithm and hardware optimizations. At the algorithm level, the model is
compressed with structured sensitivity as well as unstructured pruning, and
further quantized to the shifted 8-bit floating-point format instead of the
32-bit floating-point format. The computations with the zero kernel and zero
activation values are skipped by decomposition of the dilated and transposed
convolutions. At the hardware level, the compressed model is then supported by
an architecture with eight independent multipliers and accumulators (MACs) with
a simple zero-skipping hardware to take advantage of the activation sparsity
and low power processing. The proposed approach reduces the model size by
95.44\% and computation complexity by 93.88\%. The final implementation with
the TSMC 40 $nm$ process can achieve real-time speech separation and consumes
1.6 mW power when operated at 150 MHz. The normalized energy efficiency and
area efficiency are 2.344 TOPS/W and 14.42 GOPS/mm$^2$, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">In speech recognition applications, it is important to recognize
context-specific rare words, such as proper nouns. Tree-constrained Pointer
Generator (TCPGen) has shown promise for this purpose, which efficiently biases
such words with a prefix tree. While the original TCPGen relies on
grapheme-based encoding, we propose extending it with phoneme-aware encoding to
better recognize words of unusual pronunciations. As TCPGen handles biasing
words as subword units, we propose obtaining subword-level phoneme-aware
encoding by using alignment between phonemes and subwords. Furthermore, we
propose injecting phoneme-level predictions from CTC into queries of TCPGen so
that the model better interprets the phoneme-aware encodings. We conducted ASR
experiments with TCPGen for RNN transducer. We observed that proposed
phoneme-aware encoding outperformed ordinary grapheme-based encoding on both
the English LibriSpeech and Japanese CSJ datasets, demonstrating the robustness
of our approach across linguistically diverse languages.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, end-to-end speech recognition has emerged as a technology
that integrates the acoustic, pronunciation dictionary, and language model
components of the traditional Automatic Speech Recognition model. It is
possible to achieve human-like recognition without the need to build a
pronunciation dictionary in advance. However, due to the relative scarcity of
training data on code-switching, the performance of ASR models tends to degrade
drastically when encountering this phenomenon. Most past studies have
simplified the learning complexity of the model by splitting the code-switching
task into multiple tasks dealing with a single language and then learning the
domain-specific knowledge of each language separately. Therefore, in this
paper, we attempt to introduce language identification information into the
middle layer of the ASR model's encoder. We aim to generate acoustic features
that imply language distinctions in a more implicit way, reducing the model's
confusion when dealing with language switching.

<p class="mathjax">This work addresses the task of weakly-supervised object localization. The
goal is to learn object localization using only image-level class labels, which
are much easier to obtain compared to bounding box annotations. This task is
important because it reduces the need for labor-intensive ground-truth
annotations. However, methods for object localization trained using weak
supervision often suffer from limited accuracy in localization. To address this
challenge and enhance localization accuracy, we propose a multiscale object
localization transformer (MOLT). It comprises multiple object localization
transformers that extract patch embeddings across various scales. Moreover, we
introduce a deep clustering-guided refinement method that further enhances
localization accuracy by utilizing separately extracted image segments. These
segments are obtained by clustering pixels using convolutional neural networks.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on the publicly available ILSVRC-2012 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In this article, the state estimation problems with unknown process noise and
measurement noise covariances for both linear and nonlinear systems are
considered. By formulating the joint estimation of system state and noise
parameters into an optimization problem, a novel adaptive Kalman filter method
based on conjugate-computation variational inference, referred to as CVIAKF, is
proposed to approximate the joint posterior probability density function of the
latent variables. Unlike the existing adaptive Kalman filter methods utilizing
variational inference in natural-parameter space, CVIAKF performs optimization
in expectation-parameter space, resulting in a faster and simpler solution.
Meanwhile, CVIAKF divides optimization objectives into conjugate and
non-conjugate parts of nonlinear dynamical models, whereas conjugate
computations and stochastic mirror-descent are applied, respectively.
Remarkably, the reparameterization trick is used to reduce the variance of
stochastic gradients of the non-conjugate parts. The effectiveness of CVIAKF is
validated through synthetic and real-world datasets of maneuvering target
tracking.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-domain few-shot classification (CDFSC) is a challenging and tough task
due to the significant distribution discrepancies across different domains. To
address this challenge, many approaches aim to learn transferable
representations. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) has shown its capability to learn
transferable representations in various downstream tasks, such as unsupervised
image classification and supervised concept generalization. However, its
potential in the few-shot settings has yet to be comprehensively explored. In
this study, we investigate the potential of MLP to assist in addressing the
challenges of CDFSC. Specifically, we introduce three distinct frameworks
incorporating MLP in accordance with three types of few-shot classification
methods to verify the effectiveness of MLP. We reveal that MLP can
significantly enhance discriminative capabilities and alleviate distribution
shifts, which can be supported by our expensive experiments involving 10
baseline models and 12 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our method even
compares favorably against other state-of-the-art CDFSC algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Legal case retrieval and judgment prediction are crucial components in
intelligent legal systems. In practice, determining whether two cases share the
same charges through legal judgment prediction is essential for establishing
their relevance in case retrieval. However, current studies on legal case
retrieval merely focus on the semantic similarity between paired cases,
ignoring their charge-level consistency. This separation leads to a lack of
context and potential inaccuracies in the case retrieval that can undermine
trust in the system's decision-making process. Given the guidance role of laws
to both tasks and inspired by the success of generative retrieval, in this
work, we propose to incorporate judgment prediction into legal case retrieval,
achieving a novel law-aware Generative legal case retrieval method called Gear.
Specifically, Gear first extracts rationales (key circumstances and key
elements) for legal cases according to the definition of charges in laws,
ensuring a shared and informative representation for both tasks. Then in
accordance with the inherent hierarchy of laws, we construct a law structure
constraint tree and assign law-aware semantic identifier(s) to each case based
on this tree. These designs enable a unified traversal from the root, through
intermediate charge nodes, to case-specific leaf nodes, which respectively
correspond to two tasks. Additionally, in the training, we also introduce a
revision loss that jointly minimizes the discrepancy between the identifiers of
predicted and labeled charges as well as retrieved cases, improving the
accuracy and consistency for both tasks. Extensive experiments on two datasets
demonstrate that Gear consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
legal case retrieval while maintaining competitive judgment prediction
performance.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate two efficient time discretizations for the post-processing
technique of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to solve hyperbolic
conservation laws. The post-processing technique, which is applied at the final
time of the DG method, can enhance the accuracy of the original DG solution
(spatial superconvergence). One main difficulty of the post-processing
technique is that the spatial superconvergence after post-processing needs to
be matched with proper temporary accuracy. If the semi-discretized system (ODE
system after spatial discretization) is under-resolved in time, then the space
superconvergence will be concealed. In this paper, we focus our investigation
on the recently designed SDG method and derive its explicit scheme from a
correction process based on the DG weak formulation. We also introduce another
similar technique, namely the spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. A
comparison is made among both proposed time discretization techniques with the
standard third-order Runge-Kutta method through several numerical examples, to
conclude that both the SDG and SDC methods are efficient time discretization
techniques for exploiting the spatial superconvergence of the DG methods.

<p class="mathjax">Active domain adaptation has emerged as a solution to balance the expensive
annotation cost and the performance of trained models in semantic segmentation.
However, existing works usually ignore the correlation between selected samples
and its local context in feature space, which leads to inferior usage of
annotation budgets. In this work, we revisit the theoretical bound of the
classical Core-set method and identify that the performance is closely related
to the local sample distribution around selected samples. To estimate the
density of local samples efficiently, we introduce a local proxy estimator with
Dynamic Masked Convolution and develop a Density-aware Greedy algorithm to
optimize the bound. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Moreover, with very few labels, our scheme achieves comparable

<p class="mathjax">Due to the advantages of leveraging unlabeled data and learning meaningful
representations, semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning have been
progressively combined to achieve better performances in popular applications
with few labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. One common manner is
assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and selecting positive and
negative samples from pseudo-labeled samples to apply contrastive learning.
However, the real-world data may be imbalanced, causing pseudo-labels to be
biased toward the majority classes and further undermining the effectiveness of
contrastive learning. To address the challenge, we propose Contrastive Learning
with Augmented Features (CLAF). We design a class-dependent feature
augmentation module to alleviate the scarcity of minority class samples in
contrastive learning. For each pseudo-labeled sample, we select positive and
negative samples from labeled data instead of unlabeled data to compute
contrastive loss. Comprehensive experiments on imbalanced image classification
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CLAF in the context of imbalanced
semi-supervised learning.

<p class="mathjax">ID-based Recommender Systems (RecSys), where each item is assigned a unique
identifier and subsequently converted into an embedding vector, have dominated
the designing of RecSys. Though prevalent, such ID-based paradigm is not
suitable for developing transferable RecSys and is also susceptible to the
cold-start issue. In this paper, we unleash the boundaries of the ID-based
paradigm and propose a Pure Multi-Modality based Recommender system (PMMRec),
which relies solely on the multi-modal contents of the items (e.g., texts and
images) and learns transition patterns general enough to transfer across
domains and platforms. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play framework
architecture consisting of multi-modal item encoders, a fusion module, and a
user encoder. To align the cross-modal item representations, we propose a novel
next-item enhanced cross-modal contrastive learning objective, which is
equipped with both inter- and intra-modality negative samples and explicitly
incorporates the transition patterns of user behaviors into the item encoders.
To ensure the robustness of user representations, we propose a novel noised
item detection objective and a robustness-aware contrastive learning objective,
which work together to denoise user sequences in a self-supervised manner.
PMMRec is designed to be loosely coupled, so after being pre-trained on the
source data, each component can be transferred alone, or in conjunction with
other components, allowing PMMRec to achieve versatility under both
multi-modality and single-modality transfer learning settings. Extensive
experiments on 4 sources and 10 target datasets demonstrate that PMMRec
surpasses the state-of-the-art recommenders in both recommendation performance
and transferability. Our code and dataset is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Despite the remarkable advances in deep learning technology, achieving
satisfactory performance in lung sound classification remains a challenge due
to the scarcity of available data. Moreover, the respiratory sound samples are
collected from a variety of electronic stethoscopes, which could potentially
introduce biases into the trained models. When a significant distribution shift
occurs within the test dataset or in a practical scenario, it can substantially
decrease the performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce cross-domain
adaptation techniques, which transfer the knowledge from a source domain to a
distinct target domain. In particular, by considering different stethoscope
types as individual domains, we propose a novel stethoscope-guided supervised
contrastive learning approach. This method can mitigate any domain-related
disparities and thus enables the model to distinguish respiratory sounds of the
recording variation of the stethoscope. The experimental results on the ICBHI
dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in reducing the
domain dependency and achieving the ICBHI Score of 61.71%, which is a
significant improvement of 2.16% over the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an extension to conventional regression Neural Networks
(NNs) for replacing the point predictions they produce with prediction
intervals that satisfy a required level of confidence. Our approach follows a
novel machine learning framework, called Conformal Prediction (CP), for
assigning reliable confidence measures to predictions without assuming anything
more than that the data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets and on the problem
of predicting Total Electron Content (TEC), which is an important parameter in
trans-ionospheric links; for the latter we use a dataset of more than 60000 TEC
measurements collected over a period of 11 years. Our experimental results show
that the prediction intervals produced by our method are both well-calibrated
and tight enough to be useful in practice.

<p class="mathjax">One of the key components within diffusion models is the UNet for noise
prediction. While several works have explored basic properties of the UNet
decoder, its encoder largely remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the
first comprehensive study of the UNet encoder. We empirically analyze the
encoder features and provide insights to important questions regarding their
changes at the inference process. In particular, we find that encoder features
change gently, whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations
across different time-steps. This finding inspired us to omit the encoder at
certain adjacent time-steps and reuse cyclically the encoder features in the
previous time-steps for the decoder. Further based on this observation, we
introduce a simple yet effective encoder propagation scheme to accelerate the
diffusion sampling for a diverse set of tasks. By benefiting from our
propagation scheme, we are able to perform in parallel the decoder at certain
adjacent time-steps. Additionally, we introduce a prior noise injection method
to improve the texture details in the generated image. Besides the standard
text-to-image task, we also validate our approach on other tasks:
text-to-video, personalized generation and reference-guided generation. Without
utilizing any knowledge distillation technique, our approach accelerates both
the Stable Diffusion (SD) and the DeepFloyd-IF models sampling by 41$\%$ and
24$\%$ respectively, while maintaining high-quality generation performance. Our
code is available in

<p class="mathjax">Great progress has been made in learning-based object detection methods in
the last decade. Two-stage detectors often have higher detection accuracy than
one-stage detectors, due to the use of region of interest (RoI) feature
extractors which extract transformation-invariant RoI features for different
RoI proposals, making refinement of bounding boxes and prediction of object
categories more robust and accurate. However, previous RoI feature extractors
can only extract invariant features under limited transformations. In this
paper, we propose a novel RoI feature extractor, termed Semantic RoI Align
(SRA), which is capable of extracting invariant RoI features under a variety of
transformations for two-stage detectors. Specifically, we propose a semantic
attention module to adaptively determine different sampling areas by leveraging
the global and local semantic relationship within the RoI. We also propose a
Dynamic Feature Sampler which dynamically samples features based on the RoI
aspect ratio to enhance the efficiency of SRA, and a new position embedding,
\ie Area Embedding, to provide more accurate position information for SRA
through an improved sampling area representation. Experiments show that our
model significantly outperforms baseline models with slight computational
overhead. In addition, it shows excellent generalization ability and can be
used to improve performance with various state-of-the-art backbones and
detection methods.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
has generated growing interest in understanding their environmental impact and
the challenges associated with designing environmentally friendly ML-enabled
systems. While Green AI research, i.e., research that tries to minimize the
energy footprint of AI, is receiving increasing attention, very few concrete
guidelines are available on how ML-enabled systems can be designed to be more
environmentally sustainable. In this paper, we provide a catalog of 30 green
architectural tactics for ML-enabled systems to fill this gap. An architectural
tactic is a high-level design technique to improve software quality, in our
case environmental sustainability. We derived the tactics from the analysis of
51 peer-reviewed publications that primarily explore Green AI, and validated
them using a focus group approach with three experts. The 30 tactics we
identified are aimed to serve as an initial reference guide for further
exploration into Green AI from a software engineering perspective, and assist
in designing sustainable ML-enabled systems. To enhance transparency and
facilitate their widespread use and extension, we make the tactics available
online in easily consumable formats. Wide-spread adoption of these tactics has
the potential to substantially reduce the societal impact of ML-enabled systems
regarding their energy and carbon footprint.

<p class="mathjax">Societal change is often driven by shifts in public opinion. As citizens
evolve in their norms, beliefs, and values, public policies change too. While
traditional opinion polling and surveys can outline the broad strokes of
whether public opinion on a particular topic is changing, they usually cannot
capture the full multi-dimensional richness and diversity of opinion present in
a large heterogeneous population. However, an increasing fraction of public
discourse about public policy issues is now occurring on online platforms,
which presents an opportunity to measure public opinion change at a
qualitatively different scale of resolution and context.
<br />In this paper, we present a conceptual model of observed opinion change on
online platforms and apply it to study public discourse on Universal Basic
Income (UBI) on Reddit throughout its history. UBI is a periodic,
no-strings-attached cash payment given to every citizen of a population. We
study UBI as it is a clearly-defined policy proposal that has recently
experienced a surge of interest through trends like automation and events like
the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that overall stance towards UBI on Reddit
significantly declined until mid-2019, when this historical trend suddenly
reversed and Reddit became substantially more supportive. Using our model, we
find the most significant drivers of this overall stance change were shifts
within different user cohorts, within communities that represented similar
affluence levels, and within communities that represented similar partisan
leanings. Our method identifies nuanced social drivers of opinion change in the
large-scale public discourse that now regularly occurs online, and could be
applied to a broad set of other important issues and policies.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-spectral object Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific
objects by leveraging complementary information from different image spectra.
It delivers great advantages over traditional single-spectral ReID in complex
visual environment. However, the significant distribution gap among different
image spectra poses great challenges for effective multi-spectral feature
representations. In addition, most of current Transformer-based ReID methods
only utilize the global feature of class tokens to achieve the holistic
retrieval, ignoring the local discriminative ones. To address the above issues,
we step further to utilize all the tokens of Transformers and propose a cyclic
token permutation framework for multi-spectral object ReID, dubbled TOP-ReID.
More specifically, we first deploy a multi-stream deep network based on vision
Transformers to preserve distinct information from different image spectra.
Then, we propose a Token Permutation Module (TPM) for cyclic multi-spectral
feature aggregation. It not only facilitates the spatial feature alignment
across different image spectra, but also allows the class token of each
spectrum to perceive the local details of other spectra. Meanwhile, we propose
a Complementary Reconstruction Module (CRM), which introduces dense token-level
reconstruction constraints to reduce the distribution gap across different
image spectra. With the above modules, our proposed framework can generate more
discriminative multi-spectral features for robust object ReID. Extensive
experiments on three ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100 and MSVR310)
verify the effectiveness of our methods. The code is available at
https://github.<a href="/abs/com/9249732">com/9249732</a>92/TOP-ReID.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate their significance by effectively
modeling complex interrelationships within graph-structured data. To enhance
the credibility and robustness of GNNs, it becomes exceptionally crucial to
bolster their ability to capture causal relationships. However, despite recent
advancements that have indeed strengthened GNNs from a causal learning
perspective, conducting an in-depth analysis specifically targeting the causal
modeling prowess of GNNs remains an unresolved issue. In order to
comprehensively analyze various GNN models from a causal learning perspective,
we constructed an artificially synthesized dataset with known and controllable
causal relationships between data and labels. The rationality of the generated
data is further ensured through theoretical foundations. Drawing insights from
analyses conducted using our dataset, we introduce a lightweight and highly
adaptable GNN module designed to strengthen GNNs' causal learning capabilities
across a diverse range of tasks. Through a series of experiments conducted on
both synthetic datasets and other real-world datasets, we empirically validate
the effectiveness of the proposed module.

<p class="mathjax">Since the next-generation satellite network consisting of various service
function domains, such as communication, observation, navigation, etc., is
moving towards large-scale, using single-domain resources is difficult to
provide satisfied and timely service guarantees for the rapidly increasing
mission demands of each domain. Breaking the barriers of independence of
resources in each domain, and realizing the cross-domain transmission of
missions to efficiently collaborate inter-domain resources is a promising
solution. However, the hybrid scheduling of different missions and the
continuous increase in the number of service domains have strengthened the
differences and dynamics of mission demands, making it challenging for an
efficient cross-domain mission scheduling (CMS). To this end, this paper first
accurately characterizes the communication resource state of inter-satellite in
real-time exploiting the sparse resource representation scheme, and
systematically characterizes the differentiation of mission demands by
conducting the mission priority model. Based on the information of resources
and missions, we construct the top- and bottom-layer mission scheduling models
of reward association exploiting the correlation of intra- and inter-domain
mission scheduling and formulate the Markov decision process-based hierarchical
CMS problem. Further, to achieve higher adaptability and autonomy of CMS and
efficiently mitigate the impact of network scale, a hierarchical intelligent
CMS algorithm is developed to dynamically adjust and efficiently match the CMS
policy according to different mission demands. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm has significant performance gain compared with
independent domains and the existing CMS algorithms, and can still guarantee
high service performance under different network scales.

<p class="mathjax">Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in
3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless,
existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of
bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and
labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{3D-VLA}, a weakly
supervised approach for \textbf{3D} visual grounding based on \textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}inguistic \textbf{A}lignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior
ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the
semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing
correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly
constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for
fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference
stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries
to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly
supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and
extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our
3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised
methods.

analyze algorithmic bias and their propensity to reproduce bias. We conducted
an experiment to identify and address the presence of bias in the matching
algorithms Bumble pushes to its users in the form of profiles for potential
dates in the real world. Dating apps like Bumble utilize algorithms that learn
from user data to make recommendations. Even if the algorithm does not have
intentions or consciousness, it is a system created and maintained by humans.
We attribute moral agency of such systems to be compositely derived from
algorithmic mediations, the design and utilization of these platforms.
Developers, designers, and operators of dating platforms thus have a moral
obligation to mitigate biases in the algorithms to create inclusive platforms
that affirm diverse social identities.

<p class="mathjax">Large-scale language-image pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) have shown
superior performances on many cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, the problem
of transferring the knowledge learned from such models to video-based person
re-identification (ReID) has barely been explored. In addition, there is a lack
of decent text descriptions in current ReID benchmarks. To address these
issues, in this work, we propose a novel one-stage text-free CLIP-based
learning framework named TF-CLIP for video-based person ReID. More
specifically, we extract the identity-specific sequence feature as the
CLIP-Memory to replace the text feature. Meanwhile, we design a
Sequence-Specific Prompt (SSP) module to update the CLIP-Memory online. To
capture temporal information, we further propose a Temporal Memory Diffusion
(TMD) module, which consists of two key components: Temporal Memory
Construction (TMC) and Memory Diffusion (MD). Technically, TMC allows the
frame-level memories in a sequence to communicate with each other, and to
extract temporal information based on the relations within the sequence. MD
further diffuses the temporal memories to each token in the original features
to obtain more robust sequence features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed method shows much better results than other state-of-the-art
methods on MARS, LS-VID and iLIDS-VID. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Medical applications of robots are increasingly popular to objectivise and
speed up the execution of several types of diagnostic and therapeutic
interventions. Particularly important is a class of diagnostic activities that
require physical contact between the robotic tool and the human body, such as
palpation examinations and ultrasound scans. The practical application of these
techniques can greatly benefit from an accurate estimation of the biomechanical
properties of the patient's tissues. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy
and precision of a robotic device used for medical purposes in estimating the
elastic parameters of different materials. The measurements are evaluated
against a ground truth consisting of a set of expanded foam specimens with
different elasticity that are characterised using a high-precision device. The
experimental results in terms of precision are comparable with the ground truth
and suggest future ambitious developments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a flight control design for compound Electric Vertical
Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles. With their multitude of degrees of
controllability as well as the significant variations in their flight
characteristics, VTOL vehicles present challenges when it comes to designing
their flight control system, especially for the transition phase where the
vehicle transitions between near-hovering and high-speed wing-borne flights.
This work extends previous research on the design of unified and generic
control laws that can be applied to a broad class of vehicles such as hovering
vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft. This paper exploits this unifying property
and presents an extension for the case of compound VTOL vehicles. The proposed
control approach consists of nonlinear geometric control laws that are
continuously applicable over the entire flight envelope, excluding the use of
switching policies between different control algorithms. A transition strategy
consisting of a sequence of high-level setpoints is associated with the flight
control laws, it is defined with respect to flight envelope limitations and is
applied in this work to a commercially available compound UAV. The control
algorithms are implemented on a Pixhawk controller, they are evaluated via
Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) simulations, and finally validated in a flight
experiment.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is gaining considerable attention owing
to recent methods that overcome the inefficiency and misleading results from
the absence of supervised information. Contrastive learning methods excel at
existing pixel level and super pixel level HSI clustering tasks. The
pixel-level contrastive learning method can effectively improve the ability of
the model to capture fine features of HSI but requires a large time overhead.
The super pixel-level contrastive learning method utilizes the homogeneity of
HSI and reduces computing resources; however, it yields rough classification
results. To exploit the strengths of both methods, we present a pixel super
pixel contrastive learning and pseudo-label correction (PSCPC) method for the
HSI clustering. PSCPC can reasonably capture domain-specific and fine-grained
features through super pixels and the comparative learning of a small number of
pixels within the super pixels. To improve the clustering performance of super
pixels, this paper proposes a pseudo-label correction module that aligns the
clustering pseudo-labels of pixels and super-pixels. In addition, pixel-level
clustering results are used to supervise super pixel-level clustering,
improving the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PSCPC.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating user interactions enables a more user-oriented evaluation of
information retrieval (IR) systems. While user simulations are cost-efficient
and reproducible, many approaches often lack fidelity regarding real user
behavior. Most notably, current user models neglect the user's context, which
is the primary driver of perceived relevance and the interactions with the
search results. To this end, this work introduces the simulation of
context-driven query reformulations. The proposed query generation methods
build upon recent Large Language Model (LLM) approaches and consider the user's
context throughout the simulation of a search session. Compared to simple
context-free query generation approaches, these methods show better
effectiveness and allow the simulation of more efficient IR sessions.
Similarly, our evaluations consider more interaction context than current
session-based measures and reveal interesting complementary insights in
addition to the established evaluation protocols. We conclude with directions
for future work and provide an entirely open experimental setup.

<p class="mathjax">As the number and complexity of malware attacks continue to increase, there
is an urgent need for effective malware detection systems. While deep learning
models are effective at detecting malware, they are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Attacks like this can create malicious files that are resistant to
detection, creating a significant cybersecurity risk. Recent research has seen
the development of several adversarial attack and response approaches aiming at
strengthening deep learning models' resilience to such attacks. This survey
study offers an in-depth look at current research in adversarial attack and
defensive strategies for malware classification in cybersecurity. The methods
are classified into four categories: generative models, feature-based
approaches, ensemble methods, and hybrid tactics. The article outlines
cutting-edge procedures within each area, assessing their benefits and
drawbacks. Each topic presents cutting-edge approaches and explores their
advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the study discusses the datasets and
assessment criteria that are often utilized on this subject. Finally, it
identifies open research difficulties and suggests future study options. This
document is a significant resource for malware categorization and cyber
security researchers and practitioners.

<p class="mathjax">Uplift modeling is widely used in performance marketing to estimate effects
of promotion campaigns (e.g., increase of customer retention rate). Since it is
impossible to observe outcomes of a recipient in treatment (e.g., receiving a
certain promotion) and control (e.g., without promotion) groups simultaneously
(i.e., counter-factual), uplift models are mainly trained on instances of
treatment and control groups separately to form two models respectively, and
uplifts are predicted by the difference of predictions from these two models
(i.e., two-model method). When responses are noisy and the treatment effect is
fractional, induced individual uplift predictions will be inaccurate, resulting
in targeting undesirable customers. Though it is impossible to obtain the ideal
ground-truth individual uplifts, known as Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs),
alternatively, an average uplift of a group of users, called Average Treatment
Effect (ATE), can be observed from experimental deliveries. Upon this, similar
to Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) in which each training sample is a bag of
instances, our framework sums up individual user uplift predictions for each
bag of users as its bag-wise ATE prediction, and regularizes it to its ATE
label, thus learning more accurate individual uplifts. Additionally, to amplify
the fractional treatment effect, bags are composed of instances with adjacent
individual uplift predictions, instead of random instances. Experiments
conducted on two datasets show the effectiveness and universality of the
proposed framework.

<p class="mathjax">Recovering detailed interactions between humans/hands and objects is an
appealing yet challenging task. Existing methods typically use template-based
representations to track human/hand and objects in interactions. Despite the
progress, they fail to handle the invisible contact surfaces. In this paper, we
propose Ins-HOI, an end-to-end solution to recover human/hand-object
reconstruction via instance-level implicit reconstruction. To this end, we
introduce an instance-level occupancy field to support simultaneous human/hand
and object representation, and a complementary training strategy to handle the
lack of instance-level ground truths. Such a representation enables learning a
contact prior implicitly from sparse observations. During the complementary
training, we augment the real-captured data with synthesized data by randomly
composing individual scans of humans/hands and objects and intentionally
allowing for penetration. In this way, our network learns to recover individual
shapes as completely as possible from the synthesized data, while being aware
of the contact constraints and overall reasonability based on real-captured
scans. As demonstrated in experiments, our method Ins-HOI can produce
reasonable and realistic non-visible contact surfaces even in cases of
extremely close interaction. To facilitate the research of this task, we
collect a large-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, including 5.2k
high-quality scans with real-world human-chair and hand-object interactions. We
will release our dataset and source codes. Data examples and the video results
of our method can be found on the project page.

<p class="mathjax">In the Multiagent Path Finding problem (MAPF for short), we focus on
efficiently finding non-colliding paths for a set of $k$ agents on a given
graph $G$, where each agent seeks a path from its source vertex to a target. An
important measure of the quality of the solution is the length of the proposed
schedule $\ell$, that is, the length of a longest path (including the waiting
time). In this work, we propose a systematic study under the parameterized
complexity framework. The hardness results we provide align with many
heuristics used for this problem, whose running time could potentially be
improved based on our fixed-parameter tractability results.
<br />We show that MAPF is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ (even if $k$ is combined
with the maximum degree of the input graph). The problem remains NP-hard in
planar graphs even if the maximum degree and the makespan$\ell$ are fixed
constants. On the positive side, we show an FPT algorithm for $k+\ell$.
<br />As we delve further, the structure of~$G$ comes into play. We give an FPT
algorithm for parameter $k$ plus the diameter of the graph~$G$. The MAPF
problem is W[1]-hard for cliquewidth of $G$ plus $\ell$ while it is FPT for
treewidth of $G$ plus $\ell$.

<p class="mathjax">Industrial control systems increasingly rely on middlebox functionality such
as intrusion detection or in-network processing. However, traditional
end-to-end security protocols interfere with the necessary access to in-flight
data. While recent work on middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocols for
the traditional Internet promises to address the dilemma between end-to-end
security guarantees and middleboxes, the current state-of-the-art lacks
critical features for industrial communication. Most importantly, industrial
settings require fine-grained access control for middleboxes to truly operate
in a least-privilege mode. Likewise, advanced applications even require that
middleboxes can inject specific messages (e.g., emergency shutdowns).
Meanwhile, industrial scenarios often expose tight latency and bandwidth
constraints not found in the traditional Internet. As the current
state-of-the-art misses critical features, we propose Middlebox-aware DTLS
(Madtls), a middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocol specifically tailored
to the needs of industrial networks. Madtls provides bit-level read and write
access control of middleboxes to communicated data with minimal bandwidth and
processing overhead, even on constrained hardware.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid evolution of speech synthesis and voice conversion has raised
substantial concerns due to the potential misuse of such technology, prompting
a pressing need for effective audio deepfake detection mechanisms. Existing
detection models have shown remarkable success in discriminating known deepfake
audio, but struggle when encountering new attack types. To address this
challenge, one of the emergent effective approaches is continual learning. In
this paper, we propose a continual learning approach called Radian Weight
Modification (RWM) for audio deepfake detection. The fundamental concept
underlying RWM involves categorizing all classes into two groups: those with
compact feature distributions across tasks, such as genuine audio, and those
with more spread-out distributions, like various types of fake audio. These
distinctions are quantified by means of the in-class cosine distance, which
subsequently serves as the basis for RWM to introduce a trainable gradient
modification direction for distinct data types. Experimental evaluations
against mainstream continual learning methods reveal the superiority of RWM in
terms of knowledge acquisition and mitigating forgetting in audio deepfake

detection, demonstrating its potential significance in diverse machine learning

<p class="mathjax">Modern machine learning techniques in the natural language processing domain
can be used to automatically generate scripts for goal-oriented dialogue
systems. The current article presents a general framework for studying the
automatic generation of scripts for goal-oriented dialogue systems. A method
for preprocessing dialog data sets in JSON format is described. A comparison is
made of two methods for extracting user intent based on BERTopic and latent
Dirichlet allocation. A comparison has been made of two implemented algorithms
for classifying statements of users of a goal-oriented dialogue system based on
logistic regression and BERT transformer models. The BERT transformer approach
using the bert-base-uncased model showed better results for the three metrics
Precision (0.80), F1-score (0.78) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.74)
in comparison with other methods.

<p class="mathjax">With the application of high-frequency communication and extremely large MIMO
(XL-MIMO), the near-field effect has become increasingly apparent. The
near-field beam design now requires consideration not only of the angle of
arrival (AoA) information but also the curvature of arrival (CoA) information.
However, due to their mutual coupling, orthogonally decomposing the near-field
space becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose a Joint Autocorrelation
and Cross-correlation (JAC) scheme to address the coupling information between
near-field CoA and AoA. First, we analyze the similarity between the near-field
problem and the Doppler problem in digital signal processing, revealing that
the autocorrelation function can effectively extract CoA information.
Subsequently, utilizing the obtained CoA, we transform the near-field problem
into a far-field form, enabling the direct application of beam training schemes
designed for the far-field in the near-field scenario. Finally, we analyze the
characteristics of the far and near-field signal subspaces from the perspective
of matrix theory and discuss how the JAC algorithm handles them. Numerical
results demonstrate that the JAC scheme outperforms traditional methods in the
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, the time complexity of the
JAC algorithm is $\mathcal O(N+1)$, significantly smaller than existing
near-field beam training algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Aggregation of message authentication codes (MACs) is a proven and efficient
method to preserve valuable bandwidth in resource-constrained environments:
Instead of appending a long authentication tag to each message, the integrity
protection of multiple messages is aggregated into a single tag. However, while
such aggregation saves bandwidth, a single lost message typically means that
authentication information for multiple messages cannot be verified anymore.
With the significant increase of bandwidth-constrained lossy communication, as
applications shift towards wireless channels, it thus becomes paramount to
study the impact of packet loss on the diverse MAC aggregation schemes proposed
over the past 15 years to assess when and how to aggregate message
authentication. Therefore, we empirically study all relevant MAC aggregation
schemes in the context of lossy channels, investigating achievable goodput
improvements, the resulting verification delays, processing overhead, and
resilience to denial-of-service attacks. Our analysis shows the importance of
carefully choosing and configuring MAC aggregation, as selecting and correctly
parameterizing the right scheme can, e.g., improve goodput by 39% to 444%,
depending on the scenario. However, since no aggregation scheme performs best
in all scenarios, we provide guidelines for network operators to select optimal
schemes and parameterizations suiting specific network settings.

<p class="mathjax">Speech recognition systems driven by DNNs have revolutionized human-computer
interaction through voice interfaces, which significantly facilitate our daily
lives. However, the growing popularity of these systems also raises special
concerns on their security, particularly regarding backdoor attacks. A backdoor
attack inserts one or more hidden backdoors into a DNN model during its
training process, such that it does not affect the model's performance on
benign inputs, but forces the model to produce an adversary-desired output if a
specific trigger is present in the model input. Despite the initial success of
current audio backdoor attacks, they suffer from the following limitations: (i)
Most of them require sufficient knowledge, which limits their widespread
adoption. (ii) They are not stealthy enough, thus easy to be detected by
humans. (iii) Most of them cannot attack live speech, reducing their
practicality. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose FlowMur, a
stealthy and practical audio backdoor attack that can be launched with limited
knowledge. FlowMur constructs an auxiliary dataset and a surrogate model to
augment adversary knowledge. To achieve dynamicity, it formulates trigger
generation as an optimization problem and optimizes the trigger over different
attachment positions. To enhance stealthiness, we propose an adaptive data
poisoning method according to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Furthermore, ambient
noise is incorporated into the process of trigger generation and data poisoning
to make FlowMur robust to ambient noise and improve its practicality. Extensive
experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that FlowMur achieves high
attack performance in both digital and physical settings while remaining
resilient to state-of-the-art defenses. In particular, a human study confirms
that triggers generated by FlowMur are not easily detected by participants.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has yielded impressive
success in various downstream tasks. However, the vast potential and remarkable
capabilities of LLMs also raise new security and privacy concerns if they are
exploited for nefarious purposes due to their open-endedness. For example, LLMs
may be used to plagiarize or imitate writing, thereby infringing the copyright
of the original content, or to create indiscriminate fake information based on
a certain source text. In some cases, LLMs can even analyze text from the
Internet to infer personal privacy. Unfortunately, previous text protection
research could not foresee the emergence of powerful LLMs, rendering it no
longer effective in this new context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Silent
Guardian (SG), a text protection mechanism against LLMs, which allows LLMs to
refuse to generate response when receiving protected text, preventing the
malicious use of text from the source. Specifically, we first propose the
concept of Truncation Protection Examples (TPE). By carefully modifying the
text to be protected, TPE can induce LLMs to first sample the end token, thus
directly terminating the interaction. In addition, to efficiently construct TPE
in the discrete space of text data, we propose a novel optimization algorithm
called Super Taliored Protection (STP), which is not only highly efficient but
also maintains the semantic consistency of the text during the optimization
process. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SG can
effectively protect the target text under various configurations and achieve
almost 100% protection success rate in some cases. Notably, SG also exhibits
relatively good transferability and robustness, making its application in
practical scenarios possible.

<p class="mathjax">Since Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) are the cornerstone of the most
recent Information Retrieval (IR) models, the way they encode semantic
knowledge is particularly important. However, little attention has been given
to studying the PLMs' capability to capture hierarchical semantic knowledge.
Traditionally, evaluating such knowledge encoded in PLMs relies on their
performance on a task-dependent evaluation approach based on proxy tasks, such
as hypernymy detection. Unfortunately, this approach potentially ignores other
implicit and complex taxonomic relations. In this work, we propose a
task-agnostic evaluation method able to evaluate to what extent PLMs can
capture complex taxonomy relations, such as ancestors and siblings. The
evaluation is based on intrinsic properties that capture the hierarchical
nature of taxonomies. Our experimental evaluation shows that the
lexico-semantic knowledge implicitly encoded in PLMs does not always capture
hierarchical relations. We further demonstrate that the proposed properties can
be injected into PLMs to improve their understanding of hierarchy. Through
evaluations on taxonomy reconstruction, hypernym discovery and reading
comprehension tasks, we show that the knowledge about hierarchy is moderately
but not systematically transferable across tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Robot calligraphy is an emerging exploration of artificial intelligence in
the fields of art and education. Traditional calligraphy generation researches
mainly focus on methods such as tool-based image processing, generative models,
and style transfer. Unlike the English alphabet, the number of Chinese
characters is tens of thousands, which leads to difficulties in the generation
of a style consistent Chinese calligraphic font with over 6000 characters. Due
to the lack of high-quality data sets, formal definitions of calligraphy
knowledge, and scientific art evaluation methods, The results generated are
frequently of low quality and falls short of professional-level requirements.
To address the above problem, this paper proposes an automatic calligraphy
generation model based on deep generative adversarial networks (deepGAN) that
can generate style calligraphy fonts with professional standards. The key
highlights of the proposed method include: (1) The datasets use a
high-precision calligraphy synthesis method to ensure its high quality and
sufficient quantity; (2) Professional calligraphers are invited to conduct a
series of Turing tests to evaluate the gap between model generation results and
human artistic level; (3) Experimental results indicate that the proposed model
is the state-of-the-art among current calligraphy generation methods. The
Turing tests and similarity evaluations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

multi-armed bandit model, in which each agent faces a finite set of arms and
may communicate with other agents through a central controller. The optimal arm
for each agent in this model is the arm with the largest expected mixed reward,
where the mixed reward of each arm is a weighted average of its rewards across
all agents, making communication among agents crucial. While near-optimal
sample complexities for best arm identification are known under this
collaborative model, the question of optimal regret remains open. In this work,
we address this problem and propose the first algorithm with order optimal

<p class="mathjax">Trajectory prediction in traffic scenes involves accurately forecasting the
behaviour of surrounding vehicles. To achieve this objective it is crucial to
consider contextual information, including the driving path of vehicles, road
topology, lane dividers, and traffic rules. Although studies demonstrated the
potential of leveraging heterogeneous context for improving trajectory
prediction, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches still rely on a limited
subset of this information. This is mainly due to the limited availability of
comprehensive representations. This paper presents an approach that utilizes
knowledge graphs to model the diverse entities and their semantic connections
within traffic scenes. Further, we present nuScenes Knowledge Graph (nSKG), a
knowledge graph for the nuScenes dataset, that models explicitly all scene
participants and road elements, as well as their semantic and spatial
relationships. To facilitate the usage of the nSKG via graph neural networks
for trajectory prediction, we provide the data in a format, ready-to-use by the
PyG library. All artefacts can be found here:

<p class="mathjax">In sequential decision making, neural networks (NNs) are nowadays commonly
used to represent and learn the agent's policy. This area of application has
implied new software quality assessment challenges that traditional validation
and verification practises are not able to handle. Subsequently, novel
approaches have emerged to adapt those techniques to NN-based policies for
sequential decision making. This survey paper aims at summarising these novel
contributions and proposing future research directions. We conducted a
literature review of recent research papers (from 2018 to beginning of 2023),
whose topics cover aspects of the test or verification of NN-based policies.
The selection has been enriched by a snowballing process from the previously
selected papers, in order to relax the scope of the study and provide the
reader with insight into similar verification challenges and their recent
solutions. 18 papers have been finally selected. Our results show evidence of
increasing interest for this subject. They highlight the diversity of both the
exact problems considered and the techniques used to tackle them.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, learning urban region representations utilizing multi-modal data
(information views) has become increasingly popular, for deep understanding of
the distributions of various socioeconomic features in cities. However,
previous methods usually blend multi-view information in a posteriors stage,
falling short in learning coherent and consistent representations across
different views. In this paper, we form a new pipeline to learn consistent
representations across varying views, and propose the multi-view Contrastive
Prediction model for urban Region embedding (ReCP), which leverages the
multiple information views from point-of-interest (POI) and human mobility
data. Specifically, ReCP comprises two major modules, namely an intra-view
learning module utilizing contrastive learning and feature reconstruction to
capture the unique information from each single view, and inter-view learning
module that perceives the consistency between the two views using a contrastive
prediction learning scheme. We conduct thorough experiments on two downstream
tasks to assess the proposed model, i.e., land use clustering and region
popularity prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods significantly in urban region
representation learning.

<p class="mathjax">Many species face the threat of extinction. It's important to study these
species and gather information about them as much as possible to preserve
biodiversity. Due to the rarity of endangered species, there is a limited
amount of data available, making it difficult to apply data requiring
generative AI methods to this domain. We aim to study the feasibility of
generating consistent and real-like 3D models of endangered animals using
limited data. Such a phenomenon leads us to utilize zero-shot stable diffusion
models that can generate a 3D model out of a single image of the target
species. This paper investigates the intricate relationship between elevation
angle and the output quality of 3D model generation, focusing on the innovative
approach presented in DreamGaussian. DreamGaussian, a novel framework utilizing
Generative Gaussian Splatting along with novel mesh extraction and refinement
algorithms, serves as the focal point of our study. We conduct a comprehensive
analysis, analyzing the effect of varying elevation angles on DreamGaussian's
ability to reconstruct 3D scenes accurately. Through an empirical evaluation,
we demonstrate how changes in elevation angle impact the generated images'
spatial coherence, structural integrity, and perceptual realism. We observed
that giving a correct elevation angle with the input image significantly
affects the result of the generated 3D model. We hope this study to be
influential for the usability of AI to preserve endangered animals; while the
penultimate aim is to obtain a model that can output biologically consistent 3D
models via small samples, the qualitative interpretation of an existing
state-of-the-art model such as DreamGaussian will be a step forward in our
goal.

<p class="mathjax">To empower smart contracts with the promising capabilities of cryptography,
Ethereum officially introduced a set of cryptographic APIs that facilitate
basic cryptographic operations within smart contracts, such as elliptic curve
operations. However, since developers are not necessarily cryptography experts,
requiring them to directly interact with these basic APIs has caused real-world
security issues and potential usability challenges. To guide future research
and solutions to these challenges, we conduct the first empirical study on
Ethereum cryptographic practices. Through the analysis of 91,484,856 Ethereum
transactions, 500 crypto-related contracts, and 483 StackExchange posts, we
provide the first in-depth look at cryptographic tasks developers need to
accomplish and identify five categories of obstacles they encounter.
Furthermore, we conduct an online survey with 78 smart contract practitioners
to explore their perspectives on these obstacles and elicit the underlying
reasons. We find that more than half of practitioners face more challenges in
cryptographic tasks compared to general business logic in smart contracts.
Their feedback highlights the gap between low-level cryptographic APIs and
high-level tasks they need to accomplish, emphasizing the need for improved
cryptographic APIs, task-based templates, and effective assistance tools. Based
on these findings, we provide practical implications for further improvements
and outline future research directions.

nanodrone to be piloted through an obstacle course using bodily movement, in a
3D transposition of the '80s video-game Pacman. Using a bricolage approach to
analyse interviews, field notes, video recordings, and inspection of each
team's code revealed how participants were shaping and, in turn, became shaped
in bodily ways by the drones' limitations. We observed how teams adapted to
compete by: 1) shifting from aiming for seamless human-drone interaction, to
seeing drones as fragile, wilful, and prone to crashes; 2) engaging with
intimate, bodily interactions to more precisely understand, probe, and delimit
each drone's capabilities; 3) adopting different strategies, emphasising either
training the drone or training the pilot. We contribute with an empirical,

<p class="mathjax">Continuous machine learning pipelines are common in industrial settings where
models are periodically trained on data streams. Unfortunately, concept drifts
may occur in data streams where the joint distribution of the data X and label
y, P(X, y), changes over time and possibly degrade model accuracy. Existing
concept drift adaptation approaches mostly focus on updating the model to the
new data possibly using ensemble techniques of previous models and tend to
discard the drifted historical data. However, we contend that explicitly
utilizing the drifted data together leads to much better model accuracy and
propose Quilt, a data-centric framework for identifying and selecting data
segments that maximize model accuracy. To address the potential downside of
efficiency, Quilt extends existing data subset selection techniques, which can
be used to reduce the training data without compromising model accuracy. These
techniques cannot be used as is because they only assume virtual drifts where
the posterior probabilities P(y|X) are assumed not to change. In contrast, a
key challenge in our setup is to also discard undesirable data segments with
concept drifts. Quilt thus discards drifted data segments and selects data
segment subsets holistically for accurate and efficient model training. The two
operations use gradient-based scores, which have little computation overhead.
In our experiments, we show that Quilt outperforms state-of-the-art drift
adaptation and data selection baselines on synthetic and real datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Topic modeling is a widely used technique for revealing underlying thematic
structures within textual data. However, existing models have certain
limitations, particularly when dealing with short text datasets that lack
co-occurring words. Moreover, these models often neglect sentence-level
semantics, focusing primarily on token-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose PromptTopic, a novel topic modeling approach that harnesses the
advanced language understanding of large language models (LLMs) to address
these challenges. It involves extracting topics at the sentence level from
individual documents, then aggregating and condensing these topics into a
predefined quantity, ultimately providing coherent topics for texts of varying
lengths. This approach eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning and
improves the quality of extracted topics. We benchmark PromptTopic against the
state-of-the-art baselines on three vastly diverse datasets, establishing its
proficiency in discovering meaningful topics. Furthermore, qualitative analysis
showcases PromptTopic's ability to uncover relevant topics in multiple
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has gained prominence as an effective
approach for control systems. However, its practical deployment is impeded by
state perturbations that can severely impact system performance. Addressing
this critical challenge requires robustness verification about system
performance, which involves tackling two quantitative questions: (i) how to
establish guaranteed bounds for expected cumulative rewards, and (ii) how to
determine tail bounds for cumulative rewards. In this work, we present the
first approach for robustness verification of DRL-based control systems by
introducing reward martingales, which offer a rigorous mathematical foundation
to characterize the impact of state perturbations on system performance in
terms of cumulative rewards. Our verified results provide provably quantitative
certificates for the two questions. We then show that reward martingales can be
implemented and trained via neural networks, against different types of control
policies. Experimental results demonstrate that our certified bounds tightly
enclose simulation outcomes on various DRL-based control systems, indicating
the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of AI-based and autonomous systems is raising concerns and
apprehension due to potential negative repercussions stemming from their
behavior or decisions. These systems must be designed to comply with the human
contexts in which they will operate. To this extent, Townsend et al. (2022)
introduce the concept of SLEEC (social, legal, ethical, empathetic, or
cultural) rules that aim to facilitate the formulation, verification, and
enforcement of the rules AI-based and autonomous systems should obey. They lay
out a methodology to elicit them and to let philosophers, lawyers, domain
experts, and others to formulate them in natural language. To enable their
effective use in AI systems, it is necessary to translate these rules
systematically into a formal language that supports automated reasoning. In
this study, we first conduct a linguistic analysis of the SLEEC rules pattern,
which justifies the translation of SLEEC rules into classical logic. Then we
investigate the computational complexity of reasoning about SLEEC rules and
show how logical programming frameworks can be employed to implement SLEEC
rules in practical scenarios. The result is a readily applicable strategy for
implementing AI systems that conform to norms expressed as SLEEC rules.

<p class="mathjax">Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has emerged as a powerful metaheuristic
global optimization approach over the past three decades. Its appeal lies in
its ability to tackle complex multidimensional problems that defy conventional
algorithms. However, PSO faces challenges, such as premature stagnation in
single-objective scenarios and the need to strike a balance between exploration
and exploitation. Hybridizing PSO by integrating its cooperative nature with
established optimization techniques from diverse paradigms offers a promising
solution. In this paper, we investigate various strategies for synergizing
gradient-based optimizers with PSO. We introduce different hybridization
principles and explore several approaches, including sequential decoupled
hybridization, coupled hybridization, and adaptive hybridization. These
strategies aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of PSO, ultimately
improving its ability to navigate intricate optimization landscapes. By
combining the strengths of gradient-based methods with the inherent social
dynamics of PSO, we seek to address the critical objectives of intelligent
exploration and exploitation in complex optimization tasks. Our study delves
into the comparative merits of these hybridization techniques and offers
insights into their application across different problem domains.

<p class="mathjax">Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown advantages in graph-based analysis
tasks. However, most existing methods have the homogeneity assumption and show
poor performance on heterophilic graphs, where the linked nodes have dissimilar
features and different class labels, and the semantically related nodes might
be multi-hop away. To address this limitation, this paper presents GraphRARE, a
general framework built upon node relative entropy and deep reinforcement
learning, to strengthen the expressive capability of GNNs. An innovative node
relative entropy, which considers node features and structural similarity, is
used to measure mutual information between node pairs. In addition, to avoid
the sub-optimal solutions caused by mixing useful information and noises of
remote nodes, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to
optimize the graph topology. This algorithm selects informative nodes and
discards noisy nodes based on the defined node relative entropy. Extensive
experiments are conducted on seven real-world datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of GraphRARE in node classification and its
capability to optimize the original graph topology.

<p class="mathjax">This paper provides a novel parsimonious yet efficient design for zero-shot
learning (ZSL), dubbed ParsNets, where we are interested in learning a
composition of on-device friendly linear networks, each with orthogonality and
low-rankness properties, to achieve equivalent or even better performance
against existing deep models. Concretely, we first refactor the core module of
ZSL, i.e., visual-semantics mapping function, into several base linear networks
that correspond to diverse components of the semantic space, where the complex
nonlinearity can be collapsed into simple local linearities. Then, to
facilitate the generalization of local linearities, we construct a maximal
margin geometry on the learned features by enforcing low-rank constraints on
intra-class samples and high-rank constraints on inter-class samples, resulting
in orthogonal subspaces for different classes and each subspace lies on a
compact manifold. To enhance the model's adaptability and counterbalance
over/under-fittings in ZSL, a set of sample-wise indicators is employed to
select a sparse subset from these base linear networks to form a composite
semantic predictor for each sample. Notably, maximal margin geometry can
guarantee the diversity of features, and meanwhile, local linearities guarantee
efficiency. Thus, our ParsNets can generalize better to unseen classes and can
be deployed flexibly on resource-constrained devices. Theoretical explanations
and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Traditionally, the production efficiency of a factory floor is evaluated
using non-real time objective functions. These are based on scheduling
punctuality criteria such as 'earliness (a measure of finishing operations
ahead of schedule)' and 'tardiness (a measure of delay in executing certain
operations)'. With process automation becoming more and more inevitable due to
the emergence of Industry 4.0 / Industry 5.0, real-time objective functions are
also gaining popularity. One such criterion is 'synchronization' or 'timing'.
In this article, an IoT enabled real-time synchronization approach is presented
in the context of Integrated Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) from a
service provider's perspective. A new business and operational model, termed as
"Timing-As-A-Service (TAAS)", is introduced. In this model, the role of a
service provider is to "supply" synchronization from the mobile networks to the
IIoT domain.

<p class="mathjax">Click-through rate (CTR) Prediction is a crucial task in personalized
information retrievals, such as industrial recommender systems, online
advertising, and web search. Most existing CTR Prediction models utilize
explicit feature interactions to overcome the performance bottleneck of
implicit feature interactions. Hence, deep CTR models based on parallel
structures (e.g., DCN, FinalMLP, xDeepFM) have been proposed to obtain joint
information from different semantic spaces. However, these parallel
subcomponents lack effective supervisory signals, making it challenging to
efficiently capture valuable multi-views feature interaction information in
different semantic spaces. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet
effective novel CTR model: Contrast-enhanced Through Network for CTR (CETN), so
as to ensure the diversity and homogeneity of feature interaction information.
Specifically, CETN employs product-based feature interactions and the
augmentation (perturbation) concept from contrastive learning to segment
different semantic spaces, each with distinct activation functions. This
improves diversity in the feature interaction information captured by the
model. Additionally, we introduce self-supervised signals and through
connection within each semantic space to ensure the homogeneity of the captured
feature interaction information. The experiments and research conducted on four
real datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms twenty
baseline models in terms of AUC and Logloss.

<p class="mathjax">Visual retrieval aims to search for the most relevant visual items, e.g.,
images and videos, from a candidate gallery with a given query item. Accuracy
and efficiency are two competing objectives in retrieval tasks. Instead of
crafting a new method pursuing further improvement on accuracy, in this paper
we propose a multi-teacher distillation framework Whiten-MTD, which is able to
transfer knowledge from off-the-shelf pre-trained retrieval models to a
lightweight student model for efficient visual retrieval. Furthermore, we
discover that the similarities obtained by different retrieval models are
diversified and incommensurable, which makes it challenging to jointly distill
knowledge from multiple models. Therefore, we propose to whiten the output of
teacher models before fusion, which enables effective multi-teacher
distillation for retrieval models. Whiten-MTD is conceptually simple and
practically effective. Extensive experiments on two landmark image retrieval
datasets and one video retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method, and its good balance of retrieval performance and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Shortcut reasoning is an irrational process of inference, which degrades the
robustness of an NLP model. While a number of previous work has tackled the
identification of shortcut reasoning, there are still two major limitations:
(i) a method for quantifying the severity of the discovered shortcut reasoning
is not provided; (ii) certain types of shortcut reasoning may be missed. To
address these issues, we propose a novel method for identifying shortcut
reasoning. The proposed method quantifies the severity of the shortcut
reasoning by leveraging out-of-distribution data and does not make any
assumptions about the type of tokens triggering the shortcut reasoning. Our
experiments on Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis demonstrate
that our framework successfully discovers known and unknown shortcut reasoning
in the previous work.

<p class="mathjax">Skiing is a popular winter sport discipline with a long history of
competitive events. In this domain, computer vision has the potential to
enhance the understanding of athletes' performance, but its application lags
behind other sports due to limited studies and datasets. This paper makes a
step forward in filling such gaps. A thorough investigation is performed on the
task of skier tracking in a video capturing his/her complete performance.
Obtaining continuous and accurate skier localization is preemptive for further
higher-level performance analyses. To enable the study, the largest and most
annotated dataset for computer vision in skiing, SkiTB, is introduced. Several
visual object tracking algorithms, including both established methodologies and
a newly introduced skier-optimized baseline algorithm, are tested using the
dataset. The results provide valuable insights into the applicability of
different tracking methods for vision-based skiing analysis. SkiTB, code, and
results are available at https://machinelearning.uniud.it/datasets/skitb.

Recognition (VSR) leveraging speech representations produced by any trained
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Moving away from the
resource-intensive trends prevalent in recent literature, our method distills
knowledge from a trained Conformer-based ASR model, achieving competitive
performance on standard VSR benchmarks with significantly less resource
utilization. Using unlabeled audio-visual data only, our baseline model
achieves a word error rate (WER) of 47.4% and 54.7% on the LRS2 and LRS3 test
benchmarks, respectively. After fine-tuning the model with limited labeled
data, the word error rate reduces to 35% (LRS2) and 45.7% (LRS3). Our model can
be trained on a single consumer-grade GPU within a few days and is capable of
performing real-time end-to-end VSR on dated hardware, suggesting a path

<p class="mathjax">This paper deals with the problem of informative path planning for a UAV
deployed for precision agriculture applications. First, we observe that the
``fear of missing out'' data lead to uniform, conservative scanning policies
over the whole agricultural field. Consequently, employing a non-uniform
scanning approach can mitigate the expenditure of time in areas with minimal or
negligible real value, while ensuring heightened precision in information-dense
regions. Turning to the available informative path planning methodologies, we
discern that certain methods entail intensive computational requirements, while
others necessitate training on an ideal world simulator. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose an active sensing coverage path planning
approach, named OverFOMO, that regulates the speed of the UAV in accordance
with both the relative quantity of the identified classes, i.e. crops and
weeds, and the confidence level of such detections. To identify these
instances, a robust Deep Learning segmentation model is deployed. The
computational needs of the proposed algorithm are independent of the size of
the agricultural field, rendering its applicability on modern UAVs quite
straightforward. The proposed algorithm was evaluated with a simu-realistic
pipeline, combining data from real UAV missions and the high-fidelity dynamics
of AirSim simulator, showcasing its performance improvements over the
established state of affairs for this type of missions. An open-source
implementation of the algorithm and the evaluation pipeline is also available:

<p class="mathjax">Understanding and identifying the causes behind developers' emotions (e.g.,
Frustration caused by `delays in merging pull requests') can be crucial towards
finding solutions to problems and fostering collaboration in open-source
communities. Effectively identifying such information in the high volume of
communications across the different project channels, such as chats, emails,
and issue comments, requires automated recognition of emotions and their
causes. To enable this automation, large-scale software engineering-specific
datasets that can be used to train accurate machine learning models are
required. However, such datasets are expensive to create with the variety and
informal nature of software projects' communication channels.
<br />In this paper, we explore zero-shot LLMs that are pre-trained on massive
datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting
emotion causes in software engineering: ChatGPT, GPT-4, and flan-alpaca. Our
evaluation indicates that these recently available models can identify emotion
categories when given detailed emotions, although they perform worse than the
top-rated models. For emotion cause identification, our results indicate that
zero-shot LLMs are effective at recognizing the correct emotion cause with a
BLEU-2 score of 0.598. To highlight the potential use of these techniques, we
conduct a case study of the causes of Frustration in the last year of
development of a popular open-source project, revealing several interesting
insights.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a method for learning Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited
set of data points. The Hamiltonian vector field is found by regularized
optimization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of vector fields that are
inherently Hamiltonian, and where the vector field is required to be odd or
even. This is done with a symplectic kernel, and it is shown how this
symplectic kernel can be modified to be odd or even. The performance of the
method is validated in simulations for two Hamiltonian systems. It is shown
that the learned dynamics are Hamiltonian, and that the learned Hamiltonian
vector field can be prescribed to be odd or even.

<p class="mathjax">Video-grounded Dialogue (VGD) aims to answer questions regarding a given
multi-modal input comprising video, audio, and dialogue history. Although there
have been numerous efforts in developing VGD systems to improve the quality of
their responses, existing systems are competent only to incorporate the
information in the video and text and tend to struggle in extracting the
necessary information from the audio when generating appropriate responses to
the question. The VGD system seems to be deaf, and thus, we coin this symptom
of current systems' ignoring audio data as a deaf response. To overcome the
deaf response problem, Hearing Enhanced Audio Response (HEAR) framework is
proposed to perform sensible listening by selectively attending to audio
whenever the question requires it. The HEAR framework enhances the accuracy and
audibility of VGD systems in a model-agnostic manner. HEAR is validated on VGD
datasets (i.e., AVSD@DSTC7 and AVSD@DSTC8) and shows effectiveness with various
VGD systems.

<p class="mathjax">This work compares three locomotion techniques for an immersive VR
environment: two different types of teleporting (with and without animation)
and a manual (joystick-based) technique. We tested the effect of these
techniques on visual motion sickness, spatial awareness, presence, subjective
pleasantness, and perceived difficulty of operating the navigation. We
collected eye tracking and head and body orientation data to investigate the
relationships between motion, vection, and sickness. Our study confirms some
results already discussed in the literature regarding the reduced invasiveness
and the high usability of instant teleport while increasing the evidence
against the hypothesis of reduced spatial awareness induced by this technique.
We reinforce the evidence about the issues of extending teleporting with
animation. Furthermore, we offer some new evidence of a benefit to the user
experience of the manual technique and the correlation of the sickness felt in
this condition with head movements. The findings of this study contribute to
the ongoing debate on the development of guidelines on navigation interfaces in
specific VR environments.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present a new visual prompting method called 3DAxiesPrompts
(3DAP) to unleash the capabilities of GPT-4V in performing 3D spatial tasks.
Our investigation reveals that while GPT-4V exhibits proficiency in discerning
the position and interrelations of 2D entities through current visual prompting
techniques, its abilities in handling 3D spatial tasks have yet to be explored.
In our approach, we create a 3D coordinate system tailored to 3D imagery,
complete with annotated scale information. By presenting images infused with
the 3DAP visual prompt as inputs, we empower GPT-4V to ascertain the spatial
positioning information of the given 3D target image with a high degree of
precision. Through experiments, We identified three tasks that could be stably
completed using the 3DAP method, namely, 2D to 3D Point Reconstruction, 2D to
3D point matching, and 3D Object Detection. We perform experiments on our
proposed dataset 3DAP-Data, the results from these experiments validate the
efficacy of 3DAP-enhanced GPT-4V inputs, marking a significant stride in 3D
spatial task execution.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, several works have explored if and how robotic coaches can promote
and maintain mental well-being in different settings. However, findings from
these studies revealed that these robotic coaches are not ready to be used and
deployed in real-world settings due to several limitations that span from
technological challenges to coaching success. To overcome these challenges,
this paper presents VITA, a novel multi-modal LLM-based system that allows
robotic coaches to autonomously adapt to the coachee's multi-modal behaviours
(facial valence and speech duration) and deliver coaching exercises in order to
promote mental well-being in adults. We identified five objectives that
correspond to the challenges in the recent literature, and we show how the VITA
system addresses these via experimental validations that include one in-lab
pilot study (N=4) that enabled us to test different robotic coach
configurations (pre-scripted, generic, and adaptive models) and inform its
design for using it in the real world, and one real-world study (N=17)
conducted in a workplace over 4 weeks. Our results show that: (i) coachees
perceived the VITA adaptive and generic configurations more positively than the
pre-scripted one, and they felt understood and heard by the adaptive robotic
coach, (ii) the VITA adaptive robotic coach kept learning successfully by
personalising to each coachee over time and did not detect any interaction
ruptures during the coaching, (iii) coachees had significant mental well-being
improvements via the VITA-based robotic coach practice. The code for the VITA
system is openly available via: https://github.com/Cambridge-AFAR/VITA-system.

<p class="mathjax">Process mining, a data-driven approach for analyzing, visualizing, and
improving business processes using event logs, has emerged as a powerful
technique in the field of business process management. Process forecasting is a
sub-field of process mining that studies how to predict future processes and
process models. In this paper, we introduce and motivate the problem of event
log prediction and present our approach to solving the event log prediction
problem, in particular, using the sequence-to-sequence deep learning approach.
We evaluate and analyze the prediction outcomes on a variety of synthetic logs
and seven real-life logs and show that our approach can generate perfect
predictions on synthetic logs and that deep learning techniques have the
potential to be applied in real-world event log prediction tasks. We further
provide practical recommendations for event log predictions grounded in the
outcomes of the conducted experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance field (NeRF) has achieved great success in novel view
synthesis and 3D representation for static scenarios. Existing dynamic NeRFs
usually exploit a locally dense grid to fit the deformation field; however,
they fail to capture the global dynamics and concomitantly yield models of
heavy parameters. We observe that the 4D space is inherently sparse. Firstly,
the deformation field is sparse in spatial but dense in temporal due to the
continuity of of motion. Secondly, the radiance field is only valid on the
surface of the underlying scene, usually occupying a small fraction of the
whole space. We thus propose to represent the 4D scene using a learnable sparse
latent space, a.k.a. SLS4D. Specifically, SLS4D first uses dense learnable time
slot features to depict the temporal space, from which the deformation field is
fitted with linear multi-layer perceptions (MLP) to predict the displacement of
a 3D position at any time. It then learns the spatial features of a 3D position
using another sparse latent space. This is achieved by learning the adaptive
weights of each latent code with the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLS4D: it achieves the best 4D novel view
synthesis using only about $6\%$ parameters of the most recent work.

<p class="mathjax">Using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties is a
crucial research topic. These properties depend on numerical data and semantic
factors. Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods
typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other
pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods
cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper,
we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which
constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It
captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and
utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this
process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic
features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of
cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in
small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance
material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA)
property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and
16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two
public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and
54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability. We hope the
proposed datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models can facilitate the
communities of KG and AI for materials.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has shown remarkable progress, yet it
still faces challenges in real-world distant scenarios across various array
topologies each with multiple recording devices. The focal point of the CHiME-7
Distant ASR task is to devise a unified system capable of generalizing various
array topologies that have multiple recording devices and offering reliable
recognition performance in real-world environments. Addressing this task, we
introduce an ASR system that demonstrates exceptional performance across
various array topologies. First of all, we propose two attention-based
automatic channel selection modules to select the most advantageous subset of
multi-channel signals from multiple recording devices for each utterance.
Furthermore, we introduce inter-channel spatial features to augment the
effectiveness of multi-frame cross-channel attention, aiding it in improving
the capability of spatial information awareness. Finally, we propose a
multi-layer convolution fusion module drawing inspiration from the U-Net
architecture to integrate the multi-channel output into a single-channel
output. Experimental results on the CHiME-7 corpus with oracle segmentation
demonstrate that the improvements introduced in our proposed ASR system lead to
a relative reduction of 40.1% in the Macro Diarization Attributed Word Error
Rates (DA-WER) when compared to the baseline ASR system on the Eval sets.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning techniques often lack formal correctness guarantees. This is
evidenced by the widespread adversarial examples that plague most deep-learning
applications. This resulted in several research efforts that aim at verifying
deep neural networks, with a particular focus on safety-critical applications.
However, formal verification techniques still face major scalability and
precision challenges when dealing with the complexity of such networks. The
over-approximation introduced during the formal verification process to tackle
the scalability challenge often results in inconclusive analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate Verification-friendly
Neural Networks (VNNs). We present a post-training optimization framework to
achieve a balance between preserving prediction performance and robustness in
the resulting networks. Our proposed framework proves to result in networks
that are comparable to the original ones in terms of prediction performance,
while amenable to verification. This essentially enables us to establish
robustness for more VNNs than their deep neural network counterparts, in a more
time-efficient manner.

<p class="mathjax">Facial animation in virtual reality environments is essential for
applications that necessitate clear visibility of the user's face and the
ability to convey emotional signals. In our scenario, we animate the face of an
operator who controls a robotic Avatar system. The use of facial animation is
particularly valuable when the perception of interacting with a specific
individual, rather than just a robot, is intended. Purely keypoint-driven
animation approaches struggle with the complexity of facial movements. We
present a hybrid method that uses both keypoints and direct visual guidance
from a mouth camera. Our method generalizes to unseen operators and requires
only a quick enrolment step with capture of two short videos. Multiple source
images are selected with the intention to cover different facial expressions.
Given a mouth camera frame from the HMD, we dynamically construct the target
keypoints and apply an attention mechanism to determine the importance of each
source image. To resolve keypoint ambiguities and animate a broader range of
mouth expressions, we propose to inject visual mouth camera information into
the latent space. We enable training on large-scale speaking head datasets by
simulating the mouth camera input with its perspective differences and facial
deformations. Our method outperforms a baseline in quality, capability, and
temporal consistency. In addition, we highlight how the facial animation
contributed to our victory at the ANA Avatar XPRIZE Finals.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present a multiscale approach for the reliable coarse-scale
approximation of spatial network models represented by a linear system of
equations with respect to the nodes of a graph. The method is based on the
ideas of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) strategy and is
constructed in a fully algebraic way. This allows to apply the method to
geometrically challenging objects such as corrugated cardboard. In particular,
the method can also be applied to finite difference or finite element
discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations, yielding an
approximation with similar properties as the LOD in the continuous setting. We
present a rigorous error analysis of the proposed method under suitable
assumptions on the network. Moreover, numerical examples are presented that
underline our theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting relational facts from multimodal data is a crucial task in the
field of multimedia and knowledge graphs that feeds into widespread real-world
applications. The emphasis of recent studies centers on recognizing relational
facts in which both entities are present in one modality and supplementary
information is used from other modalities. However, such works disregard a
substantial amount of multimodal relational facts that arise across different
modalities, such as one entity seen in a text and another in an image. In this
paper, we propose a new task, namely Multimodal Object-Entity Relation
Extraction, which aims to extract "object-entity" relational facts from image
and text data. To facilitate research on this task, we introduce MORE, a new
dataset comprising 21 relation types and 20,264 multimodal relational facts
annotated on 3,559 pairs of textual news titles and corresponding images. To
show the challenges of Multimodal Object-Entity Relation Extraction, we
evaluated recent state-of-the-art methods for multimodal relation extraction
and conducted a comprehensive experimentation analysis on MORE. Our results
demonstrate significant challenges for existing methods, underlining the need
for further research on this task. Based on our experiments, we identify
several promising directions for future research. The MORE dataset and code are
available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/MORE.

<p class="mathjax">When a gait of a bipedal robot is developed using deep reinforcement
learning, reference trajectories may or may not be used. Each approach has its
advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method is up to the control
developer. This paper investigates the effect of reference trajectories on
locomotion learning and the resulting gaits. We implemented three gaits of a
full-order anthropomorphic robot model with different reward imitation ratios,
provided sim-to-sim control policy transfer, and compared the gaits in terms of
robustness and energy efficiency. In addition, we conducted a qualitative
analysis of the gaits by interviewing people, since our task was to create an
appealing and natural gait for a humanoid robot.
<br />According to the results of the experiments, the most successful approach was
the one in which the average value of rewards for imitation and adherence to
command velocity per episode remained balanced throughout the training. The
gait obtained with this method retains naturalness (median of 3.6 according to
the user study) compared to the gait trained with imitation only (median of
4.0), while remaining robust close to the gait trained without reference
trajectories.

<p class="mathjax">Invariant representation learning (IRL) encourages the prediction from
invariant causal features to labels de-confounded from the environments,
advancing the technical roadmap of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.
Despite spotlights around, recent theoretical results verified that some causal
features recovered by IRLs merely pretend domain-invariantly in the training
environments but fail in unseen domains. The \emph{fake invariance} severely
endangers OOD generalization since the trustful objective can not be diagnosed
and existing causal surgeries are invalid to rectify. In this paper, we review
a IRL family (InvRat) under the Partially and Fully Informative Invariant
Feature Structural Causal Models (PIIF SCM /FIIF SCM) respectively, to certify
their weaknesses in representing fake invariant features, then, unify their
causal diagrams to propose ReStructured SCM (RS-SCM). RS-SCM can ideally
rebuild the spurious and the fake invariant features simultaneously. Given
this, we further develop an approach based on conditional mutual information
with respect to RS-SCM, then rigorously rectify the spurious and fake invariant
effects. It can be easily implemented by a small feature selection subnet
introduced in the IRL family, which is alternatively optimized to achieve our
goal. Experiments verified the superiority of our approach to fight against the
fake invariant issue across a variety of OOD generalization benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops and analyses semi-discrete numerical method for two
dimensional Vlasov-Stokes' system with periodic boundary condition. The method
is based on coupling of semi-discrete discontinuous Galerkin method for the
Vlasov equation with discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the stationary
incompressible Stokes' equation. The proposed method is both mass and momentum
conservative. Since it is difficult to establish non-negativity of the discrete
local density, the generalized discrete Stokes' operator become non-coercive
and indefinite and under smallness condition on the discretization parameter,
optimal error estimates are established with help of a modified the Stokes'
projection to deal with Stokes' part and with the help of a special projection
to tackle the Vlasov part. Finally, numerical experiments based on the dG

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in a variety of downstream
generative tasks, yet remain under-explored in the important and challenging
expressive talking head generation. In this work, we propose a DreamTalk
framework to fulfill this gap, which employs meticulous design to unlock the
potential of diffusion models in generating expressive talking heads.
Specifically, DreamTalk consists of three crucial components: a denoising
network, a style-aware lip expert, and a style predictor. The diffusion-based
denoising network is able to consistently synthesize high-quality audio-driven
face motions across diverse expressions. To enhance the expressiveness and
accuracy of lip motions, we introduce a style-aware lip expert that can guide
lip-sync while being mindful of the speaking styles. To eliminate the need for
expression reference video or text, an extra diffusion-based style predictor is
utilized to predict the target expression directly from the audio. By this
means, DreamTalk can harness powerful diffusion models to generate expressive
faces effectively and reduce the reliance on expensive style references.
Experimental results demonstrate that DreamTalk is capable of generating
photo-realistic talking faces with diverse speaking styles and achieving
accurate lip motions, surpassing existing state-of-the-art counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Since the advent of Spectre attacks, researchers and practitioners have
developed a range of hardware and software measures to counter transient
execution attacks. A prime example of such mitigation is speculative load
hardening in LLVM, which protects against leaks by tracking the speculation
state and masking values during misspeculation. LLVM relies on static analysis
to harden programs using slh that often results in over-protection, which
incurs performance overhead. We extended an existing side-channel model
validation framework, Scam-V, to check the vulnerability of programs to
Spectre-PHT attacks and optimize the protection of programs using the slh
approach. We illustrate the efficacy of Scam-V by first demonstrating that it
can automatically identify Spectre vulnerabilities in real programs, e.g.,
fragments of crypto-libraries. We then develop an optimization mechanism that
validates the necessity of slh hardening w.r.t. the target platform. Our
experiments showed that hardening introduced by LLVM in most cases could be
significantly improved when the underlying microarchitecture properties are
considered.

that the Noether charge associated with time translation symmetry is exactly

fulfils the naively discretized equations of motions inside the domain, except

<p class="mathjax">A key problem toward the use of microorganisms as bio-factories is reaching
and maintaining cellular communities at a desired density and composition so
that they can efficiently convert their biomass into useful compounds.
Promising technological platforms for the real time, scalable control of
cellular density are bioreactors. In this work, we developed a learning-based
strategy to expand the toolbox of available control algorithms capable of
regulating the density of a \textit{single} bacterial population in
bioreactors. Specifically, we used a sim-to-real paradigm, where a simple
mathematical model, calibrated using a few data, was adopted to generate
synthetic data for the training of the controller. The resulting policy was
then exhaustively tested in vivo using a low-cost bioreactor known as Chi.Bio,
assessing performance and robustness. In addition, we compared the performance
with more traditional controllers (namely, a PI and an MPC), confirming that
the learning-based controller exhibits similar performance in vivo. Our work
showcases the viability of learning-based strategies for the control of
cellular density in bioreactors, making a step forward toward their use for the
control of the composition of microbial consortia.

is the case, for instance, of mechanical Hamiltonian functions in physics,
population growth equations in biology, and consumer preference and utility
functions in economics. We consider the scenario in which a surrogate of a
function is to be tested for additive separability. The detection that the
surrogate is additively separable can be leveraged to improve further learning.
Hence, it is beneficial to have the ability to test for such separability in
surrogates. The mathematical approach is to test if the mixed partial
derivative of the surrogate is zero; or empirically, lower than a threshold. We
present and comparatively and empirically evaluate the eight methods to compute
the mixed partial derivative of a surrogate function.

<p class="mathjax">One of the bottlenecks of automated driving technologies is safe and socially
acceptable interactions with human-driven vehicles, for example during merging.
Driver models that provide accurate predictions of joint and individual driver
behaviour of high-level decisions, safety margins, and low-level control inputs
are required to improve the interactive capabilities of automated driving.
Existing driver models typically focus on one of these aspects. Unified models
capturing all aspects are missing which hinders understanding of the principles
that govern human traffic interactions. This in turn limits the ability of
automated vehicles to resolve merging interactions. Here, we present a
communication-enabled interaction model based on risk perception with the
potential to capture merging interactions on all three levels. Our model
accurately describes human behaviour in a simplified merging scenario,
addressing both individual actions (such as velocity adjustments) and joint
actions (such as the order of merging). Contrary to other interaction models,
our model does not assume humans are rational and explicitly accounts for
communication between drivers. Our results demonstrate that communication and
risk-based decision-making explain observed human interactions on multiple
levels. This explanation improves our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of human traffic interactions and poses a step towards
interaction-aware automated driving.

<p class="mathjax">Hypergraphs are vital in modelling data with higher-order relations
containing more than two entities, gaining prominence in machine learning and
signal processing. Many hypergraph neural networks leverage message passing
over hypergraph structures to enhance node representation learning, yielding
impressive performances in tasks like hypergraph node classification. However,
these message-passing-based models face several challenges, including
oversmoothing as well as high latency and sensitivity to structural
perturbations at inference time. To tackle those challenges, we propose an
alternative approach where we integrate the information about hypergraph
structures into training supervision without explicit message passing, thus
also removing the reliance on it at inference. Specifically, we introduce
Hypergraph-MLP, a novel learning framework for hypergraph-structured data,
where the learning model is a straightforward multilayer perceptron (MLP)
supervised by a loss function based on a notion of signal smoothness on
hypergraphs. Experiments on hypergraph node classification tasks demonstrate
that Hypergraph-MLP achieves competitive performance compared to existing
baselines, and is considerably faster and more robust against structural
perturbations at inference.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce RANRAC, a robust reconstruction algorithm for 3D objects
handling occluded and distracted images, which is a particularly challenging
scenario that prior robust reconstruction methods cannot deal with. Our
solution supports single-shot reconstruction by involving light-field networks,
and is also applicable to photo-realistic, robust, multi-view reconstruction
from real-world images based on neural radiance fields. While the algorithm
imposes certain limitations on the scene representation and, thereby, the
supported scene types, it reliably detects and excludes inconsistent
perspectives, resulting in clean images without floating artifacts. Our
solution is based on a fuzzy adaption of the random sample consensus paradigm,
enabling its application to large scale models. We interpret the minimal number
of samples to determine the model parameters as a tunable hyperparameter. This
is applicable, as a cleaner set of samples improves reconstruction quality.
Further, this procedure also handles outliers. Especially for conditioned
models, it can result in the same local minimum in the latent space as would be
obtained with a completely clean set. We report significant improvements for
novel-view synthesis in occluded scenarios, of up to 8dB PSNR compared to the
baseline.

<p class="mathjax">In recent advancements in spoken question answering (QA), end-to-end models
have made significant strides. However, previous research has primarily focused
on extractive span selection. While this extractive-based approach is effective
when answers are present directly within the input, it falls short in
addressing abstractive questions, where answers are not directly extracted but
inferred from the given information. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first
end-to-end Generative Spoken Question Answering (GSQA) model that empowers the
system to engage in abstractive reasoning. The challenge in training our GSQA
model lies in the absence of a spoken abstractive QA dataset. We propose using
text models for initialization and leveraging the extractive QA dataset to
transfer knowledge from the text generative model to the spoken generative
model. Experimental results indicate that our model surpasses the previous
extractive model by 3% on extractive QA datasets. Furthermore, the GSQA model
has only been fine-tuned on the spoken extractive QA dataset. Despite not
having seen any spoken abstractive QA data, it can still closely match the
performance of the cascade model. In conclusion, our GSQA model shows the
potential to generalize to a broad spectrum of questions, thus further
expanding spoken question answering capabilities of abstractive QA. Our code is

<p class="mathjax">Explaining predictions of black-box neural networks is crucial when applied
to decision-critical tasks. Thus, attribution maps are commonly used to
identify important image regions, despite prior work showing that humans prefer
explanations based on similar examples. To this end, ProtoPNet learns a set of
class-representative feature vectors (prototypes) for case-based reasoning.
During inference, similarities of latent features to prototypes are linearly
classified to form predictions and attribution maps are provided to explain the
similarity. In this work, we evaluate whether architectures for case-based
reasoning fulfill established axioms required for faithful explanations using
the example of ProtoPNet. We show that such architectures allow the extraction
of faithful explanations. However, we prove that the attribution maps used to
explain the similarities violate the axioms. We propose a new procedure to
extract explanations for trained ProtoPNets, named ProtoPFaith. Conceptually,
these explanations are Shapley values, calculated on the similarity scores of
each prototype. They allow to faithfully answer which prototypes are present in
an unseen image and quantify each pixel's contribution to that presence,
thereby complying with all axioms. The theoretical violations of ProtoPNet
manifest in our experiments on three datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs,
RSNA) and five architectures (ConvNet, ResNet, ResNet50, WideResNet50,
ResNeXt50). Our experiments show a qualitative difference between the
explanations given by ProtoPNet and ProtoPFaith. Additionally, we quantify the
explanations with the Area Over the Perturbation Curve, on which ProtoPFaith
outperforms ProtoPNet on all experiments by a factor $&gt;10^3$.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce RJUA-QA, a novel medical dataset for question answering (QA) and
reasoning with clinical evidence, contributing to bridge the gap between
general large language models (LLMs) and medical-specific LLM applications.
RJUA-QA is derived from realistic clinical scenarios and aims to facilitate
LLMs in generating reliable diagnostic and advice. The dataset contains 2,132
curated Question-Context-Answer pairs, corresponding about 25,000 diagnostic
records and clinical cases. The dataset covers 67 common urological disease
categories, where the disease coverage exceeds 97.6\% of the population seeking
medical services in urology. Each data instance in RJUA-QA comprises: (1) a
question mirroring real patient to inquiry about clinical symptoms and medical
conditions, (2) a context including comprehensive expert knowledge, serving as
a reference for medical examination and diagnosis, (3) a doctor response
offering the diagnostic conclusion and suggested examination guidance, (4) a
diagnosed clinical disease as the recommended diagnostic outcome, and (5)
clinical advice providing recommendations for medical examination. RJUA-QA is
the first medical QA dataset for clinical reasoning over the patient inquiries,
where expert-level knowledge and experience are required for yielding
diagnostic conclusions and medical examination advice. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted to evaluate the performance of both medical-specific
and general LLMs on the RJUA-QA dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Reliable deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in cluttered unknown
environments requires accurate sensors for obstacle avoidance. Such a
requirement limits the usage of cheap and micro-scale vehicles with constrained
payload capacity if industrial-grade reliability and precision are required.
This paper investigates the possibility of offloading the necessity to carry
heavy and expensive obstacle sensors to another member of the UAV team while
preserving the desired obstacle avoidance capability. A novel cooperative
guidance framework offloading the obstacle sensing requirements from a
minimalistic secondary UAV to a superior primary UAV is proposed. The primary
UAV constructs a dense occupancy map of the environment and plans
collision-free paths for both UAVs to ensure reaching the desired secondary
UAV's goal. The primary UAV guides the secondary UAV to follow the planned path
while tracking the UAV using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based relative
localization. The proposed approach was verified in real-world experiments with
a heterogeneous team of a 3D LiDAR-equipped primary UAV and a camera-equipped
secondary UAV moving autonomously through unknown cluttered Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments with the proposed framework running
completely on board the UAVs.

<p class="mathjax">The development of biophysical models for clinical applications is rapidly
advancing in the research community, thanks to their predictive nature and
their ability to assist the interpretation of clinical data. However,
high-resolution and accurate multi-physics computational models are
computationally expensive and their personalisation involves fine calibration
of a large number of parameters, which may be space-dependent, challenging
their clinical translation. In this work, we propose a new approach which
relies on the combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with
three-dimensional soft tissue nonlinear biomechanical models, capable of
reconstructing displacement fields and estimating heterogeneous
patient-specific biophysical properties. The proposed learning algorithm
encodes information from a limited amount of displacement and, in some cases,
strain data, that can be routinely acquired in the clinical setting, and
combines it with the physics of the problem, represented by a mathematical
model based on partial differential equations, to regularise the problem and
improve its convergence properties. Several benchmarks are presented to show
the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its great potential to
enable the robust and effective identification of patient-specific,
heterogeneous physical properties, s.a. tissue stiffness properties. In
particular, we demonstrate the capability of the PINN to detect the presence,
location and severity of scar tissue, which is beneficial to develop
personalised simulation models for disease diagnosis, especially for cardiac
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) deals with training a model
on a labeled source domain with the aim of generalizing to unseen domains
during inference. Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by
means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can
only account for style diversification and not content. In this work, we take
an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative
FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In
detail, CLOUDS is a framework that integrates FMs of various kinds: (i) CLIP
backbone for its robust feature representation, (ii) generative models to
diversify the content, thereby covering various modes of the possible target
distribution, and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining
the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our
CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under
varying weather conditions, notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and
6.7% on averaged miou, respectively. The code is available at :

frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar mutual interference
mitigation. Instead of training NNs to regress from interfered to clean radar
signals as in previous work, we train NNs directly on object detection maps. We
do so by performing a continuous relaxation of the cell-averaging constant
false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) peak detector, which is a well-established algorithm
for object detection using radar. With this new training objective we are able
to increase object detection performance by a large margin. Furthermore, we
introduce separable convolution kernels to strongly reduce the number of
parameters and computational complexity of convolutional NN architectures for
radar applications. We validate our contributions with experiments on
real-world measurement data and compare them against signal processing
interference mitigation methods.

<p class="mathjax">Group centrality measures are a generalization of standard centrality,
designed to quantify the importance of not just a single node (as is the case
with standard measures) but rather that of a group of nodes. Some nodes may
have an incentive to evade such measures, i.e., to hide their actual
importance, in order to conceal their true role in the network. A number of
studies have been proposed in the literature to understand how nodes can rewire
the network in order to evade standard centrality, but no study has focused on
group centrality to date. We close this gap by analyzing four group centrality
measures: degree, closeness, betweenness, and GED-walk. We show that an optimal
way to rewire the network can be computed efficiently given the former measure,
but the problem is NP-complete given closeness and betweenness. Moreover, we
empirically evaluate a number of hiding strategies, and show that an optimal
way to hide from degree group centrality is also effective in practice against
the other measures. Altogether, our results suggest that it is possible to hide
from group centrality measures based solely on the local information available
to the group members about the network topology.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial Intelligence (AI) based image analysis has an immense potential to
support diagnostic histopathology, including cancer diagnostics. However,
developing supervised AI methods requires large-scale annotated datasets. A
potentially powerful solution is to augment training data with synthetic data.
Latent diffusion models, which can generate high-quality, diverse synthetic
images, are promising. However, the most common implementations rely on
detailed textual descriptions, which are not generally available in this
domain. This work proposes a method that constructs structured textual prompts
from automatically extracted image features. We experiment with the PCam
dataset, composed of tissue patches only loosely annotated as healthy or
cancerous. We show that including image-derived features in the prompt, as
opposed to only healthy and cancerous labels, improves the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) from 178.8 to 90.2. We also show that pathologists find it
challenging to detect synthetic images, with a median sensitivity/specificity
of 0.55/0.55. Finally, we show that synthetic data effectively trains AI
models.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayes bound on the generalisation gap, in a
supervised time-series setting for a special class of discrete-time non-linear
dynamical systems. This class includes stable recurrent neural networks (RNN),
and the motivation for this work was its application to RNNs. In order to
achieve the results, we impose some stability constraints, on the allowed
models. Here, stability is understood in the sense of dynamical systems. For
RNNs, these stability conditions can be expressed in terms of conditions on the
weights. We assume the processes involved are essentially bounded and the loss
functions are Lipschitz. The proposed bound on the generalisation gap depends
on the mixing coefficient of the data distribution, and the essential supremum
of the data. Furthermore, the bound converges to zero as the dataset size
increases. In this paper, we 1) formalize the learning problem, 2) derive a
PAC-Bayesian error bound for such systems, 3) discuss various consequences of
this error bound, and 4) show an illustrative example, with discussions on
computing the proposed bound. Unlike other available bounds the derived bound
holds for non i.i.d. data (time-series) and it does not grow with the number of
steps of the RNN.

<p class="mathjax">Occluded person re-identification (ReID) is a very challenging task due to
the occlusion disturbance and incomplete target information. Leveraging
external cues such as human pose or parsing to locate and align part features
has been proven to be very effective in occluded person ReID. Meanwhile, recent
Transformer structures have a strong ability of long-range modeling.
Considering the above facts, we propose a Teacher-Student Decoder (TSD)
framework for occluded person ReID, which utilizes the Transformer decoder with
the help of human parsing. More specifically, our proposed TSD consists of a
Parsing-aware Teacher Decoder (PTD) and a Standard Student Decoder (SSD). PTD
employs human parsing cues to restrict Transformer's attention and imparts this
information to SSD through feature distillation. Thereby, SSD can learn from
PTD to aggregate information of body parts automatically. Moreover, a mask
generator is designed to provide discriminative regions for better ReID. In
addition, existing occluded person ReID benchmarks utilize occluded samples as
queries, which will amplify the role of alleviating occlusion interference and
underestimate the impact of the feature absence issue. Contrastively, we
propose a new benchmark with non-occluded queries, serving as a complement to
the existing benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method is superior and the new benchmark is essential. The source codes are
available at https://github.com/hh23333/TSD.

<p class="mathjax">Event cameras offer the exciting possibility of tracking the camera's pose
during high-speed motion and in adverse lighting conditions. Despite this
promise, existing event-based monocular visual odometry (VO) approaches
demonstrate limited performance on recent benchmarks. To address this
limitation, some methods resort to additional sensors such as IMUs, stereo
event cameras, or frame-based cameras. Nonetheless, these additional sensors
limit the application of event cameras in real-world devices since they
increase cost and complicate system requirements. Moreover, relying on a
frame-based camera makes the system susceptible to motion blur and HDR. To
remove the dependency on additional sensors and to push the limits of using
only a single event camera, we present Deep Event VO (DEVO), the first
monocular event-only system with strong performance on a large number of
real-world benchmarks. DEVO sparsely tracks selected event patches over time. A
key component of DEVO is a novel deep patch selection mechanism tailored to
event data. We significantly decrease the pose tracking error on seven
real-world benchmarks by up to 97% compared to event-only methods and often
surpass or are close to stereo or inertial methods. Code is available at
https://github.com/tum-vision/DEVO

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel writing method called Probing Chain of Thought (ProCoT),
which prevents students from cheating using a Large Language Model (LLM), such
as ChatGPT, while enhancing their active learning through such models. LLMs
have disrupted education and many other feilds. For fear of students cheating,
many educationists have resorted to banning their use, as their outputs can be
human-like and hard to detect in some cases. These LLMs are also known for
hallucinations (i.e. fake facts). We conduct studies with ProCoT in two
different courses with a combined total of about 66 students. The students in
each course were asked to prompt an LLM of their choice with one question from
a set of four and required to affirm or refute statements in the LLM output by
using peer reviewed references. The results show two things: (1) ProCoT
stimulates creative/critical thinking and writing of students through
engagement with LLMs when we compare the LLM solely output to ProCoT output and
(2) ProCoT can prevent cheating because of clear limitations in existing LLMs
when we compare students ProCoT output to LLM ProCoT output. We also discover
that most students prefer to give answers in fewer words than LLMs, which are
typically verbose. The average word counts for students, ChatGPT (v3.5) and
Phind (v8) are 208, 391 and 383, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the problem of CPRP, concept prerequisite relation
prediction, which is a fundamental task in using AI for education. CPRP is
usually formulated into a link-prediction task on a relationship graph of
concepts and solved by training the graph neural network (GNN) model. However,
current directed GNNs fail to manage graph isomorphism which refers to the
invariance of non-isomorphic graphs, reducing the expressivity of resulting
representations. We present a permutation-equivariant directed GNN model by
introducing the Weisfeiler-Lehman test into directed GNN learning. Our method
is then used for CPRP and evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental
results show that our model delivers better prediction performance than the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate inferring individual preferences and the contradiction of
individual preferences with group preferences through direct measurement of the
brain. We report an experiment where brain activity collected from 31
participants produced in response to viewing images is associated with their
self-reported preferences. First, we show that brain responses present a graded
response to preferences, and that brain responses alone can be used to train
classifiers that reliably estimate preferences. Second, we show that brain
responses reveal additional preference information that correlates with group
preference, even when participants self-reported having no such preference. Our
analysis of brain responses carries significant implications for researchers in
general, as it suggests an individual's explicit preferences are not always
aligned with the preferences inferred from their brain responses. These
findings call into question the reliability of explicit and behavioral signals.
They also imply that additional, multimodal sources of information may be
necessary to infer reliable preference information.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding vehicles in images is important for various applications such
as intelligent transportation and self-driving system. Existing vehicle-centric
works typically pre-train models on large-scale classification datasets and
then fine-tune them for specific downstream tasks. However, they neglect the
specific characteristics of vehicle perception in different tasks and might
thus lead to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
vehicle-centric pre-training framework called VehicleMAE, which incorporates
the structural information including the spatial structure from vehicle profile
information and the semantic structure from informative high-level natural
language descriptions for effective masked vehicle appearance reconstruction.
To be specific, we explicitly extract the sketch lines of vehicles as a form of
the spatial structure to guide vehicle reconstruction. The more comprehensive
knowledge distilled from the CLIP big model based on the similarity between the
paired/unpaired vehicle image-text sample is further taken into consideration
to help achieve a better understanding of vehicles. A large-scale dataset is
built to pre-train our model, termed Autobot1M, which contains about 1M vehicle
images and 12693 text information. Extensive experiments on four vehicle-based
downstream tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our VehicleMAE. The
source code and pre-trained models will be released at
https://github.com/Event-AHU/VehicleMAE.

DAG based blockchains currently referred to as Blockchain 3.0 solves many

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) involves training a model over a dataset distributed
among clients, with the constraint that each client's dataset is localized and
possibly heterogeneous. In FL, small and noisy datasets are common,
highlighting the need for well-calibrated models that represent the uncertainty
of predictions. The closest FL techniques to achieving such goals are the
Bayesian FL methods which collect parameter samples from local posteriors, and
aggregate them to approximate the global posterior. To improve scalability for
larger models, one common Bayesian approach is to approximate the global
predictive posterior by multiplying local predictive posteriors. In this work,
we demonstrate that this method gives systematically overconfident predictions,
and we remedy this by proposing $\beta$-Predictive Bayes, a Bayesian FL
algorithm that interpolates between a mixture and product of the predictive
posteriors, using a tunable parameter $\beta$. This parameter is tuned to
improve the global ensemble's calibration, before it is distilled to a single
model. Our method is evaluated on a variety of regression and classification
datasets to demonstrate its superiority in calibration to other baselines, even
as data heterogeneity increases. Code available at

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent advances of the artificial intelligence, building social
intelligence remains a challenge. Among social signals, laughter is one of the
distinctive expressions that occurs during social interactions between humans.
In this work, we tackle a new challenge for machines to understand the
rationale behind laughter in video, Video Laugh Reasoning. We introduce this
new task to explain why people laugh in a particular video and a dataset for
this task. Our proposed dataset, SMILE, comprises video clips and language
descriptions of why people laugh. We propose a baseline by leveraging the
reasoning capacity of large language models (LLMs) with textual video
representation. Experiments show that our baseline can generate plausible
explanations for laughter. We further investigate the scalability of our
baseline by probing other video understanding tasks and in-the-wild videos. We
release our dataset, code, and model checkpoints on

<p class="mathjax">We consider stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) and single input
single output (SISO) plants in the frequency domain from a fresh perspective.
Compensators that are themselves stable are sometimes preferred because they
make starting the system easier. Such starting remains easy if there is a
stable compensator in parallel with the plant rather than in a feedback loop.
In such an arrangement, we explain why it is possible to stabilize all plants
whose transfer functions are proper rational functions of the Laplace variable
$s$. In our proposed architecture we have (i) an optional compensator $C_s(s)$
in series with the plant $P(s)$, (ii) a necessary compensator $C_p(s)$ in
parallel with $C_s(s)P(s)$, along with (iii) a feedback gain $K$ for the
combined new plant $C_s(s)P(s)+C_p(s)$. We show that stabilization with stable
$C_s(s)$ and $C_p(s)$ is always possible. In our proposed solution the
closed-loop plant is biproper and has all its zeros in the left half plane, so
there is a $K_0$ such that the plant is stable for $K&gt;K_0$. We are not aware of
prior use of parallel compensators with such a goal. Our proposed architecture
works even for plants that are impossible to stabilize with stable compensators
in the usual single-loop feedback architecture. Several examples are provided.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a systematic analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) based on a
signal processing technique for network parameter removal, in the form of
synaptic filters that identifies the fragility, robustness and antifragility
characteristics of DNN parameters. Our proposed analysis investigates if the
DNN performance is impacted negatively, invariantly, or positively on both
clean and adversarially perturbed test datasets when the DNN undergoes synaptic
filtering. We define three \textit{filtering scores} for quantifying the
fragility, robustness and antifragility characteristics of DNN parameters based
on the performances for (i) clean dataset, (ii) adversarial dataset, and (iii)
the difference in performances of clean and adversarial datasets. We validate
the proposed systematic analysis on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-v1.1 and
ShuffleNet V2 x1.0 network architectures for MNIST, CIFAR10 and Tiny ImageNet
datasets. The filtering scores, for a given network architecture, identify
network parameters that are invariant in characteristics across different
datasets over learning epochs. Vice-versa, for a given dataset, the filtering
scores identify the parameters that are invariant in characteristics across
different network architectures. We show that our synaptic filtering method
improves the test accuracy of ResNet and ShuffleNet models on adversarial
datasets when only the robust and antifragile parameters are selectively
retrained at any given epoch, thus demonstrating applications of the proposed
strategy in improving model robustness.

<p class="mathjax">We present SeeThruFinger, a soft robotic finger with an in-finger vision for
multi-modal perception, including visual perception and tactile sensing, for
geometrically adaptive and real-time reactive grasping. Multi-modal perception
of intrinsic and extrinsic interactions is critical in building intelligent
robots that learn. Instead of adding various sensors for different modalities,
a preferred solution is to integrate them into one elegant and coherent design,
which is a challenging task. This study leverages the Soft Polyhedral Network
design as a robotic finger, capable of omni-directional adaptation with an
unobstructed view of the finger's spatial deformation from the inside. By
embedding a miniature camera underneath, we achieve the visual perception of
the external environment by inpainting the finger mask using E2FGV, which can
be used for object detection in the downstream tasks for grasping. After
contacting the objects, we use real-time object segmentation algorithms, such
as XMem, to track the soft finger's spatial deformations. We also learned a
Supervised Variational Autoencoder to enable tactile sensing of 6D forces and
torques for reactive grasp. As a result, we achieved multi-modal perception,
including visual perception and tactile sensing, and soft, adaptive object
grasping within a single vision-based soft finger design compatible with
multi-fingered robotic grippers.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential model synchronisation is the task of propagating changes from one
model to another correlated one to restore consistency. It is challenging to
perform this propagation in a least-changing way that avoids unnecessary
deletions (which might cause information loss). From a theoretical point of
view, so-called short-cut (SC) rules have been developed that enable provably
correct propagation of changes while avoiding information loss. However, to be
able to react to every possible change, an infinite set of such rules might be
necessary. Practically, only small sets of pre-computed basic SC rules have
been used, severely restricting the kind of changes that can be propagated
without loss of information. In this work, we close that gap by developing an
approach to compute more complex required SC rules on-the-fly during
synchronisation. These higher-order SC rules allow us to cope with more complex
scenarios when multiple changes must be handled in one step. We implemented our
approach in the model transformation tool eMoflon. An evaluation shows that the
overhead of computing higher-order SC rules on-the-fly is tolerable and at
times even improves the overall performance. Above that, completely new
scenarios can be dealt with without the loss of information.

<p class="mathjax">This survey gives an overview of three central algebraic themes related to
the study of splines: duality, group actions, and homology. Splines are
piecewise polynomial functions of a prescribed order of smoothness on some
subdivided domain D in R^k, and appear in applications ranging from
approximation theory to geometric modeling to numerical analysis.
Alternatively, splines can be interpreted as a collection of polynomials
labeling the vertices of a (combinatorial) graph, with adjacent vertex-labels
differing by a power of an affine linear form attached to the edge. In most
cases of interest, the subdivided domain is essentially dual to the
combinatorial graph, and these two characterizations of splines coincide.
<br />Properties of splines depend on combinatorics, topology, geometry, and
symmetry of a simplicial or polyhedral subdivision of a region D in R^k, and
are often quite subtle. We describe how duality, group actions, and homology --
techniques which play a central role in many areas of both pure and applied
mathematics -- can be used to illuminate different questions about splines.
<br />Our target audience is nonspecialists: we provide a concrete introduction to
these methods, and illustrate them with many examples in the context of
splines. We also provide a tutorial on computational aspects: all of the
objects appearing in this note may be studied using open source computer
algebra software.

<p class="mathjax">This report proposes a model to predict the location of the most deprived
areas in a city using data from the census. A census data is very high
dimensional and needs to be simplified. We use a novel algorithm to reduce
dimensionality and find patterns: The diffusion map. Features are defined by
eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix that defines the diffusion map.
Eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues indicate specific
population features. Previous work has found qualitatively that the second most
important dimension for describing the census data in Bristol is linked to
deprivation. In this report, we analyse how good this dimension is as a model
for predicting deprivation by comparing with the recognised measures. The
Pearson correlation coefficient was found to be over 0.7. The top 10 per cent
of deprived areas in the UK which also locate in Bristol are extracted to test
the accuracy of the model. There are 52 most deprived areas, and 38 areas are
correctly identified by comparing to the model. The influence of scores of IMD
domains that do not correlate with the models, Eigenvector 2 entries of
non-deprived OAs and orthogonality of Eigenvectors cause the model to fail the
prediction of 14 deprived areas.
<br />However, overall, the model shows a high performance to predict the future
deprivation of overall areas where the project considers. This project is
expected to support the government to allocate resources and funding.

<p class="mathjax">Linear mode-connectivity (LMC) (or lack thereof) is one of the intriguing
characteristics of neural network loss landscapes. While empirically well
established, it unfortunately still lacks a proper theoretical understanding.
Even worse, although empirical data points are abound, a systematic study of
when networks exhibit LMC is largely missing in the literature. In this work we
aim to close this gap. We explore how LMC is affected by three factors: (1)
architecture (sparsity, weight-sharing), (2) training strategy (optimization
setup) as well as (3) the underlying dataset. We place particular emphasis on
minimal but non-trivial settings, removing as much unnecessary complexity as
possible. We believe that our insights can guide future theoretical works on
uncovering the inner workings of LMC.

$p$-dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Coresets under DTW have not been
investigated before, and the analysis is not directly accessible to existing
methods as DTW is not a metric. The three main ingredients that allow our
construction of coresets are the adaptation of the $\varepsilon$-coreset
framework of sensitivity sampling, bounds on the VC dimension of approximations
to the range spaces of balls under DTW, and new approximation algorithms for
the $k$-median problem under DTW. We achieve our results by investigating
approximations of DTW that provide a trade-off between the provided accuracy
and amenability to known techniques. In particular, we observe that given $n$
curves under DTW, one can directly construct a metric that approximates DTW on
this set, permitting the use of the wealth of results on metric spaces for
clustering purposes. The resulting approximations are the first with polynomial
running time and achieve a very similar approximation factor as
state-of-the-art techniques. We apply our results to produce a practical
algorithm approximating $(k,\ell)$-median clustering under DTW.

<p class="mathjax">Algorithmic monoculture arises when many decision-makers rely on the same
algorithm to evaluate applicants. An emerging body of work investigates
possible harms of this kind of homogeneity, but has been limited by the
challenge of incorporating market effects in which the preferences and behavior
of many applicants and decision-makers jointly interact to determine outcomes.
<br />Addressing this challenge, we introduce a tractable theoretical model of
algorithmic monoculture in a two-sided matching market with many participants.
We use the model to analyze outcomes under monoculture (when decision-makers
all evaluate applicants using a common algorithm) and under polyculture (when
decision-makers evaluate applicants independently). All else equal, monoculture
(1) selects less-preferred applicants when noise is well-behaved, (2) matches
more applicants to their top choice, though individual applicants may be worse
off depending on their value to decision-makers and risk tolerance, and (3) is
more robust to disparities in the number of applications submitted.

(STHC) to study the integration of AI in scientific research, focusing on the
human capital of scientists and the external resources available within their
network of collaborators and institutions. We validate our hypotheses on a
large sample of publications from OpenAlex, covering all sciences from 1980 to
2020. We find that the diffusion of AI is strongly driven by social mechanisms
that organize the deployment and creation of human capital that complements the
technology. Our results suggest that AI is pioneered by domain scientists with
a `taste for exploration' and who are embedded in a network rich of computer
scientists, experienced AI scientists and early-career researchers; they also
come from institutions with high citation impact and a relatively strong
publication history on AI. The pattern is similar across scientific
disciplines, the exception being access to high-performance computing (HPC),
which is important in chemistry and the medical sciences but less so in other
fields. Once AI is integrated into research, most adoption factors continue to
influence its subsequent reuse. Implications for the organization and
management of science in the evolving era of AI-driven discovery are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Offline reinforcement learning leverages pre-collected datasets of
transitions to train policies. It can serve as effective initialization for
online algorithms, enhancing sample efficiency and speeding up convergence.
However, when such datasets are limited in size and quality, offline
pre-training can produce sub-optimal policies and lead to degraded online
reinforcement learning performance. In this paper we propose a model-based data
augmentation strategy to maximize the benefits of offline reinforcement
learning pre-training and reduce the scale of data needed to be effective. Our
approach leverages a world model of the environment trained on the offline
dataset to augment states during offline pre-training. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of MuJoCo robotic tasks and our results show it can jump-start
online fine-tuning and substantially reduce - in some cases by an order of
magnitude - the required number of environment interactions.

<p class="mathjax">High force/torque (F/T) sensor calibration accuracy is crucial to achieving
successful force estimation/control tasks with humanoid robots.
State-of-the-art affine calibration models do not always approximate correctly
the physical phenomenon of the sensor/transducer, resulting in inaccurate F/T
measurements for specific applications such as thrust estimation of a
jet-powered humanoid robot. This paper proposes and validates nonlinear
polynomial models for F/T calibration, increasing the number of model
coefficients to minimize the estimation residuals. The analysis of several
models, based on the data collected from experiments with the iCub3 robot,
shows a significant improvement in minimizing the force/torque estimation error
when using higher-degree polynomials. In particular, when using a 4th-degree
polynomial model, the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) decreased to 2.28N from the
4.58N obtained with an affine model, and the absolute error in the forces
remained under 6N while it was reaching up to 16N with the affine model.

<p class="mathjax">Many real world data, particularly in the natural sciences and computer
vision, lie on known Riemannian manifolds such as spheres, tori or the group of
rotation matrices. The predominant approaches to learning a distribution on
such a manifold require solving a differential equation in order to sample from
the model and evaluate densities. The resulting sampling times are slowed down
by a high number of function evaluations. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach which only requires a single function evaluation followed
by a projection to the manifold. Training is achieved by an adaptation of the
recently proposed free-form flow framework to Riemannian manifolds. The central
idea is to estimate the gradient of the negative log-likelihood via a trace
evaluated in the tangent space. We evaluate our method on various manifolds,
and find significantly faster inference at competitive performance compared to
previous work. We make our code public at https://github.com/vislearn/FFF.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to harness labeled source data to
train models for unlabeled target data. Despite extensive research in domains
like computer vision and natural language processing, UDA remains underexplored
for time series data, which has widespread real-world applications ranging from
medicine and manufacturing to earth observation and human activity recognition.
Our paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating UDA techniques for time series classification, with a focus on deep
learning methods. We provide seven new benchmark datasets covering various
domain shifts and temporal dynamics, facilitating fair and standardized UDA
method assessments with state of the art neural network backbones (e.g.
Inception) for time series data. This benchmark offers insights into the
strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches while preserving the
unsupervised nature of domain adaptation, making it directly applicable to
practical problems. Our paper serves as a vital resource for researchers and
practitioners, advancing domain adaptation solutions for time series data and
fostering innovation in this critical field. The implementation code of this
benchmark is available at https://github.com/EricssonResearch/UDA-4-TSC.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel vision-based proprioception approach for a soft
robotic finger capable of estimating and reconstructing tactile interactions in
terrestrial and aquatic environments. The key to this system lies in the
finger's unique metamaterial structure, which facilitates omni-directional
passive adaptation during grasping, protecting delicate objects across diverse
scenarios. A compact in-finger camera captures high-framerate images of the
finger's deformation during contact, extracting crucial tactile data in real
time. We present a method of the volumetric discretized model of the soft
finger and use the geometry constraints captured by the camera to find the
optimal estimation of the deformed shape. The approach is benchmarked with a
motion-tracking system with sparse markers and a haptic device with dense
measurements. Both results show state-of-the-art accuracies, with a median
error of 1.96 mm for overall body deformation, corresponding to 2.1$\%$ of the
finger's length. More importantly, the state estimation is robust in both
on-land and underwater environments as we demonstrate its usage for underwater
object shape sensing. This combination of passive adaptation and real-time
tactile sensing paves the way for amphibious robotic grasping applications.

<p class="mathjax">Efficiently computing spatio-textual queries has become increasingly
important in various applications that need to quickly retrieve geolocated
entities associated with textual information, such as in location-based
services and social networks. To accelerate such queries, several works have
proposed combining spatial and textual indices into hybrid index structures.
Recently, the novel idea of replacing traditional indices with ML models has
attracted a lot of attention. This includes works on learned spatial indices,
where the main challenge is to address the lack of a total ordering among
objects in a multidimensional space. In this work, we investigate how to extend
this novel type of index design to the case of spatio-textual data. We study
different design choices, based on either loose or tight coupling between the
spatial and textual part, as well as a hybrid index that combines a traditional
and a learned component. We also perform an experimental evaluation using
several real-world datasets to assess the potential benefits of using a learned
index for evaluating spatio-textual queries.

<p class="mathjax">Designing reward functions that guide generative molecular design (GMD)
algorithms to desirable areas of chemical space is of critical importance in
AI-driven drug discovery. Traditionally, this has been a manual and error-prone
task; the selection of appropriate computational methods to approximate
biological assays is challenging and the aggregation of computed values into a
single score even more so, leading to potential reliance on trial-and-error
approaches. We propose a novel approach for automated reward configuration that
relies solely on experimental data, mitigating the challenges of manual reward
adjustment on drug discovery projects. Our method achieves this by constructing
a ranking over experimental data based on Pareto dominance over the
multi-objective space, then training a neural network to approximate the reward
function such that rankings determined by the predicted reward correlate with
those determined by the Pareto dominance relation. We validate our method using
two case studies. In the first study we simulate Design-Make-Test-Analyse
(DMTA) cycles by alternating reward function updates and generative runs guided
by that function. We show that the learned function adapts over time to yield
compounds that score highly with respect to evaluation functions taken from the
literature. In the second study we apply our algorithm to historical data from
four real drug discovery projects. We show that our algorithm yields reward
functions that outperform the predictive accuracy of human-defined functions,
achieving an improvement of up to 0.4 in Spearman's correlation against a
ground truth evaluation function that encodes the target drug profile for that
project. Our method provides an efficient data-driven way to configure reward
functions for GMD, and serves as a strong baseline for future research into
transformative approaches for the automation of drug discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene
reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to
large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to
their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt
to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough
with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we present
PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system which performs high-fidelity surface
reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real time. To handle large-scale
indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which
dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within
a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and
improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation,
PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features. We also
incorporate multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency
feature, smoothness, and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we
propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe
database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental
results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction
results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in
small and large-scale indoor environments). The code will be open-sourced upon
paper acceptance.

formalising programs using Kripke structures, and then model checking the
system is an established workflow in program verification and has wide
applications in AI. In this paper, we consider the task of model enumeration,
which asks for a uniform stream of output systems that satisfy the given

falsified by the formula), enumerating satisfying submodels is always hard for
CTL - regardless of which subset of CTL operators is considered. As a silver
lining on the horizon, we present fragments via restrictions on the allowed
Boolean functions that still allow for fast enumeration.

important special cases such as pricing and contract design, which have been
widely studied in recent literature. However, existing work considers the case
where the principal can only choose a single strategy at every round to
interact with the agent and then observe the agent's revealed preference
through their actions. In this paper, we extend this line of study to allow the
principal to offer a menu of strategies to the agent and learn additionally
from observing the agent's selection from the menu. We provide a thorough
investigation of several online principal-agent problem settings and
characterize their sample complexities, accompanied by the corresponding
algorithms we have developed. We instantiate this paradigm to several important
design problems $-$ including Stackelberg (security) games, contract design,
and information design. Finally, we also explore the connection between our
findings and existing results about online learning in Stackelberg games, and
we offer a solution that can overcome a key hard instance of Peng et al.

<p class="mathjax">The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a surveillance
technology that becomes mandatory in many airspaces. It improves safety,
increases efficiency and reduces air traffic congestion by broadcasting
aircraft navigation data. Yet, ADS-B is vulnerable to spoofing attacks as it
lacks mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being
supplied. None of the existing cryptographic solutions fully meet the backward
compatibility and bandwidth preservation requirements of the standard. Hence,
we propose Extended Security in the Air using TESLA (ESAT), an enhanced
approach that integrates TESLA, phase-overlay modulation techniques and
certificate-based PKI. As a result, entity authentication, data origin
authentication, and data integrity are the security services that ESAT offers.
To assess compliance with the standard, we designed an SDR-based implementation
of ESAT and performed backwards compatibility tests on commercial and general
aviation (GA) ADS-B in receivers. Besides, we calculated the 1090ES band's
activity factor and analyzed the channel occupancy rate according to ITU-R
SM.2256-1 recommendation. Also, we performed a bit error rate analysis of ESAT
messages. The results suggest that ESAT is backward compatible, does not incur
significant communication overhead, and has an error rate that is acceptable
for Eb/No values above 14 dB.

<p class="mathjax">Multivariate time series data are ubiquitous in the application of machine
learning to problems in the physical sciences. Chemiresistive sensor arrays are
highly promising in chemical detection tasks relevant to industrial, safety,
and military applications. Sensor arrays are an inherently multivariate time
series data collection tool which demand rapid and accurate classification of
arbitrary chemical analytes. Previous research has benchmarked data-agnostic
multivariate time series classifiers across diverse multivariate time series
supervised tasks in order to find general-purpose classification algorithms. To
our knowledge, there has yet to be an effort to survey machine learning and
time series classification approaches to chemiresistive hardware sensor arrays
for the detection of chemical analytes. In addition to benchmarking existing
approaches to multivariate time series classifiers, we incorporate findings
from a model survey to propose the novel \textit{ChemTime} approach to sensor
array classification for chemical sensing. We design experiments addressing the
unique challenges of hardware sensor arrays classification including the rapid
classification ability of classifiers and minimization of inference time while
maintaining performance for deployed lightweight hardware sensing devices. We
find that \textit{ChemTime} is uniquely positioned for the chemical sensing
task by combining rapid and early classification of time series with beneficial
inference and high accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">In modern machine learning problems we deal with datasets that are either
distributed by nature or potentially large for which distributing the
computations is usually a standard way to proceed, since centralized algorithms
are in general ineffective. We propose a distributed learning approach for
mixtures of experts (MoE) models with an aggregation strategy to construct a
reduction estimator from local estimators fitted parallelly to distributed
subsets of the data. The aggregation is based on an optimal minimization of an
expected transportation divergence between the large MoE composed of local
estimators and the unknown desired MoE model. We show that the provided
reduction estimator is consistent as soon as the local estimators to be
aggregated are consistent, and its construction is performed by a proposed
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that is computationally effective. We
study the statistical and numerical properties for the proposed reduction
estimator on experiments that demonstrate its performance compared to namely
the global estimator constructed in a centralized way from the full dataset.
For some situations, the computation time is more than ten times faster, for a
comparable performance. Our source codes are publicly available on Github.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning shows promise as a privacy-preserving collaborative
learning technique. Existing heterogeneous federated learning mainly focuses on
skewing the label distribution across clients. However, most approaches suffer
from catastrophic forgetting and concept drift, mainly when the global
distribution of all classes is extremely unbalanced and the data distribution
of the client dynamically evolves over time. In this paper, we study the new
task, i.e., Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL), which addresses
the practical scenario where heterogeneous data distributions exist among
different clients and dynamic tasks within the client. Accordingly, we propose
a novel federated learning framework named Federated Multi-Level Prototypes
(FedMLP) and design federated multi-level regularizations. To mitigate concept
drift, we construct prototypes and semantic prototypes to provide fruitful
generalization knowledge and ensure the continuity of prototype spaces. To
maintain the model stability and consistency of convergence, three
regularizations are introduced as training losses, i.e., prototype-based
regularization, semantic prototype-based regularization, and federated
inter-task regularization. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in various settings.

exceptions, they have mostly been limited to unsupervised settings. We consider
supervised classification problems, and non-decomposable evaluation measures in
such settings. We show that stratified uniform sampling based coresets have
excellent empirical performance that are backed by theoretical guarantees too.
We focus on the F1 score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, two widely used
non-decomposable objective functions that are nontrivial to optimize for and
show that uniform coresets attain a lower bound for coreset size, and have good
empirical performance, comparable with ``smarter'' coreset construction

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the demand for memory and
computation resources is extreme, necessitating the use of leadership-scale
computing platforms for practical domain sizes. This intensive requirement
renders traditional checkpointing methods ineffective due to the significant
slowdown in simulations while saving state data to disk. As we progress towards
exascale and GPU-driven High-Performance Computing (HPC) and confront larger
problem sizes, the choice becomes increasingly stark: to compromise data
fidelity or to reduce resolution. To navigate this challenge, this study
advocates for the use of \textit{in situ} analysis and visualization
techniques. These allow more frequent data "snapshots" to be taken directly
from memory, thus avoiding the need for disruptive checkpointing. We detail our
approach of instrumenting NekRS, a GPU-focused thermal-fluid simulation code
employing the spectral element method (SEM), and describe varied \textit{in
situ} and in transit strategies for data rendering. Additionally, we provide
concrete scientific use-cases and report on runs performed on Polaris, Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility's (ALCF) 44 Petaflop supercomputer and J\"ulich
Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS) Booster, J\"ulich

<p class="mathjax">Sentence embeddings induced with various transformer architectures encode
much semantic and syntactic information in a distributed manner in a
one-dimensional array. We investigate whether specific grammatical information
can be accessed in these distributed representations. Using data from a task
developed to test rule-like generalizations, our experiments on detecting
subject-verb agreement yield several promising results. First, we show that
while the usual sentence representations encoded as one-dimensional arrays do
not easily support extraction of rule-like regularities, a two-dimensional
reshaping of these vectors allows various learning architectures to access such
information. Next, we show that various architectures can detect patterns in
these two-dimensional reshaped sentence embeddings and successfully learn a
model based on smaller amounts of simpler training data, which performs well on
more complex test data. This indicates that current sentence embeddings contain
information that is regularly distributed, and which can be captured when the
embeddings are reshaped into higher dimensional arrays. Our results cast light
on representations produced by language models and help move towards developing
few-shot learning approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future
for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning
methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis
for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological
images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we
present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images,
and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework
is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to
explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple
magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks,
cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain
the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&amp;E) images and transfer the model to
immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of
our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream
tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image
(WSI)-level classification in H\&amp;E field, together with expression level
prediction of IHC marker and tumor identification in IHC field. The
experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the
efficacy of proposed pretext tasks. The codes and models are available at
https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.

<p class="mathjax">When performing tasks like automatic speech recognition or spoken language
understanding for a given utterance, access to preceding text or audio provides
contextual information can improve performance. Considering the recent advances
in generative large language models (LLM), we hypothesize that an LLM could
generate useful context information using the preceding text. With appropriate
prompts, LLM could generate a prediction of the next sentence or abstractive
text like titles or topics. In this paper, we study the use of LLM-generated
context information and propose an approach to distill the generated
information during fine-tuning of self-supervised speech models, which we refer
to as generative context-aware fine-tuning. This approach allows the fine-tuned
model to make improved predictions without access to the true surrounding
segments or to the LLM at inference time, while requiring only a very small
additional context module. We evaluate the proposed approach using the SLUE and
Libri-light benchmarks for several downstream tasks: automatic speech
recognition, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The results show
that generative context-aware fine-tuning outperforms a context injection
fine-tuning approach that accesses the ground-truth previous text, and is
competitive with a generative context injection fine-tuning approach that
requires the LLM at inference time.

<p class="mathjax">Text simplification, crucial in natural language processing, aims to make
texts more comprehensible, particularly for specific groups like visually
impaired Spanish speakers, a less-represented language in this field. In
Spanish, there are few datasets that can be used to create text simplification
systems. Our research has the primary objective to develop a Spanish financial
text simplification dataset. We created a dataset with 5,314 complex and
simplified sentence pairs using established simplification rules. We also
compared our dataset with the simplifications generated from GPT-3, Tuner, and
MT5, in order to evaluate the feasibility of data augmentation using these
systems. In this manuscript we present the characteristics of our dataset and
the findings of the comparisons with other systems. The dataset is available at
Hugging face, saul1917/FEINA.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender models highly depend on user-item
interactions to learn CF representations, thus falling short of recommending
cold-start items. To address this issue, prior studies mainly introduce item
features (e.g., thumbnails) for cold-start item recommendation. They learn a
feature extractor on warm-start items to align feature representations with
interactions, and then leverage the feature extractor to extract the feature
representations of cold-start items for interaction prediction. Unfortunately,
the features of cold-start items, especially the popular ones, tend to diverge
from those of warm-start ones due to temporal feature shifts, preventing the
feature extractor from accurately learning feature representations of
cold-start items.
<br />To alleviate the impact of temporal feature shifts, we consider using
Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to enhance the generation ability of
the feature extractor. Nonetheless, existing DRO methods face an inconsistency
issue: the worse-case warm-start items emphasized during DRO training might not
align well with the cold-start item distribution. To capture the temporal
feature shifts and combat this inconsistency issue, we propose a novel temporal
DRO with new optimization objectives, namely, 1) to integrate a worst-case
factor to improve the worst-case performance, and 2) to devise a shifting
factor to capture the shifting trend of item features and enhance the
optimization of the potentially popular groups in cold-start items. Substantial
experiments on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of our
temporal DRO in enhancing the generalization ability of cold-start recommender
models.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the challenge of achieving rapid learning in physical
environments, this paper presents the development and training of a robotic
system designed to navigate and solve a labyrinth game using model-based
reinforcement learning techniques. The method involves extracting
low-dimensional observations from camera images, along with a cropped and
rectified image patch centered on the current position within the labyrinth,
providing valuable information about the labyrinth layout. The learning of a
control policy is performed purely on the physical system using model-based
reinforcement learning, where the progress along the labyrinth's path serves as
a reward signal. Additionally, we exploit the system's inherent symmetries to
augment the training data. Consequently, our approach learns to successfully
solve a popular real-world labyrinth game in record time, with only 5 hours of
real-world training data.

<p class="mathjax">Online video super-resolution (online-VSR) highly relies on an effective
alignment module to aggregate temporal information, while the strict latency
requirement makes accurate and efficient alignment very challenging. Though
much progress has been achieved, most of the existing online-VSR methods
estimate the motion fields of each frame separately to perform alignment, which
is computationally redundant and ignores the fact that the motion fields of
adjacent frames are correlated. In this work, we propose an efficient Temporal
Motion Propagation (TMP) method, which leverages the continuity of motion field
to achieve fast pixel-level alignment among consecutive frames. Specifically,
we first propagate the offsets from previous frames to the current frame, and
then refine them in the neighborhood, which significantly reduces the matching
space and speeds up the offset estimation process. Furthermore, to enhance the
robustness of alignment, we perform spatial-wise weighting on the warped
features, where the positions with more precise offsets are assigned higher
importance. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TMP
method achieves leading online-VSR accuracy as well as inference speed. The

<p class="mathjax">Amphion is a toolkit for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation. Its purpose is
to support reproducible research and help junior researchers and engineers get
started in the field of audio, music, and speech generation research and
development. Amphion offers a unique feature: visualizations of classic models
or architectures. We believe that these visualizations are beneficial for
junior researchers and engineers who wish to gain a better understanding of the
model. The North-Star objective of Amphion is to offer a platform for studying
the conversion of any inputs into general audio. Amphion is designed to support
individual generation tasks. In addition to the specific generation tasks,
Amphion also includes several vocoders and evaluation metrics. A vocoder is an
important module for producing high-quality audio signals, while evaluation
metrics are critical for ensuring consistent metrics in generation tasks. In
this paper, we provide a high-level overview of Amphion.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the omnipresence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the interest
towards editable implicit 3D representations has surged over the last years.
However, editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is
difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the
model parameters. Despite these challenges, recent research has shown first
promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits.
The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity, a lack of
support for local edits and large memory requirements, rendering them less
useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF, a unified
framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of
NeRFs. To tackle local editing, we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for
region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final
output color, which can optionally be supervised by a style loss, resulting in
a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance
editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping,
we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee
interactivity, we compose the output color using a set of learned, modifiable
base colors, composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work,
LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Obsolete devices add to the rising levels of electronic waste, a major
environmental concern, and a contributing factor to climate change. In recent
years, device manufacturers have established environmental commitments and
launched initiatives such as supporting the recycling of obsolete devices by
making more ways available for consumers to safely dispose of their old
devices. However, little support is available for individuals who want to
continue using legacy or 'end-of-life' devices and few studies have explored
the usefulness of these older devices, the barriers to their continued use and
the associated user experiences. With a human-computer interaction lens, this
paper reflects on device usefulness as a function of utility and usability, and
on the barriers to continued device use and app installation. Additionally, the
paper contributes insights from a sequel study that extends on prior work
evaluating app functionality of a 'vintage' Apple device with new empirical
data on app downloadability and functionality for the same device when newly
classified as 'obsolete'. A total of 230 apps, comprising the top 10 free App
Store apps for each of 23 categories, were assessed for downloadability and
functionality on an Apple iPad Mini tablet. Although only 20 apps (8.7%) could
be downloaded directly onto the newly obsolete device, 143 apps (62.2%) could
be downloaded with the use of a different non-legacy device. Of these 163
downloadable apps, 131 apps (com-prising 57% of all 230 apps and 80.4% of the
downloadable apps) successfully installed, opened, and functioned. This was a
decrease of only 4.3% in functional apps (of the 230 total apps) compared to
the performance of the device when previously classified as 'vintage'.

<p class="mathjax">We consider partitions of a point set into two parts, and the lengths of the
minimum spanning trees of the original set and of the two parts. If $w(P)$
denotes the length of a minimum spanning tree of $P$, we show that every set
$P$ of $n \geq 12$ points admits a bipartition $P= R \cup B$ for which the
ratio $\frac{w(R)+w(B)}{w(P)}$ is strictly larger than $1$; and that $1$ is the
largest number with this property. Furthermore, we provide a very fast
algorithm that computes such a bipartition in $O(1)$ time and one that computes
the corresponding ratio in $O(n \log{n})$ time. In certain settings, a ratio
larger than $1$ can be expected and sometimes guaranteed. For example, if $P$
is a set of $n$ random points uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$ ($n \to
\infty$), then for any $\eps&gt;0$, the above ratio in a maximizing partition is
at least $\sqrt2 -\eps$ with probability tending to $1$. As another example, if
$P$ is a set of $n$ points with spread at most $\alpha \sqrt{n}$, for some
constant $\alpha&gt;0$, then the aforementioned ratio in a maximizing partition is
$1 + \Omega(\alpha^{-2})$. All our results and techniques are extendable to
higher dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">The rising popularity of ChatGPT and other AI-powered large language models
(LLMs) has led to increasing studies highlighting their susceptibility to
mistakes and biases. However, most of these studies focus on models trained on
English texts. Taking an innovative approach, this study investigates political
biases in GPT's multilingual models. We posed the same question about
high-profile political issues in the United States and China to GPT in both
English and simplified Chinese, and our analysis of the bilingual responses
revealed that GPT's bilingual models' political "knowledge" (content) and the
political "attitude" (sentiment) are significantly more inconsistent on
political issues in China. The simplified Chinese GPT models not only tended to
provide pro-China information but also presented the least negative sentiment
towards China's problems, whereas the English GPT was significantly more
negative towards China. This disparity may stem from Chinese state censorship
and US-China geopolitical tensions, which influence the training corpora of GPT
bilingual models. Moreover, both Chinese and English models tended to be less
critical towards the issues of "their own" represented by the language used,
than the issues of "the other." This suggests that GPT multilingual models
could potentially develop a "political identity" and an associated sentiment
bias based on their training language. We discussed the implications of our
findings for information transmission and communication in an increasingly
divided world.

<p class="mathjax">We describe and analyze a quasi-Trefftz DG method for solving boundary value
problems for the homogeneous diffusion-advection-reaction equation with
piecewise-smooth coefficients. Trefftz schemes are high-order Galerkin methods
whose discrete functions are elementwise exact solutions of the underlying PDE.
Trefftz basis functions can be computed for many PDEs that are linear,
homogeneous and with piecewise-constant coefficients. However, if the equation
has varying coefficients, in general, exact solutions are unavailable, hence
the construction of discrete Trefftz spaces is impossible. Quasi-Trefftz
methods have been introduced to overcome this limitation, relying on discrete
spaces of functions that are elementwise "approximate solutions" of the PDE. A
space-time quasi-Trefftz DG method for the acoustic wave equation with smoothly
varying coefficients has recently been studied; since it has shown excellent
results, we propose a related method that can be applied to second-order
elliptic equations. The DG weak formulation is derived using an interior
penalty parameter and the upwind numerical fluxes. We choose polynomial
quasi-Trefftz basis functions, whose coefficients can be computed with a simple
algorithm based on the Taylor expansion of the PDE's coefficients. The main
advantage of Trefftz and quasi-Trefftz schemes over more classical ones is the
higher accuracy for comparable numbers of degrees of freedom. We prove that the
dimension of the quasi-Trefftz space is smaller than the dimension of the full
polynomial space of the same degree and that yields the same optimal
convergence rates. The quasi-Trefftz DG method is well-posed, consistent and
stable and we prove its high-order convergence. We present some numerical
experiments in two dimensions that show excellent properties in terms of
approximation and convergence rate.

<p class="mathjax">Since smart cities aim at becoming self-monitoring and self-response systems,
their deployment relies on close resource monitoring through large-scale urban
sensing. The subsequent gathering of massive amounts of data makes essential
the development of event-filtering mechanisms that enable the selection of what
is relevant and trustworthy. Due to the rise of mobile event producers,
location information has become a valuable filtering criterion, as it not only
offers extra information on the described event, but also enhances trust in the
producer. Implementing mechanisms that validate the quality of location
information becomes then imperative. The lack of such strategies in cloud
architectures compels the adoption of new communication schemes for Internet of
Things (IoT)-based urban services. To serve the demand for location
verification in urban event-based systems (DEBS), we have designed three
different fog architectures that combine proximity and cloud communication. We
have used network simulations with realistic urban traces to prove that the
three of them can correctly identify between 73% and 100% of false location
claims.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the decomposition of convolutional kernels for lightweight CNNs being
well studied, existing works that rely on tensor network diagrams or
hyperdimensional abstraction lack geometry intuition. This work devises a new
perspective by linking a 3D-reshaped kernel tensor to its various slice-wise
and rank-1 decompositions, permitting a straightforward connection between
various tensor approximations and efficient CNN modules. Specifically, it is
discovered that a pointwise-depthwise-pointwise (PDP) configuration constitutes
a viable construct for lightweight CNNs. Moreover, a novel link to the latest
ShiftNet is established, inspiring a first-ever shift layer pruning that
achieves nearly 50% compression with &lt; 1% drop in accuracy for ShiftResNet.

<p class="mathjax">CNC manufacturing is a process that employs computer numerical control (CNC)
machines to govern the movements of various industrial tools and machinery,
encompassing equipment ranging from grinders and lathes to mills and CNC
routers. However, the reliance on manual CNC programming has become a
bottleneck, and the requirement for expert knowledge can result in significant
costs. Therefore, we introduce a pioneering approach named CNC-Net,
representing the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) to simulate CNC machines
and grasp intricate operations when supplied with raw materials. CNC-Net
constitutes a self-supervised framework that exclusively takes an input 3D
model and subsequently generates the essential operation parameters required by
the CNC machine to construct the object. Our method has the potential to
transformative automation in manufacturing by offering a cost-effective
alternative to the high costs of manual CNC programming while maintaining
exceptional precision in 3D object production. Our experiments underscore the
effectiveness of our CNC-Net in constructing the desired 3D objects through the
utilization of CNC operations. Notably, it excels in preserving finer local
details, exhibiting a marked enhancement in precision compared to the
state-of-the-art 3D CAD reconstruction approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid progression of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, facilitated by
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), has resulted in their widespread
application to provide human assistance across diverse industries. This trend
has sparked significant discourse centered around the ever-increasing need for
LLM-based AI systems to function among humans as part of human society, sharing
human values, especially as these systems are deployed in high-stakes settings
(e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, etc.). Towards this end, neurosymbolic
AI systems are attractive due to their potential to enable easy-to-understand
and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision-making, by
leveraging explicit representations of shared values. In this paper, we
introduce substantial extensions to Khaneman's System one/two framework and
propose a neurosymbolic computational framework called Value-Inspired AI (VAI).
It outlines the crucial components essential for the robust and practical
implementation of VAI systems, aiming to represent and integrate various
dimensions of human values. Finally, we further offer insights into the current
progress made in this direction and outline potential future directions for the
field.

<p class="mathjax">Natural language understanding (NLU) using neural network pipelines often
requires additional context that is not solely present in the input data.
Through Prior research, it has been evident that NLU benchmarks are susceptible
to manipulation by neural models, wherein these models exploit statistical
artifacts within the encoded external knowledge to artificially inflate
performance metrics for downstream tasks. Our proposed approach, known as the
Recap, Deliberate, and Respond (RDR) paradigm, addresses this issue by
incorporating three distinct objectives within the neural network pipeline.
Firstly, the Recap objective involves paraphrasing the input text using a
paraphrasing model in order to summarize and encapsulate its essence. Secondly,
the Deliberation objective entails encoding external graph information related
to entities mentioned in the input text, utilizing a graph embedding model.
Finally, the Respond objective employs a classification head model that
utilizes representations from the Recap and Deliberation modules to generate
the final prediction. By cascading these three models and minimizing a combined
loss, we mitigate the potential for gaming the benchmark and establish a robust
method for capturing the underlying semantic patterns, thus enabling accurate
predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RDR method, we conduct tests
on multiple GLUE benchmark tasks. Our results demonstrate improved performance
compared to competitive baselines, with an enhancement of up to 2\% on standard
metrics. Furthermore, we analyze the observed evidence for semantic
understanding exhibited by RDR models, emphasizing their ability to avoid
gaming the benchmark and instead accurately capture the true underlying
semantic patterns.

<p class="mathjax">Video recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent
studies show that style transfer-based and patch-based unrestricted
perturbations can effectively improve attack efficiency. These attacks,
however, face two main challenges: 1) Adding large stylized perturbations to
all pixels reduces the naturalness of the video and such perturbations can be
easily detected. 2) Patch-based video attacks are not extensible to targeted
attacks due to the limited search space of reinforcement learning that has been
widely used in video attacks recently. In this paper, we focus on the video
black-box setting and propose a novel attack framework named LogoStyleFool by
adding a stylized logo to the clean video. We separate the attack into three
stages: style reference selection, reinforcement-learning-based logo style
transfer, and perturbation optimization. We solve the first challenge by
scaling down the perturbation range to a regional logo, while the second
challenge is addressed by complementing an optimization stage after
reinforcement learning. Experimental results substantiate the overall
superiority of LogoStyleFool over three state-of-the-art patch-based attacks in
terms of attack performance and semantic preservation. Meanwhile, LogoStyleFool
still maintains its performance against two existing patch-based defense
methods. We believe that our research is beneficial in increasing the attention
of the security community to such subregional style transfer attacks.

<p class="mathjax">We present a modular approach to \emph{reinforcement learning} (RL) in
environments consisting of simpler components evolving in parallel. A
monolithic view of such modular environments may be prohibitively large to
learn, or may require unrealizable communication between the components in the
form of a centralized controller. Our proposed approach is based on the
assume-guarantee paradigm where the optimal control for the individual
components is synthesized in isolation by making \emph{assumptions} about the
behaviors of neighboring components, and providing \emph{guarantees} about
their own behavior. We express these \emph{assume-guarantee contracts} as
regular languages and provide automatic translations to scalar rewards to be
used in RL. By combining local probabilities of satisfaction for each
component, we provide a lower bound on the probability of satisfaction of the
complete system. By solving a Markov game for each component, RL can produce a
controller for each component that maximizes this lower bound. The controller
utilizes the information it receives through communication, observations, and
any knowledge of a coarse model of other agents. We experimentally demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed approach on a variety of case studies.

<p class="mathjax">Compressive learning is an emerging approach to drastically reduce the memory
footprint of large-scale learning, by first summarizing a large dataset into a
low-dimensional sketch vector, and then decoding from this sketch the latent
information needed for learning. In light of recent progress on information
preservation guarantees for sketches based on random features, a major
objective is to design easy-to-tune algorithms (called decoders) to robustly
and efficiently extract this information. To address the underlying non-convex
optimization problems, various heuristics have been proposed. In the case of
compressive clustering, the standard heuristic is CL-OMPR, a variant of sliding
Frank-Wolfe. Yet, CL-OMPR is hard to tune, and the examination of its
robustness was overlooked. In this work, we undertake a scrutinized examination
of CL-OMPR to circumvent its limitations. In particular, we show how this
algorithm can fail to recover the clusters even in advantageous scenarios. To
gain insight, we show how the deficiencies of this algorithm can be attributed
to optimization difficulties related to the structure of a correlation function
appearing at core steps of the algorithm. To address these limitations, we
propose an alternative decoder offering substantial improvements over CL-OMPR.
Its design is notably inspired from the mean shift algorithm, a classic
approach to detect the local maxima of kernel density estimators. The proposed
algorithm can extract clustering information from a sketch of the MNIST dataset
that is 10 times smaller than previously.

<p class="mathjax">This work lies at the intersection of two cutting edge technologies
envisioned to proliferate in future 6G wireless systems: Multi-access Edge
Computing (MEC) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). While the
former will bring a powerful information technology environment at the wireless
edge, the latter will enhance communication performance, thanks to the
possibility of adapting wireless propagation as per end users' convenience,
according to specific service requirements. We propose a joint optimization of
radio, computing, and wireless environment reconfiguration through an RIS, with
the goal of enabling low power computation offloading services with reliability
guarantees. Going beyond previous works on this topic, multi-carrier frequency
selective RIS elements' responses and wireless channels are considered. This
opens new challenges in RIS optimization, accounting for frequency dependent
RIS response profiles, which strongly affect RIS-aided wireless links and, as a
consequence, MEC service performance. We formulate an optimization problem
accounting for short and long-term constraints involving device transmit power
allocation across multiple subcarriers and local computing resources, as well
as RIS reconfiguration parameters according to a recently developed Lorentzian
model. Besides a theoretical optimization framework, numerical results show the
effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling low power reliable computation
offloading over RIS-aided frequency selective channels.

<p class="mathjax">Can large language models assist in data discovery? Data discovery
predominantly happens via search on a data portal or the web, followed by
assessment of the dataset to ensure it is fit for the intended purpose. The
ability of conversational generative AI (CGAI) to support recommendations with
reasoning implies it can suggest datasets to users, explain why it has done so,
and provide information akin to documentation regarding the dataset in order to
support a use decision. We hold 3 workshops with data users and find that,
despite limitations around web capabilities, CGAIs are able to suggest relevant
datasets and provide many of the required sensemaking activities, as well as
support dataset analysis and manipulation. However, CGAIs may also suggest
fictional datasets, and perform inaccurate analysis. We identify emerging
practices in data discovery and present a model of these to inform future
research directions and data prompt design.

<p class="mathjax">This work concerns the construction and characterization of product kernels
for multivariate approximation from a finite set of discrete samples. To this
end, we consider composing different component kernels, each acting on a
low-dimensional Euclidean space. Due to Aronszajn (1950), the product of
positive semi-definite kernel functions is again positive semi-definite, where,
moreover, the corresponding native space is a particular instance of a tensor
product, referred to as Hilbert tensor product. We first analyze the general
problem of multivariate interpolation by product kernels. Then, we further
investigate the tensor product structure, in particular for grid-like samples.
We use this case to show that the product of strictly positive definite kernel
functions is again strictly positive definite. Moreover, we develop an
efficient computation scheme for the well-known Newton basis. Supporting
numerical examples show the good performance of product kernels, especially for
their flexibility.

<p class="mathjax">Peer learning is a novel high-level reinforcement learning framework for
agents learning in groups. While standard reinforcement learning trains an
individual agent in trial-and-error fashion, all on its own, peer learning
addresses a related setting in which a group of agents, i.e., peers, learns to
master a task simultaneously together from scratch. Peers are allowed to
communicate only about their own states and actions recommended by others:
"What would you do in my situation?". Our motivation is to study the learning
behavior of these agents. We formalize the teacher selection process in the
action advice setting as a multi-armed bandit problem and therefore highlight
the need for exploration. Eventually, we analyze the learning behavior of the
peers and observe their ability to rank the agents' performance within the
study group and understand which agents give reliable advice. Further, we
compare peer learning with single agent learning and a state-of-the-art action
advice baseline. We show that peer learning is able to outperform single-agent
learning and the baseline in several challenging discrete and continuous OpenAI
Gym domains. Doing so, we also show that within such a framework complex
policies from action recommendations beyond discrete action spaces can evolve.

<p class="mathjax">Images acquired in hazy conditions have degradations induced in them.
Dehazing such images is a vexed and ill-posed problem. Scores of prior-based
and learning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate the effect of haze
and generate haze-free images. Many conventional methods are constrained by
their lack of awareness regarding scene depth and their incapacity to capture
long-range dependencies. In this paper, a method that uses residual learning
and vision transformers in an attention module is proposed. It essentially
comprises two networks: In the first one, the network takes the ratio of a hazy
image and the approximated transmission matrix to estimate a residual map. The
second network takes this residual image as input and passes it through
convolution layers before superposing it on the generated feature maps. It is
then passed through global context and depth-aware transformer encoders to
obtain channel attention. The attention module then infers the spatial
attention map before generating the final haze-free image. Experimental
results, including several quantitative metrics, demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of the suggested methodology.

<p class="mathjax">Ad hoc architectures have emerged as a valuable alternative to centralized
participatory sensing systems due to their infrastructureless nature, which
ensures good availability, easy maintenance and direct user communication. As a
result, they need to incorporate content-aware assessment mechanisms to deal
with a common problem in participatory sensing: information assessment. Easy
contribution encourages users participation and improves the sensing task but
may result in large amounts of data, which may not be valid or relevant.
Currently, prioritization is the only totally ad hoc scheme to assess
user-generated alerts. This strategy prevents duplicates from congesting the
network. However, it does not include the assessment of every generated alert
and does not deal with low-quality or irrelevant alerts. In order to ensure
users receive only interesting alerts and the network is not compromised, we
propose two collaborative alert assessment mechanisms that, while keeping the
network flat, provide an effective message filter. Both of them rely on
opportunistic collaboration with nearby peers. By simulating their behavior in
a real urban area, we have proved them able to decrease network load while
maintaining alert delivery ratio.

<p class="mathjax">The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for
their adoption in the high-stakes domain of healthcare. Specifically, the
application of LLMs in patient-trial matching, which involves assessing patient
eligibility against clinical trial's nuanced inclusion and exclusion criteria,
has shown promise. Recent research has shown that GPT-3.5, a widely recognized
LLM developed by OpenAI, can outperform existing methods with minimal 'variable
engineering' by simply comparing clinical trial information against patient
summaries. However, there are significant challenges associated with using
closed-source proprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5 in practical healthcare
applications, such as cost, privacy and reproducibility concerns. To address
these issues, this study presents the first systematic examination of the
efficacy of both proprietary (GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) and open-source LLMs (LLAMA
7B,13B, and 70B) for the task of patient-trial matching. Employing a
multifaceted evaluation framework, we conducted extensive automated and
human-centric assessments coupled with a detailed error analysis for each
model. To enhance the adaptability of open-source LLMs, we have created a
specialized synthetic dataset utilizing GPT-4, enabling effective fine-tuning
under constrained data conditions. Our findings reveal that open-source LLMs,
when fine-tuned on this limited and synthetic dataset, demonstrate performance
parity with their proprietary counterparts. This presents a massive opportunity
for their deployment in real-world healthcare applications. To foster further
research and applications in this field, we release both the annotated
evaluation dataset along with the fine-tuned LLM -- Trial-LLAMA -- for public
use.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in learning techniques have garnered attention for their
applicability to a diverse range of real-world sequential decision-making
problems. Yet, many practical applications have critical constraints for
operation in real environments. Most learning solutions often neglect the risk
of failing to meet these constraints, hindering their implementation in
real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware decision-making
framework for contextual bandit problems, accommodating constraints and
continuous action spaces. Our approach employs an actor multi-critic
architecture, with each critic characterizing the distribution of performance
and constraint metrics. Our framework is designed to cater to various risk
levels, effectively balancing constraint satisfaction against performance. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we first compare it against
state-of-the-art baseline methods in a synthetic environment, highlighting the
impact of intrinsic environmental noise across different risk configurations.
Finally, we evaluate our framework in a real-world use case involving a 5G
mobile network where only our approach consistently satisfies the system
constraint (a signal processing reliability target) with a small performance
toll (8.5% increase in power consumption).

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving linear numeric
planning problems, called Symbolic Pattern Planning. Given a planning problem
$\Pi$, a bound $n$ and a pattern -- defined as an arbitrary sequence of actions
-- we encode the problem of finding a plan for $\Pi$ with bound $n$ as a
formula with fewer variables and/or clauses than the state-of-the-art rolled-up
and relaxed-relaxed-$\exists$ encodings. More importantly, we prove that for
any given bound, it is never the case that the latter two encodings allow
finding a valid plan while ours does not. On the experimental side, we consider
6 other planning systems -- including the ones which participated in this
year's International Planning Competition (IPC) -- and we show that our planner
Patty has remarkably good comparative performances on this year's IPC problems.

<p class="mathjax">The number and complexity of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is
growing relentlessly. As a result, even with the many algorithmic and
mathematical advances experienced over past decades as well as the impressive
energy efficiency and computational capacity of current hardware accelerators,
training the most powerful and popular deep neural networks comes at very high
economic and environmental costs. Recognising that additional optimisations of
conventional neural network training is very difficult, this work takes a
radically different approach by proposing GreenLightningAI, a new AI system
design consisting of a linear model that is capable of emulating the behaviour
of deep neural networks by subsetting the model for each particular sample. The
new AI system stores the information required to select the system subset for a
given sample (referred to as structural information) separately from the linear
model parameters (referred to as quantitative knowledge). In this paper we
present a proof of concept, showing that the structural information stabilises
far earlier than the quantitative knowledge. Additionally, we show
experimentally that the structural information can be kept unmodified when
re-training the AI system with new samples while still achieving a validation
accuracy similar to that obtained when re-training a neural network with
similar size. Since the proposed AI system is based on a linear model, multiple
copies of the model, trained with different datasets, can be easily combined.
This enables faster and greener (re)-training algorithms, including incremental
re-training and federated incremental re-training.

<p class="mathjax">Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to align with human instructions and enhance their
capabilities in downstream tasks. When the models are required to align with a
broader range of downstream tasks, or there is a desire to notably improve the
performance on a specific task, a substantial increase in fine-tuning data
often emerges as the solution. However, we find that large-scale increases in
instruction data can disrupt the world knowledge previously stored in the LLMs,
i.e., world knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we introduce LoRAMoE to
address above challenge. The LoRAMoE is a plugin version of Mixture of Experts
(MoE). The plugin-form ensures the integrity of world knowledge by freezing the
backbone model during the training phase. And we propose the use of localized
balancing constraints to coordinate parts of experts for task utilization,
meanwhile enables other experts to to fully leverage the world knowledge stored
in the models. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRAMoE can reasonly
coordinate experts based on data type during inference, and even dramatically
increasing instruction data does not result in knowledge forgetting. Moreover,
LoRAMoE provides additional benefits for the performance of downstream tasks,
indicating the potential of our approach for multi-task learning.

<p class="mathjax">The key to performance optimization of a program is to decide correctly when
a certain transformation should be applied by a compiler. Traditionally, such
profitability decisions are made by hand-coded algorithms tuned for a very
small number of benchmarks, usually requiring a great deal of effort to be
retuned when the benchmark suite changes. This is an ideal opportunity to apply
machine-learning models to speed up the tuning process; while this realization
has been around since the late 90s, only recent advancements in ML enabled a
practical application of ML to compilers as an end-to-end framework. Even so,
seamless integration of ML into the compiler would require constant rebuilding
of the compiler when models are updated.
<br />This paper presents ACPO: \textbf{\underline{A}}I-Enabled
\textbf{\underline{C}}ompiler-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}rogram
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization; a novel framework to provide LLVM with
simple and comprehensive tools to benefit from employing ML models for
different optimization passes. We first showcase the high-level view, class
hierarchy, and functionalities of ACPO and subsequently, demonstrate \taco{a
couple of use cases of ACPO by ML-enabling the Loop Unroll and Function
Inlining passes and describe how ACPO can be leveraged to optimize other
passes. Experimental results reveal that ACPO model for Loop Unroll is able to
gain on average 4\% and 3\%, 5.4\%, 0.2\% compared to LLVM's O3 optimization
when deployed on Polybench, Coral-2, CoreMark, and Graph-500, respectively.
Furthermore, by adding the Inliner model as well, ACPO is able to provide up to
4.5\% and 2.4\% on Polybench and Cbench compared with LLVM's O3 optimization,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models represent state-of-the-art linguistic models designed
to equip computers with the ability to comprehend natural language. With its
exceptional capacity to capture complex contextual relationships, the LLaMA
(Large Language Model Meta AI) family represents a novel advancement in the
field of natural language processing by releasing foundational models designed
to improve the natural language understanding abilities of the transformer
architecture thanks to their large amount of trainable parameters (7, 13, and
70 billion parameters). In many natural language understanding tasks, these
models obtain the same performances as private company models such as OpenAI
Chat-GPT with the advantage to make publicly available weights and code for
research and commercial uses. In this work, we investigate the possibility of
Language Adaptation for LLaMA models, explicitly focusing on addressing the
challenge of Italian Language coverage. Adopting an open science approach, we
explore various tuning approaches to ensure a high-quality text generated in
Italian suitable for common tasks in this underrepresented language in the
original models' datasets. We aim to release effective text generation models
with strong linguistic properties for many tasks that seem challenging using
multilingual or general-purpose LLMs. By leveraging an open science philosophy,
this study contributes to Language Adaptation strategies for the Italian
language by introducing the novel LLaMAntino family of Italian LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Graph matching is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, with many
applications such as software analysis and computational biology. One
well-known type of graph matching problem is graph isomorphism, which consists
of deciding if two graphs are identical. Despite its usefulness, the properties
that one may check using graph isomorphism are rather limited, since it only
allows strict equality checks between two graphs. For example, it does not
allow one to check complex structural properties such as if the target graph is
an arbitrary length sequence followed by an arbitrary size loop.
<br />We propose a generalization of graph isomorphism that allows one to check
such properties through a declarative specification. This specification is
given in the form of a Regular Graph Pattern (ReGaP), a special type of graph,
inspired by regular expressions, that may contain wildcard nodes that represent
arbitrary structures such as variable-sized sequences or subgraphs. We propose
a SAT-based algorithm for checking if a target graph matches a given ReGaP. We
also propose a preprocessing technique for improving the performance of the
algorithm and evaluate it through an extensive experimental evaluation on
benchmarks from the CodeSearchNet dataset.

<p class="mathjax">This communication proposes a dual-wideband differentially fed dual-polarized
magnetoelectric (ME) dipole with second-order bandstop filtering for
millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) applications at 24.25-29.5 GHz and 37-43.5 GHz.
Without disturbing the complementary antenna operation, two resonator types
(hairpin and coupled {\lambda}/4 open-/short-circuited stub resonators), are
embedded into the wideband ME dipole to create two transmission poles and two
zeros for sharp band-edge selectivity. This allows independent manipulation of
the transmission poles and zeros and a compact ME dipole size. Across the
operating band, the symmetric filtering antenna design has more than 31.6 dB of
port-to-port isolation. Measured results show symmetrical E- and H-plane
radiation patterns and cross-polarization levels lower than -25.1 dB. The
measured gains of the single element and a 2x2 array are 8.3 dBi and 12.5 dBi,
respectively. Also, the band rejection reaches 23.7 dB and 21.8 dB for single
element and array, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) comprises a wide selection of various
problems similar to those used in human IQ tests. Recent years have brought
dynamic progress in solving particular AVR tasks, however, in the contemporary
literature AVR problems are largely dealt with in isolation, leading to highly
specialized task-specific methods. With the aim of developing universal
learning systems in the AVR domain, we propose the unified model for solving
Single-Choice Abstract visual Reasoning tasks (SCAR), capable of solving
various single-choice AVR tasks, without making any a priori assumptions about
the task structure, in particular the number and location of panels. The
proposed model relies on a novel Structure-Aware dynamic Layer (SAL), which
adapts its weights to the structure of the considered AVR problem. Experiments
conducted on Raven's Progressive Matrices, Visual Analogy Problems, and Odd One
Out problems show that SCAR (SAL-based models, in general) effectively solves
diverse AVR tasks, and its performance is on par with the state-of-the-art
task-specific baselines. What is more, SCAR demonstrates effective knowledge
reuse in multi-task and transfer learning settings. To our knowledge, this work
is the first successful attempt to construct a general single-choice AVR solver
relying on self-configurable architecture and unified solving method. With this
work we aim to stimulate and foster progress on task-independent research paths
in the AVR domain, with the long-term goal of development of a general AVR
solver.

<p class="mathjax">We present a numerical method to learn an accurate predictive model for an
unknown stochastic dynamical system from its trajectory data. The method seeks
to approximate the unknown flow map of the underlying system. It employs the
idea of autoencoder to identify the unobserved latent random variables. In our
approach, we design an encoding function to discover the latent variables,
which are modeled as unit Gaussian, and a decoding function to reconstruct the
future states of the system. Both the encoder and decoder are expressed as deep
neural networks (DNNs). Once the DNNs are trained by the trajectory data, the
decoder serves as a predictive model for the unknown stochastic system. Through
an extensive set of numerical examples, we demonstrate that the method is able
to produce long-term system predictions by using short bursts of trajectory
data. It is also applicable to systems driven by non-Gaussian noises.

in topological data analysis. Previous efforts by Curry et al. and Ghrist et

sets. In this work, we study the invertibility of the ECT on definable sets
that aren't necessarily compact, resulting in a complete classification of
constructible functions that the Euler characteristic transform is not
injective on. We then introduce the quadric Euler characteristic transform
(QECT) as a natural generalization of the ECT by detecting definable shapes
with quadric hypersurfaces rather than hyperplanes. We also discuss some

<p class="mathjax">Answering complex natural language questions often necessitates multi-step
reasoning and integrating external information. Several systems have combined
knowledge retrieval with a large language model (LLM) to answer such questions.
These systems, however, suffer from various failure cases, and we cannot
directly train them end-to-end to fix such failures, as interaction with
external knowledge is non-differentiable. To address these deficiencies, we
define a ReAct-style LLM agent with the ability to reason and act upon external
knowledge. We further refine the agent through a ReST-like method that
iteratively trains on previous trajectories, employing growing-batch
reinforcement learning with AI feedback for continuous self-improvement and
self-distillation. Starting from a prompted large model and after just two
iterations of the algorithm, we can produce a fine-tuned small model that
achieves comparable performance on challenging compositional question-answering
benchmarks with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Many applications, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification and
inverse problems, require repeatedly performing simulations of
large-dimensional physical systems for different choices of parameters. This
can be prohibitively expensive.
<br />In order to save computational cost, one can construct surrogate models by
expressing the system in a low-dimensional basis, obtained from training data.
This is referred to as model reduction.
<br />Past investigations have shown that, when performing model reduction of
Hamiltonian systems, it is crucial to preserve the symplectic structure
associated with the system in order to ensure long-term numerical stability.
<br />Up to this point structure-preserving reductions have largely been limited to
linear transformations. We propose a new neural network architecture in the
spirit of autoencoders, which are established tools for dimension reduction and
feature extraction in data science, to obtain more general mappings.
<br />In order to train the network, a non-standard gradient descent approach is
applied that leverages the differential-geometric structure emerging from the
network design.
<br />The new architecture is shown to significantly outperform existing designs in
accuracy.

this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a
Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while
improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to
output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that
control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the
best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We
release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from
Persona-Chat. We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our
generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and
observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat
during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations.

<p class="mathjax">Policy learning in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) lacks data efficient and
versatile methods that exhibit the desired motion quality for delicate surgical
interventions. To this end, we introduce Movement Primitive Diffusion (MPD), a
novel method for imitation learning (IL) in RAS that focuses on gentle
manipulation of deformable objects. The approach combines the versatility of
diffusion-based imitation learning (DIL) with the high-quality motion
generation capabilities of Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs).
This combination enables MPD to achieve gentle manipulation of deformable
objects, while maintaining data efficiency critical for RAS applications where
demonstration data is scarce. We evaluate MPD across various simulated tasks
and a real world robotic setup on both state and image observations. MPD
outperforms state-of-the-art DIL methods in success rate, motion quality, and
data efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">With the success of self-supervised representations, researchers seek a
better understanding of the information encapsulated within a representation.
Among various interpretability methods, we focus on classification-based linear
probing. We aim to foster a solid understanding and provide guidelines for
linear probing by constructing a novel mathematical framework leveraging
information theory. First, we connect probing with the variational bounds of
mutual information (MI) to relax the probe design, equating linear probing with
fine-tuning. Then, we investigate empirical behaviors and practices of probing
through our mathematical framework. We analyze the layer-wise performance curve
being convex, which seemingly violates the data processing inequality. However,
we show that the intermediate representations can have the biggest MI estimate
because of the tradeoff between better separability and decreasing MI. We
further suggest that the margin of linearly separable representations can be a
criterion for measuring the "goodness of representation." We also compare
accuracy with MI as the measuring criteria. Finally, we empirically validate
our claims by observing the self-supervised speech models on retaining word and
phoneme information.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce an efficient sparse Gaussian process (E-SGP) for
the surrogate modelling of fluid mechanics. This novel Bayesian machine
learning algorithm allows efficient model training using databases of different
structures. It is a further development of the approximated sparse GP
algorithm, combining the concept of efficient GP (E-GP) and variational energy
free sparse Gaussian process (VEF-SGP). The developed E-SGP approach exploits
the arbitrariness of inducing points and the monotonically increasing nature of
the objective function with respect to the number of inducing points in
VEF-SGP. By specifying the inducing points on the orthogonal grid/input
subspace and using the Kronecker product, E-SGP significantly improves
computational efficiency without imposing any constraints on the covariance
matrix or increasing the number of parameters that need to be optimised during
training.
<br />The E-SGP algorithm developed in this paper outperforms E-GP not only in
scalability but also in model quality in terms of mean standardized logarithmic
loss (MSLL). The computational complexity of E-GP suffers from the cubic growth
regarding the growing structured training database. However, E-SGP maintains
computational efficiency whilst the resolution of the model, (i.e., the number
of inducing points) remains fixed. The examples show that E-SGP produces more
accurate predictions in comparison with E-GP when the model resolutions are
similar in both. E-GP benefits from more training data but comes with higher
computational demands, while E-SGP achieves a comparable level of accuracy but
is more computationally efficient, making E-SGP a potentially preferable choice
for fluid mechanic problems. Furthermore, E-SGP can produce more reasonable
estimates of model uncertainty, whilst E-GP is more likely to produce
over-confident predictions.

<p class="mathjax">The process of training a deep neural network is characterized by significant
time requirements and associated costs. Although researchers have made
considerable progress in this area, further work is still required due to
resource constraints. This study examines innovative approaches to expedite the
training process of deep neural networks (DNN), with specific emphasis on three
state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, Vision Transformer (ViT), and
EfficientNet. The research utilizes sophisticated methodologies, including
Gradient Accumulation (GA), Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and Pin Memory
(PM), in order to optimize performance and accelerate the training procedure.
<br />The study examines the effects of these methodologies on the DNN models
discussed earlier, assessing their efficacy with regard to training rate and
computational efficacy. The study showcases the efficacy of including GA as a
strategic approach, resulting in a noteworthy decrease in the duration required
for training. This enables the models to converge at a faster pace. The
utilization of AMP enhances the speed of computations by taking advantage of
the advantages offered by lower precision arithmetic while maintaining the
correctness of the model.
<br />Furthermore, this study investigates the application of Pin Memory as a
strategy to enhance the efficiency of data transmission between the central
processing unit and the graphics processing unit, thereby offering a promising
opportunity for enhancing overall performance. The experimental findings
demonstrate that the combination of these sophisticated methodologies
significantly accelerates the training of DNNs, offering vital insights for
experts seeking to improve the effectiveness of deep learning processes.

<p class="mathjax">We show that existing unsupervised methods on large language model (LLM)
activations do not discover knowledge -- instead they seem to discover whatever
feature of the activations is most prominent. The idea behind unsupervised
knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure,
which can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that
arbitrary features (not just knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a
particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation method,
contrast-consistent search (Burns et al. - <a href="/abs/2212.03827">arXiv:2212.03827</a>). We then present a
series of experiments showing settings in which unsupervised methods result in
classifiers that do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different
prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for
discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks
to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we
hypothesise that the identification issues explored here, e.g. distinguishing a
model's knowledge from that of a simulated character's, will persist for future
unsupervised methods.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive
general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning.
However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level
understanding, falling short of achieving fine-grained vision-language
alignment at the pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data
limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text
instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask
regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual
understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based
region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model
by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Especially, Osprey adopts a
convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware
visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution
input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region
understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction
tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model
(SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics. The source code,
dataset and demo can be found at https://github.com/CircleRadon/Osprey.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have recently emerged as
successful methods for novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction.
However, most current NeRF models either achieve high accuracy using large
model sizes, or achieve high memory-efficiency by trading off accuracy. This
limits the applicable scope of any single model, since high-accuracy models
might not fit in low-memory devices, and memory-efficient models might not
satisfy high-quality requirements. To this end, we present SlimmeRF, a model
that allows for instant test-time trade-offs between model size and accuracy
through slimming, thus making the model simultaneously suitable for scenarios
with different computing budgets. We achieve this through a newly proposed
algorithm named Tensorial Rank Incrementation (TRaIn) which increases the rank
of the model's tensorial representation gradually during training. We also
observe that our model allows for more effective trade-offs in sparse-view
scenarios, at times even achieving higher accuracy after being slimmed. We
credit this to the fact that erroneous information such as floaters tend to be
stored in components corresponding to higher ranks. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/Shiran-Yuan/SlimmeRF.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is not motivated to seek innovation within the attention
mechanism. Instead, it focuses on overcoming the existing trade-offs between
accuracy and efficiency within the context of point cloud processing,
leveraging the power of scale. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in 3D
large-scale representation learning, we recognize that model performance is
more influenced by scale than by intricate design. Therefore, we present Point
Transformer V3 (PTv3), which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over the
accuracy of certain mechanisms that are minor to the overall performance after
scaling, such as replacing the precise neighbor search by KNN with an efficient
serialized neighbor mapping of point clouds organized with specific patterns.
This principle enables significant scaling, expanding the receptive field from
16 to 1024 points while remaining efficient (a 3x increase in processing speed
and a 10x improvement in memory efficiency compared with its predecessor,
PTv2). PTv3 attains state-of-the-art results on over 20 downstream tasks that
span both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Further enhanced with multi-dataset
joint training, PTv3 pushes these results to a higher level.

<p class="mathjax">Livestock feeding behavior is an influential research area for those involved
in animal husbandry and agriculture. In recent years, there has been a growing
interest in automated systems for monitoring the behavior of ruminants. Despite
the developments accomplished in the last decade, there is still much to do and
learn about the methods for measuring and analyzing livestock feeding behavior.
Automated monitoring systems mainly use motion, acoustic, and image sensors to
collect animal behavioral data. The performance evaluation of existing methods
is a complex task and direct comparisons between studies are difficult. Several
factors prevent a direct comparison, starting from the diversity of data and
performance metrics used in the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this
work represents the first tutorial-style review on the analysis of the feeding
behavior of ruminants, emphasizing the relationship between sensing
methodologies, signal processing and computational intelligence methods. It
assesses the main sensing methodologies (i.e. based on movement, sound,
images/videos and pressure) and the main techniques to measure and analyze the
signals associated with feeding behavior, evaluating their use in different
settings and situations. It also highlights the potentiality of automated
monitoring systems to provide valuable information that improves our
understanding of livestock feeding behavior. The relevance of these systems is
increasingly important due to their impact on production systems and research.
Finally, the paper closes by discussing future challenges and opportunities in
livestock feeding behavior monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Optimal control deals with optimization problems in which variables steer a
dynamical system, and its outcome contributes to the objective function. Two
classical approaches to solving these problems are Dynamic Programming and the
Pontryagin Maximum Principle. In both approaches, Hamiltonian equations offer
an interpretation of optimality through auxiliary variables known as costates.
However, Hamiltonian equations are rarely used due to their reliance on
forward-backward algorithms across the entire temporal domain. This paper
introduces a novel neural-based approach to optimal control, with the aim of
working forward-in-time. Neural networks are employed not only for implementing
state dynamics but also for estimating costate variables. The parameters of the
latter network are determined at each time step using a newly introduced local
policy referred to as the time-reversed generalized Riccati equation. This
policy is inspired by a result discussed in the Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem,
which we conjecture stabilizes state dynamics. We support this conjecture by
discussing experimental results from a range of optimal control case studies.

<p class="mathjax">Modeling and prediction of epidemic spread are critical to assist in
policy-making for mitigation. Therefore, we present a new method based on
Gaussian Process Regression to model and predict epidemics, and it quantifies
prediction confidence through variance and high probability error bounds.
Gaussian Process Regression excels in using small datasets and providing
uncertainty bounds, and both of these properties are critical in modeling and
predicting epidemic spreading processes with limited data. However, the
derivation of formal uncertainty bounds remains lacking when using Gaussian
Process Regression in the setting of epidemics, which limits its usefulness in
guiding mitigation efforts. Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel bound
on the variance of the prediction that quantifies the impact of the epidemic
data on the predictions we make. Further, we develop a high probability error
bound on the prediction, and we quantify how the epidemic spread, the infection
data, and the length of the prediction horizon all affect this error bound. We
also show that the error stays below a certain threshold based on the length of
the prediction horizon. To illustrate this framework, we leverage Gaussian
Process Regression to model and predict COVID-19 using real-world infection
data from the United Kingdom.

<p class="mathjax">We present a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) utilizing superconductor
technology. The ALU serves as the central processing unit of a processor,
performing crucial arithmetic and logical operations. We have adopted a
bit-parallel architecture to ensure an efficient and streamlined design with
minimal fanin/fanout and optimal latency. In terms of fabrication, the ALU has
been fabricated using a standard commercial process. It operates at an
impressive clock frequency exceeding 30 GHz while consuming a mere 4.75 mW of
power, including applied reverse current, encompassing static and dynamic
components. The ALU contains over 9000 Josephson junctions, with approximately
7000 JJs dedicated to wiring, delay lines, and path balancing, and it has over
18% bias margin. Designed as a co-processor, this arithmetic logic unit will
work with external CMOS memory and processors via interface circuits. Thorough
testing and validation of the ALU's functionality have been conducted with
digital and analog simulations, and all the components were fabricated and
measured within a 4K pulse-tube cryocooler. Experimental verification has
confirmed the successful operation of both the arithmetic and logic units.
These results have been analyzed and are presented alongside the experimental
data to provide comprehensive insights into the ALU's behavior and
capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Direct observations of earthquake nucleation and propagation are few and yet
the next decade will likely see an unprecedented increase in indirect, surface
observations that must be integrated into modeling efforts. Machine learning
(ML) excels in the presence of large data and is an actively growing field in
seismology. However, not all ML methods incorporate rigorous physics, and
purely data-driven models can predict physically unrealistic outcomes due to
observational bias or extrapolation. Our work focuses on the recently emergent
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which seamlessly integrates data while
ensuring that model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints. In this
work we develop a multi-network PINN for both the forward problem as well as
for direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters, constrained by the
physics of motion in the solid Earth, which have direct implications for
assessing seismic hazard. We present the computational PINN framework for
strike-slip faults in 1D and 2D subject to rate-and-state friction. Initial and
boundary conditions define the data on which the PINN is trained. While the
PINN is capable of approximating the solution to the governing equations to
low-errors, our primary interest lies in the network's capacity to infer
friction parameters during the training loop. We find that the network for the
parameter inversion at the fault performs much better than the network for
material displacements to which it is coupled. Additional training iterations
and model tuning resolves this discrepancy, enabling a robust surrogate model
for solving both forward and inverse problems relevant to seismic faulting.

<p class="mathjax">To overcome the limited payload of lightweight vehicles such as unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) and the aerodynamic constraints on the onboard radar, a
compact nonuniform conformal array is proposed in order to achieve a wide
beamscanning range and to reduce the sidelobes of the planar array. The
non-uniform array consists of 7x4 elements where the inner two rows follow a
geometric sequence while the outer two rows follow an arithmetic sequence along
the x axis. The element spacing along the y axis is gradient from the center as
well. This geometry not only provides more degrees of freedom to optimize the
array radiation, but also reduces the computation cost when synthesizing the
excitation and the configuration of the array for a specific beam pattern. As
field cancellation may happen due to the convex and concave features of the
non-canonical UAV surface, a fast and low-cost in-house code to calculate the
radiation pattern of a large scale conformal array for an arbitrary surface and
element pattern is employed to optimize the array structure. As a proof of
concept, the proposed array with a total volume of 142x93x40 mm3 is implemented
at ISM band (5.8 GHz) using a miniature widebeam single-layer patch antenna
with a dimension of 0.12lambdax0.12lambdax0.025lambda. By using the beamforming
technique, an active onboard system is measured, which achieves the maximum
gain of 21.8 dBi and a scanning range of &gt;50deg and -28deg~28deg with a small
scan loss of 2.2 and 0.5 dB in elevation and azimuth, respectively. Therefore,
our design has high potential for wireless communication and sensing on UAV.

<p class="mathjax">Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by various
artifacts, making artifact removal crucial for improving signal quality in
scenarios such as disease diagnosis and brain-computer interface (BCI). In this
paper, we present a fully convolutional neural architecture, called DTP-Net,
which consists of a Densely Connected Temporal Pyramid (DTP) sandwiched between
a pair of learnable time-frequency transformations for end-to-end
electroencephalogram (EEG) denoising. The proposed method first transforms a
single-channel EEG signal of arbitrary length into the time-frequency domain
via an Encoder layer. Then, noises, such as ocular and muscle artifacts, are
extracted by DTP in a multi-scale fashion and reduced. Finally, a Decoder layer
is employed to reconstruct the artifact-reduced EEG signal. Additionally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of the representation learning behavior of each
module in DTP-Net to substantiate its robustness and reliability. Extensive
experiments conducted on two public semi-simulated datasets demonstrate the
effective artifact removal performance of DTP-Net, which outperforms
state-of-art approaches. Experimental results demonstrate cleaner waveforms and
significant improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Relative Root Mean
Square Error (RRMSE) after denoised by the proposed model. Moreover, the
proposed DTP-Net is applied in a specific BCI downstream task, improving the
classification accuracy by up to 5.55% compared to that of the raw signals,
validating its potential applications in the fields of EEG-based neuroscience
and neuro-engineering.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, we present an innovative method known as a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) model to predict multi-joint kinematics using
electromyography (EMG) signals recorded from the muscles surrounding these
joints across various loads. The primary aim is to simultaneously predict both
the shoulder and elbow joint angles while executing elbow flexion-extension
(FE) movements, especially under varying load conditions. The PINN model is
constructed by combining a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a
joint torque computation model. During the training process, the model utilizes
a custom loss function derived from an inverse dynamics joint torque
musculoskeletal model, along with a mean square angle loss. The training
dataset for the PINN model comprises EMG and time data collected from four
different subjects. To assess the model's performance, we conducted a
comparison between the predicted joint angles and experimental data using a
testing data set. The results demonstrated strong correlations of 58% to 83% in
joint angle prediction. The findings highlight the potential of incorporating
physical principles into the model, not only increasing its versatility but
also enhancing its accuracy. The findings could have significant implications
for the precise estimation of multi-joint kinematics in dynamic scenarios,
particularly concerning the advancement of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the problem of joint active and passive beamforming
for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted massive multiple-input
multiple-output systems towards the extension of the wireless cellular coverage
in 3D, where multiple RISs, each equipped with an array of passive elements,
are deployed to assist a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve multiple
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the same time-frequency resource of 5G
wireless communications. With a focus on ensuring fairness among UAVs, our
objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) at UAVs by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming parameters at the
BS and phase shift parameters at RISs. We propose two novel algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm aims to mitigate interference by
calculating the BS beamforming matrix through matrix inverse operations once
the phase shift parameters are determined. The second one is based on the
principle that one RIS element only serves one UAV and the phase shift
parameter of this RIS element is optimally designed to compensate the phase
offset caused by the propagation and fading. To obtain the optimal parameters,
we utilize one state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, deep
deterministic policy gradient, to solve these two optimization problems.
Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed
solution and some insightful remarks are observed.

<p class="mathjax">The joint alignment of multivariate functional data plays an important role
in various fields such as signal processing, neuroscience and medicine,
including the statistical analysis of data from wearable devices. Traditional
methods often ignore the phase variability and instead focus on the variability
in the observed amplitude. We present a novel method for joint alignment of
multivariate quasi-periodic functions using deep neural networks, decomposing,
but retaining all the information in the data by preserving both phase and
amplitude variability. Our proposed neural network uses a special activation of
the output that builds on the unit simplex transformation, and we utilize a
loss function based on the Fisher-Rao metric to train our model. Furthermore,
our method is unsupervised and can provide an optimal common template function
as well as subject-specific templates. We demonstrate our method on two
simulated datasets and one real example, comprising data from 12-lead 10s

<p class="mathjax">The detection of pilots' mental states is important due to the potential for
their abnormal mental states to result in catastrophic accidents. This study
introduces the feasibility of employing deep learning techniques to classify
different workload levels, specifically normal state, low workload, and high
workload. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to
classify workload levels of pilots. Our approach involves the hybrid deep
neural network that consists of five convolutional blocks and one long
short-term memory block to extract the significant features from
electroencephalography signals. Ten pilots participated in the experiment,
which was conducted within the simulated flight environment. In contrast to
four conventional models, our proposed model achieved a superior grand--average
accuracy of 0.8613, surpassing other conventional models by at least 0.0597 in
classifying workload levels across all participants. Our model not only
successfully classified workload levels but also provided valuable feedback to
the participants. Hence, we anticipate that our study will make the significant
contributions to the advancement of autonomous flight and driving leveraging
artificial intelligence technology in the future.

<p class="mathjax">Electrocardiograms (ECGs), a medical monitoring technology recording cardiac
activity, are widely used for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia. The diagnosis is
based on the analysis of the deformation of the signal shapes due to irregular
heart rates associated with heart diseases. Due to the infeasibility of manual
examination of large volumes of ECG data, this paper aims to propose an
automated AI based system for ECG-based arrhythmia classification. To this
front, a deep learning based solution has been proposed for ECG-based
arrhythmia classification. Twelve lead electrocardiograms (ECG) of length 10
sec from 45, 152 individuals from Shaoxing People's Hospital (SPH) dataset from
PhysioNet with four different types of arrhythmias were used. The sampling
frequency utilized was 500 Hz. Median filtering was used to preprocess the ECG
signals. For every 1 sec of ECG signal, the time-frequency (TF) scalogram was
estimated and stacked row wise to obtain a single image from 12 channels,
resulting in 10 stacked TF scalograms for each ECG signal. These stacked TF
scalograms are fed to the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN), 1D
CNN, and 1D CNN-LSTM (Long short-term memory) models, for arrhythmia
classification. The fine-tuned CNN models obtained the best test accuracy of
about 98% followed by 95% test accuracy by basic CNN-LSTM in arrhythmia
classification.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive Radar Networks, which were popularized by Simon Haykin in 2006,
have been proposed to address limitations with legacy radar installations.
These limitations include large physical size, power consumption, fixed
operating parameters, and single point vulnerabilities. Cognitive radar solves
part of this problem through adaptability, using biologically inspired
techniques to observe the environment and adjust operation accordingly.
Cognitive radar networks extend the capabilities of cognitive radar spatially,
providing the opportunity to observe targets from multiple angles to mitigate
stealth effects; distribute resources over space and in time; obtain better
tracking performance; and gain more information from a scene. Often, problems
of cognition in CRNs are viewed through the lens of iterative learning problems
- one or multiple cognitive processes are implemented in the network, where
each process first observes the environment, then selects operating parameters
(from discrete or continuous options) using the history of observations and
previous rewards, then repeats the cycle. Further, cognitive radar networks
often are implemented with a flexible architecture and wide-bandwidth
front-ends, enabling the addition of electronic support measures such as
passive signal estimation. In this work we consider questions of the form "How
should a cognitive radar network choose when to observe targets?" and "How can
a cognitive radar network reduce the amount of energy it uses?" We implement
tools from the multi-armed bandit and age of information literature to select
modes for the network, choosing either an active radar mode or a passive signal
estimation mode. We show that through the use of target classes, the network
can determine how often each target should be observed to optimize tracking
performance.

<p class="mathjax">Previous research has demonstrated the potential of using pre-trained
language models for decoding open vocabulary Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals captured through a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).
However, the impact of embedding EEG signals in the context of language models
and the effect of subjectivity, remain unexplored, leading to uncertainty about
the best approach to enhance decoding performance. Additionally, current
evaluation metrics used to assess decoding effectiveness are predominantly
syntactic and do not provide insights into the comprehensibility of the decoded
output for human understanding. We present an end-to-end deep learning
framework for non-invasive brain recordings that brings modern representational
learning approaches to neuroscience. Our proposal introduces the following
innovations: 1) an end-to-end deep learning architecture for open vocabulary
EEG decoding, incorporating a subject-dependent representation learning module
for raw EEG encoding, a BART language model, and a GPT-4 sentence refinement
module; 2) a more comprehensive sentence-level evaluation metric based on the
BERTScore; 3) an ablation study that analyses the contributions of each module
within our proposal, providing valuable insights for future research. We
evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, ZuCo v1.0 and v2.0,
comprising EEG recordings of 30 subjects engaged in natural reading tasks. Our
model achieves a BLEU-1 score of 42.75%, a ROUGE-1-F of 33.28%, and a
BERTScore-F of 53.86%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by
3.38%, 8.43%, and 6.31%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the transmission strategy of a ground-based beyond
diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), a.k.a RIS 2.0, in a
network where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) simultaneously transmit
signals to the respective groups of users. It is assumed that each group is
assigned subcarriers orthogonal to those assigned to other groups and rate
splitting multiple access (RSMA) is adopted within each group. A corresponding
mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) is formulated, which aims
to jointly optimize 1) allocation of BD-RIS elements to groups, 2) BD-RIS phase
rotations, 3) rate allocation in RSMA, and 4) precoders. To solve the problem,
we propose using generalized benders decomposition (GBD) augmented with a
manifold-based algorithm. GBD splits the MINLP problem into two sub-problems,
namely the primal and the relaxed master problem, which are solved alternately
and iteratively. In the primal problem, we apply block coordinate descent (BCD)
to manage the coupling of variables effectively. Moreover, we recognize the
manifold structure in the phase rotation constraint of BD-RIS, enabling the
Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG). Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing spectral efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we present a deep learning framework designed to integrate
with our previously developed system that facilitates large-scale 1D fetal
Doppler data collection, aiming to enhance data quality. This system, tailored
for traditional Indigenous midwives in low-resource communities, leverages a
cost-effective Android phone to improve the quality of recorded signals. We
have shown that the Doppler data can be used to identify fetal growth
restriction, hypertension, and other concerning issues during pregnancy.
However, the quality of the signal is dependent on many factors, including
radio frequency interference, position of the fetus, maternal body habitus, and
usage of the Doppler by the birth attendants. In order to provide instant
feedback to allow correction of the data at source, a signal quality metric is
required that can run in real-time on the mobile phone.
<br />In this study, 191 DUS signals with durations mainly in the range between 5
to 10 minutes were evaluated for quality and classified into five categories:
Good, Poor, (Radiofrequency) Interference, Talking, and Silent, at a resolution
of 3.75 seconds. A deep neural network was trained on each 3.75-second segment
from these recordings and validated using five-fold cross-validation.
<br />An average micro F1 = 97.4\% and macro F1 = 94.2\% were achieved, with F1 =
99.2\% for `Good' quality data. These results indicate that the algorithm,
which will now be implemented in the midwives' app, should allow a significant
increase in the quality of data at the time of capture.

<p class="mathjax">Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a relatively rare disease that affects
patients at birth and results in extremely heterogeneous anatomical and
functional defects. 12-lead ECG signal is routinely collected in CHD patients
because it provides significant biomarkers for disease prognosis. However,
developing accurate machine learning models is challenging due to the lack of
large available datasets. Here, we suggest exploiting the Riemannian geometry
of the spatial covariance structure of the ECG signal to improve
classification. Firstly, we use covariance augmentation to mix samples across
the Riemannian geodesic between corresponding classes. Secondly, we suggest to
project the covariance matrices to their respective class Riemannian mean to
enhance the quality of feature extraction via tangent space projection. We
perform several ablation experiments and demonstrate significant improvement
compared to traditional machine learning models and deep learning on ECG time
series data.

<p class="mathjax">Smart roads have become an essential component of intelligent transportation
systems (ITS). The roadside perception technology, a critical aspect of smart
roads, utilizes various sensors, roadside units (RSUs), and edge computing
devices to gather real-time traffic data for vehicle-road cooperation. However,
the full potential of smart roads in improving the safety and efficiency of
autonomous vehicles only can be realized through the mass deployment of
roadside perception and communication devices. On the one hand, roadside
devices require significant investment but can only achieve monitoring function
currently, resulting in no profitability for investors. On the other hand,
drivers lack trust in the safety of autonomous driving technology, making it
difficult to promote large-scale commercial applications. To deal with the
dilemma of mass deployment, we propose a novel smart-road vehicle-guiding
architecture for vehicle-road cooperative autonomous driving, based on which we
then propose the corresponding business model and analyze its benefits from
both operator and driver perspectives. The numerical simulations validate that
our proposed smart road solution can enhance driving safety and traffic
efficiency. Moreover, we utilize the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) model to
assess the economic advantages of the proposed business model which indicates
that the smart highway that can provide vehicle-guided-driving services for
autonomous vehicles yields more profit than the regular highway.

<p class="mathjax">Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality,
accounting for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually. One critical clinical
objective is the early detection of CVDs using electrocardiogram (ECG) data, an
area that has received significant attention from the research community.
Recent advancements based on machine learning and deep learning have achieved
great progress in this domain. However, existing methodologies exhibit inherent
limitations, including inappropriate model evaluations and instances of data
leakage. In this study, we present a streamlined workflow paradigm for
preprocessing ECG signals into consistent 10-second durations, eliminating the
need for manual feature extraction/beat detection. We also propose a hybrid
model of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
fraud detection. This architecture consists of two LSTM layers and an SVM
classifier, which achieves a SOTA results with an Average precision score of
0.9402 on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset and 0.9563 on the MIT-BIH atrial
fibrillation dataset. Based on the results, we believe our method can
significantly benefit the early detection and management of CVDs.

modulation (BICM) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The
system relies on optimization of the positions of the quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) points on the I/Q plane for maximized achievable information
rate, while maintaining quantization and fiber nonlinear noise robustness.
Furthermore, 'dummy' bits are multiplexed with coded bits before mapping to
symbols. Rate adaptivity is achieved by tuning the ratio of coded and 'dummy'
bits, while maintaining a fixed forward error-correction block and a fixed
modulation format size. The points' positions and their labeling are optimized
using automatic differentiation in a many-to-one fashion such that the
performance of the 'dummy' bits is sacrificed in favor of the performance of
the data bits. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated in a multi-span
recirculating loop coherent optical fiber transmission system with a total
distance of up to 3000 km. Near-continuous zero-error flexible throughput is
reported as a function of the transmission distance. Up to 1-2 spans of
increased reach gains are achieved at the same net data rate w.r.t.
conventional QAM. At a given distance, up to 0.79 bits/2D symbol of gain w.r.t.
conventional QAM is achieved. The proposed scheme is also demonstrated to
achieve a similar performance to the the now mainstream probabilistic amplitude
shaping scheme employing impractically long distribution matcher.

<p class="mathjax">Brain-computer interface (BCI) has garnered the significant attention for
their potential in various applications, with event-related potential (ERP)
performing a considerable role in BCI systems. This paper introduces a novel
Distributed Inference System tailored for detecting task-wise single-trial ERPs
in a stream of satellite images. Unlike traditional methodologies that employ a
single model for target detection, our system utilizes multiple models, each
optimized for specific tasks, ensuring enhanced performance across varying
image transition times and target onset times. Our experiments, conducted on
four participants, employed two paradigms: the Normal paradigm and an AI
paradigm with bounding boxes. Results indicate that our proposed system
outperforms the conventional methods in both paradigms, achieving the highest
$F_{\beta}$ scores. Furthermore, including bounding boxes in the AI paradigm
significantly improved target recognition. This study underscores the potential
of our Distributed Inference System in advancing the field of ERP detection in

<p class="mathjax">Electroencephalografic (EEG) data are complex multi-dimensional time-series
that are very useful in many applications, from diagnostics to driving
brain-computer interface systems. Their classification is still a challenging
task, due to the inherent within- and between-subject variability and their low
signal-to-noise ratio. On the other hand, the reconstruction of raw EEG data is
even more difficult because of the high temporal resolution of these signals.
Recent literature has proposed numerous machine and deep learning models that
could classify, e.g., different types of movements, with an accuracy in the
range 70% to 80% (with 4 classes). On the other hand, a limited number of works
targeted the reconstruction problem, with very limited results. In this work,
we propose vEEGNet, a DL architecture with two modules, i.e., an unsupervised
module based on variational autoencoders to extract a latent representation of
the data, and a supervised module based on a feed-forward neural network to
classify different movements. To build the encoder and the decoder of VAE we
exploited the well-known EEGNet network. We implemented two slightly different
architectures of vEEGNet, thus showing state-of-the-art classification
performance, and the ability to reconstruct both low-frequency and middle-range
components of the raw EEG. Although preliminary, this work is promising as we
found out that the low-frequency reconstructed signals are consistent with the
so-called motor-related cortical potentials, well-known motor-related EEG
patterns and we could improve over previous literature by reconstructing faster
EEG components, too. Further investigations are needed to explore the
potentialities of vEEGNet in reconstructing the full EEG data, generating new
samples, and studying the relationship between classification and
reconstruction performance.

<p class="mathjax">Meta-surfaces, also known as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), have
emerged as a cost-effective, low power consumption, and flexible solution for
enabling multiple applications in Internet of Things (IoT). However, in the
context of meta-surface-assisted multi-pair IoT communications, significant
interference issues often arise amount multiple channels. This issue is
particularly pronounced in scenarios characterized by Line-of-Sight (LoS)
conditions, where the channels exhibit low rank due to the significant
correlation in propagation paths. These challenges pose a considerable threat
to the quality of communication when multiplexing data streams. In this paper,
we introduce a meta-surface-aided communication scheme for multi-pair
interactions in IoT environments. Inspired by holographic technology, a novel
compensation method on the whole meta-surface has been proposed, which allows
for independent multi-pair direct data streams transmission with low
interference. To further reduce correlation under LoS channel conditions, we
propose a vortex beam-based solution that leverages the low correlation
property between distinct topological modes. We use different vortex beams to
carry distinct data streams, thereby enabling distinct receivers to capture
their intended signal with low interference, aided by holographic
meta-surfaces. Moreover, a prototype has been performed successfully to
demonstrate two-pair multi-node communication scenario operating at 10 GHz with
QPSK/16-QAM modulation.

<p class="mathjax">Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has gained traction in an attempt to fix the
black-box nature of Deep Learning. Specifically (medical) biosignals such as
electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electroocculography
(EOG) and electromyography (EMG) could benefit from good UQ, since these suffer
from a poor signal to noise ratio, and good human interpretability is pivotal
for medical applications and Brain Computer Interfaces. In this paper, we
review the state of the art at the intersection of Uncertainty Quantification
and Biosignal with Machine Learning. We present various methods, shortcomings,
uncertainty measures and theoretical frameworks that currently exist in this
application domain. Overall it can be concluded that promising UQ methods are
available, but that research is needed on how people and systems may interact
with an uncertainty model in a (clinical) environment.

<p class="mathjax">The application of counterfactual explanation (CE) techniques in the realm of
electroencephalography (EEG) classification has been relatively infrequent in
contemporary research. In this study, we attempt to introduce and explore a
novel non-generative approach to CE, specifically tailored for the analysis of
EEG signals. This innovative approach assesses the model's decision-making
process by strategically swapping patches derived from time-frequency analyses.
By meticulously examining the variations and nuances introduced in the
classification outcomes through this method, we aim to derive insights that can
enhance interpretability. The empirical results obtained from our experimental
investigations serve not only to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach
but also to reinforce human confidence in the model's predictive capabilities.
Consequently, these findings underscore the significance and potential value of
conducting further, more extensive research in this promising direction.

<p class="mathjax">Controlling systems governed by partial differential equations is an
inherently hard problem. Specifically, control of wave dynamics is challenging
due to additional physical constraints and intrinsic properties of wave
phenomena such as dissipation, attenuation, reflection, and scattering. In this
work, we introduce an environment designed for the study of the control of
acoustic waves by actuated metamaterial designs. We utilize this environment
for the development of a novel machine-learning method, based on deep neural
networks, for efficiently learning the dynamics of an acoustic PDE from
samples. Our model is fully interpretable and maps physical constraints and
intrinsic properties of the real acoustic environment into its latent
representation of information. Within our model we use a trainable perfectly
matched layer to explicitly learn the property of acoustic energy dissipation.
Our model can be used to predict and control scattered wave energy. The
capabilities of our model are demonstrated on an important problem in
acoustics, which is the minimization of total scattered energy. Furthermore, we
show that the prediction of scattered energy by our model generalizes in time
and can be extended to long time horizons. We make our code repository publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">Abnormal driver states, particularly have been major concerns for road
safety, emphasizing the importance of accurate drowsiness detection to prevent
accidents. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recognized for their
effectiveness in monitoring a driver's mental state by monitoring brain
activities. However, the challenge lies in the requirement for prior
calibration due to the variation of EEG signals among and within individuals.
The necessity of calibration has made the brain-computer interface (BCI) less
accessible. We propose a practical generalized framework for classifying driver
drowsiness states to improve accessibility and convenience. We separate the
normalization process for each driver, treating them as individual domains. The
goal of developing a general model is similar to that of domain generalization.
The framework considers the statistics of each domain separately since they
vary among domains. We experimented with various normalization methods to
enhance the ability to generalize across subjects, i.e. the model's
generalization performance of unseen domains. The experiments showed that
applying individual domain-specific normalization yielded an outstanding
improvement in generalizability. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the
potential and accessibility by removing the need for calibration in BCI
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Moore Law states that transistor density will double every two years, which
is sustained until today due to continuous multi-directional innovations, such
as extreme ultraviolet lithography, novel patterning techniques etc., leading
the semiconductor industry towards 3nm node and beyond. For any patterning
scheme, the most important metric to evaluate the quality of printed patterns
is EPE, with overlay being its largest contribution. Overlay errors can lead to
fatal failures of IC devices such as short circuits or broken connections in
terms of P2P electrical contacts. Therefore, it is essential to develop
effective overlay analysis and control techniques to ensure good functionality
of fabricated semiconductor devices. In this work we have used an imec N14 BEOL
process flow using LELE patterning technique to print metal layers with minimum
pitch of 48nm with 193i lithography. FF structures are decomposed into two mask
layers (M1A and M1B) and then the LELE flow is carried out to make the final
patterns. Since a single M1 layer is decomposed into two masks, control of
overlay between the two masks is critical. The goal of this work is of two-fold
as, (a) to quantify the impact of overlay on capacitance and (b) to see if we
can predict the final capacitance measurements with selected machine learning
models at an early stage. To do so, scatterometry spectra are collected on
these electrical test structures at (a)post litho, (b)post TiN hardmask etch,
and (c)post Cu plating and CMP. Critical Dimension and overlay measurements for
line-space pattern are done with SEM post litho, post etch and post Cu CMP.
Various machine learning models are applied to do the capacitance prediction
with multiple metrology inputs at different steps of wafer processing. Finally,
we demonstrate that by using appropriate machine learning models we are able to
do better prediction of electrical results.

<p class="mathjax">An end-to-end fiber-based network holds the potential to provide
multi-gigabit fixed access to end-users. However, deploying fiber access,
especially in areas where fiber is non-existent, can be time-consuming and
costly, resulting in delayed returns for Operators. This work investigates
transmission data from fixed broadband wireless access in the mmWave band in
5G. Given the growing interest in this domain, understanding the transmission
characteristics of the data becomes crucial. While existing datasets for the
mmWave band are available, they are often generated from simulated
environments. In this study, we introduce a dataset compiled from real-world
transmission data collected from the Fixed Broadband Wireless Access in mmWave
Band device (RWM6050). The aim is to facilitate self-configuration based on
transmission characteristics. To achieve this, we propose an online machine
learning-based approach for real-time training and classification of
transmission characteristics. Additionally, we present two advanced temporal
models for more accurate classifications. Our results demonstrate the ability
to detect transmission angle and distance directly from the analysis of
transmission data with very high accuracy, reaching up to 99% accuracy on the
combined classification task. Finally, we outline promising future research
directions based on the collected data.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is concerned with a class of multivariable stochastic Hamiltonian
systems whose generalised position is related by an ordinary differential
equation to the momentum governed by an Ito stochastic differential equation.
The latter is driven by a standard Wiener process and involves both
conservative and viscous damping forces. With the mass, diffusion and damping
matrices being position-dependent, the resulting nonlinear model of Langevin
dynamics describes dissipative mechanical systems (possibly with rotational
degrees of freedom) or their electromechanical analogues subject to external
random forcing. We study the time evolution of the joint position-momentum
probability distribution for the system and its convergence to equilibrium by
decomposing the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation (FPKE) and the
Kullback-Leibler relative entropy with respect to the invariant measure into
those for the position distribution and the momentum distribution conditioned
on the position. This decomposition reveals a manifestation of the
Barbashin-Krasovskii-LaSalle principle and higher-order dissipation
inequalities for the relative entropy as a Lyapunov functional for the FPKE.

<p class="mathjax">A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) game is an incomplete information game with
quadratic payoff functions and Gaussian payoff states. This study addresses an
information design problem to identify an information structure that maximizes
a quadratic objective function. Gaussian information structures are found to be
optimal among all information structures. Furthermore, the optimal Gaussian
information structure can be determined by semidefinite programming, which is a
natural extension of linear programming. This paper provides sufficient
conditions for the optimality and suboptimality of both no and full information
disclosure. In addition, we characterize optimal information structures in
symmetric LQG games and optimal public information structures in asymmetric LQG

<p class="mathjax">$B_1^+$ and $B_0$ field-inhomogeneities can significantly reduce accuracy and
robustness of MRF's quantitative parameter estimates. Additional $B_1^+$ and
$B_0$ calibration scans can mitigate this but add scan time and cannot be
applied retrospectively to previously collected data. Here, we proposed a
calibration-free sequence-adaptive deep-learning framework, to estimate and
correct for $B_1^+$ and $B_0$ effects of any MRF sequence. We demonstrate its
capability on arbitrary MRF sequences at 3T, where no training data were
previously obtained. Such approach can be applied to any previously-acquired
and future MRF-scans. The flexibility in directly applying this framework to
other quantitative sequences is also highlighted.

<p class="mathjax">Explainability is key to enhancing artificial intelligence's trustworthiness
in medicine. However, several issues remain concerning the actual benefit of
explainable models for clinical decision-making. Firstly, there is a lack of
consensus on an evaluation framework for quantitatively assessing the practical
benefits that effective explainability should provide to practitioners.
Secondly, physician-centered evaluations of explainability are limited.
Thirdly, the utility of built-in attention mechanisms in transformer-based
models as an explainability technique is unclear. We hypothesize that superior
attention maps should align with the information that physicians focus on,
potentially reducing prediction uncertainty and increasing model reliability.
We employed a multimodal transformer to predict lymph node metastasis in rectal
cancer using clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging, exploring how well
attention maps, visualized through a state-of-the-art technique, can achieve
agreement with physician understanding. We estimated the model's uncertainty
using meta-level information like prediction probability variance and
quantified agreement. Our assessment of whether this agreement reduces
uncertainty found no significant effect. In conclusion, this case study did not
confirm the anticipated benefit of attention maps in enhancing model
reliability. Superficial explanations could do more harm than good by
misleading physicians into relying on uncertain predictions, suggesting that
the current state of attention mechanisms in explainability should not be
overestimated. Identifying explainability mechanisms truly beneficial for
clinical decision-making remains essential.

<p class="mathjax">Video motion magnification amplifies invisible small motions to be
perceptible, which provides humans with spatially dense and holistic
understanding about small motions from the scene of interest. This is based on
the premise that magnifying small motions enhances the legibility of the
motion. In the real world, however, vibrating objects often possess complex
systems, having complex natural frequencies, modes, and directions. Existing
motion magnification often fails to improve the legibility since the intricate
motions still retain complex characteristics even when magnified, which
distracts us from analyzing them. In this work, we focus on improving the
legibility by proposing a new concept, axial motion magnification, which
magnifies decomposed motions along the user-specified direction. Axial motion
magnification can be applied to various applications where motions of specific
axes are critical, by providing simplified and easily readable motion
information. We propose a novel learning-based axial motion magnification
method with the Motion Separation Module that enables to disentangle and
magnify the motion representation along axes of interest. Further, we build a
new synthetic training dataset for the axial motion magnification task. Our
proposed method improves the legibility of resulting motions along certain
axes, while adding additional user controllability. Our method can be directly
adopted to the generic motion magnification and achieves favorable performance
against competing methods. Our project page is available at

<p class="mathjax">Several sensing techniques have been proposed for silent speech recognition
(SSR); however, many of these methods require invasive processes or sensor
attachment to the skin using adhesive tape or glue, rendering them unsuitable
for frequent use in daily life. By contrast, impulse radio ultra-wideband
(IR-UWB) radar can operate without physical contact with users' articulators
and related body parts, offering several advantages for SSR. These advantages
include high range resolution, high penetrability, low power consumption,
robustness to external light or sound interference, and the ability to be
embedded in space-constrained handheld devices. This study demonstrated IR-UWB
radar-based contactless SSR using four types of speech stimuli (vowels,
consonants, words, and phrases). To achieve this, a novel speech feature
extraction algorithm specifically designed for IR-UWB radar-based SSR is
proposed. Each speech stimulus is recognized by applying a classification
algorithm to the extracted speech features. Two different algorithms,
multidimensional dynamic time warping (MD-DTW) and deep neural network-hidden
Markov model (DNN-HMM), were compared for the classification task.
Additionally, a favorable radar antenna position, either in front of the user's
lips or below the user's chin, was determined to achieve higher recognition
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed speech
feature extraction algorithm combined with DNN-HMM for classifying vowels,
consonants, words, and phrases. Notably, this study represents the first
demonstration of phoneme-level SSR using contactless radar.

<p class="mathjax">Radiation therapy is a primary and effective NasoPharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)
treatment strategy. The precise delineation of Gross Tumor Volumes (GTVs) and
Organs-At-Risk (OARs) is crucial in radiation treatment, directly impacting
patient prognosis. Previously, the delineation of GTVs and OARs was performed
by experienced radiation oncologists. Recently, deep learning has achieved
promising results in many medical image segmentation tasks. However, for NPC
OARs and GTVs segmentation, few public datasets are available for model
development and evaluation. To alleviate this problem, the SegRap2023 challenge
was organized in conjunction with MICCAI2023 and presented a large-scale
benchmark for OAR and GTV segmentation with 400 Computed Tomography (CT) scans
from 200 NPC patients, each with a pair of pre-aligned non-contrast and
contrast-enhanced CT scans. The challenge's goal was to segment 45 OARs and 2
GTVs from the paired CT scans. In this paper, we detail the challenge and
analyze the solutions of all participants. The average Dice similarity
coefficient scores for all submissions ranged from 76.68\% to 86.70\%, and
70.42\% to 73.44\% for OARs and GTVs, respectively. We conclude that the
segmentation of large-size OARs is well-addressed, and more efforts are needed
for GTVs and small-size or thin-structure OARs. The benchmark will remain
publicly available here: https://segrap2023.grand-challenge.org

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems are often trained by
using an auxiliary classification task to learn an embedding space. Doing so
enables the system to learn embeddings that are robust to noise and are
ignoring non-target sound events but requires manually annotated meta
information to be used as class labels. However, the less difficult the
classification task becomes, the less informative are the embeddings and the
worse is the resulting ASD performance. A solution to this problem is to
utilize self-supervised learning (SSL). In this work, feature exchange
(FeatEx), a simple yet effective SSL approach for ASD, is proposed. In
addition, FeatEx is compared to and combined with existing SSL approaches. As
the main result, a new state-of-the-art performance for the DCASE2023 ASD
dataset is obtained that outperforms all other published results on this
dataset by a large margin.

<p class="mathjax">In modern collider experiments, the quest to explore fundamental interactions
between elementary particles has reached unparalleled levels of precision.
Signatures from particle physics detectors are low-level objects encoding the
physics of collisions. The complete simulation of them in a detector is a
memory and storage-intensive task. To address this computational bottleneck in
particle physics, "Fast Simulation" has been introduced and refined over the
years. The field has seen a surge in interest in surrogate modeling the
detector simulation, fueled by the advancements in deep generative models.
These models aim to generate responses that are statistically identical to the
observed data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and exhaustive
taxonomic review of the existing literature on the simulation of detector
signatures from both methodological and application-wise perspectives.
Initially, we formulate the problem of detector signature simulation and
discuss its different variations that can be unified. Next, we classify the
state-of-the-art methods into four distinct categories based on their
underlying model architectures, summarizing their respective generation
strategies. We then identify and discuss three key application areas. Finally,
we shed light on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in detector
signature simulation, setting the stage for future research and development.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning addresses the challenge encountered by many
supervised methods, i.e. the requirement of large amounts of annotated data.
This challenge is particularly pronounced in fields such as the
electroencephalography (EEG) research domain. Self-supervised learning operates
instead by utilizing pseudo-labels, which are generated by pretext tasks, to
obtain a rich and meaningful data representation. In this study, we aim at
introducing a dual-stream pretext task architecture that operates both in the
time and frequency domains. In particular, we have examined the incorporation
of the novel Frequency Similarity (FS) pretext task into two existing pretext
tasks, Relative Positioning (RP) and Temporal Shuffling (TS). We assess the
accuracy of these models using the Physionet Challenge 2018 (PC18) dataset in
the context of the downstream task sleep stage classification. The inclusion of
FS resulted in a notable improvement in downstream task accuracy, with a 1.28
percent improvement on RP and a 2.02 percent improvement on TS. Furthermore,
when visualizing the learned embeddings using Uniform Manifold Approximation
and Projection (UMAP), distinct clusters emerge, indicating that the learned
representations carry meaningful information.

<p class="mathjax">There are increasingly efficient data processing pipelines that work on
vectors of numbers, for instance most machine learning models, or vector
databases for fast similarity search. These require converting the data to
numbers. While this conversion is easy for simple numerical and categorical
entries, databases are strife with text entries, such as names or descriptions.
In the age of large language models, what's the best strategies to vectorize
tables entries, baring in mind that larger models entail more operational
complexity? We study the benefits of language models in 14 analytical tasks on
tables while varying the training size, as well as for a fuzzy join benchmark.
We introduce a simple characterization of a column that reveals two settings:
1) a dirty categories setting, where strings share much similarities across
entries, and conversely 2) a diverse entries setting. For dirty categories,
pretrained language models bring little-to-no benefit compared to simpler
string models. For diverse entries, we show that larger language models improve
data processing. For these we investigate the complexity-performance tradeoffs
and show that they reflect those of classic text embedding: larger models tend
to perform better, but it is useful to fine tune them for embedding purposes.

<p class="mathjax">Annotating a multilingual code-switched corpus is a painstaking process
requiring specialist linguistic expertise. This is partly due to the large
number of language combinations that may appear within and across utterances,
which might require several annotators with different linguistic expertise to
consider an utterance sequentially. This is time-consuming and costly. It would
be useful if the spoken languages in an utterance and the boundaries thereof
were known before annotation commences, to allow segments to be assigned to the
relevant language experts in parallel. To address this, we investigate the
development of a continuous multilingual language diarizer using fine-tuned
speech representations extracted from a large pre-trained self-supervised
architecture (WavLM). We experiment with a code-switched corpus consisting of
five South African languages (isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sesotho and English)
and show substantial diarization error rate improvements for language families,
language groups, and individual languages over baseline systems.

<p class="mathjax">In the past, the field of drum source separation faced significant challenges
due to limited data availability, hindering the adoption of cutting-edge deep
learning methods that have found success in other related audio applications.
In this manuscript, we introduce StemGMD, a large-scale audio dataset of
isolated single-instrument drum stems. Each audio clip is synthesized from MIDI
recordings of expressive drums performances using ten real-sounding acoustic
drum kits. Totaling 1224 hours, StemGMD is the largest audio dataset of drums
to date and the first to comprise isolated audio clips for every instrument in
a canonical nine-piece drum kit. We leverage StemGMD to develop LarsNet, a
novel deep drum source separation model. Through a bank of dedicated U-Nets,
LarsNet can separate five stems from a stereo drum mixture faster than
real-time and is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art nonnegative
spectro-temporal factorization methods.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks have shown promising classification performance when
predicting certain biomarkers from Whole Slide Images in digital pathology.
However, the calibration of the networks' output probabilities is often not
evaluated. Communicating uncertainty by providing reliable confidence scores is
of high relevance in the medical context. In this work, we compare three neural
network architectures that combine feature representations on patch-level to a
slide-level prediction with respect to their classification performance and
evaluate their calibration. As slide-level classification task, we choose the
prediction of Microsatellite Instability from Colorectal Cancer tissue
sections. We observe that Transformers lead to good results in terms of
classification performance and calibration. When evaluating the classification
performance on a separate dataset, we observe that Transformers generalize
best. The investigation of reliability diagrams provides additional insights to
the Expected Calibration Error metric and we observe that especially
Transformers push the output probabilities to extreme values, which results in
overconfident predictions.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion and Poisson flow models have shown impressive performance in a wide
range of generative tasks, including low-dose CT image denoising. However, one
limitation in general, and for clinical applications in particular, is slow
sampling. Due to their iterative nature, the number of function evaluations
(NFE) required is usually on the order of $10-10^3$, both for conditional and
unconditional generation. In this paper, we present posterior sampling Poisson
flow generative models (PPFM), a novel image denoising technique for low-dose
and photon-counting CT that produces excellent image quality whilst keeping
NFE=1. Updating the training and sampling processes of Poisson flow generative
models (PFGM)++, we learn a conditional generator which defines a trajectory
between the prior noise distribution and the posterior distribution of
interest. We additionally hijack and regularize the sampling process to achieve
NFE=1. Our results shed light on the benefits of the PFGM++ framework compared
to diffusion models. In addition, PPFM is shown to perform favorably compared
to current state-of-the-art diffusion-style models with NFE=1, consistency
models, as well as popular deep learning and non-deep learning-based image
denoising techniques, on clinical low-dose CT images and clinical images from a
prototype photon-counting CT system.

<p class="mathjax">Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), which allows users to customize
keywords, has attracted increasingly more interest. However, existing methods
based on acoustic models and post-processing train the acoustic model with ASR
training criteria to model all phonemes, making the acoustic model
under-optimized for the KWS task. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
unified two-pass open-vocabulary KWS (U2-KWS) framework inspired by the
two-pass ASR model U2. Specifically, we employ the CTC branch as the first
stage model to detect potential keyword candidates and the decoder branch as
the second stage model to validate candidates. In order to enhance any
customized keywords, we redesign the U2 training procedure for U2-KWS and add
keyword information by audio and text cross-attention into both branches. We
perform experiments on our internal dataset and Aishell-1. The results show
that U2-KWS can achieve a significant relative wake-up rate improvement of 41%
compared to the traditional customized KWS systems when the false alarm rate is
fixed to 0.5 times per hour.

<p class="mathjax">The electroencephalogram (EEG) offers a non-invasive means by which a
listener's auditory system may be monitored during continuous speech
perception. Reliable auditory-EEG decoders could facilitate the objective
diagnosis of hearing disorders, or find applications in cognitively-steered
hearing aids. Previously, we developed decoders for the ICASSP Auditory EEG
Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC). These decoders aimed to solve the
match-mismatch task: given a short temporal segment of EEG recordings, and two
candidate speech segments, the task is to identify which of the two speech
segments is temporally aligned, or matched, with the EEG segment. The decoders
made use of cortical responses to the speech envelope, as well as
speech-related frequency-following responses, to relate the EEG recordings to
the speech stimuli. Here we comprehensively document the methods by which the
decoders were developed. We extend our previous analysis by exploring the
association between speaker characteristics (pitch and sex) and classification
accuracy, and provide a full statistical analysis of the final performance of
the decoders as evaluated on a heldout portion of the dataset. Finally, the
generalisation capabilities of the decoders are characterised, by evaluating
them using an entirely different dataset which contains EEG recorded under a
variety of speech-listening conditions. The results show that the
match-mismatch decoders achieve accurate and robust classification accuracies,
and they can even serve as auditory attention decoders without additional
training.

<p class="mathjax">Support vector machines (SVMs) are well-studied supervised learning models
for binary classification. In many applications, large amounts of samples can
be cheaply and easily obtained. What is often a costly and error-prone process
is to manually label these instances. Semi-supervised support vector machines
(S3VMs) extend the well-known SVM classifiers to the semi-supervised approach,
aiming at maximizing the margin between samples in the presence of unlabeled
data. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, S3VMs attempt to achieve
better accuracy and robustness compared to traditional SVMs. Unfortunately, the
resulting optimization problem is non-convex and hence difficult to solve
exactly. In this paper, we present a new branch-and-cut approach for S3VMs
using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. We apply optimality-based
bound tightening to bound the feasible set. Box constraints allow us to include
valid inequalities, strengthening the lower bound. The resulting SDP relaxation
provides bounds significantly stronger than the ones available in the
literature. For the upper bound, instead, we define a local search exploiting
the solution of the SDP relaxation. Computational results highlight the
efficiency of the algorithm, showing its capability to solve instances with a
number of data points 10 times larger than the ones solved in the literature.

<p class="mathjax">Image prefiltering with just noticeable distortion (JND) improves coding
efficiency in a visual lossless way by filtering the perceptually redundant
information prior to compression. However, real JND cannot be well modeled with
inaccurate masking equations in traditional approaches or image-level subject
tests in deep learning approaches. Thus, this paper proposes a fine-grained JND
prefiltering dataset guided by image quality assessment for accurate
block-level JND modeling. The dataset is constructed from decoded images to
include coding effects and is also perceptually enhanced with block overlap and
edge preservation. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we propose a lightweight
JND prefiltering network, IQNet, which can be applied directly to different
quantization cases with the same model and only needs 3K parameters. The
experimental results show that the proposed approach to Versatile Video Coding
could yield maximum/average bitrate savings of 41\%/15\% and 53\%/19\% for
all-intra and low-delay P configurations, respectively, with negligible
subjective quality loss. Our method demonstrates higher perceptual quality and
a model size that is an order of magnitude smaller than previous deep learning
methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper launches a thorough discussion on the locality of local neural
operator (LNO), which is the core that enables LNO great flexibility on varied
computational domains in solving transient partial differential equations
(PDEs). We investigate the locality of LNO by looking into its receptive field
and receptive range, carrying a main concern about how the locality acts in LNO
training and applications. In a large group of LNO training experiments for
learning fluid dynamics, it is found that an initial receptive range compatible
with the learning task is crucial for LNO to perform well. On the one hand, an
over-small receptive range is fatal and usually leads LNO to numerical
oscillation; on the other hand, an over-large receptive range hinders LNO from
achieving the best accuracy. We deem rules found in this paper general when
applying LNO to learn and solve transient PDEs in diverse fields. Practical
examples of applying the pre-trained LNOs in flow prediction are presented to
confirm the findings further. Overall, with the architecture properly designed
with a compatible receptive range, the pre-trained LNO shows commendable
accuracy and efficiency in solving practical cases.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the growing interest in deploying deep learning models
directly in-sensor. We present "Q-Segment", a quantized real-time segmentation
algorithm, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two low-power edge vision
platforms, namely Sony IMX500, which has an in-sensors processor, and Sony
Spresense, a low-power multi-core ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. One of the main
goals of the model is to achieve end-to-end image segmentation for vessel-based
medical diagnosis. Deployed on the IMX500 platform, Q-Segment achieves
ultra-low inference time in-sensor of only 1.9 ms and energy consumption of
only 5.7 mJ. We compare the proposed network with outperforming existing
networks on various platforms by a factor of 75x (compared to ERFNet). The
network architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip

<p class="mathjax">The identification of the Purkinje conduction system in the heart is a
challenging task, yet essential for a correct definition of cardiac digital
twins for precision cardiology. Here, we propose a probabilistic approach for
identifying the Purkinje network from non-invasive clinical data such as the
standard electrocardiogram (ECG). We use cardiac imaging to build an
anatomically accurate model of the ventricles; we algorithmically generate a
rule-based Purkinje network tailored to the anatomy; we simulate physiological
electrocardiograms with a fast model; we identify the geometrical and
electrical parameters of the Purkinje-ECG model with Bayesian optimization and
approximate Bayesian computation. The proposed approach is inherently
probabilistic and generates a population of plausible Purkinje networks, all
fitting the ECG within a given tolerance. In this way, we can estimate the
uncertainty of the parameters, thus providing reliable predictions. We test our
methodology in physiological and pathological scenarios, showing that we are
able to accurately recover the ECG with our model. We propagate the uncertainty
in the Purkinje network parameters in a simulation of conduction system pacing
therapy. Our methodology is a step forward in creation of digital twins from
non-invasive data in precision medicine. An open source implementation can be

<p class="mathjax">Segmentation quality assessment (SQA) plays a critical role in the deployment
of a medical image based AI system. Users need to be informed/alerted whenever
an AI system generates unreliable/incorrect predictions. With the introduction
of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a general foundation segmentation model,
new research opportunities emerged in how one can utilize SAM for medical image
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel SQA method, called SQA-SAM,
which exploits SAM to enhance the accuracy of quality assessment for medical
image segmentation. When a medical image segmentation model (MedSeg) produces
predictions for a test image, we generate visual prompts based on the
predictions, and SAM is utilized to generate segmentation maps corresponding to
the visual prompts. How well MedSeg's segmentation aligns with SAM's
segmentation indicates how well MedSeg's segmentation aligns with the general
perception of objectness and image region partition. We develop a score measure
for such alignment. In experiments, we find that the generated scores exhibit
moderate to strong positive correlation (in Pearson correlation and Spearman
correlation) with Dice coefficient scores reflecting the true segmentation
quality.

<p class="mathjax">Skillful subseasonal forecasts beyond 2 weeks are crucial for a wide range of
applications across various sectors of society. Recently, state-of-the-art
machine learning based weather forecasting models have made significant
advancements, outperforming the high-resolution forecast (HRES) from the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). However, the full
potential of machine learning models in subseasonal forecasts has yet to be
fully explored. In this study, we introduce FuXi Subseasonal-to-Seasonal
(FuXi-S2S), a machine learning based subseasonal forecasting model that
provides global daily mean forecasts up to 42 days, covering 5 upper-air
atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and 11 surface variables. FuXi-S2S
integrates an enhanced FuXi base model with a perturbation module for
flow-dependent perturbations in hidden features, and incorporates Perlin noise
to perturb initial conditions. The model is developed using 72 years of daily
statistics from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data. When compared to the ECMWF
Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) reforecasts, the FuXi-S2S forecasts demonstrate
superior deterministic and ensemble forecasts for total precipitation (TP),
outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and geopotential at 500 hPa (Z500). Although
it shows slightly inferior performance in predicting 2-meter temperature (T2M),
it has clear advantages over land area. Regarding the extreme forecasts,
FuXi-S2S outperforms ECMWF S2S globally for TP. Furthermore, FuXi-S2S forecasts
surpass the ECMWF S2S reforecasts in predicting the Madden Julian Oscillation
(MJO), a key source of subseasonal predictability. They extend the skillful
prediction of MJO from 30 days to 36 days.

<p class="mathjax">WHO's report on environmental noise estimates that 22 M people suffer from
chronic annoyance related to noise caused by audio events (AEs) from various
sources. Annoyance may lead to health issues and adverse effects on metabolic
and cognitive systems. In cities, monitoring noise levels does not provide
insights into noticeable AEs, let alone their relations to annoyance. To create
annoyance-related monitoring, this paper proposes a graph-based model to
identify AEs in a soundscape, and explore relations between diverse AEs and
human-perceived annoyance rating (AR). Specifically, this paper proposes a
lightweight multi-level graph learning (MLGL) based on local and global
semantic graphs to simultaneously perform audio event classification (AEC) and
human annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experiments show that: 1) MLGL with
4.1 M parameters improves AEC and ARP results by using semantic node
information in local and global context aware graphs; 2) MLGL captures
relations between coarse and fine-grained AEs and AR well; 3) Statistical
analysis of MLGL results shows that some AEs from different sources
significantly correlate with AR, which is consistent with previous research on
human perception of these sound sources.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted sensor networks (UASNets), which play
a crucial role in creating new opportunities, are experiencing significant
growth in civil applications worldwide. UASNets improve disaster management
through timely surveillance and advance precision agriculture with detailed
crop monitoring, thereby significantly transforming the commercial economy.
UASNets revolutionize the commercial sector by offering greater efficiency,
safety, and cost-effectiveness, highlighting their transformative impact. A
fundamental aspect of these new capabilities and changes is the collection of
data from rugged and remote areas. Due to their excellent mobility and
maneuverability, UAVs are employed to collect data from ground sensors in harsh
environments, such as natural disaster monitoring, border surveillance, and
emergency response monitoring. One major challenge in these scenarios is that
the movements of UAVs affect channel conditions and result in packet loss. Fast
movements of UAVs lead to poor channel conditions and rapid signal degradation,
resulting in packet loss. On the other hand, slow mobility of a UAV can cause
buffer overflows of the ground sensors, as newly arrived data is not promptly
collected by the UAV.
<br />Our proposal to address this challenge is to minimize packet loss by jointly
optimizing the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple
UAVs.Furthermore, in UASNets, swift movements of UAVs result in poor channel
conditions and fast signal attenuation, leading to an extended age of
information (AoI). In contrast, slow movements of UAVs prolong flight time,
thereby extending the AoI of ground sensors.To address this challenge, we
propose a new mean-field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize
the AoI of sensory data.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain
boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant
challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision
algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle
with thin masks, often necessitating intricate post-processing for effective
contour closure and continuity. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a
fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique, leveraging domain knowledge
about grain boundary connectivity and employing conditional random fields and
perceptual grouping rules. This approach significantly enhances segmentation
mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation
with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide.
Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51%
improvement in grain alignment, providing a more detailed assessment of
segmentation performance for complex microstructures. This method not only
enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented
level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation
of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where
precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.

<p class="mathjax">Many existing covariate shift adaptation methods estimate sample weights to
be used in the risk estimation in order to mitigate the gap between the source
and the target distribution. However, non-parametrically estimating the optimal
weights typically involves computationally expensive hyper-parameter tuning
that is crucial to the final performance. In this paper, we propose a new
non-parametric approach to covariate shift adaptation which avoids estimating
weights and has no hyper-parameter to be tuned. Our basic idea is to label
unlabeled target data according to the $k$-nearest neighbors in the source
dataset. Our analysis indicates that setting $k = 1$ is an optimal choice.
Thanks to this property, there is no need to tune any hyper-parameters, unlike
other non-parametric methods. Moreover, our method achieves a running time
quasi-linear in the sample size with a theoretical guarantee, for the first
time in the literature to the best of our knowledge. Our results include sharp
rates of convergence for estimating the joint probability distribution of the
target data. In particular, the variance of our estimators has the same rate of
convergence as for standard parametric estimation despite their non-parametric
nature. Our numerical experiments show that proposed method brings drastic
reduction in the running time with accuracy comparable to that of the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Untrained neural networks pioneered by Deep Image Prior (DIP) have recently
enabled MRI reconstruction without requiring fully-sampled measurements for
training. Their success is widely attributed to the implicit regularization
induced by suitable network architectures. However, the lack of understanding
of such architectural priors results in superfluous design choices and
sub-optimal outcomes. This work aims to simplify the architectural design
decisions for DIP-MRI to facilitate its practical deployment. We observe that
certain architectural components are more prone to causing overfitting
regardless of the number of parameters, incurring severe reconstruction
artifacts by hindering accurate extrapolation on the un-acquired measurements.
We interpret this phenomenon from a frequency perspective and find that the
architectural characteristics favoring low frequencies, i.e., deep and narrow
with unlearnt upsampling, can lead to enhanced generalization and hence better
reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose two architecture-agnostic
remedies: one to constrain the frequency range of the white-noise input and the
other to penalize the Lipschitz constants of the network. We demonstrate that
even with just one extra line of code on the input, the performance gap between
the ill-designed models and the high-performing ones can be closed. These
results signify that for the first time, architectural biases on untrained MRI
reconstruction can be mitigated without architectural modifications.
