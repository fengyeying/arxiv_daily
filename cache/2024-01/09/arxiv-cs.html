<p class="mathjax">Law enforcement officials heavily depend on Forensic Video Analytic (FVA)
Software in their evidence extraction process. However present-day FVA software
are complex, time consuming, equipment dependent and expensive. Developing
countries struggle to gain access to this gateway to a secure haven. The term
forensic pertains the application of scientific methods to the investigation of
crime through post-processing, whereas surveillance is the close monitoring of
real-time feeds.
<br />The principle objective of this Final Year Project was to develop an
efficient and effective FVA Software, addressing the shortcomings through a
stringent and systematic review of scholarly research papers, online databases
and legal documentation. The scope spans multiple object detection, multiple
object tracking, anomaly detection, activity recognition, tampering detection,
general and specific image enhancement and video synopsis.
<br />Methods employed include many machine learning techniques, GPU acceleration
and efficient, integrated architecture development both for real-time and
postprocessing. For this CNN, GMM, multithreading and OpenCV C++ coding were
used. The implications of the proposed methodology would rapidly speed up the
FVA process especially through the novel video synopsis research arena. This
project has resulted in three research outcomes Moving Object Based Collision
Free Video Synopsis, Forensic and Surveillance Analytic Tool Architecture and
Tampering Detection Inter-Frame Forgery.
<br />The results include forensic and surveillance panel outcomes with emphasis on
video synopsis and Sri Lankan context. Principal conclusions include the
optimization and efficient algorithm integration to overcome limitations in
processing power, memory and compromise between real-time performance and
accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Metasurfaces have widespread applications in fifth-generation (5G) microwave
communication. Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in
achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts.
However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are
time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies
demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine
metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs.
The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can
accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses.
In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN
achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional
methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for
specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design
problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug
discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Metadata, often termed "data about data," is crucial for organizing,
understanding, and managing vast omics datasets. It aids in efficient data
discovery, integration, and interpretation, enabling users to access,
comprehend, and utilize data effectively. Its significance spans the domains of
scientific research, facilitating data reproducibility, reusability, and
secondary analysis. However, numerous perceptual and technical barriers hinder
the sharing of metadata among researchers. These barriers compromise the
reliability of research results and hinder integrative meta-analyses of omics
studies . This study highlights the key barriers to metadata sharing, including
the lack of uniform standards, privacy and legal concerns, limitations in study
design, limited incentives, inadequate infrastructure, and the dearth of
well-trained personnel for metadata management and reuse. Proposed solutions
include emphasizing the promotion of standardization, educational efforts, the
role of journals and funding agencies, incentives and rewards, and the
improvement of infrastructure. More accurate, reliable, and impactful research
outcomes are achievable if the scientific community addresses these barriers,
facilitating more accurate, reliable, and impactful research outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">In recent studies, the focus has been on enhancing knowledge graph embedding
learning, which encodes entities and relations in knowledge graphs into
low-dimensional vector spaces. While current models mainly consider the
structural aspects of these graphs, there's a wealth of contextual and literal
information in knowledge graphs that can be utilized for more effective
embeddings. This paper introduces a novel model that incorporates both
contextual and literal information into entity and relation embeddings,
utilizing graph convolutional networks. Specifically, for contextual
information, we assess its significance through confidence and relatedness
metrics. A unique rule-based method is developed to calculate the confidence
metric, and the relatedness metric is derived from the literal information's
representations. We validated our model's performance with thorough experiments
on two established benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Deep anomaly detection methods have become increasingly popular in recent
years, with methods like Stacked Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, and
Generative Adversarial Networks greatly improving the state-of-the-art. Other
methods rely on augmenting classical models (such as the One-Class Support
Vector Machine), by learning an appropriate kernel function using Neural
Networks. Recent developments in representation learning by self-supervision
are proving to be very beneficial in the context of anomaly detection. Inspired
by the advancements in anomaly detection using self-supervised learning in the
field of computer vision, this thesis aims to develop a method for detecting
anomalies by exploiting pretext tasks tailored for text corpora. This approach
greatly improves the state-of-the-art on two datasets, 20Newsgroups, and AG
News, for both semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection, thus proving
the potential for self-supervised anomaly detectors in the field of natural
language processing.

<p class="mathjax">This paper examines the efficacy of utilizing large language models (LLMs) to
detect public threats posted online. Amid rising concerns over the spread of
threatening rhetoric and advance notices of violence, automated content
analysis techniques may aid in early identification and moderation. Custom data
collection tools were developed to amass post titles from a popular Korean
online community, comprising 500 non-threat examples and 20 threats. Various
LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM) were prompted to classify individual posts as
either "threat" or "safe." Statistical analysis found all models demonstrated
strong accuracy, passing chi-square goodness of fit tests for both threat and
non-threat identification. GPT-4 performed best overall with 97.9% non-threat
and 100% threat accuracy. Affordability analysis also showed PaLM API pricing
as highly cost-efficient. The findings indicate LLMs can effectively augment
human content moderation at scale to help mitigate emerging online risks.
However, biases, transparency, and ethical oversight remain vital
considerations before real-world implementation.

<p class="mathjax">This study investigates the complexity of regulatory affairs in the medical
device industry, a critical factor influencing market access and patient care.
Through qualitative research, we sought expert insights to understand the
factors contributing to this complexity. The study involved semi-structured
interviews with 28 professionals from medical device companies, specializing in
various aspects of regulatory affairs. These interviews were analyzed using
open coding and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The findings
reveal key sources of complexity within the regulatory landscape, divided into
five domains: (A) Regulatory language complexity, (B) Intricacies within the
regulatory process, (C) Global-level complexities, (D) Database-related
considerations, and (E) Product-level issues. The participants highlighted the
need for strategies to streamline regulatory compliance, enhance interactions
between regulatory bodies and industry players, and develop adaptable
frameworks for rapid technological advancements. Emphasizing interdisciplinary
collaboration and increased transparency, the study concludes that these
elements are vital for establishing coherent and effective regulatory
procedures in the medical device sector.

question or comment to keep a conversation going. In recent years, several
utilized machine learning or sophisticated language processing, such as Tay,
Xiaoice, Zo, Hugging Face, Kuki, and Replika. Unlike generative AI, they
focused on engagement, not expertise. Millions of people were motivated to
engage with them. What were the attractions? Will generative AI do better if it
is equally engaging, or should it be less engaging? Prior to the emergence of
generative AI, we conducted a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis
to learn what motivated millions of people to engage with one such 'virtual
companion,' Microsoft's Zo. We examined the complete chat logs of 2000
anonymized people. We identified over a dozen motivations that people had for
interacting with this software. Designers learned different ways to increase
engagement. Generative conversational AI does not yet have a clear revenue
model to address its high cost. It might benefit from being more engaging, even
as it supports productivity and creativity. Our study and analysis point to
opportunities and challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic embeddings play a crucial role in natural language-based information
retrieval. Embedding models represent words and contexts as vectors whose
spatial configuration is derived from the distribution of words in large text
corpora. While such representations are generally very powerful, they might
fail to account for fine-grained domain-specific nuances. In this article, we
investigate this uncertainty for the domain of characterizations of expressive
piano performance. Using a music research dataset of free text performance
characterizations and a follow-up study sorting the annotations into clusters,
we derive a ground truth for a domain-specific semantic similarity structure.
We test five embedding models and their similarity structure for correspondence
with the ground truth. We further assess the effects of contextualizing
prompts, hubness reduction, cross-modal similarity, and k-means clustering. The
quality of embedding models shows great variability with respect to this task;
more general models perform better than domain-adapted ones and the best model
configurations reach human-level agreement.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a wide range of tasks. However, their proficiency and reliability in the
specialized domain of Data Analysis, particularly with a focus on data-driven
thinking, remain uncertain. To bridge this gap, we introduce BIBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the data analysis capabilities of
LLMs within the context of Business Intelligence (BI). BIBench assesses LLMs
across three dimensions: 1) BI foundational knowledge, evaluating the models'
numerical reasoning and familiarity with financial concepts; 2) BI knowledge
application, determining the models' ability to quickly comprehend textual
information and generate analysis questions from multiple views; and 3) BI
technical skills, examining the models' use of technical knowledge to address
real-world data analysis challenges. BIBench comprises 11 sub-tasks, spanning
three categories of task types: classification, extraction, and generation.
Additionally, we've developed BIChat, a domain-specific dataset with over a
million data points, to fine-tune LLMs. We will release BIBenchmark, BIChat,
and the evaluation scripts at \url{https://github.com/cubenlp/BIBench}. This
benchmark aims to provide a measure for in-depth analysis of LLM abilities and
foster the advancement of LLMs in the field of data analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Objective: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) stimulates a need
for a comprehensive review of their applications and outcomes in mental health
care contexts. This scoping review aims to critically analyze the existing
development and applications of LLMs in mental health care, highlighting their
successes and identifying their challenges and limitations in these specialized
fields. Materials and Methods: A broad literature search was conducted in
November 2023 using six databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar,
arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv) following the 2020 version of the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A
total of 313 publications were initially identified, and after applying the
study inclusion criteria, 34 publications were selected for the final review.
Results: We identified diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care,
including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key
challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of
mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy
and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical
considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized
evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion: LLMs show
promising potential in advancing mental health care, with applications in
diagnostics, and patient support. Continued advancements depend on
collaborative, multidisciplinary efforts focused on framework enhancement,
rigorous dataset development, technological refinement, and ethical integration
to ensure the effective and safe application of LLMs in mental health care.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the domain
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, has opened new avenues for
application across various fields, yet its role in business education remains
underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the
performance of seven major LLMs, OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and
GPT-4 Turbo), Google's models (PaLM 2, Gemini 1.0 Pro), and Anthropic's models
(Claude 2 and Claude 2.1), on the GMAT, which is a key exam in the admission
process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs
outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other
models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top
business schools. Through a case study, this research examines GPT-4 Turbo's
ability to explain answers, evaluate responses, identify errors, tailor
instructions, and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions,
GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, and Gemini 1.0 Pro, show marked improvements in
reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors, underscoring their potential
for complex problem-solving. While AI's promise in education, assessment, and
tutoring is clear, challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs'
academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and
application of AI in education. As AI technology advances, it is imperative to
establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction, verify the accuracy of
AI-generated content, ensure worldwide access for diverse learners, and create
an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research
sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich
educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.

<p class="mathjax">Organizations face the challenge of ensuring compliance with an increasing
amount of requirements from various regulatory documents. Which requirements
are relevant depends on aspects such as the geographic location of the
organization, its domain, size, and business processes. Considering these
contextual factors, as a first step, relevant documents (e.g., laws,
regulations, directives, policies) are identified, followed by a more detailed
analysis of which parts of the identified documents are relevant for which step
of a given business process. Nowadays the identification of regulatory
requirements relevant to business processes is mostly done manually by domain
and legal experts, posing a tremendous effort on them, especially for a large
number of regulatory documents which might frequently change. Hence, this work
examines how legal and domain experts can be assisted in the assessment of
relevant requirements. For this, we compare an embedding-based NLP ranking
method, a generative AI method using GPT-4, and a crowdsourced method with the
purely manual method of creating relevancy labels by experts. The proposed
methods are evaluated based on two case studies: an Australian insurance case
created with domain experts and a global banking use case, adapted from SAP
Signavio's workflow example of an international guideline. A gold standard is
created for both BPMN2.0 processes and matched to real-world textual
requirements from multiple regulatory documents. The evaluation and discussion
provide insights into strengths and weaknesses of each method regarding
applicability, automation, transparency, and reproducibility and provide
guidelines on which method combinations will maximize benefits for given
characteristics such as process usage, impact, and dynamics of an application
scenario.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of pretrained models has significantly impacted from Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision to relational datasets.
Traditionally, these models are assessed through fine-tuned downstream tasks.
However, this raises the question of how to evaluate these models more
efficiently and more effectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach
where we leverage the meta features associated with each entity as a source of
worldly knowledge and employ entity representations from the models. We propose
using the consistency between these representations and the meta features as a
metric for evaluating pretrained models. Our method's effectiveness is
demonstrated across various domains, including models with relational datasets,
large language models and images models.

<p class="mathjax">Crowdfunding in the realm of the Social Web has received substantial
attention, with prior research examining various aspects of campaigns,
including project objectives, durations, and influential project categories for
successful fundraising. These factors are crucial for entrepreneurs seeking
donor support. However, the terrain of charity crowdfunding within the Social
Web remains relatively unexplored, lacking comprehension of the motivations
driving donations that often lack concrete reciprocation. Distinct from
conventional crowdfunding that offers tangible returns, charity crowdfunding
relies on intangible rewards like tax advantages, recognition posts, or
advisory roles. Such details are often embedded within campaign narratives,
yet, the analysis of textual content in charity crowdfunding is limited. This
study introduces an inventive text analytics framework, utilizing Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent themes from textual descriptions
of charity campaigns. The study has explored four different themes, two each in
campaign and incentive descriptions. Campaign description themes are focused on
child and elderly health mainly the ones who are diagnosed with terminal
diseases. Incentive description themes are based on tax benefits, certificates,
and appreciation posts. These themes, combined with numerical parameters,
predict campaign success. The study was successful in using Random Forest
Classifier to predict success of the campaign using both thematic and numerical
parameters. The study distinguishes thematic categories, particularly medical
need-based charity and general causes, based on project and incentive
descriptions. In conclusion, this research bridges the gap by showcasing topic
modelling utility in uncharted charity crowdfunding domains.

<p class="mathjax">One of the final frontiers in the development of complex human - AI
collaborative systems is the ability of AI agents to comprehend the natural
language and perform tasks accordingly. However, training efficient
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents grounded in natural language has been a
long-standing challenge due to the complexity and ambiguity of the language and
sparsity of the rewards, among other factors. Several advances in reinforcement
learning, curriculum learning, continual learning, language models have
independently contributed to effective training of grounded agents in various
environments. Leveraging these developments, we present a novel algorithm,
Grounded Language Instruction through DEmonstration in RL (GLIDE-RL) that
introduces a teacher-instructor-student curriculum learning framework for
training an RL agent capable of following natural language instructions that
can generalize to previously unseen language instructions. In this multi-agent
framework, the teacher and the student agents learn simultaneously based on the
student's current skill level. We further demonstrate the necessity for
training the student agent with not just one, but multiple teacher agents.
Experiments on a complex sparse reward environment validates the effectiveness
of our proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieval-based augmentations that aim to incorporate knowledge from an
external database into language models have achieved great success in various
knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks, such as question-answering and text generation.
However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks, such as
text classification, is still challenging. Existing works focus on
concatenating retrievals to inputs as context to form the prompt-based inputs.
Unfortunately, such methods require language models to have the capability to
handle long texts. Besides, inferring such concatenated data would also consume
a significant amount of computational resources.
<br />To solve these challenges, we propose \textbf{ReFusion} in this paper, a
computation-efficient \textbf{Re}trieval representation \textbf{Fusion} with
neural architecture search. The main idea is to directly fuse the retrieval
representations into the language models. Specifically, we first propose an
online retrieval module that retrieves representations of similar sentences.
Then, we present a retrieval fusion module including two effective ranking
schemes, i.e., reranker-based scheme and ordered-mask-based scheme, to fuse the
retrieval representations with hidden states. Furthermore, we use Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) to seek the optimal fusion structure across different
layers. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results
demonstrate our ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance on various
NKI tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In conversational AI research, there's a noticeable trend towards developing
models with a larger number of parameters, exemplified by models like ChatGPT.
While these expansive models tend to generate increasingly better chat
responses, they demand significant computational resources and memory. This
study explores a pertinent question: Can a combination of smaller models
collaboratively achieve comparable or enhanced performance relative to a
singular large model? We introduce an approach termed "blending", a
straightforward yet effective method of integrating multiple chat AIs. Our
empirical evidence suggests that when specific smaller models are
synergistically blended, they can potentially outperform or match the
capabilities of much larger counterparts. For instance, integrating just three
models of moderate size (6B/13B paramaeters) can rival or even surpass the
performance metrics of a substantially larger model like ChatGPT (175B+
paramaters). This hypothesis is rigorously tested using A/B testing
methodologies with a large user base on the Chai research platform over a span
of thirty days. The findings underscore the potential of the "blending"
strategy as a viable approach for enhancing chat AI efficacy without a
corresponding surge in computational demands.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal depression detection is an important research topic that aims to
predict human mental states using multimodal data. Previous methods treat
different modalities equally and fuse each modality by na\"ive mathematical
operations without measuring the relative importance between them, which cannot
obtain well-performed multimodal representations for downstream depression
tasks. In order to tackle the aforementioned concern, we present a Cross-modal
Attention Network with Adaptive Multi-modal Recurrent Fusion (CANAMRF) for
multimodal depression detection. CANAMRF is constructed by a multimodal feature
extractor, an Adaptive Multimodal Recurrent Fusion module, and a Hybrid
Attention Module. Through experimentation on two benchmark datasets, CANAMRF
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of
our proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Cough-based diagnosis for Respiratory Diseases (RDs) using Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has attracted considerable attention, yet many existing
studies overlook confounding variables in their predictive models. These
variables can distort the relationship between cough recordings (input data)
and RD status (output variable), leading to biased associations and unrealistic
model performance. To address this gap, we propose the Bias Free Network
(RBFNet), an end to end solution that effectively mitigates the impact of
confounders in the training data distribution. RBFNet ensures accurate and
unbiased RD diagnosis features, emphasizing its relevance by incorporating a
COVID19 dataset in this study. This approach aims to enhance the reliability of
AI based RD diagnosis models by navigating the challenges posed by confounding
variables. A hybrid of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed for the feature encoder module of
RBFNet. An additional bias predictor is incorporated in the classification
scheme to formulate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) which
helps in decorrelating the impact of confounding variables from RD prediction.
The merit of RBFNet is demonstrated by comparing classification performance
with State of The Art (SoTA) Deep Learning (DL) model (CNN LSTM) after training
on different unbalanced COVID-19 data sets, created by using a large scale
proprietary cough data set. RBF-Net proved its robustness against extremely
biased training scenarios by achieving test set accuracies of 84.1%, 84.6%, and
80.5% for the following confounding variables gender, age, and smoking status,
respectively. RBF-Net outperforms the CNN-LSTM model test set accuracies by
5.5%, 7.7%, and 8.2%, respectively

code-related tasks, yet many LLMs treat code as simple sequences, neglecting
its structured nature. We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that
leverages the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation,
transpilation, and understanding. Using dynamic programming, our AST-Aware
Segmentation retains code structure, while our AST-Aware Span Corruption
objective equips the model to reconstruct various code structures. Unlike other
models, AST-T5 avoids intricate program analyses or architectural changes, so
it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations show
that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various
code-related tasks. Structure-awareness makes AST-T5 particularly powerful in
code-to-code tasks, surpassing CodeT5 by 2 points in exact match score for the
Bugs2Fix task and by 3 points in exact match score for Java-C# Transpilation in
CodeXGLUE. Our code and model are publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of function estimation by a multi-agent system
comprising of two agents and a fusion center. Each agent receives data
comprising of samples of an independent variable (input) and the corresponding
values of the dependent variable (output). The data remains local and is not
shared with other members in the system. The objective of the system is to
collaboratively estimate the function from the input to the output. To this
end, we develop an iterative distributed algorithm for this function estimation
problem. Each agent solves a local estimation problem in a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) and uploads the function to the fusion center. At the
fusion center, the functions are fused by first estimating the data points that
would have generated the uploaded functions and then subsequently solving a
least squares estimation problem using the estimated data from both functions.
The fused function is downloaded by the agents and is subsequently used for
estimation at the next iteration along with incoming data. This procedure is
executed sequentially and stopped when the difference between consecutively
estimated functions becomes small enough. To analyze the algorithm, we define
learning operators for the agents, fusion center and the system. We study the
asymptotic properties of the norm of the learning operators and find sufficient
conditions under which they converge to $1$. Given a sequence of data points,
we define and prove the existence of the learning operator for the system. We
prove that the porposed learning algorithm is consistent and demonstrate the
same using an example. The paper has been submitted to L4DC 2024.

<p class="mathjax">With the rise of human-machine communication, machines are increasingly
designed with humanlike characteristics, such as gender, which can
inadvertently trigger cognitive biases. Many conversational agents (CAs), such
as voice assistants and chatbots, default to female personas, leading to
concerns about perpetuating gender stereotypes and inequality. Critiques have
emerged regarding the potential objectification of females and reinforcement of
gender stereotypes by these technologies. This research, situated in
conversational AI design, aims to delve deeper into the impacts of gender
biases in human-CA interactions. From a behavioral and communication research
standpoint, this program focuses not only on perceptions but also the
linguistic styles of users when interacting with CAs, as previous research has
rarely explored. It aims to understand how pre-existing gender biases might be
triggered by CAs' gender designs. It further investigates how CAs' gender
designs may reinforce gender biases and extend them to human-human
communication. The findings aim to inform ethical design of conversational
agents, addressing whether gender assignment in CAs is appropriate and how to
promote gender equality in design.

<p class="mathjax">Although face recognition (FR) has achieved great success in recent years, it
is still challenging to accurately recognize faces in low-quality images due to
the obscured facial details. Nevertheless, it is often feasible to make
predictions about specific soft biometric (SB) attributes, such as gender, and
baldness even in dealing with low-quality images. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-branch neural network that leverages SB attribute information to
boost the performance of FR. To this end, we propose a cross-attribute-guided
transformer fusion (CATF) module that effectively captures the long-range
dependencies and relationships between FR and SB feature representations. The
synergy created by the reciprocal flow of information in the dual
cross-attention operations of the proposed CATF module enhances the performance
of FR. Furthermore, we introduce a novel self-attention distillation framework
that effectively highlights crucial facial regions, such as landmarks by
aligning low-quality images with those of their high-quality counterparts in
the feature space. The proposed self-attention distillation regularizes our
network to learn a unified quality-invariant feature representation in
unconstrained environments. We conduct extensive experiments on various FR
benchmarks varying in quality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of our FR method compared to state-of-the-art FR studies.

<p class="mathjax">Operationalizing large language models (LLMs) for custom, repetitive data
pipelines is challenging, particularly due to their unpredictable and
potentially catastrophic failures. Acknowledging the inevitability of these
errors, we focus on identifying when LLMs may be generating incorrect responses
when used repeatedly as part of data generation pipelines. We present SPADE, a
method for automatically synthesizing assertions that identify bad LLM outputs.
SPADE analyzes prompt version histories to create candidate assertion functions
and then selects a minimal set that fulfills both coverage and accuracy
requirements. In testing across nine different real-world LLM pipelines, SPADE
efficiently reduces the number of assertions by 14% and decreases false
failures by 21% when compared to simpler baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic accident analysis is pivotal for enhancing public safety and
developing road regulations. Traditional approaches, although widely used, are
often constrained by manual analysis processes, subjective decisions, uni-modal
outputs, as well as privacy issues related to sensitive data. This paper
introduces the idea of AccidentGPT, a foundation model of traffic accident
analysis, which incorporates multi-modal input data to automatically
reconstruct the accident process video with dynamics details, and furthermore
provide multi-task analysis with multi-modal outputs. The design of the
AccidentGPT is empowered with a multi-modality prompt with feedback for
task-oriented adaptability, a hybrid training schema to leverage labelled and
unlabelled data, and a edge-cloud split configuration for data privacy. To
fully realize the functionalities of this model, we proposes several research
opportunities. This paper serves as the stepping stone to fill the gaps in
traditional approaches of traffic accident analysis and attract the research
community attention for automatic, objective, and privacy-preserving traffic
accident analysis.

<p class="mathjax">The current neuron reconstruction pipeline for electron microscopy (EM) data
usually includes automatic image segmentation followed by extensive human
expert proofreading. In this work, we aim to reduce human workload by
predicting connectivity between over-segmented neuron pieces, taking both
microscopy image and 3D morphology features into account, similar to human
proofreading workflow. To this end, we first construct a dataset, named
FlyTracing, that contains millions of pairwise connections of segments
expanding the whole fly brain, which is three orders of magnitude larger than
existing datasets for neuron segment connection. To learn sophisticated
biological imaging features from the connectivity annotations, we propose a
novel connectivity-aware contrastive learning method to generate dense
volumetric EM image embedding. The learned embeddings can be easily
incorporated with any point or voxel-based morphological representations for
automatic neuron tracing. Extensive comparisons of different combination
schemes of image and morphological representation in identifying split errors
across the whole fly brain demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach, especially for the locations that contain severe imaging artifacts,
such as section missing and misalignment. The dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/Levishery/Flywire-Neuron-Tracing.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel Latent Diffusion Transformer, namely Latte, for video
generation. Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and
then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the
latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from
videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of
decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the
quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through
rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model
variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding,
and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation
datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In
addition, we extend Latte to text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte
achieves comparable results compared to recent T2V models. We strongly believe
that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating
Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.

Calibration through Prior Adaptation (SUCPA) is a calibration algorithm used in

peculiarity of being non-hyperbolic {with a non-bounded set of non-isolated

<p class="mathjax">Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a
broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC
fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether
sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus,
prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate
quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and
preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency
of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics,
users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a
new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively
estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and
accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To
this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE
admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level
load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is
proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework
for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission
controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network
measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on
context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions. The simulation results show that
the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance and yield substantial
gains in terms of cell-level service reliability and efficient resource
utilization.

<p class="mathjax">We present CRUXEval (Code Reasoning, Understanding, and eXecution
Evaluation), a benchmark consisting of 800 Python functions (3-13 lines). Each
function comes with an input-output pair, leading to two natural tasks: input
prediction and output prediction. First, we propose a generic recipe for
generating our execution benchmark which can be used to create future variation
of the benchmark. Second, we evaluate twenty code models on our benchmark and
discover that many recent high-scoring models on HumanEval do not show the same
improvements on our benchmark. Third, we show that simple CoT and fine-tuning
schemes can improve performance on our benchmark but remain far from solving
it. The best setup, GPT-4 with chain of thought (CoT), achieves a pass@1 of 75%
and 81% on input and output prediction, respectively. In contrast, Code Llama
34B achieves a pass@1 of 50% and 46% on input and output prediction,
highlighting the gap between open and closed source models. As no model is
close to acing CRUXEval, we provide examples of consistent GPT-4 failures on
simple programs as a lens into its code reasoning capabilities and areas for

<p class="mathjax">Context: Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in various domains.
However, like traditional software systems, deep learning systems contain bugs,
which can have severe impacts, as evidenced by crashes involving autonomous
vehicles. Despite substantial advancements in deep learning techniques, little
research has focused on reproducing deep learning bugs, which hinders resolving
them. Existing literature suggests that only 3% of deep learning bugs are
reproducible, underscoring the need for further research.
<br />Objective: This paper examines the reproducibility of deep learning bugs. We
identify edit actions and useful information that could improve deep learning
bug reproducibility.
<br />Method: First, we construct a dataset of 668 deep learning bugs from Stack
Overflow and Defects4ML across 3 frameworks and 22 architectures. Second, we
select 102 bugs using stratified sampling and try to determine their
reproducibility. While reproducing these bugs, we identify edit actions and
useful information necessary for their reproduction. Third, we used the Apriori
algorithm to identify useful information and edit actions required to reproduce
specific bug types. Finally, we conduct a user study with 22 developers to
assess the effectiveness of our findings in real-life settings.
<br />Results: We successfully reproduced 85 bugs and identified ten edit actions
and five useful information categories that can help us reproduce deep learning
bugs. Our findings improved bug reproducibility by 22.92% and reduced
reproduction time by 24.35% based on our user study.
<br />Conclusions: Our research addresses the critical issue of deep learning bug
reproducibility. Practitioners and researchers can leverage our findings to
improve deep learning bug reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">Inland waterways are critical for freight movement, but limited means exist
for monitoring their performance and usage by freight-carrying vessels, e.g.,
barges. While methods to track vessels, e.g., tug and tow boats, are publicly
available through Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), ways to track freight
tonnages and commodity flows carried on barges along these critical marine
highways are non-existent, especially in real-time settings. This paper
develops a method to detect barge traffic on inland waterways using existing
traffic cameras with opportune viewing angles. Deep learning models,
specifically, You Only Look Once (YOLO), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD),
and EfficientDet are employed. The model detects the presence of vessels and/or
barges from video and performs a classification (no vessel or barge, vessel
without barge, vessel with barge, and barge). A dataset of 331 annotated images
was collected from five existing traffic cameras along the Mississippi and Ohio
Rivers for model development. YOLOv8 achieves an F1-score of 96%, outperforming
YOLOv5, SSD, and EfficientDet models with 86%, 79%, and 77% respectively.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out regarding weather conditions (fog and
rain) and location (Mississippi and Ohio rivers). A background subtraction
technique was used to normalize video images across the various locations for
the location sensitivity analysis. This model can be used to detect the
presence of barges along river segments, which can be used for anonymous bulk
commodity tracking and monitoring. Such data is valuable for long-range
transportation planning efforts carried out by public transportation agencies,
in addition to operational and maintenance planning conducted by federal
agencies such as the US Army Corp of Engineers.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning on graphs tackles the problem of training a graph neural
network (GNN) where graph data arrive in a streaming fashion and the model
tends to forget knowledge from previous tasks when updating with new data.
Traditional continual learning strategies such as Experience Replay can be
adapted to streaming graphs, however, these methods often face challenges such
as inefficiency in preserving graph topology and incapability of capturing the
correlation between old and new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
TA$\mathbb{CO}$, a (t)opology-(a)ware graph (co)arsening and (co)ntinual
learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced
graph. At each time period, this reduced graph expands by combining with a new
graph and aligning shared nodes, and then it undergoes a "zoom out" process by
reduction to maintain a stable size. We design a graph coarsening algorithm
based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph and
preserve topological information. We empirically demonstrate the learning
process on the reduced graph can approximate that of the original graph. Our
experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three
real-world datasets using different backbone GNN models.

skills to environments that may be difficult or dangerous to work in. Current
systems are able to give operators direct control of many components of the
robot to immerse them in the remote environment, but operators still struggle

framework for incorporating open-world shared control into avatar robots to
combine the benefits of direct and shared control. This framework preserves the
fluency of our avatar interface by minimizing obstructions to the operator's

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal information extraction (MIE) gains significant attention as the
popularity of multimedia content increases. However, current MIE methods often
resort to using task-specific model structures, which results in limited
generalizability across tasks and underutilizes shared knowledge across MIE
tasks. To address these issues, we propose UMIE, a unified multimodal
information extractor to unify three MIE tasks as a generation problem using
instruction tuning, being able to effectively extract both textual and visual
mentions. Extensive experiments show that our single UMIE outperforms various
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across six MIE datasets on three tasks.
Furthermore, in-depth analysis demonstrates UMIE's strong generalization in the
zero-shot setting, robustness to instruction variants, and interpretability.
Our research serves as an initial step towards a unified MIE model and
initiates the exploration into both instruction tuning and large language
models within the MIE domain. Our code, data, and model are available at

by optimizing the mixing matrix, which controls the communication demands

<p class="mathjax">A genuine signer's signature is naturally unstable even at short
time-intervals whereas, expert forgers always try to perfectly mimic a genuine
signer's signature. This presents a challenge which puts a genuine signer at
risk of being denied access, while a forge signer is granted access. The
implication is a high false acceptance rate (FAR) which is the percentage of
forge signature classified as belonging to a genuine class. Existing work have
only scratched the surface of signature verification because the
misclassification error remains high. In this paper, a consensus-threshold
distance-based classifier criterion is proposed for offline writer-dependent
signature verification. Using features extracted from SigNet and SigNet-F deep
convolutional neural network models, the proposed classifier minimizes FAR.
This is demonstrated via experiments on four datasets: GPDS-300, MCYT, CEDAR
and Brazilian PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-300, the consensus threshold classifier
improves the state-of-the-art performance by achieving a 1.27% FAR compared to
8.73% and 17.31% recorded in literature. This performance is consistent across
other datasets and guarantees that the risk of imposters gaining access to
sensitive documents or transactions is minimal.

<p class="mathjax">For finite element approximations of transport phenomena, it is often
necessary to apply a form of limiting to ensure that the discrete solution
remains well-behaved and satisfies physical constraints. However, these
limiting procedures are typically performed at discrete nodal locations, which
is not sufficient to ensure the robustness of the scheme when the solution must
be evaluated at arbitrary locations (e.g., for adaptive mesh refinement,
remapping in arbitrary Lagragian--Eulerian solvers, overset meshes, etc.). In
this work, a novel limiting approach for discontinuous Galerkin methods is
presented which ensures that the solution is continuously bounds-preserving
(i.e., across the entire solution polynomial) for any arbitrary choice of
basis, approximation order, and mesh element type. Through a modified
formulation for the constraint functionals, the proposed approach requires only
the solution of a single spatial scalar minimization problem per element for
which a highly efficient numerical optimization procedure is presented. The
efficacy of this approach is shown in numerical experiments by enforcing
continuous constraints in high-order unstructured discontinuous Galerkin
discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws, ranging from scalar transport
with maximum principle preserving constraints to compressible gas dynamics with
positivity-preserving constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Complex network data pervades various real-world domains, including physical,
technological, and biological systems. Despite the prevalence of such data,
predicting trends and understanding behavioral patterns in complex systems
remains challenging due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. While
data-driven methods have made strides in uncovering governing equations from
time series data, efforts to extract physical laws from network data are
limited and often struggle with incomplete or noisy data. To address these
challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method
(FEX) and its fast algorithm for this learning problem on complex networks. FEX
represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite
mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a
combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques.
This unique configuration allows FEX to capture complex dynamics with minimal
prior knowledge of the system and a small dictionary of mathematical operators.
Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FEX excels in accurately
identifying dynamics across diverse network topologies and dynamic behaviors.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence based on neural networks has made significant
progress. However, there are concerns about the reliability and security of
this approach due to its lack of transparency. This is the black box problem of
AI. Here we show how this problem can be solved using symbolic AI, which has a
transparent white box nature. The widespread use of symbolic AI is hindered by
the opacity of mathematical models and natural language terms, the lack of a
unified ontology, and the combinatorial explosion of search options. To solve
the AI black box problem and to implement general-purpose symbolic AI, we
propose to use deterministic logic cellular automata with rules based on first
principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this case, the
general theory of the relevant domain plays the role of a knowledge base for
the cellular automaton inference. A cellular automaton implements automatic
parallel logical inference at three levels of organization of a complex system.
Our verification of several ecological hypotheses provides a successful
precedent for the implementation of white-box AI. Finally, we discuss a program
for creating a general-purpose symbolic AI capable of processing knowledge and
ensuring the reliability and safety of automated decisions.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning methods based on AdaBoost have been widely applied to
various classification problems across many mission-critical applications
including healthcare, law and finance. However, there is a growing concern
about the unfairness and discrimination of data-driven classification models,
which is inevitable for classical algorithms including AdaBoost. In order to
achieve fair classification, a novel fair AdaBoost (FAB) approach is proposed
that is an interpretable fairness-improving variant of AdaBoost. We mainly
investigate binary classification problems and focus on the fairness of three
different indicators (i.e., accuracy, false positive rate and false negative
rate). By utilizing a fairness-aware reweighting technique for base
classifiers, the proposed FAB approach can achieve fair classification while
maintaining the advantage of AdaBoost with negligible sacrifice of predictive
performance. In addition, a hyperparameter is introduced in FAB to show
preferences for the fairness-accuracy trade-off. An upper bound for the target
loss function that quantifies error rate and unfairness is theoretically
derived for FAB, which provides a strict theoretical support for the
fairness-improving methods designed for AdaBoost. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world datasets (i.e., Adult,
COMPAS and HSLS) with respect to the three fairness indicators. The results are
accordant with theoretic analyses, and show that (i) FAB significantly improves
classification fairness at a small cost of accuracy compared with AdaBoost; and
(ii) FAB outperforms state-of-the-art fair classification methods including
equalized odds method, exponentiated gradient method, and disparate
mistreatment method in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

<p class="mathjax">Fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) provide structural systems with unique
features that appeal to various civilian and military sectors. Often, one needs
to modulate the temperature field to achieve the intended functionalities
(e.g., self-healing) in these lightweight structures. Vascular-based active
cooling offers one efficient way of thermal regulation in such material
systems. However, the thermophysical properties (e.g., thermal conductivity,
specific heat capacity) of FRC and their base constituents depend on
temperature, and such structures are often subject to a broad spectrum of
temperatures. Notably, prior active cooling modeling studies did not account
for such temperature dependence. Thus, the primary aim of this paper is to
reveal the effect of temperature-dependent material properties -- obtained via
material characterization -- on the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of
active cooling. By applying mathematical analysis and conducting numerical
simulations, we show this dependence does not affect qualitative attributes,
such as minimum and maximum principles (in the same spirit as \textsc{Hopf}'s
results for elliptic partial differential equations). However, the dependence
slightly affects quantitative results, such as the mean surface temperature and
thermal efficiency. The import of our study is that it provides a deeper
understanding of thermal regulation systems under practical scenarios and can
guide researchers and practitioners in perfecting associated designs.

<p class="mathjax">Neural growth is the process of growing a small neural network to a large
network and has been utilized to accelerate the training of deep neural
networks. One crucial aspect of neural growth is determining the optimal growth
timing. However, few studies investigate this systematically. Our study reveals
that neural growth inherently exhibits a regularization effect, whose intensity
is influenced by the chosen policy for growth timing. While this regularization
effect may mitigate the overfitting risk of the model, it may lead to a notable
accuracy drop when the model underfits. Yet, current approaches have not
addressed this issue due to their lack of consideration of the regularization
effect from neural growth. Motivated by these findings, we propose an
under/over fitting risk-aware growth timing policy, which automatically adjusts
the growth timing informed by the level of potential under/overfitting risks to
address both risks. Comprehensive experiments conducted using CIFAR-10/100 and
ImageNet datasets show that the proposed policy achieves accuracy improvements
of up to 1.3% in models prone to underfitting while achieving similar
accuracies in models suffering from overfitting compared to the existing
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are experiencing rapid growth,
yielding a plethora of noteworthy contributions in recent months. The
prevailing trend involves adopting data-driven methodologies, wherein diverse
instruction-following datasets are collected. However, a prevailing challenge
persists in these approaches, specifically in relation to the limited visual
perception ability, as CLIP-like encoders employed for extracting visual
information from inputs. Though these encoders are pre-trained on billions of
image-text pairs, they still grapple with the information loss dilemma, given
that textual captions only partially capture the contents depicted in images.
To address this limitation, this paper proposes to improve the visual
perception ability of MLLMs through a mixture-of-experts knowledge enhancement
mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that incorporates
multi-task encoders and visual tools into the existing MLLMs training and
inference pipeline, aiming to provide a more comprehensive and accurate
summarization of visual inputs. Extensive experiments have evaluated its
effectiveness of advancing MLLMs, showcasing improved visual perception
achieved through the integration of visual experts.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel self-supervised framework for retargeting
non-parameterized 3D garments onto 3D human avatars of arbitrary shapes and
poses, enabling 3D virtual try-on (VTON). Existing self-supervised 3D
retargeting methods only support parametric and canonical garments, which can
only be draped over parametric body, e.g. SMPL. To facilitate the
non-parametric garments and body, we propose a novel method that introduces
Isomap Embedding based correspondences matching between the garment and the
human body to get a coarse alignment between the two meshes. We perform neural
refinement of the coarse alignment in a self-supervised setting. Further, we
leverage a Laplacian detail integration method for preserving the inherent
details of the input garment. For evaluating our 3D non-parametric garment
retargeting framework, we propose a dataset of 255 real-world garments with
realistic noise and topological deformations. The dataset contains $44$ unique
garments worn by 15 different subjects in 5 distinctive poses, captured using a
multi-view RGBD capture setup. We show superior retargeting quality on
non-parametric garments and human avatars over existing state-of-the-art
methods, acting as the first-ever baseline on the proposed dataset for
non-parametric 3D garment retargeting.

<p class="mathjax">As a powerful tool for modeling graph data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
received increasing attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, it
is notoriously difficult to deploy GNNs on industrial scale graphs, due to
their huge data size and complex topological structures. In this paper, we
propose GLISP, a sampling based GNN learning system for industrial scale
graphs. By exploiting the inherent structural properties of graphs, such as
power law distribution and data locality, GLISP addresses the scalability and
performance issues that arise at different stages of the graph learning
process. GLISP consists of three core components: graph partitioner, graph
sampling service and graph inference engine. The graph partitioner adopts the
proposed vertex-cut graph partitioning algorithm AdaDNE to produce balanced
partitioning for power law graphs, which is essential for sampling based GNN
systems. The graph sampling service employs a load balancing design that allows
the one hop sampling request of high degree vertices to be handled by multiple
servers. In conjunction with the memory efficient data structure, the
efficiency and scalability are effectively improved. The graph inference engine
splits the $K$-layer GNN into $K$ slices and caches the vertex embeddings
produced by each slice in the data locality aware hybrid caching system for
reuse, thus completely eliminating redundant computation caused by the data
dependency of graph. Extensive experiments show that GLISP achieves up to
$6.53\times$ and $70.77\times$ speedups over existing GNN systems for training
and inference tasks, respectively, and can scale to the graph with over 10
billion vertices and 40 billion edges with limited resources.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks can readily disrupt the image classification system,
revealing the vulnerability of DNN-based recognition tasks. While existing
adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or
compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG,
limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image
classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid
evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression
has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many
security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and
autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional
compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the
robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image
compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on
a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned
image compressors as pre-processing modules. Furthermore, to enhance the
transferability of perturbations across various quality levels and
architectures of learned image compression models, we introduce a saliency
score-based sampling method to enable the fast generation of transferable
perturbation. Extensive experiments with popular attack methods demonstrate the
enhanced transferability of our proposed method when attacking images that have
been post-processed with different learned image compression models.

<p class="mathjax">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the
stability and reliability of online systems. Effective and early detection of
such attacks is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of networks. In this
work, we introduce an enhanced approach for DDoS attack detection by leveraging
the capabilities of Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) coupled with
synthetic oversampling techniques. Because of the inherent class imbalance in
many cyber-security datasets, conventional methods often struggle with false
negatives, misclassifying subtle DDoS patterns as benign. By applying the
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the CICIDS dataset, we
balance the representation of benign and malicious data points, enabling the
model to better discern intricate patterns indicative of an attack. Our deep
residual network, tailored for this specific task, further refines the
detection process. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that our approach achieves an accuracy of 99.98%, significantly outperforming
traditional methods. This work underscores the potential of combining advanced
data augmentation techniques with deep learning models to bolster
cyber-security defenses.

<p class="mathjax">NuLink provides privacy-preserving technology for decentralized applications
via APIs. Users can securely store its valuable data, trade with others and so
on. To ensure the privacy and security of service provided by NuLink,
(zero-knowledge) proof systems are necessary. Zero-knowledge proof systems
allow the prover to make the verifier believe that a certain conclusion is
correct without providing any useful information to the verifier. In NuLink, we
are going to use (zero-knowledge) proof system in the following three methods:
1. Users store their data through NuLink in a decentralized manner. To ensure
that the storage clients are indeed storing the data, we employ proof of
storage systems. In this system, users prepare certain challenges that can only
be correctly answered by those who are actually storing the data. 2. Users have
the option to outsource computations to NuLink. To verify the correctness of
the computation results provided by the compute node, we require the node to
provide a proof of correctness via SNARK systems. When sensitive parameters are
used as inputs for computation, we utilize zk-SNARKs to prevent any potential
leakage of these parameters. 3. Users may choose to trade their data through
NuLink. To confirm that the buyer has sufficient digital funds and the seller
possesses the desired data, both parties can provide a proof via zk-SNARKs.
This builds confidence and prevents cheating during transactions. Using
zero-knowledge proof systems, we can ensure that all nodes in NuLink behaves
honestly and avoid cheating in the whole system.

<p class="mathjax">Due to manufacturing variabilities and temperature gradients within an
electric vehicle's battery pack, the capacities of cells in it decrease
differently over time. This reduces the usable capacity of the battery - the
charge levels of one or more cells might be at the minimum threshold while most
of the other cells have residual charge. Active cell balancing (i.e.,
transferring charge among cells) can equalize their charge levels, thereby
increasing the battery pack's usable capacity. But performing balancing means
additional charge transfer, which can result in energy loss and cell aging,
akin to memory aging in storage technologies due to writing. This paper studies
when cell balancing should be optimally triggered to minimize aging while
maintaining the necessary driving capability. In particular, we propose
optimization strategies for cell balancing while minimizing their impact on
aging. By borrowing terminology from the storage domain, we refer to this as
"wear leveling-aware" active balancing.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable
proficiency across various tasks. Given the potent applications of LLMs in
numerous fields, there has been a surge in LLM development. In developing LLMs,
a common practice involves continual pre-training on previously fine-tuned
models. However, this can lead to catastrophic forgetting. In our work, we
investigate the phenomenon of forgetting that occurs during continual
pre-training on an existing fine-tuned LLM. We evaluate the impact of
continuous pre-training on the fine-tuned LLM across various dimensions,
including output format, knowledge, and reliability. Experiment results
highlight the non-trivial challenge of addressing catastrophic forgetting
during continual pre-training, especially the repetition issue.

<p class="mathjax">Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a vital role in geoscience to explore the
subsurface. It utilizes the seismic wave to image the subsurface velocity map.
As the machine learning (ML) technique evolves, the data-driven approaches
using ML for FWI tasks have emerged, offering enhanced accuracy and reduced
computational cost compared to traditional physics-based methods. However, a
common challenge in geoscience, the unprivileged data, severely limits ML
effectiveness. The issue becomes even worse during model pruning, a step
essential in geoscience due to environmental complexities. To tackle this, we
introduce the EdGeo toolkit, which employs a diffusion-based model guided by
physics principles to generate high-fidelity velocity maps. The toolkit uses
the acoustic wave equation to generate corresponding seismic waveform data,
facilitating the fine-tuning of pruned ML models. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements in SSIM scores and reduction in both MAE and MSE
across various pruning ratios. Notably, the ML model fine-tuned using data
generated by EdGeo yields superior quality of velocity maps, especially in
representing unprivileged features, outperforming other existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are
captured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal
reasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple
sequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently
capture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is
not uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder
to extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual
timesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information.
Here we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic
interactions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional
sequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a
compact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse
time scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a
multi-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to
efficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction
process is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate
TimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions,
including a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human
activity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of
TimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains
state-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2%
on event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our
experiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including
zero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability
to streaming data flow.

designed. A prefilter of the output is utilized in order to improve robustness
of the observer with respect to measurement noises. The use of such a prefilter
also simplifies tuning, since the observer gains in this case are parameterized

<p class="mathjax">Alleviating overestimation bias is a critical challenge for deep
reinforcement learning to achieve successful performance on more complex tasks
or offline datasets containing out-of-distribution data. In order to overcome
overestimation bias, ensemble methods for Q-learning have been investigated to
exploit the diversity of multiple Q-functions. Since network initialization has
been the predominant approach to promote diversity in Q-functions,
heuristically designed diversity injection methods have been studied in the
literature. However, previous studies have not attempted to approach guaranteed
independence over an ensemble from a theoretical perspective. By introducing a
novel regularization loss for Q-ensemble independence based on random matrix
theory, we propose spiked Wishart Q-ensemble independence regularization (SPQR)
for reinforcement learning. Specifically, we modify the intractable hypothesis
testing criterion for the Q-ensemble independence into a tractable KL
divergence between the spectral distribution of the Q-ensemble and the target
Wigner's semicircle distribution. We implement SPQR in several online and
offline ensemble Q-learning algorithms. In the experiments, SPQR outperforms
the baseline algorithms in both online and offline RL benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by
well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion
models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training
data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can
be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find
empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this
limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called
\textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional
training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated
data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i)
the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the
generated data.

<p class="mathjax">An artificial lateral line (ALL) is a bioinspired flow sensing system of an
underwater robot that consists of distributed flow sensors. The ALL has
achieved great success in sensing the motion states of bioinspired underwater
robots, e.g., robotic fish, that are driven by body undulation and/or tail
flapping. However, the ALL has not been systematically tested and studied in
the sensing of underwater robots driven by rotating propellers due to the
highly dynamic and complex flow field therein. This paper makes a bold
hypothesis that the distributed flow measurements sampled from the propeller
wake flow, although infeasible to represent the entire flow dynamics, provides
sufficient information for estimating the lateral motion states of the leader
underwater robot. An experimental testbed is constructed to investigate the
feasibility of such a state estimator which comprises a cylindrical ALL sensory
system, a rotating leader propeller, and a water tank with a planar sliding
guide. Specifically, a hybrid network that consists of a one-dimensional
convolution network (1DCNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory network
(BiLSTM) is designed to extract the spatiotemporal features of the time series
of distributed pressure measurements. A multi-output deep learning network is
adopted to estimate the lateral motion states of the leader propeller. In
addition, the state estimator is optimized using the whale optimization
algorithm (WOA) considering the comprehensive estimation performance. Extensive
experiments are conducted the results of which validate the proposed
data-driven algorithm in estimating the motion states of the leader underwater
robot by propeller wake sensing.

<p class="mathjax">How to effectively exploit spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture
target appearance changes in visual tracking. However, most deep learning-based
trackers mainly focus on designing a complicated appearance model or template
updating strategy, while lacking the exploitation of context between
consecutive frames and thus entailing the \textit{when-and-how-to-update}
dilemma. To address these issues, we propose a novel explicit visual prompts
framework for visual tracking, dubbed \textbf{EVPTrack}. Specifically, we
utilize spatio-temporal tokens to propagate information between consecutive
frames without focusing on updating templates. As a result, we cannot only
alleviate the challenge of \textit{when-to-update}, but also avoid the
hyper-parameters associated with updating strategies. Then, we utilize the
spatio-temporal tokens to generate explicit visual prompts that facilitate
inference in the current frame. The prompts are fed into a transformer encoder
together with the image tokens without additional processing. Consequently, the
efficiency of our model is improved by avoiding \textit{how-to-update}. In
addition, we consider multi-scale information as explicit visual prompts,
providing multiscale template features to enhance the EVPTrack's ability to
handle target scale changes. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks
(i.e., LaSOT, LaSOT\rm $_{ext}$, GOT-10k, UAV123, TrackingNet, and TNL2K.)
validate that our EVPTrack can achieve competitive performance at a real-time
speed by effectively exploiting both spatio-temporal and multi-scale
information. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/EVPTrack.

<p class="mathjax">Novice programmers need to learn how to write basic code but often face
difficulties when coding independently. To assist struggling students, we have
recently implemented personalized Parsons problems as a pop-up scaffolding.
Students found them to be more engaging and helpful for learning compared to
simply receiving the correct answer, such as the response they might get from
Large Language Model (LLM) tools like ChatGPT. However, a drawback of using
Parsons problems as scaffolding is that students may be able to put the code
blocks back in place without fully understanding the rationale of the correct
solution. As a result, the learning benefits of such scaffolding are
compromised. Our goal is to enhance the advantages of using personalized
Parsons problems as scaffolding by improving their comprehension through code
explanations. In this poster, we propose designs that incorporate multiple
levels of textual explanations in the Parsons problems. This design will be
used for future technical evaluation and classroom experiments. These
experiments will explore the effectiveness of adding textual explanations to
Parsons problems to improve instructional benefits.

<p class="mathjax">Industrial anomaly detection is generally addressed as an unsupervised task
that aims at locating defects with only normal training samples. Recently,
numerous 2D anomaly detection methods have been proposed and have achieved
promising results, however, using only the 2D RGB data as input is not
sufficient to identify imperceptible geometric surface anomalies. Hence, in
this work, we focus on multi-modal anomaly detection. Specifically, we
investigate early multi-modal approaches that attempted to utilize models
pre-trained on large-scale visual datasets, i.e., ImageNet, to construct
feature databases. And we empirically find that directly using these
pre-trained models is not optimal, it can either fail to detect subtle defects
or mistake abnormal features as normal ones. This may be attributed to the
domain gap between target industrial data and source data.Towards this problem,
we propose a Local-to-global Self-supervised Feature Adaptation (LSFA) method
to finetune the adaptors and learn task-oriented representation toward anomaly
detection.Both intra-modal adaptation and cross-modal alignment are optimized
from a local-to-global perspective in LSFA to ensure the representation quality
and consistency in the inference stage.Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method not only brings a significant performance boost to feature embedding
based approaches, but also outperforms previous State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods
prominently on both MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets, e.g., LSFA achieves
97.1% I-AUROC on MVTec-3D, surpass previous SoTA by +3.4%.

<p class="mathjax">It is of great interest to solve the inverse problem of stationary radiative
transport equation (RTE) in optical tomography. The standard way is to
formulate the inverse problem into an optimization problem, but the bottleneck
is that one has to solve the forward problem repeatedly, which is
time-consuming. Due to the optical property of biological tissue, in real
applications, optical thin and thick regions coexist and are adjacent to each
other, and the geometry can be complex. To use coarse meshes and save the
computational cost, the forward solver has to be asymptotic preserving across
the interface (APAL).
<br />In this paper, we propose an offline/online solver for RTE. The cost at the
offline stage is comparable to classical methods, while the cost at the online
stage is much lower. Two cases are considered. One is to solve the RTE with
fixed scattering and absorption cross sections while the boundary conditions
vary; the other is when cross sections vary in a small domain and the boundary
conditions change many times. The solver can be decomposed into offline/online
stages in these two cases. One only needs to calculate the offline stage once
and update the online stage when the parameters vary. Our proposed solver is
much cheaper when one needs to solve RTE with multiple right-hand sides or when
the cross sections vary in a small domain, thus can accelerate the speed of
solving inverse RTE problems. We illustrate the online/offline decomposition
based on the Tailored Finite Point Method (TFPM), which is APAL on general
quadrilateral meshes.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce Context-Aware MultiModal Learner (CaMML), for
tuning large multimodal models (LMMs). CaMML, a lightweight module, is crafted
to seamlessly integrate multimodal contextual samples into large models,
thereby empowering the model to derive knowledge from analogous,
domain-specific, up-to-date information and make grounded inferences.
Importantly, CaMML is highly scalable and can efficiently handle lengthy
multimodal context examples owing to its hierarchical design. Based on CaMML,
we have developed two multimodal models, CaMML-7B and CaMML-13B, that have
shown exceptional performance across an array of benchmark datasets for
multimodal tasks. Remarkably, CaMML-13B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on over ten widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets,
surpassing LLaVA-1.5 (13B) with a noticeable margin, without integration of any
external resources. Moreover, we have conducted extensive ablative studies to
inspect the inner workings of CaMML and performed qualitative analyses to
showcase its effectiveness in handling real-world challenging cases.

<p class="mathjax">Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the security and
maintenance of modern software systems. At present, the primary approach for
detecting anomalies in log data is through supervised anomaly detection.
Nonetheless, existing supervised methods heavily rely on labeled data, which
can be frequently limited in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised log anomaly detection method that combines the DQN algorithm
from deep reinforcement learning, which is called DQNLog. DQNLog leverages a
small amount of labeled data and a large-scale unlabeled dataset, effectively
addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and limited labeling. This
approach not only learns known anomalies by interacting with an environment
biased towards anomalies but also discovers unknown anomalies by actively
exploring the unlabeled dataset. Additionally, DQNLog incorporates a
cross-entropy loss term to prevent model overestimation during Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our evaluation on three widely-used datasets
demonstrates that DQNLog significantly improves recall rate and F1-score while
maintaining precision, validating its practicality.

<p class="mathjax">Training supervised deep neural networks that perform defect detection and
segmentation requires large-scale fully-annotated datasets, which can be hard
or even impossible to obtain in industrial environments. Generative AI offers
opportunities to enlarge small industrial datasets artificially, thus enabling
the usage of state-of-the-art supervised approaches in the industry.
Unfortunately, also good generative models need a lot of data to train, while
industrial datasets are often tiny. Here, we propose a new approach for reusing
general-purpose pre-trained generative models on industrial data, ultimately
allowing the generation of self-labelled defective images. First, we let the
model learn the new concept, entailing the novel data distribution. Then, we
force it to learn to condition the generative process, producing industrial
images that satisfy well-defined topological characteristics and show defects
with a given geometry and location. To highlight the advantage of our approach,
we use the synthetic dataset to optimise a crack segmentor for a real
industrial use case. When the available data is small, we observe considerable
performance increase under several metrics, showing the method's potential in
production environments.

<p class="mathjax">Event cameras or dynamic vision sensors (DVS) record asynchronous response to
brightness changes instead of conventional intensity frames, and feature
ultra-high sensitivity at low bandwidth. The new mechanism demonstrates great
advantages in challenging scenarios with fast motion and large dynamic range.
However, the recorded events might be highly sparse due to either limited
hardware bandwidth or extreme photon starvation in harsh environments. To
unlock the full potential of event cameras, we propose an inventive event
sequence completion approach conforming to the unique characteristics of event
data in both the processing stage and the output form. Specifically, we treat
event streams as 3D event clouds in the spatiotemporal domain, develop a
diffusion-based generative model to generate dense clouds in a coarse-to-fine
manner, and recover exact timestamps to maintain the temporal resolution of raw
data successfully. To validate the effectiveness of our method comprehensively,
we perform extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets with
different spatial resolutions, and additionally collect a novel event dataset
covering diverse scenarios with highly dynamic motions and under harsh
illumination. Besides generating high-quality dense events, our method can
benefit downstream applications such as object classification and intensity
frame reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent multi-target tracking has a wide range of applications, including
wildlife patrolling, security surveillance or environment monitoring. Such
algorithms often make restrictive assumptions: the number of targets and/or
their initial locations may be assumed known, or agents may be pre-assigned to
monitor disjoint partitions of the environment, reducing the burden of
exploration. This also limits applicability when there are fewer agents than
targets, since agents are unable to continuously follow the targets in their
fields of view. Multi-agent tracking algorithms additionally assume inter-agent
synchronization of observations, or the presence of a central controller to
coordinate joint actions. Instead, we focus on the setting of decentralized
multi-agent, multi-target, simultaneous active search-and-tracking with
asynchronous inter-agent communication. Our proposed algorithm DecSTER uses a
sequential monte carlo implementation of the probability hypothesis density
filter for posterior inference combined with Thompson sampling for
decentralized multi-agent decision making. We compare different action
selection policies, focusing on scenarios where targets outnumber agents. In
simulation, we demonstrate that DecSTER is robust to unreliable inter-agent
communication and outperforms information-greedy baselines in terms of the
Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) metric for different numbers of targets
and varying teamsizes.

<p class="mathjax">Stability analysis is an essential aspect of studying the generalization
ability of deep learning, as it involves deriving generalization bounds for
stochastic gradient descent-based training algorithms. Adversarial training is
the most widely used defense against adversarial example attacks. However,
previous generalization bounds for adversarial training have not included
information regarding the data distribution. In this paper, we fill this gap by
providing generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent-based
adversarial training that incorporate data distribution information. We utilize
the concepts of on-average stability and high-order approximate Lipschitz
conditions to examine how changes in data distribution and adversarial budget
can affect robust generalization gaps. Our derived generalization bounds for
both convex and non-convex losses are at least as good as the uniform
stability-based counterparts which do not include data distribution
information. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate how distribution shifts from
data poisoning attacks can impact robust generalization.

<p class="mathjax">Short Text Classification (STC) is crucial for processing and comprehending
the brief but substantial content prevalent on contemporary digital platforms.
The STC encounters difficulties in grasping semantic and syntactic intricacies,
an issue that is apparent in traditional pre-trained language models. Although
Graph Convolutional Networks enhance performance by integrating external
knowledge bases, these methods are limited by the quality and extent of the
knowledge applied. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly improved the performance of complex
reasoning tasks. However, some studies have highlighted the limitations of
their application in fundamental NLP tasks. Consequently, this study sought to
employ CoT to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in STC tasks. This study
introduces Quartet Logic: A Four-Step Reasoning (QLFR) framework. This
framework primarily incorporates Syntactic and Semantic Enrichment CoT,
effectively decomposing the STC task into four distinct steps: (i) essential
concept identification, (ii) common-sense knowledge retrieval, (iii) text
rewriting, and (iv) classification. This elicits the inherent knowledge and
abilities of LLMs to address the challenges in STC. Surprisingly, we found that
QLFR can also improve the performance of smaller models. Therefore, we
developed a CoT-Driven Multi-task learning (QLFR-CML) method to facilitate the
knowledge transfer from LLMs to smaller models. Extensive experimentation
across six short-text benchmarks validated the efficacy of the proposed
methods. Notably, QLFR achieved state-of-the-art performance on all datasets,
with significant improvements, particularly on the Ohsumed and TagMyNews
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning is an emerging distributed machine learning framework in
the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In IoV, millions of vehicles are willing to
train the model to share their knowledge. Maintaining an active state means the
participants must update their state to the FL server in a fixed interval and
participate to next round. However, the cost by maintaining an active state is
very large when there are a huge number of participating vehicles. In this
paper, we proposed a distributed client selection scheme to reduce the cost of
maintaining the active state for all participants. The clients with the highest
evaluation are elected among the neighbours. In the evaluator, four variables
are considered including sample quantity, throughput available, computational
capability and the quality of the local dataset. We adopted fuzzy logic as the
evaluator since the closed-form solution over four variables does not exist.
Extensive simulation results show our proposal approximates the centralized
client selection in terms of accuracy and can significantly reduce the
communication overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Despite significant progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs), the development of
driving policies that ensure both the safety of AVs and traffic flow efficiency
has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI
mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which
facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon.
Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an
innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into
AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves
as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore
uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous
situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the
other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance,
thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data
collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two
training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually
designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action
values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents' policy learning.
Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human
mentor's cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms
traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of
traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios. The

technology, selecting a high-quality service from a wide range of options has
become a complex task. This study aims to address the challenges of data
sparsity and the cold-start problem in web service recommendation using Quality
of Service (QoS). We propose a novel approach called QoS-aware graph
contrastive learning (QAGCL) for web service recommendation. Our model
harnesses the power of graph contrastive learning to handle cold-start problems
and improve recommendation accuracy effectively. By constructing contextually
augmented graphs with geolocation information and randomness, our model
provides diverse views. Through the use of graph convolutional networks and
graph contrastive learning techniques, we learn user and service embeddings
from these augmented graphs. The learned embeddings are then utilized to
seamlessly integrate QoS considerations into the recommendation process.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our QAGCL model over
several existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing data
sparsity and the cold-start problem in QoS-aware service recommendations. Our
research contributes to the potential for more accurate recommendations in
real-world scenarios, even with limited user-service interaction data.

<p class="mathjax">One common approach to solve multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
problems is to extend conventional Q-learning by using vector Q-values in
combination with a utility function. However issues can arise with this
approach in the context of stochastic environments, particularly when
optimising for the Scalarised Expected Reward (SER) criterion. This paper
extends prior research, providing a detailed examination of the factors
influencing the frequency with which value-based MORL Q-learning algorithms
learn the SER-optimal policy for an environment with stochastic state
transitions. We empirically examine several variations of the core

<p class="mathjax">Point cloud registration is a crucial technique in 3D computer vision with a
wide range of applications. However, this task can be challenging, particularly
in large fields of view with dynamic objects, environmental noise, or other
perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a model called PosDiffNet.
Our approach performs hierarchical registration based on window-level,
patch-level, and point-level correspondence. We leverage a graph neural partial
differential equation (PDE) based on Beltrami flow to obtain high-dimensional
features and position embeddings for point clouds. We incorporate position
embeddings into a Transformer module based on a neural ordinary differential
equation (ODE) to efficiently represent patches within points. We employ the
multi-level correspondence derived from the high feature similarity scores to
facilitate alignment between point clouds. Subsequently, we use registration
methods such as SVD-based algorithms to predict the transformation using
corresponding point pairs. We evaluate PosDiffNet on several 3D point cloud
datasets, verifying that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for
point cloud registration in large fields of view with perturbations. The
implementation code of experiments is available at
https://github.com/AI-IT-AVs/PosDiffNet.

<p class="mathjax">Domain generalization (DG) aims to improve the generalization ability of the
model trained on several known training domains over unseen test domains.
Previous work has shown that self-supervised contrastive pre-training improves
the robustness of the model on downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we
find that self-supervised models do not exhibit better generalization
performance than supervised models pre-trained on the same dataset in the DG
setting. We argue that this is owing to the fact that the richer intra-class
discriminative features extracted by self-supervised contrastive learning,
which we term silent features, are suppressed during supervised fine-tuning.
These silent features are likely to contain features that are more
generalizable on the test domain. In this work, we model and analyze this
feature suppression phenomenon and theoretically prove that preserving silent
features can achieve lower expected test domain risk under certain conditions.
In light of this, we propose a simple yet effective method termed STEP (Silent
Feature Preservation) to improve the generalization performance of the
self-supervised contrastive learning pre-trained model by alleviating the
suppression of silent features during the supervised fine-tuning process.
Experimental results show that STEP exhibits state-of-the-art performance on
standard DG benchmarks with significant distribution shifts.

<p class="mathjax">In contemporary society, the escalating pressures of life and work have
propelled psychological disorders to the forefront of modern health concerns,
an issue that has been further accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
prevalence of depression among adolescents is steadily increasing, and
traditional diagnostic methods, which rely on scales or interviews, prove
particularly inadequate for detecting depression in young people. Addressing
these challenges, numerous AI-based methods for assisting in the diagnosis of
mental health issues have emerged. However, most of these methods center around
fundamental issues with scales or use multimodal approaches like facial
expression recognition. Diagnosis of depression risk based on everyday habits
and behaviors has been limited to small-scale qualitative studies. Our research
leverages adolescent census data to predict depression risk, focusing on
children's experiences with depression and their daily life situations. We
introduced a method for managing severely imbalanced high-dimensional data and
an adaptive predictive approach tailored to data structure characteristics.
Furthermore, we proposed a cloud-based architecture for automatic online
learning and data updates. This study utilized publicly available NSCH youth
census data from 2020 to 2022, encompassing nearly 150,000 data entries. We
conducted basic data analyses and predictive experiments, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over standard machine learning and deep
learning algorithms. This affirmed our data processing method's broad
applicability in handling imbalanced medical data. Diverging from typical
predictive method research, our study presents a comprehensive architectural
solution, considering a wider array of user needs.

<p class="mathjax">Language Processing systems such as Part-of-speech tagging, Named entity
recognition, Machine translation, Speech recognition, and Language modeling
(LM) are well-studied in high-resource languages. Nevertheless, research on
these systems for several low-resource languages, including Bodo, Mizo,
Nagamese, and others, is either yet to commence or is in its nascent stages.
Language model plays a vital role in the downstream tasks of modern NLP.
Extensive studies are carried out on LMs for high-resource languages.
Nevertheless, languages such as Bodo, Rabha, and Mising continue to lack
coverage. In this study, we first present BodoBERT, a language model for the
Bodo language. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first such effort
to develop a language model for Bodo. Secondly, we present an ensemble DL-based
POS tagging model for Bodo. The POS tagging model is based on combinations of
BiLSTM with CRF and stacked embedding of BodoBERT with BytePairEmbeddings. We
cover several language models in the experiment to see how well they work in
POS tagging tasks. The best-performing model achieves an F1 score of 0.8041. A
comparative experiment was also conducted on Assamese POS taggers, considering
that the language is spoken in the same region as Bodo.

<p class="mathjax">Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to identify relevant
videos given textual queries. Compared to conventional textual retrieval, the
main obstacle for text-video retrieval is the semantic gap between the textual
nature of queries and the visual richness of video content. Previous works
primarily focus on aligning the query and the video by finely aggregating
word-frame matching signals. Inspired by the human cognitive process of
modularly judging the relevance between text and video, the judgment needs
high-order matching signal due to the consecutive and complex nature of video
contents. In this paper, we propose chunk-level text-video matching, where the
query chunks are extracted to describe a specific retrieval unit, and the video
chunks are segmented into distinct clips from videos. We formulate the
chunk-level matching as n-ary correlations modeling between words of the query
and frames of the video and introduce a multi-modal hypergraph for n-ary
correlation modeling. By representing textual units and video frames as nodes
and using hyperedges to depict their relationships, a multi-modal hypergraph is
constructed. In this way, the query and the video can be aligned in a
high-order semantic space. In addition, to enhance the model's generalization
ability, the extracted features are fed into a variational inference component
for computation, obtaining the variational representation under the Gaussian
distribution. The incorporation of hypergraphs and variational inference allows
our model to capture complex, n-ary interactions among textual and visual
contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the text-video retrieval task.

<p class="mathjax">In multimodal land cover classification (MLCC), a common challenge is the
redundancy in data distribution, where irrelevant information from multiple
modalities can hinder the effective integration of their unique features. To
tackle this, we introduce the Multimodal Informative Vit (MIVit), a system with
an innovative information aggregate-distributing mechanism. This approach
redefines redundancy levels and integrates performance-aware elements into the
fused representation, facilitating the learning of semantics in both forward
and backward directions. MIVit stands out by significantly reducing redundancy
in the empirical distribution of each modality's separate and fused features.
It employs oriented attention fusion (OAF) for extracting shallow local
features across modalities in horizontal and vertical dimensions, and a
Transformer feature extractor for extracting deep global features through
long-range attention. We also propose an information aggregation constraint
(IAC) based on mutual information, designed to remove redundant information and
preserve complementary information within embedded features. Additionally, the
information distribution flow (IDF) in MIVit enhances performance-awareness by
distributing global classification information across different modalities'
feature maps. This architecture also addresses missing modality challenges with
lightweight independent modality classifiers, reducing the computational load
typically associated with Transformers. Our results show that MIVit's
bidirectional aggregate-distributing mechanism between modalities is highly
effective, achieving an average overall accuracy of 95.56% across three
multimodal datasets. This performance surpasses current state-of-the-art
methods in MLCC. The code for MIVit is accessible at
https://github.com/icey-zhang/MIViT.

<p class="mathjax">Medical question answer (QA) assistants respond to lay users' health-related
queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources using natural
language processing and related techniques. They can serve as vital tools to
alleviate issues of misinformation, information overload, and complexity of
medical language, thus addressing lay users' information needs while reducing
the burden on healthcare professionals. QA systems, the engines of such
assistants, have typically used either language models (LMs) or knowledge
graphs (KG), though the approaches could be complementary. LM-based QA systems
excel at understanding complex questions and providing well-formed answers, but
are prone to factual mistakes. KG-based QA systems, which represent facts well,
are mostly limited to answering short-answer questions with pre-created
templates. While a few studies have jointly used LM and KG approaches for
text-based QA, this was done to answer multiple-choice questions. Extant QA
systems also have limitations in terms of automation and performance. We
address these challenges by designing a novel, automated disease QA system
which effectively utilizes both LM and KG techniques through a joint-reasoning
approach to answer disease-related questions appropriate for lay users. Our
evaluation of the system using a range of quality metrics demonstrates its
efficacy over benchmark systems, including the popular ChatGPT.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate cloud recognition and warning are crucial for various applications,
including in-flight support, weather forecasting, and climate research.
However, recent deep learning algorithms have predominantly focused on
detecting cloud regions in satellite imagery, with insufficient attention to
the specificity required for accurate cloud recognition. This limitation
inspired us to develop the novel FY-4A-Himawari-8 (FYH) dataset, which includes
nine distinct cloud categories and uses precise domain adaptation methods to
align 70,419 image-label pairs in terms of projection, temporal resolution, and
spatial resolution, thereby facilitating the training of supervised deep
learning networks. Given the complexity and diversity of cloud formations, we
have thoroughly analyzed the challenges inherent to cloud recognition tasks,
examining the intricate characteristics and distribution of the data. To
effectively address these challenges, we designed a Distribution-aware
Interactive-Attention Network (DIAnet), which preserves pixel-level details
through a high-resolution branch and a parallel multi-resolution cross-branch.
We also integrated a distribution-aware loss (DAL) to mitigate the imbalance
across cloud categories. An Interactive Attention Module (IAM) further enhances
the robustness of feature extraction combined with spatial and channel
information. Empirical evaluations on the FYH dataset demonstrate that our
method outperforms other cloud recognition networks, achieving superior
performance in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The code for
implementing DIAnet is available at https://github.com/icey-zhang/DIAnet.

<p class="mathjax">Defeasibility in causal reasoning implies that the causal relationship
between cause and effect can be strengthened or weakened. Namely, the causal
strength between cause and effect should increase or decrease with the
incorporation of strengthening arguments (supporters) or weakening arguments
(defeaters), respectively. However, existing works ignore defeasibility in
causal reasoning and fail to evaluate existing causal strength metrics in
defeasible settings. In this work, we present {\delta}-CAUSAL, the first
benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning.
{\delta}-CAUSAL includes around 11K events spanning ten domains, featuring
defeasible causality pairs, i.e., cause-effect pairs accompanied by supporters
and defeaters. We further show current causal strength metrics fail to reflect
the change of causal strength with the incorporation of supporters or defeaters
in {\delta}-CAUSAL. To this end, we propose CESAR (Causal Embedding aSsociation
with Attention Rating), a metric that measures causal strength based on
token-level causal relationships. CESAR achieves a significant 69.7% relative
improvement over existing metrics, increasing from 47.2% to 80.1% in capturing
the causal strength change brought by supporters and defeaters. We further
demonstrate even Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 still lag 4.5 and
10.7 points behind humans in generating supporters and defeaters, emphasizing
the challenge posed by {\delta}-CAUSAL.

<p class="mathjax">Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging branch of AI that
combines the strengths of symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI. A major drawback of
sub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a "black box", meaning that predictions are
difficult to explain, making the testing &amp; evaluation (T&amp;E) and validation &amp;
verification (V&amp;V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge.
Since neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic and
sub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can ease
the V&amp;V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI,
evaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolic
and sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overview
of current techniques for the T&amp;E and V&amp;V processes of these components is
provided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&amp;E
and V&amp;V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows that
neurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&amp;E and V&amp;V processes of
sub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally,
the applicability of current T&amp;E and V&amp;V methods to neurosymbolic AI is
assessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact these
methods is explored. It is found that current T&amp;E and V&amp;V techniques are partly
sufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolic
part of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them use
approaches where current T&amp;E and V&amp;V methods are not applicable by default, and
adjustments or even new approaches are needed. Our research shows that there is
great potential in using symbolic AI to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the
predictions of a sub-symbolic model, making neurosymbolic AI an interesting
research direction for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.

However, the majority of existing model editing techniques are limited to
monolingual frameworks, thus failing to address the crucial issue of
cross-lingual knowledge synchronization for multilingual models. To tackle this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective method that trains multilingual
patch neuron to store cross-lingual knowledge. It can be easily adapted to
existing approaches to enhance their cross-lingual editing capabilities. To
evaluate our method, we conduct experiments using both the XNLI dataset and a
self-constructed XFEVER dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method achieves improved performance in cross-lingual editing tasks
without requiring excessive modifications to the original methodology, thereby
showcasing its user-friendly characteristics. Codes will be released soon.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate per-object distance estimation is crucial in safety-critical
applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. Existing
approaches rely on two scales: local information (i.e., the bounding box
proportions) or global information, which encodes the semantics of the scene as
well as the spatial relations with neighboring objects. However, these
approaches may struggle with long-range objects and in the presence of strong
occlusions or unusual visual patterns. In this respect, our work aims to
strengthen both local and global cues. Our architecture -- named DistFormer --
builds upon three major components acting jointly: i) a robust context encoder
extracting fine-grained per-object representations; ii) a masked
encoder-decoder module exploiting self-supervision to promote the learning of
useful per-object features; iii) a global refinement module that aggregates
object representations and computes a joint, spatially-consistent estimation.
To evaluate the effectiveness of DistFormer, we conduct experiments on the
standard KITTI dataset and the large-scale NuScenes and MOTSynth datasets. Such
datasets cover various indoor/outdoor environments, changing weather
conditions, appearances, and camera viewpoints. Our comprehensive analysis
shows that DistFormer outperforms existing methods. Moreover, we further delve
into its generalization capabilities, showing its regularization benefits in
zero-shot synth-to-real transfer.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we study the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) to the spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman
operators. Hermitian DMD is a data-driven method for approximating the Koopman
operator associated with an unknown nonlinear dynamical system from
discrete-time snapshots, while preserving the self-adjointness of the operator
on its finite-dimensional approximations. We show that, under suitable
conditions, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of HDMD converge to the spectral
properties of the underlying Koopman operator. Along the way, we establish a
general theorem on the convergence of spectral measures, and demonstrate our
results numerically on the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation.

<p class="mathjax">It has been established in the literature that the number of ratings and the
scores restaurants obtain on online rating systems (ORS) significantly impact
their revenue. However, when a restaurant has a limited number of ratings, it
may be challenging to predict its future performance. It may well be that
ratings reveal more about the user who did the rating than about the quality of
the restaurant. This motivates us to segment users into "inflating raters", who
tend to give unusually high ratings, and "deflating raters", who tend to give
unusually low ratings, and compare the rankings generated by these two
populations. Using a public dataset provided by Yelp, we find that deflating
raters are better at predicting restaurants that will achieve a top rating (4.5
and above) in the future. As such, these deflating raters may have an important
role in restaurant discovery.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic community detection methods often lack effective mechanisms to ensure
temporal consistency, hindering the analysis of network evolution. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep graph clustering framework with temporal
consistency regularization on inter-community structures, inspired by the
concept of minimal network topological changes within short intervals.
Specifically, to address the representation collapse problem, we first
introduce MFC, a matrix factorization-based deep graph clustering algorithm
that preserves node embedding. Based on static clustering results, we construct
probabilistic community networks and compute their persistence homology, a
robust topological measure, to assess structural similarity between them.
Moreover, a novel neural network regularization TopoReg is introduced to ensure
the preservation of topological similarity between inter-community structures
over time intervals. Our approach enhances temporal consistency and clustering
accuracy on real-world datasets with both fixed and varying numbers of
communities. It is also a pioneer application of TDA in temporally persistent
community detection, offering an insightful contribution to field of network
analysis. Code and data are available at the public git repository:

<p class="mathjax">Providing high-quality video with efficient bitrate is a main challenge in
video industry. The traditional one-size-fits-all scheme for bitrate ladders is
inefficient and reaching the best content-aware decision computationally
impractical due to extensive encodings required. To mitigate this, we propose a
bitrate and complexity efficient bitrate ladder prediction method using
transfer learning and spatio-temporal features. We propose: (1) using feature
maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with
limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by
predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The
method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity
versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense. Additionally, transfer learning
was thoroughly studied through four networks and ablation studies.

<p class="mathjax">Rising cyber threats, with miscreants registering thousands of new domains
daily for Internet-scale attacks like spam, phishing, and drive-by downloads,
emphasize the need for innovative detection methods. This paper introduces a
cutting-edge approach for identifying suspicious domains at the onset of the
registration process. The accompanying data pipeline generates crucial features
by comparing new domains to registered domains,emphasizing the crucial
similarity score. Leveraging a novel combination of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques, including a pretrained Canine model, and Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) models, our system analyzes semantic and numerical attributes,
providing a robust solution for early threat detection. This integrated
approach significantly reduces the window of vulnerability, fortifying defenses
against potential threats. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the
integrated approach and contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing
proactive strategies to mitigate the risks associated with illicit online
activities through the early identification of suspicious domain registrations.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential decision-making under uncertainty is present in many important
problems. Two popular approaches for tackling such problems are reinforcement
learning and online search (e.g., Monte Carlo tree search). While the former
learns a policy by interacting with the environment (typically done before
execution), the latter uses a generative model of the environment to sample
promising action trajectories at decision time. Decision-making is particularly
challenging in non-stationary environments, where the environment in which an
agent operates can change over time. Both approaches have shortcomings in such
settings -- on the one hand, policies learned before execution become stale
when the environment changes and relearning takes both time and computational
effort. Online search, on the other hand, can return sub-optimal actions when
there are limitations on allowed runtime. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo tree search} (PA-MCTS), which combines
action-value estimates from an out-of-date policy with an online search using
an up-to-date model of the environment. We prove theoretical results showing
conditions under which PA-MCTS selects the one-step optimal action and also
bound the error accrued while following PA-MCTS as a policy. We compare and
contrast our approach with AlphaZero, another hybrid planning approach, and
Deep Q Learning on several OpenAI Gym environments. Through extensive
experiments, we show that under non-stationary settings with limited time
constraints, PA-MCTS outperforms these baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Learning augmented is a machine learning concept built to improve the
performance of a method or model, such as enhancing its ability to predict and
generalize data or features, or testing the reliability of the method by
introducing noise and other factors. On the other hand, clustering is a
fundamental aspect of data analysis and has long been used to understand the
structure of large datasets. Despite its long history, the k-means algorithm
still faces challenges. One approach, as suggested by Ergun et al,is to use a
predictor to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and
a specified centroid. However, it is known that the computational cost of this
algorithm increases with the value of k, and it often gets stuck in local
minima. In response to these challenges, we propose a solution to reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is
worth noting that when using k values of 10 and 25, the proposed algorithm
yields lower cost results compared to running it without PCA. "Principal
component analysis (PCA) is the problem of fitting a low-dimensional affine
subspace to a set of data points in a high-dimensional space. PCA is
well-established in the literature and has become one of the most useful tools
for data modeling, compression, and visualization."

<p class="mathjax">The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, commonly referred to as COVID-19, triggered
the global pandemic. Although the nature of the international spread of
infection is an important issue, extracting diffusion networks from
observations is challenging because of its inherent complexity. In this paper,
we investigate the process of infection worldwide, including time delays, based
on global infection case data collected from January 3, 2020 to December 31,
2022. We approach the data with a complex Hilbert principal component analysis,
which can consider not only the concurrent relationships between elements, but
also the leading and lagging relationships. Then, we examine the interactions
among countries by considering six factors: geography, population, GDP,
stringency of countermeasures, vaccination rates, and government type. The
results show two primary trends occurring in 2020 and in 2021-2022 and they
interchange with each other. Specifically, European, highly populated, and
democratic countries, i.e., countries with high mobility rates, show leading
trends in 2020. In contrast, African and nondemocratic countries show leading
trends in 2021-2022, followed by countries with high vaccination rates and
advanced countermeasures. The results reveal that, although factors that
increase infection risk lead to certain trends at the beginning of the
pandemic, these trends dynamically changes over time due to socioeconomic
factors, especially the introduction of countermeasures. The findings suggest
that international efforts to promote countermeasures in developing countries
can contribute to pandemic containment.

<p class="mathjax">The remarkable potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
comprehending both vision and language information has been widely
acknowledged. However, the scarcity of 3D scenes-language pairs in comparison
to their 2D counterparts, coupled with the inadequacy of existing approaches in
understanding of 3D scenes by LLMs, poses a significant challenge. In response,
we collect and construct an extensive dataset comprising 75K
instruction-response pairs tailored for 3D scenes. This dataset addresses tasks
related to 3D VQA, 3D grounding, and 3D conversation. To further enhance the
integration of 3D spatial information into LLMs, we introduce a novel and
efficient prompt tuning paradigm, 3DMIT. This paradigm eliminates the alignment
stage between 3D scenes and language and extends the instruction prompt with
the 3D modality information including the entire scene and segmented objects.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our method across diverse tasks in the 3D
scene domain and find that our approach serves as a strategic means to enrich
LLMs' comprehension of the 3D world. Our code is available at
https://github.com/staymylove/3DMIT.

achieve efficient and high-fidelity mapping using only posed RGB inputs. Our
method eliminates the need for external depth priors derived from e.g., a depth
estimation model. Our key idea is to represent the scene as a hierarchical
feature grid that encodes the radiance and then factorizes it into feature
planes and vectors. As such, the scene representation becomes simpler and more
generalizable for fast and smooth convergence on new observations. This allows
for efficient computation while alleviating noise patterns by reducing the
complexity of the scene representation. Buttressed by the hierarchical
factorized representation, we leverage the Sign Distance Field (SDF) as a proxy
of rendering for inferring the volume density, demonstrating high mapping
fidelity. Moreover, we introduce a dual-path encoding strategy to strengthen
the photometric cues and further boost the mapping quality, especially for the
distant and textureless regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's
superiority in geometric and textural accuracy over the state-of-the-art
NeRF-based monocular mapping methods.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency
to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy
and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM
hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect
hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be
done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work
presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the
three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we
construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet
effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the
different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the
potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and
examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in
LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the
hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data
can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new method to improve the convergence speed of the Robbins-Monro
algorithm by introducing prior information about the target point into the
Robbins-Monro iteration. We achieve the incorporation of prior information
without the need of a -- potentially wrong -- regression model, which would
also entail additional constraints. We show that this prior-information
Robbins-Monro sequence is convergent for a wide range of prior distributions,
even wrong ones, such as Gaussian, weighted sum of Gaussians, e.g., in a kernel
density estimate, as well as bounded arbitrary distribution functions greater
than zero. We furthermore analyse the sequence numerically to understand its
performance and the influence of parameters. The results demonstrate that the
prior-information Robbins-Monro sequence converges faster than the standard
one, especially during the first steps, which are particularly important for
applications where the number of function measurements is limited, and when the
noise of observing the underlying function is large. We finally propose a rule
to select the parameters of the sequence.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has empirically shown its data representation
learnability in many downstream tasks. There are only a few theoretical works
on data representation learnability, and many of those focus on final data
representation, treating the nonlinear neural network as a ``black box".
However, the accurate learning results of neural networks are crucial for
describing the data distribution features learned by SSL models. Our paper is
the first to analyze the learning results of the nonlinear SSL model
accurately. We consider a toy data distribution that contains two features: the
label-related feature and the hidden feature. Unlike previous linear setting
work that depends on closed-form solutions, we use the gradient descent
algorithm to train a 1-layer nonlinear SSL model with a certain initialization
region and prove that the model converges to a local minimum. Furthermore,
different from the complex iterative analysis, we propose a new analysis
process which uses the exact version of Inverse Function Theorem to accurately
describe the features learned by the local minimum. With this local minimum, we
prove that the nonlinear SSL model can capture the label-related feature and
hidden feature at the same time. In contrast, the nonlinear supervised learning
(SL) model can only learn the label-related feature. We also present the
learning processes and results of the nonlinear SSL and SL model via simulation
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Backdoor attacks present a substantial security concern for deep learning
models, especially those utilized in applications critical to safety and
security. These attacks manipulate model behavior by embedding a hidden trigger
during the training phase, allowing unauthorized control over the model's
output during inference time. Although numerous defenses exist for image
classification models, there is a conspicuous absence of defenses tailored for
time series data, as well as an end-to-end solution capable of training clean
models on poisoned data. To address this gap, this paper builds upon
Anti-Backdoor Learning (ABL) and introduces an innovative method, End-to-End
Anti-Backdoor Learning (E2ABL), for robust training against backdoor attacks.
Unlike the original ABL, which employs a two-stage training procedure, E2ABL
accomplishes end-to-end training through an additional classification head
linked to the shallow layers of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This secondary
head actively identifies potential backdoor triggers, allowing the model to
dynamically cleanse these samples and their corresponding labels during
training. Our experiments reveal that E2ABL significantly improves on existing
defenses and is effective against a broad range of backdoor attacks in both
image and time series domains.

<p class="mathjax">Large-language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in improving
human-robot interaction, offering advanced conversational skills and
versatility in managing diverse, open-ended user requests in various tasks and
domains. Despite the potential to transform human-robot interaction, very
little is known about the distinctive design requirements for utilizing LLMs in
robots, which may differ from text and voice interaction and vary by task and
context. To better understand these requirements, we conducted a user study (n
= 32) comparing an LLM-powered social robot against text- and voice-based
agents, analyzing task-based requirements in conversational tasks, including
choose, generate, execute, and negotiate. Our findings show that LLM-powered
robots elevate expectations for sophisticated non-verbal cues and excel in
connection-building and deliberation, but fall short in logical communication
and may induce anxiety. We provide design implications both for robots
integrating LLMs and for fine-tuning LLMs for use with robots.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of MiniApps, operating within larger SuperApps, has revolutionized
user experiences by offering a wide range of services without the need for
individual app downloads. However, this convenience has raised significant
privacy concerns, as these MiniApps often require access to sensitive data,
potentially leading to privacy violations. Our research addresses the critical
gaps in the analysis of MiniApps' privacy practices, especially focusing on
WeChat MiniApps in the Android ecosystem. Despite existing privacy regulations
and platform guidelines, there is a lack of effective mechanisms to safeguard
user privacy fully. We introduce MiniScope, a novel two-phase hybrid analysis
approach, specifically designed for the MiniApp environment. This approach
overcomes the limitations of existing static analysis techniques by
incorporating dynamic UI exploration for complete code coverage and accurate
privacy practice identification. Our methodology includes modeling UI
transition states, resolving cross-package callback control flows, and
automated iterative UI exploration. This allows for a comprehensive
understanding of MiniApps' privacy practices, addressing the unique challenges
of sub-package loading and event-driven callbacks. Our empirical evaluation of
over 120K MiniApps using MiniScope demonstrates its effectiveness in
identifying privacy inconsistencies. The results reveal significant issues,
with 5.7% of MiniApps over-collecting private data and 33.4% overclaiming data
collection. These findings emphasize the urgent need for more precise privacy
monitoring systems and highlight the responsibility of SuperApp operators to
enforce stricter privacy measures.

<p class="mathjax">Image signal processors (ISPs) are historically grown legacy software systems
for reconstructing color images from noisy raw sensor measurements. Each
smartphone manufacturer has developed its ISPs with its own characteristic
heuristics for improving the color rendition, for example, skin tones and other
visually essential colors. The recent interest in replacing the historically
grown ISP systems with deep-learned pipelines to match DSLR's image quality
improves structural features in the image. However, these works ignore the
superior color processing based on semantic scene analysis that distinguishes
mobile phone ISPs from DSLRs. Here, we present MetaISP, a single model designed
to learn how to translate between the color and local contrast characteristics
of different devices. MetaISP takes the RAW image from device A as input and
translates it to RGB images that inherit the appearance characteristics of
devices A, B, and C. We achieve this result by employing a lightweight deep
learning technique that conditions its output appearance based on the device of
interest. In this approach, we leverage novel attention mechanisms inspired by
cross-covariance to learn global scene semantics. Additionally, we use the
metadata that typically accompanies RAW images and estimate scene illuminants
when they are unavailable.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, text-to-image diffusion models become a new paradigm in image
processing fields, including content generation, image restoration and
image-to-image translation. Given a target prompt, Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are able to generate realistic yet eligible images.
With this appealing property, the image translation task has the potential to
be free from target image samples for supervision. By using a target text
prompt for domain adaption, the diffusion model is able to implement zero-shot
image-to-image translation advantageously. However, the sampling and inversion
processes of DDPM are stochastic, and thus the inversion process often fail to
reconstruct the input content. Specifically, the displacement effect will
gradually accumulated during the diffusion and inversion processes, which led
to the reconstructed results deviating from the source domain. To make
reconstruction explicit, we propose a prompt redescription strategy to realize
a mirror effect between the source and reconstructed image in the diffusion
model (MirrorDiffusion). More specifically, a prompt redescription mechanism is
investigated to align the text prompts with latent code at each time step of
the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to pursue a
structure-preserving reconstruction. With the revised DDIM inversion,
MirrorDiffusion is able to realize accurate zero-shot image translation by
editing optimized text prompts and latent code. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MirrorDiffusion achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot image translation benchmarks by clear
margins and practical model stability.

<p class="mathjax">The precise characterization and modeling of Cyber-Physical-Social Systems
(CPSS) requires more comprehensive and accurate data, which imposes heightened
demands on intelligent sensing capabilities. To address this issue,
Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) has been proposed to collect data from CPSS by
harnessing the collective intelligence of a diverse workforce. Our first and
second Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Crowdsensing Intelligence
(DHW-CSI) have focused on principles and high-level processes of organizing and
operating CSI, as well as the participants, methods, and stages involved in
CSI. This letter reports the outcomes of the latest DHW-CSI, focusing on
Autonomous Crowdsensing (ACS) enabled by a range of technologies such as
decentralized autonomous organizations and operations, large language models,
and human-oriented operating systems. Specifically, we explain what ACS is and
explore its distinctive features in comparison to traditional crowdsensing.
Moreover, we present the ``6A-goal" of ACS and propose potential avenues for
future research.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) has attracted attention due
to its ability to support heterogeneous models and data. To reduce the high
communication cost of transmitting model parameters, a major challenge in HtFL,
prototype-based HtFL methods are proposed to solely share class
representatives, a.k.a, prototypes, among heterogeneous clients while
maintaining the privacy of clients' models. However, these prototypes are
naively aggregated into global prototypes on the server using weighted
averaging, resulting in suboptimal global knowledge which negatively impacts
the performance of clients. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel
HtFL approach called FedTGP, which leverages our Adaptive-margin-enhanced
Contrastive Learning (ACL) to learn Trainable Global Prototypes (TGP) on the
server. By incorporating ACL, our approach enhances prototype separability
while preserving semantic meaning. Extensive experiments with twelve
heterogeneous models demonstrate that our FedTGP surpasses state-of-the-art
methods by up to 9.08% in accuracy while maintaining the communication and
privacy advantages of prototype-based HtFL. Our code is available at
https://github.com/TsingZ0/FedTGP.

<p class="mathjax">Many countries around the world, including Korea, use the school choice
lottery system. However, this method has a problem in that many students are
assigned to less-preferred schools based on the lottery results. In addition,
the task of finding a good assignment with ties often has a time complexity of
NP, making it a very difficult problem to improve the quality of the
assignment.
<br />In this paper, we prove that the problem of finding a stable matching that
maximizes the student-oriented preference utility in a two-sided market with
one-sided preference can be solved in polynomial time, and we verify through
experiments that the quality of assignment is improved. The main contributions
of this paper are as follows. We found that stable student-oriented allocation
in a two-sided market with one-sided preferences is the same as stable
allocation in a two-sided market with symmetric preferences. In addition, we
defined a method to quantify the quality of allocation from a preference
utilitarian perspective. Based on the above two, it was proven that the problem
of finding a stable match that maximizes the preference utility in a two-sided
market with homogeneous preferences can be reduced to an allocation problem. In
this paper, through an experiment, we quantitatively verified that optimal
student assignment assigns more students to schools of higher preference, even
in situations where many students are assigned to schools of low preference
using the existing assignment method.

<p class="mathjax">Split Learning (SL) is a promising Distributed Learning approach in
electromyography (EMG) based prosthetic control, due to its applicability
within resource-constrained environments. Other learning approaches, such as
Deep Learning and Federated Learning (FL), provide suboptimal solutions, since
prosthetic devices are extremely limited in terms of processing power and
battery life. The viability of implementing SL in such scenarios is caused by
its inherent model partitioning, with clients executing the smaller model
segment. However, selecting an inadequate cut layer hinders the training
process in SL systems. This paper presents an algorithm for optimal cut layer
selection in terms of maximizing the convergence rate of the model. The
performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm substantially
accelerates the convergence in an EMG pattern recognition task for improving
prosthetic device control.

<p class="mathjax">RAID proposal advocated replacing large disks with arrays of PC disks, but as
the capacity of small disks increased 100-fold in 1990s the production of large
disks was discontinued. Storage dependability is increased via replication or
erasure coding. Cloud storage providers store multiple copies of data obviating
for need for further redundancy. Varitaions of RAID based on local recovery
codes, partial MDS reduce recovery cost. NAND flash Solid State Disks - SSDs
have low latency and high bandwidth, are more reliable, consume less power and
have a lower TCO than Hard Disk Drives, which are more viable for hyperscalers.

<p class="mathjax">Building simulation environments for developing and testing autonomous
vehicles necessitates that the simulators accurately model the statistical
realism of the real-world environment, including the interaction with other
vehicles driven by human drivers. To address this requirement, an accurate
human behavior model is essential to incorporate the diversity and consistency
of human driving behavior. We propose a mathematical framework for designing a
data-driven simulation model that simulates human driving behavior more
realistically than the currently used physics-based simulation models.
Experiments conducted using the NGSIM dataset validate our hypothesis regarding
the necessity of considering the complexity, diversity, and consistency of
human driving behavior when aiming to develop realistic simulators.

<p class="mathjax">Research suggests that tutors should adopt a strategic approach when
addressing math errors made by low-efficacy students. Rather than drawing
direct attention to the error, tutors should guide the students to identify and
correct their mistakes on their own. While tutor lessons have introduced this
pedagogical skill, human evaluation of tutors applying this strategy is arduous
and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing
real-time assessment to tutors during their actual tutoring sessions, yet
little is known regarding their accuracy in this context. In this study, we
investigate the capacity of generative AI to evaluate real-life tutors'
performance in responding to students making math errors. By analyzing 50
real-life tutoring dialogues, we find both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 demonstrate
proficiency in assessing the criteria related to reacting to students making
errors. However, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing instances where
the student made an error. Notably, GPT-4 tends to overidentify instances of
students making errors, often attributing student uncertainty or inferring
potential errors where human evaluators did not. Future work will focus on
enhancing generalizability by assessing a larger dataset of dialogues and
evaluating learning transfer. Specifically, we will analyze the performance of
tutors in real-life scenarios when responding to students' math errors before
and after lesson completion on this crucial tutoring skill.

initial coding. The paper presents the initial coding of two datasets of
different sizes, and it reflects on how the LLM reaches some form of analytical

creation of two codebooks, one comprising the total cumulative initial codes

<p class="mathjax">We address the challenge of estimating the learning rate for adaptive
gradient methods used in training deep neural networks. While several
learning-rate-free approaches have been proposed, they are typically tailored
for steepest descent. However, although steepest descent methods offer an
intuitive approach to finding minima, many deep learning applications require
adaptive gradient methods to achieve faster convergence. In this paper, we
interpret adaptive gradient methods as steepest descent applied on
parameter-scaled networks, proposing learning-rate-free adaptive gradient
methods. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of this approach,
demonstrating comparable performance to hand-tuned learning rates across
various scenarios. This work extends the applicability of learning-rate-free
methods, enhancing training with adaptive gradient methods.

forward-backward systems of stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) driven
by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure. We provide a rigorous
comparison of the different algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness in
various applications, such as cases derived from pricing with jumps and
mean-field games. In particular, we show the efficiency of the deep-learning
algorithms to solve a coupled multi-dimensional FBSDE system driven by a
time-inhomogeneous jump process with stochastic intensity, which describes the
Nash equilibria for a specific mean-field game (MFG) problem for which we also
provide the complete theoretical resolution. More precisely, we develop an
extension of the MFG model for smart grids introduced in Alasseur, Campi,
Dumitrescu and Zeng (Annals of Operations Research, 2023) to the case when the
random jump times correspond to the jump times of a doubly Poisson process. We
first provide an existence result of an equilibria and derive its semi-explicit
characterization in terms of a system of FBSDEs in the linear-quadratic
setting. We then compare the MFG solution to the optimal strategy of a central
planner and provide several numerical illustrations using the deep-learning
solvers presented in the first part of the paper.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods are widely used in various
industries to obtain high quality taskspecific solutions with minimal human
intervention. Event Sequences find widespread use in various industrial
applications including churn prediction customer segmentation fraud detection
and fault diagnosis among others. Such data consist of categorical and
real-valued components with irregular timestamps. Despite the usefulness of NAS
methods previous approaches only have been applied to other domains images
texts or time series. Our work addresses this limitation by introducing a novel
NAS algorithm SeqNAS specifically designed for event sequence classification.
We develop a simple yet expressive search space that leverages commonly used
building blocks for event sequence classification including multihead self
attention convolutions and recurrent cells. To perform the search we adopt
sequential Bayesian Optimization and utilize previously trained models as an
ensemble of teachers to augment knowledge distillation. As a result of our work
we demonstrate that our method surpasses state of the art NAS methods and
popular architectures suitable for sequence classification and holds great
potential for various industrial applications.

<p class="mathjax">Interpersonal relationship quality is pivotal in social and occupational
contexts. Existing analysis of interpersonal relationships mostly rely on
subjective self-reports, whereas objective quantification remains challenging.
In this paper, we propose a novel social relationship analysis framework using
spatio-temporal patterns derived from dyadic EEG signals, which can be applied
to quantitatively measure team cooperation in corporate team building, and
evaluate interpersonal dynamics between therapists and patients in psychiatric
therapy. First, we constructed a dyadic-EEG dataset from 72 pairs of
participants with two relationships (stranger or friend) when watching
emotional videos simultaneously. Then we proposed a deep neural network on
dyadic-subject EEG signals, in which we combine the dynamic graph convolutional
neural network for characterizing the interpersonal relationships among the EEG
channels and 1-dimension convolution for extracting the information from the
time sequence. To obtain the feature vectors from two EEG recordings that well
represent the relationship of two subjects, we integrate deep canonical
correlation analysis and triplet loss for training the network. Experimental
results show that the social relationship type (stranger or friend) between two
individuals can be effectively identified through their EEG data.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances achieved by deep learning models rely on the independent and
identically distributed assumption, hindering their applications in real-world
scenarios with domain shifts. To address the above issues, cross-domain
learning aims at extracting domain-invariant knowledge to reduce the domain
shift between training and testing data. However, in visual cross-domain
learning, traditional methods concentrate solely on the image modality,
neglecting the use of the text modality to alleviate the domain shift. In this
work, we propose Large Language models as Visual cross-dOmain learners (LLaVO).
LLaVO uses vision-language models to convert images into detailed textual
descriptions. A large language model is then finetuned on textual descriptions
of the source/target domain generated by a designed instruction template.
Extensive experimental results on various cross-domain tasks under the domain
generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation settings have demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">PageRank is a popular centrality metric that assigns importance to the
vertices of a graph based on its neighbors and their score. Efficient parallel
algorithms for updating PageRank on dynamic graphs is crucial for various
applications, especially as dataset sizes have reached substantial scales. This
technical report presents our Dynamic Frontier approach. Given a batch update
of edge deletion and insertions, it progressively identifies affected vertices
that are likely to change their ranks with minimal overhead. On a server
equipped with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, our Dynamic Frontier PageRank
outperforms Static, Naive-dynamic, and Dynamic Traversal PageRank by 7.8x,
2.9x, and 3.9x respectively - on uniformly random batch updates of size 10^-7
|E| to 10^-3 |E|. In addition, our approach improves performance at an average
rate of 1.8x for every doubling of threads.

<p class="mathjax">Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) exploits multi-view 3D
consistency, achieving impressive results in 3D scene modeling and
high-fidelity novel-view synthesis. However, there are limitations. First,
existing methods assume enough high-quality images are available for training
the NeRF model, ignoring real-world image degradation. Second, previous methods
struggle with ambiguity in the training set due to unmodeled inconsistencies
among different views. In this work, we present RustNeRF for real-world
high-quality NeRF. To improve NeRF's robustness under real-world inputs, we
train a 3D-aware preprocessing network that incorporates real-world degradation
modeling. We propose a novel implicit multi-view guidance to address
information loss during image degradation and restoration. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RustNeRF's advantages over existing approaches under
real-world degradation. The code will be released.

<p class="mathjax">Group activity recognition in video is a complex task due to the need for a
model to recognise the actions of all individuals in the video and their
complex interactions. Recent studies propose that optimal performance is
achieved by individually tracking each person and subsequently inputting the
sequence of poses or cropped images/optical flow into a model. This helps the
model to recognise what actions each person is performing before they are
merged to arrive at the group action class. However, all previous models are
highly reliant on high quality tracking and have only been evaluated using
ground truth tracking information. In practice it is almost impossible to
achieve highly reliable tracking information for all individuals in a group
activity video. We introduce an innovative deep learning-based group activity
recognition approach called Rendered Pose based Group Activity Recognition
System (RePGARS) which is designed to be tolerant of unreliable tracking and
pose information. Experimental results confirm that RePGARS outperforms all
existing group activity recognition algorithms tested which do not use ground
truth detection and tracking information.

<p class="mathjax">Recent improvements in adder optimization could be achieved by optimizing the
AND-trees occurring within the constructed circuits. The overlap of such trees
and its potential for pure size optimization has not been taken into account
though. Motivated by this, we examine the fundamental problem of minimizing the
size of a circuit for multiple AND-functions on intersecting variable sets. Our
formulation generalizes the overlapping \AND-trees within adder optimization
but is in NP, in contrast to general Boolean circuit optimization which is in
$\Sigma_2^p$ (and thus suspected not to be in NP). While restructuring the AND-
or XOR-trees simultaneously, we optimize the total number of gates needed for
all functions to be computed. We show that this problem is APX-hard already for
functions of few variables and present efficient approximation algorithms for
the case in which the Boolean functions depend on at most 3 or 4 variables
each, achieving guarantees of $\frac 43$ and $1.9$, respectively. To conclude,
we give a polynomial approximation algorithm with guarantee $\frac 23k$ for
AND-functions of up to $k$ variables. To achieve these results, the key
technique is to determine how much overlap among the variable sets makes tree
construction cheap and how little makes the optimum solution large.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most important problems in computer vision and remote sensing is
object detection, which identifies particular categories of diverse things in
pictures. Two crucial data sources for public security are the thermal infrared
(TIR) remote sensing multi-scenario photos and videos produced by unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the small scale of the target, complex scene
information, low resolution relative to the viewable videos, and dearth of
publicly available labeled datasets and training models, their object detection
procedure is still difficult. A UAV TIR object detection framework for pictures
and videos is suggested in this study. The Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR)
cameras used to gather ground-based TIR photos and videos are used to create
the ``You Only Look Once'' (YOLO) model, which is based on CNN architecture.
Results indicated that in the validating task, detecting human object had an
average precision at IOU (Intersection over Union) = 0.5, which was 72.5\%,
using YOLOv7 (YOLO version 7) state of the art model \cite{1}, while the
detection speed around 161 frames per second (FPS/second). The usefulness of
the YOLO architecture is demonstrated in the application, which evaluates the
cross-detection performance of people in UAV TIR videos under a YOLOv7 model in
terms of the various UAVs' observation angles. The qualitative and quantitative
evaluation of object detection from TIR pictures and videos using deep-learning
models is supported favorably by this work.

<p class="mathjax">In real-time systems optimization, designers often face a challenging problem
posed by the non-convex and non-continuous schedulability conditions, which may
even lack an analytical form to understand their properties. To tackle this
challenging problem, we treat the schedulability analysis as a black box that
only returns true/false results. We propose a general and scalable framework to
optimize real-time systems, named Numerical Optimizer with Real-Time Highlight
(NORTH). NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the
numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active
constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition,
we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types
of discrete variables (\eg priority assignments, categorical variables) with
continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate
the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization
based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of
control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to
$10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
similar or better solution quality. NORTH+ outperforms NORTH by 30\% with
similar algorithm scalability. Both NORTH and NORTH+ support black-box
schedulability analysis, ensuring broad applicability.

introduced in this work as a novel variation of the traditional Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in which the set of points is partitioned into multiple
classes, each of which is represented by a distinct color (or label). The goal
is to find a minimum cost cycle $C$ that visits all the colors and only makes
each one appears once. This issue has various applications in the fields of
transportation, goods distribution network, postal network, inspection,
insurance, banking, etc. By reducing the traditional TSP to it, we can

<p class="mathjax">For effective structural damage assessment, the instances of damages need to
be localized in the world of a 3D model. Due to a lack of data, the detection
of structural anomalies can currently not be directly learned and performed in
3D space. In this work, a three-stage approach is presented, which uses the
good performance of detection models on image level to segment instances of
anomalies in the 3D space. In the detection stage, semantic segmentation
predictions are produced on image level. The mapping stage transfers the
image-level prediction onto the respective point cloud. In the extraction
stage, 3D anomaly instances are extracted from the segmented point cloud. Cloud
contraction is used to transform cracks into their medial axis representation.
For areal anomalies the bounding polygon is extracted by means of alpha shapes.
The approach covers the classes crack, spalling, and corrosion and the three
image-level segmentation models TopoCrack, nnU-Net, and DetectionHMA are
compared. Granted a localization tolerance of 4cm, IoUs of over 90% can be
achieved for crack and corrosion and 41% for spalling, which appears to be a
specifically challenging class. Detection on instance-level measured in AP is
about 45% for crack and spalling and 73% for corrosion.

<p class="mathjax">We seek to understand what facilitates sample-efficient learning from
historical datasets for sequential decision-making, a problem that is popularly
known as offline reinforcement learning (RL). Further, we are interested in
algorithms that enjoy sample efficiency while leveraging (value) function
approximation. In this paper, we address these fundamental questions by (i)
proposing a notion of data diversity that subsumes the previous notions of
coverage measures in offline RL and (ii) using this notion to {unify} three
distinct classes of offline RL algorithms based on version spaces (VS),
regularized optimization (RO), and posterior sampling (PS). We establish that
VS-based, RO-based, and PS-based algorithms, under standard assumptions,
achieve \emph{comparable} sample efficiency, which recovers the
state-of-the-art sub-optimality bounds for finite and linear model classes with
the standard assumptions. This result is surprising, given that the prior work
suggested an unfavorable sample complexity of the RO-based algorithm compared
to the VS-based algorithm, whereas posterior sampling is rarely considered in
offline RL due to its explorative nature. Notably, our proposed model-free
PS-based algorithm for offline RL is {novel}, with sub-optimality bounds that
are {frequentist} (i.e., worst-case) in nature.

<p class="mathjax">A critical issue faced by open-source software projects is the risk of key
personnel leaving the project. This risk is exacerbated in large projects that
have been under development for a long time and experienced growth in their
development teams. One way to quantify this risk is to measure the
concentration of knowledge about the project among its developers. Formally
known as the Bus Factor (BF) of a project and defined as 'the number of key
developers who would need to be incapacitated to make a project unable to
proceed'. Most of the proposed algorithms for BF calculation measure a
developer's knowledge of a file based on the number of commits. In this work,
we propose using other metrics like lines of code changes (LOCC) and cosine
difference of lines of code (change-size-cos) to calculate the BF. We use these
metrics for BF calculation for five open-source GitHub projects using the CST
algorithm and the RIG algorithm, which is git-blame-based. Moreover, we
calculate the BF on project sub-directories that have seen the most active
development recently. Lastly, we compare the results of the two algorithms in
accuracy, similarity in results, execution time, and trends in BF values over
time.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning for
reinforcement learning from high-dimensional observations in the context of
realistic robot tasks. Recent offline model-free approaches successfully use
online fine-tuning to either improve the performance of the agent over the data
collection policy or adapt to novel tasks. At the same time, model-based RL
algorithms have achieved significant progress in sample efficiency and the
complexity of the tasks they can solve, yet remain under-utilized in the
fine-tuning setting. In this work, we argue that existing model-based offline
RL methods are not suitable for offline-to-online fine-tuning in
high-dimensional domains due to issues with distribution shifts, off-dynamics
data, and non-stationary rewards. We propose an on-policy model-based method
that can efficiently reuse prior data through model-based value expansion and
policy regularization, while preventing model exploitation by controlling
epistemic uncertainty. We find that our approach successfully solves tasks from
the MetaWorld benchmark, as well as the Franka Kitchen robot manipulation
environment completely from images. To the best of our knowledge, MOTO is the
first method to solve this environment from pixels.

<p class="mathjax">Gentrification is a process of neighborhood change in which the primary
beneficiaries tend to be homeowners and newcomers, as opposed to incumbent
renters. However, operational definitions of gentrification and other concepts
of neighborhood change are elusive, making them and their interactions with
policy interventions difficult to quantify. In this paper, we propose
formulating processes of neighborhood change as instances of no-regret
dynamics; a collective learning process in which a set of strategic agents
rapidly reach a state of approximate equilibrium. We mathematize concepts of
neighborhood change to model the incentive structures impacting individual
dwelling-site decision-making. Our model accounts for affordability, access to
relevant amenities, community ties, and site upkeep. We showcase our model with
computational experiments that provide semi-quantitative insights on the
spatial economics of neighborhood change, particularly on the influence of
residential zoning policy and the placement of urban amenities.

<p class="mathjax">Digital twins are an important technology for advancing mobile
communications, specially in use cases that require simultaneously simulating
the wireless channel, 3D scenes and machine learning. Aiming at providing a
solution to this demand, this work describes a modular co-simulation
methodology called CAVIAR. Here, CAVIAR is upgraded to support a message
passing library and enable the virtual counterpart of a digital twin system
using different 6G-related simulators. The main contributions of this work are
the detailed description of different CAVIAR architectures, the implementation
of this methodology to assess a 6G use case of UAV-based search and rescue
mission (SAR), and the generation of benchmarking data about the computational
resource usage. For executing the SAR co-simulation we adopt five open-source
solutions: the physical and link level network simulator Sionna, the simulator
for autonomous vehicles AirSim, scikit-learn for training a decision tree for
MIMO beam selection, Yolov8 for the detection of rescue targets and NATS for
message passing. Results for the implemented SAR use case suggest that the
methodology can run in a single machine, with the main demanded resources being
the CPU processing and the GPU memory.

<p class="mathjax">This work investigates how hierarchically structured data can help neural
networks learn conceptual representations of cathedrals. The underlying
WikiScenes dataset provides a spatially organized hierarchical structure of
cathedral components. We propose a novel hierarchical contrastive training
approach that leverages a triplet margin loss to represent the data's spatial
hierarchy in the encoder's latent space. As such, the proposed approach
investigates if the dataset structure provides valuable information for
self-supervised learning. We apply t-SNE to visualize the resultant latent
space and evaluate the proposed approach by comparing it with other
dataset-specific contrastive learning methods using a common downstream
classification task. The proposed method outperforms the comparable
weakly-supervised and baseline methods. Our findings suggest that dataset
structure is a valuable modality for weakly-supervised learning.

<p class="mathjax">Neural machine translation benefits from semantically rich representations.
Considerable progress in learning such representations has been achieved by
language modelling and mutual information maximization objectives using
contrastive learning. The language-dependent nature of language modelling
introduces a trade-off between the universality of the learned representations
and the model's performance on the language modelling tasks. Although
contrastive learning improves performance, its success cannot be attributed to
mutual information alone. We propose a novel Context Enhancement step to
improve performance on neural machine translation by maximizing mutual
information using the Barlow Twins loss. Unlike other approaches, we do not
explicitly augment the data but view languages as implicit augmentations,
eradicating the risk of disrupting semantic information. Further, our method
does not learn embeddings from scratch and can be generalised to any set of
pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the language-agnosticism of our
embeddings through language classification and use them for neural machine
translation to compare with state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The underground exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious
services (i.e., Malla) is witnessing an uptick, amplifying the cyber threat
landscape and posing questions about the trustworthiness of LLM technologies.
However, there has been little effort to understand this new cybercrime, in
terms of its magnitude, impact, and techniques. In this paper, we conduct the
first systematic study on 212 real-world Mallas, uncovering their proliferation
in underground marketplaces and exposing their operational modalities. Our
study discloses the Malla ecosystem, revealing its significant growth and
impact on today's public LLM services. Through examining 212 Mallas, we
uncovered eight backend LLMs used by Mallas, along with 182 prompts that
circumvent the protective measures of public LLM APIs. We further demystify the
tactics employed by Mallas, including the abuse of uncensored LLMs and the
exploitation of public LLM APIs through jailbreak prompts. Our findings enable
a better understanding of the real-world exploitation of LLMs by
cybercriminals, offering insights into strategies to counteract this
cybercrime.

<p class="mathjax">Scientific discoveries are increasingly constrained by limited storage space
and I/O capacities. For time-series simulations and experiments, their data
often need to be decimated over timesteps to accommodate storage and I/O
limitations. In this paper, we propose a technique that addresses storage costs
while improving post-analysis accuracy through spatiotemporal adaptive,
error-controlled lossy compression. We investigate the trade-off between data
precision and temporal output rates, revealing that reducing data precision and
increasing timestep frequency lead to more accurate analysis outcomes.
Additionally, we integrate spatiotemporal feature detection with data
compression and demonstrate that performing adaptive error-bounded compression
in higher dimensional space enables greater compression ratios, leveraging the
error propagation theory of a transformation-based compressor.
<br />To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments using the well-known E3SM
climate simulation code and apply our method to compress variables used for
cyclone tracking. Our results show a significant reduction in storage size
while enhancing the quality of cyclone tracking analysis, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, in comparison to the prevalent timestep decimation approach.
Compared to three state-of-the-art lossy compressors lacking feature
preservation capabilities, our adaptive compression framework improves
perfectly matched cases in TC tracking by 26.4-51.3% at medium compression
ratios and by 77.3-571.1% at large compression ratios, with a merely 5-11%
computational overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Today, many users deploy their microservice-based applications with various
interconnections on a cluster of Cloud machines, subject to stochastic changes
due to dynamic user requirements. To address this problem, we compare three
machine learning (ML) models for predicting the microservice call rates based
on the microservice times and aiming at estimating the scalability
requirements. We apply the linear regression (LR), multilayer perception (MLP),
and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models on the Alibaba microservice
traces. The prediction results reveal that the LR model reaches a lower
training time than the GBR and MLP models. However, the GBR reduces the mean
absolute error and the mean absolute percentage error compared to LR and MLP
models. Moreover, the prediction results show that the required number of
replicas for each microservice by the gradient boosting model is close to the
actual test data without any prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Recent works showed the possibility of building open-vocabulary large
language models (LLMs) that directly operate on pixel representations and are
implemented as encoder-decoder models that reconstruct masked image patches of
rendered text. However, these pixel-based LLMs are limited to autoencoding
tasks and cannot generate new text as images. As such, they cannot be used for
open-answer or generative language tasks. In this work, we overcome this
limitation and introduce PIXAR, the first pixel-based autoregressive LLM that
does not rely on a pre-defined vocabulary for both input and output text.
Consisting of only a decoder, PIXAR can answer free-form generative tasks while
keeping the text representation learning performance on par with previous
encoder-decoder models. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges to
autoregressively generate non-blurred text as images and link this to the usual
maximum likelihood objective. We propose a simple adversarial pretraining that
significantly improves the readability and performance of PIXAR making it
comparable to GPT2 on short text generation tasks. This paves the way to
building open-vocabulary LLMs that are usable for free-form generative tasks
and questions the necessity of the usual symbolic input representation -- text
as tokens -- for these challenging tasks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a hybrid attention and autoencoder (AE) model for
unsupervised online anomaly detection in time series. The autoencoder captures
local structural patterns in short embeddings, while the attention model learns
long-term features, facilitating parallel computing with positional encoding.
Unique in its approach, our proposed hybrid model combines attention and
autoencoder for the first time in time series anomaly detection. It employs an
attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key
architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the
autoencoder's latent space. The model utilizes a threshold from the validation
dataset for anomaly detection and introduces an alternative method based on
analyzing the first statistical moment of error, improving accuracy without
dependence on a validation dataset. Evaluation on diverse real-world benchmark
datasets and comparing with other well-established models, confirms the
effectiveness of our proposed model in anomaly detection.

<p class="mathjax">The "0-1 knapsack problem" stands as a classical combinatorial optimization
conundrum, necessitating the selection of a subset of items from a given set.
Each item possesses inherent values and weights, and the primary objective is
to formulate a selection strategy that maximizes the total value while adhering
to a predefined capacity constraint. In this research paper, we introduce a
novel variant of Cultural Algorithms tailored specifically for solving 0-1
knapsack problems, a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge. Our
proposed algorithm incorporates a belief space to refine the population and
introduces two vital functions for dynamically adjusting the crossover and
mutation rates during the evolutionary process. Through extensive
experimentation, we provide compelling evidence of the algorithm's remarkable
efficiency in consistently locating the global optimum, even in knapsack
problems characterized by high dimensions and intricate constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Socially assistive robots (SARs) have shown great promise in supplementing
and augmenting interventions to support the physical and mental well-being of
older adults. However, past work has not yet explored the potential of applying
SAR to lower the barriers of long-term low vision rehabilitation (LVR)
interventions for older adults. In this work, we present a user-informed design
process to validate the motivation and identify major design principles for
developing SAR for long-term LVR. To evaluate user-perceived usefulness and
acceptance of SAR in this novel domain, we performed a two-phase study through
user surveys. First, a group (n=38) of older adults with LV completed a
mailed-in survey. Next, a new group (n=13) of older adults with LV saw an
in-clinic SAR demo and then completed the survey. The study participants
reported that SARs would be useful, trustworthy, easy to use, and enjoyable
while providing socio-emotional support to augment LVR interventions. The
in-clinic demo group reported significantly more positive opinions of the SAR's
capabilities than did the baseline survey group that used mailed-in forms
without the SAR demo.

<p class="mathjax">The accurate identification of walnuts within orchards brings forth a
plethora of advantages, profoundly amplifying the efficiency and productivity
of walnut orchard management. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of
walnut trees, characterized by their closely resembling shapes, colors, and
textures between the walnuts and leaves, present a formidable challenge in
precisely distinguishing between them during the annotation process. In this
study, we present a novel approach to improve walnut detection efficiency,
utilizing YOLOv5 trained on an enriched image set that incorporates both real
and synthetic RGB and NIR images. Our analysis comparing results from our
original and augmented datasets shows clear improvements in detection when
using the synthetic images.

<p class="mathjax">Enhancing the energy efficiency of devices stands as one of the key
requirements in the fifth-generation (5G) cellular network and its evolutions
toward the next generation wireless technology. Specifically, for
battery-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices where downlink monitoring
significantly contributes to energy consumption, efficient solutions are
required for power saving while addressing performance tradeoffs. In this
regard, the use of a low-power wake-up receiver (WUR) and wake-up signal (WUS)
is an attractive solution for reducing the energy consumption of devices
without compromising the downlink latency. This paper provides an overview of
the standardization study on the design of low-power WUR and WUS within Release
18 of the third-generation partnership project (3GPP). We describe design
principles, receiver architectures, waveform characteristics, and device
procedures upon detection of WUS. In addition, we provide representative
results to show the performance of the WUR in terms of power saving, coverage,
and network overhead along with highlighting design tradeoffs.

<p class="mathjax">Urban search and rescue missions require rapid first response to minimize
loss of life and damage. Often, such efforts are assisted by humanitarian
robots which need to handle dynamic operational conditions such as uneven and
rough terrains, especially during mass casualty incidents like an earthquake.
Quadruped robots, owing to their versatile design, have the potential to assist
in such scenarios. However, control of quadruped robots in dynamic and rough
terrain environments is a challenging problem due to the many degrees of
freedom of these robots. Current locomotion controllers for quadrupeds are
limited in their ability to produce multiple adaptive gaits, solve tasks in a
time and resource-efficient manner, and require tedious training and manual
tuning procedures. To address these challenges, we propose MTAC: a multi-gait
terrain-adaptive controller, which utilizes a Hierarchical reinforcement
learning (HRL) approach while being time and memory-efficient. We show that our
proposed method scales well to a diverse range of environments with similar
compute times as state-of-the-art methods. Our method showed greater than 75%
on most tasks, outperforming previous work on the majority of test cases.

<p class="mathjax">Probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers have been
introduced over the past decade as uncertainty-aware numerical integrators.
They typically proceed by assuming a functional prior to the ODE solution,
which is then queried on a grid to form a posterior distribution over the ODE
solution. As the queries span the integration interval, the approximate
posterior solution then converges to the true deterministic one. Gaussian ODE
filters, in particular, have enjoyed a lot of attention due to their
computational efficiency, the simplicity of their implementation, as well as
their provable fast convergence rates. In this article, we extend the
methodology to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and propose a
probabilistic simulator for SDEs. Our approach involves transforming the SDE
into a sequence of random ODEs using piecewise differentiable approximations of
the Brownian motion. We then apply probabilistic ODE solvers to the individual
ODEs, resulting in a pathwise probabilistic solution to the SDE\@. We establish
worst-case strong $1.5$ local and $1.0$ global convergence orders for a
specific instance of our method. We further show how we can marginalise the
Brownian approximations, by incorporating its coefficients as part of the prior
ODE model, allowing for computing exact transition densities under our model.
Finally, we numerically validate the theoretical findings, showcasing
reasonable weak convergence properties in the marginalised version.

<p class="mathjax">Since its introduction to computational geometry by Alt and Godau in 1992,
the Fr\'echet distance has been a mainstay of algorithmic research on curve
similarity computations. The focus of the research has been on comparing
polygonal curves, with the notable exception of an algorithm for the decision
problem for planar piecewise smooth curves due to Rote (2007). We present an
algorithm for the decision problem for piecewise smooth curves that is both
conceptually simpler and naturally extends to the first algorithm for the
problem for piecewise smooth curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We assume that the
algorithm is given two continuous curves, each consisting of a sequence of $m$,
resp.\ $n$, smooth pieces, where each piece belongs to a sufficiently
well-behaved class of curves, such as the set of algebraic curves of bounded
degree. We introduce a decomposition of the free space diagram into a
controlled number of pieces that can be used to solve the decision problem
similarly to the polygonal case, in $O(mn)$ time, leading to a computation of
the Fr\'echet distance that runs in $O(mn\log(mn))$ time. Furthermore, we study
approximation algorithms for piecewise smooth curves that are also $c$-packed
for some fixed value $c$. We adapt the existing framework for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximations and show that an approximate decision can be
computed in $O(cn/\epsilon)$ time for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$.

<p class="mathjax">Due to their unsupervised training and uncertainty estimation, deep
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become powerful tools for
reconstruction-based Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD). Existing VAE-based
TSAD methods, either statistical or deep, tune meta-priors to estimate the
likelihood probability for effectively capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in
the data. However, these methods confront the challenge of inherent data
scarcity, which is often the case in anomaly detection tasks. Such scarcity
easily leads to latent holes, discontinuous regions in latent space, resulting
in non-robust reconstructions on these discontinuous spaces. We propose a novel
generative framework that combines VAEs with self-supervised learning (SSL) to
address this issue.

<p class="mathjax">Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today.
While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing
methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech
online. A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is
a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context
of hate speech to make accurate predictions. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural
language tasks. LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of
natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details.
Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech
detection. However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech
is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware
hate speech detection. In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate
speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets. We discover
that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark
machine learning models in identifying hate speech. By proposing four diverse
prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech.
Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively
capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in
LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Furthermore, although
LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate
speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively
leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models are the current state of the art for generating
photorealistic images. Controlling the sampling process for constrained image
generation tasks such as inpainting, however, remains challenging since exact
conditioning on such constraints is intractable. While existing methods use
various techniques to approximate the constrained posterior, this paper
proposes to exploit the ability of Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to
exactly and efficiently compute the constrained posterior, and to leverage this
signal to steer the denoising process of diffusion models. Specifically, this
paper adopts a class of expressive TPMs termed Probabilistic Circuits (PCs).
Building upon prior advances, we further scale up PCs and make them capable of
guiding the image generation process of diffusion models. Empirical results
suggest that our approach can consistently improve the overall quality and
semantic coherence of inpainted images across three natural image datasets
(i.e., CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and LSUN) with only ~10% additional computational
overhead brought by the TPM. Further, with the help of an image encoder and
decoder, our method can readily accept semantic constraints on specific regions
of the image, which opens up the potential for more controlled image generation
tasks. In addition to proposing a new framework for constrained image
generation, this paper highlights the benefit of more tractable models and
motivates the development of expressive TPMs.

<p class="mathjax">While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph
representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates
under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while
post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution
calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift.
However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty
estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with
post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a
novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty
estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to
graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support
partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic
networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the
functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling
hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on
pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate,
concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\Delta$UQ leads to better
calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves
performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and
generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into
uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\Delta$UQ
in obtaining reliable estimates.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment and major appliances at the
residential level and tracking their changes in real time is important for
aggregators and traditional electricity utilities. In our previous work, we
developed a systematic solution called IRMAC to identify residential users' BTM
equipment and applications from their imported energy data. As a part of IRMAC,
a Similarity Profile (SP) was proposed for dimensionality reduction and
extracting self-join similarity from the end users' daily electricity usage
data. The proposed SP calculation, however, was computationally expensive and
required a significant amount of memory at the user's end. To realise the
benefits of edge computing, in this paper, we propose and assess three
computationally-efficient updating solutions, namely additive, fixed memory,
and codebook-based updating methods. Extensive simulation studies are carried
out using real PV users' data to evaluate the performance of the proposed
methods in identifying PV users, tracking changes in real time, and examining
memory usage. We found that the Codebook-based solution reduces more than 30\%
of the required memory without compromising the performance of extracting
users' features. When the end users' data storage and computation speed are
concerned, the fixed-memory method outperforms the others. In terms of tracking
the changes, different variations of the fixed-memory method show various
inertia levels, making them suitable for different applications.

<p class="mathjax">To achieve scalability with today's heterogeneous HPC resources, we need a
dramatic shift in our thinking; MPI+X is not enough. Asynchronous Many Task
(AMT) runtime systems break down the global barriers imposed by the Bulk
Synchronous Programming model. HPX is an open-source, C++ Standards compliant
AMT runtime system that is developed by a diverse international community of
collaborators called The Ste||ar Group. HPX provides features which allow
application developers to naturally use key design patterns, such as
overlapping communication and computation, decentralizing of control flow,
oversubscribing execution resources and sending work to data instead of data to
work. The Ste||ar Group comprises physicists, engineers, and computer
scientists; men and women from many different institutions and affiliations,
and over a dozen different countries. We are committed to advancing the
development of scalable parallel applications by providing a platform for
collaborating and exchanging ideas. In this paper, we give a detailed
description of the features HPX provides and how they help achieve scalability
and programmability, a list of applications of HPX including two large NSF
funded collaborations (STORM, for storm surge forecasting; and STAR (OctoTiger)
an astro-physics project which runs at 96.8% parallel efficiency on 643,280
cores), and we end with a description of how HPX and the Ste||ar Group fit into
the open source community.

<p class="mathjax">28 GHz outdoor-indoor coverage into modern office buildings with high thermal
efficiency windows is found to be severely limited due to 46 dB median
penetration loss at normal incidence and additional 15 dB median oblique
incidence loss. The study is based on measurements of path gain over 280
outdoor-indoor links, at ranges up to 100 m. A simple theoretical path gain
model is extended to include building penetration through multiple sides of the
building as well as a reflection from another building. The theoretical model
accounts for the building orientation relative to the source, resulting in 4.9
dB RMSE relative to data, as compared to 5.7 dB RMSE from a linear fit and 14.7
dB RMSE for the 3GPP recommended model. Only coarse description of the
buildings is required: building orientation and exterior wall composition,
without any interior details. Coverage range for SNR&gt;-8 dB from an outdoor base
to a terminal just inside a high-efficiency building is under 35 m

<p class="mathjax">Semi-autonomous machines, autonomous machines and robots inhabit closed,
semi-closed and open environments, more structured environments like the
household or more unstructured environments like cultural landscapes or the
wilderness. There they encounter domestic animals, farm animals, working
animals, and wild animals. These creatures could be disturbed, displaced,
injured, or killed by the machines. Within the context of machine ethics and
social robotics, the School of Business FHNW developed several design studies
and prototypes for animal-friendly machines, which can be understood as moral
and social machines in the spirit of these disciplines. In 2019-20, a team led
by the main author developed a prototype robot lawnmower that can recognize
hedgehogs, interrupt its work for them and thus protect them. Every year many
of these animals die worldwide because of traditional service robots. HAPPY
HEDGEHOG (HHH), as the invention is called, could be a solution to this
problem. This article begins by providing an introduction to the background.
Then it focuses on navigation (where the machine comes across certain objects
that need to be recognized) and thermal and image recognition (with the help of
machine learning) of the machine. It also presents obvious weaknesses and
possible improvements. The results could be relevant for an industry that wants
to market their products as animal-friendly machines.

<p class="mathjax">Missing data is a widespread problem in many domains, creating challenges in
data analysis and decision making. Traditional techniques for dealing with
missing data, such as excluding incomplete records or imputing simple estimates
(e.g., mean), are computationally efficient but may introduce bias and disrupt
variable relationships, leading to inaccurate analyses. Model-based imputation
techniques offer a more robust solution that preserves the variability and
relationships in the data, but they demand significantly more computation time,
limiting their applicability to small datasets.
<br />This work enables efficient, high-quality, and scalable data imputation
within a database system using the widely used MICE method. We adapt this
method to exploit computation sharing and a ring abstraction for faster model
training. To impute both continuous and categorical values, we develop
techniques for in-database learning of stochastic linear regression and
Gaussian discriminant analysis models. Our MICE implementations in PostgreSQL
and DuckDB outperform alternative MICE implementations and model-based
imputation techniques by up to two orders of magnitude in terms of computation
time, while maintaining high imputation quality.

<p class="mathjax">Long-horizon tasks, usually characterized by complex subtask dependencies,
present a significant challenge in manipulation planning. Skill chaining is a
practical approach to solving unseen tasks by combining learned skill priors.
However, such methods are myopic if sequenced greedily and face scalability
issues with search-based planning strategy. To address these challenges, we
introduce Generative Skill Chaining~(GSC), a probabilistic framework that
learns skill-centric diffusion models and composes their learned distributions
to generate long-horizon plans during inference. GSC samples from all skill
models in parallel to efficiently solve unseen tasks while enforcing geometric
constraints. We evaluate the method on various long-horizon tasks and
demonstrate its capability in reasoning about action dependencies, constraint
handling, and generalization, along with its ability to replan in the face of
perturbations. We show results in simulation and on real robot to validate the
efficiency and scalability of GSC, highlighting its potential for advancing
long-horizon task planning. More details are available at:

<p class="mathjax">This paper revisits the event-triggered control problem from a data-driven
perspective, where unknown continuous-time linear systems subject to
disturbances are taken into account. Using data information collected off-line
instead of accurate system model information, a data-driven dynamic
event-triggered control scheme is developed in this paper. The dynamic property
is reflected by that the designed event-triggering function embedded in the
event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is dynamically updated as a whole. Thanks to
this dynamic design, a strictly positive minimum inter-event time (MIET) is
guaranteed without sacrificing control performance. Specifically, exponential
input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with respect to
disturbances is achieved in this paper, which is superior to some existing
results that only guarantee a practical exponential ISS property. The dynamic
ETM is easy-to-implement in practical operation since all designed parameters
are determined only by a simple data-driven linear matrix inequality (LMI),
without additional complicated conditions as required in relevant literature.
As quantization is the most common signal constraint in practice, the developed
control scheme is further extended to the case where state transmission is
affected by a uniform or logarithmic quantization effect. Finally, adequate
simulations are performed to show the validity and superiority of the proposed
control schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Demands for pneumatic-driven soft robots are constantly rising for various
applications. However, they are often designed manually due to the lack of
systematic methods. Moreover, design-dependent characteristics of pneumatic
actuation pose distinctive challenges. This paper provides a compact MATLAB
code, named SoRoTop, and its various extensions for designing pneumatic-driven
soft robots using topology optimization. The code uses the method of moving
asymptotes as the optimizer and builds upon the approach initially presented in
Kumar et al.(Struct Multidiscip Optim 61 (4): 1637-1655, 2020). The pneumatic
load is modeled using Darcy's law with a conceptualized drainage term.
Consistent nodal loads are determined from the resultant pressure field using
the conventional finite element approach. The robust formulation is employed,
i.e., the eroded and blueprint design descriptions are used. A min-max
optimization problem is formulated using the output displacements of the eroded
and blueprint designs. A volume constraint is imposed on the blueprint design,
while the eroded design is used to apply a conceptualized strain energy
constraint. The latter constraint aids in attaining optimized designs that can
endure the applied load without compromising their performance. Sensitivities
required for optimization are computed using the adjoint-variable method. The
code is explained in detail, and various extensions are also presented. It is
structured into pre-optimization, MMA optimization, and post-optimization
operations, each of which is comprehensively detailed. The paper also
illustrates the impact of load sensitivities on the optimized designs. SoRoTop
is provided in Appendix A and is available with extensions in the supplementary
material and publicly at \url{https://github.com/PrabhatIn/SoRoTop}.

<p class="mathjax">In software development, the predominant emphasis on functionality often
supersedes security concerns, a trend gaining momentum with AI-driven
automation tools like GitHub Copilot. These tools significantly improve
developers' efficiency in functional code development. Nevertheless, it remains
a notable concern that such tools are also responsible for creating insecure
code, predominantly because of pre-training on publicly available repositories
with vulnerable code. Moreover, developers are called the "weakest link in the
chain" since they have very minimal knowledge of code security. Although
existing solutions provide a reasonable solution to vulnerable code, they must
adequately describe and educate the developers on code security to ensure that
the security issues are not repeated. Therefore we introduce a multipurpose
code vulnerability analysis system \texttt{SecRepair}, powered by a large
language model, CodeGen2 assisting the developer in identifying and generating
fixed code along with a complete description of the vulnerability with a code
comment. Our innovative methodology uses a reinforcement learning paradigm to
generate code comments augmented by a semantic reward mechanism. Inspired by
how humans fix code issues, we propose an instruction-based dataset suitable
for vulnerability analysis with LLMs. We further identify zero-day and N-day
vulnerabilities in 6 Open Source IoT Operating Systems on GitHub. Our findings
underscore that incorporating reinforcement learning coupled with semantic
reward augments our model's performance, thereby fortifying its capacity to
address code vulnerabilities with improved efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">CG-Kit is a new code generation toolkit that we propose as a solution for
portability and maintainability for scientific computing applications. The
development of CG-Kit is rooted in the urgent need created by the shifting
landscape of high-performance computing platforms and the algorithmic
complexities of a particular large-scale multiphysics application: Flash-X.
This combination leads to unique challenges including handling an existing
large code base in Fortran and/or C/C++, subdivision of code into a great
variety of units supporting a wide range of physics and numerical methods,
different parallelization techniques for distributed- and shared-memory systems
and accelerator devices, and heterogeneity of computing platforms requiring
coexisting variants of parallel algorithms. The challenges demand that
developers determine custom abstractions and granularity for code generation.
CG-Kit tackles this with standalone tools that can be combined into highly
specific and, we argue, highly effective portability and maintainability tool
chains. Here we present the design of our new tools: parametrized source trees,
control flow graphs, and recipes. The tools are implemented in Python. Although
the tools are agnostic to the programming language of the source code, we focus
on C/C++ and Fortran. Code generation experiments demonstrate the generation of
variants of parallel algorithms: first, multithreaded variants of the basic
AXPY operation (scalar-vector addition and vector-vector multiplication) to
introduce the application of CG-Kit tool chains; and second, variants of
parallel algorithms within a hydrodynamics solver, called Spark, from Flash-X
that operates on block-structured adaptive meshes. In summary, code generated
by CG-Kit achieves a reduction by over 60% of the original C/C++/Fortran source
code.

<p class="mathjax">While single task image restoration (IR) has achieved significant successes,
it remains a challenging issue to train a single model which can tackle
multiple IR tasks. In this work, we investigate in-depth the multiple-in-one
(MiO) IR problem, which comprises seven popular IR tasks. We point out that MiO
IR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the
adaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple
yet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential
learning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which
guides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential
manner rather than mixing them together. The second strategy, i.e., prompt
learning, attempts to address how to adapt to the different IR tasks, which
assists the network to understand the specific task and improves the
generalization ability. By evaluating on 19 test sets, we demonstrate that the
sequential and prompt learning strategies can significantly enhance the MiO
performance of commonly used CNN and Transformer backbones. Our experiments
also reveal that the two strategies can supplement each other to learn better
degradation representations and enhance the model robustness. It is expected
that our proposed MiO IR formulation and strategies could facilitate the
research on how to train IR models with higher generalization capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Modern ConvNets continue to achieve state-of-the-art results over a vast
array of vision and image classification tasks, but at the cost of increasing
parameters. One strategy for compactifying a network without sacrificing much
expressive power is to reshape it into a tensorial neural network (TNN), which
is a higher-order tensorization of its layers, followed by a factorization,
such as a CP-decomposition, which strips a weight down to its critical basis
components. Passes through TNNs can be represented as sequences of multilinear
operations (MLOs), where the evaluation path can greatly affect the number of
floating point operations (FLOPs) incurred. While functions such as the popular
einsum can evaluate simple MLOs such as contractions, existing implementations
cannot process multi-way convolutions, resulting in scant assessments of how
optimal evaluation paths through tensorized convolutional layers can improve
training speed. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework for representing
tensorial convolution layers as einsum-like strings and a meta-algorithm
conv_einsum which is able to evaluate these strings in a FLOPs-minimizing
manner. Comprehensive experiments, using our open-source implementation, over a
wide range of models, tensor decompositions, and diverse tasks, demonstrate
that conv_einsum significantly increases both computational and
memory-efficiency of convolutional TNNs.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) is one of the key methods for enhancing the
performance of large language models on specific tasks by providing a set of
few-shot question and answer examples. However, the ICL capability of different
types of models shows significant variation due to factors such as model
architecture, volume of learning data, and the size of parameters. Generally,
the larger the model's parameter size and the more extensive the learning data,
the stronger its ICL capability. In this paper, we propose a method SLEICL
(Strong LLM Enhanced ICL) that involves learning from examples using strong
language models and then summarizing and transferring these learned skills to
weak language models for inference and application. This ensures the stability
and effectiveness of ICL. Compared to directly enabling weak language models to
learn from prompt examples, SLEICL reduces the difficulty of ICL for these
models. Our experiments, conducted on up to eight datasets with five language
models, demonstrate that weak language models achieve consistent improvement
over their own zero-shot or few-shot capabilities using the SLEICL method. Some
weak language models even surpass the performance of GPT4-1106-preview
(zero-shot) with the aid of SLEICL.

<p class="mathjax">This study focuses on order dispatch decisions within two-echelon supply
chains, where order dispatch creates economic shipments to reduce delivery
costs. Dispatching orders is often constrained by delivery windows, leading to
penalty costs for untimely deliveries. Prolonged dispatch times can increase
the lead time of orders and potentially violate these delivery windows. To
balance the trade-offs between lead time and economic delivery, this study
introduces a simulation-optimization approach for determining optimal ordering
and dispatch rules. It emphasizes the intricacies of the order dispatch process
and explores how these can be integrated into the simulation-optimization
procedure to improve ordering and delivery decisions. The study evaluates
various options for implementing dispatch rules, including the number of
dispatch queues and prioritized dispatch. The results indicate that a
single-queue, quantity-based, first-in-first-out dispatch approach achieves the
greatest cost reduction while maintaining a desirable service level.

<p class="mathjax">The advantages of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are apparent in a
variety of language processing tasks. But can a language model's knowledge be
further harnessed to effectively disambiguate objects and navigate
decision-making challenges within the realm of robotics? Our study reveals the
LLM's aptitude for solving complex decision making challenges that are often
previously modeled by Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
A pivotal focus of our research is the object disambiguation capability of
LLMs. We detail the integration of an LLM into a tabletop environment
disambiguation task, a decision making problem where the robot's task is to
discern and retrieve a user's desired object from an arbitrarily large and
complex cluster of objects. Despite multiple query attempts with zero-shot
prompt engineering (details can be found in the Appendix), the LLM struggled to
inquire about features not explicitly provided in the scene description. In
response, we have developed a few-shot prompt engineering system to improve the
LLM's ability to pose disambiguating queries. The result is a model capable of
both using given features when they are available and inferring new relevant
features when necessary, to successfully generate and navigate down a precise
decision tree to the correct object--even when faced with identical options.

it is vital to acquire accuracy with the speed. A phase frequency detector
(PFD) is a critical device to regulate and provide accurate frequency in IoT

circuit, designed using 90 nm standard CMOS technology, aiming to achieve
superior operational frequencies. An efficient and high-frequency PFD design is
crafted and analysed using cadence virtuoso. The study focused on investigating
the impact of optimising PFD design. With the optimised PFD, an operational

<p class="mathjax">Image and video inpainting is a classic problem in computer vision and
computer graphics, aiming to fill in the plausible and realistic content in the
missing areas of images and videos. With the advance of deep learning, this
problem has achieved significant progress recently. The goal of this paper is
to comprehensively review the deep learning-based methods for image and video
inpainting. Specifically, we sort existing methods into different categories
from the perspective of their high-level inpainting pipeline, present different
deep learning architectures, including CNN, VAE, GAN, diffusion models, etc.,
and summarize techniques for module design. We review the training objectives
and the common benchmark datasets. We present evaluation metrics for low-level
pixel and high-level perceptional similarity, conduct a performance evaluation,
and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of representative inpainting methods.
We also discuss related real-world applications. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and suggest potential future research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate prediction of flight-level passenger traffic is of paramount
importance in airline operations, influencing key decisions from pricing to
route optimization. This study introduces a novel, multimodal deep learning
approach to the challenge of predicting flight-level passenger traffic,
yielding substantial accuracy improvements compared to traditional models.
Leveraging an extensive dataset from American Airlines, our model ingests
historical traffic data, fare closure information, and seasonality attributes
specific to each flight. Our proposed neural network integrates the strengths
of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
exploiting the temporal patterns and spatial relationships within the data to
enhance prediction performance. Crucial to the success of our model is a
comprehensive data processing strategy. We construct 3D tensors to represent
data, apply careful masking strategies to mirror real-world dynamics, and
employ data augmentation techniques to enrich the diversity of our training
set. The efficacy of our approach is borne out in the results: our model
demonstrates an approximate 33\% improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE)
compared to traditional benchmarks. This study, therefore, highlights the
significant potential of deep learning techniques and meticulous data
processing in advancing the field of flight traffic prediction.

<p class="mathjax">AI and robotics technologies have witnessed remarkable advancements in the
past decade, revolutionizing work patterns and opportunities in various
domains. The application of these technologies has propelled society towards an
era of symbiosis between humans and machines. To facilitate efficient
communication between humans and intelligent robots, we propose the "Avatar"
system, an immersive low-latency panoramic human-robot interaction platform. We
have designed and tested a prototype of a rugged mobile platform integrated
with edge computing units, panoramic video capture devices, power batteries,
robot arms, and network communication equipment. Under favorable network
conditions, we achieved a low-latency high-definition panoramic visual
experience with a delay of 357ms. Operators can utilize VR headsets and
controllers for real-time immersive control of robots and devices. The system
enables remote control over vast physical distances, spanning campuses,
provinces, countries, and even continents (New York to Shenzhen). Additionally,
the system incorporates visual SLAM technology for map and trajectory
recording, providing autonomous navigation capabilities. We believe that this
intuitive system platform can enhance efficiency and situational experience in
human-robot collaboration, and with further advancements in related
technologies, it will become a versatile tool for efficient and symbiotic
cooperation between AI and humans.

involving natural language generation, reasoning, and comprehension. This study
aims to construct prompts and comments grounded in the diverse scoring criteria
delineated within the official TOEFL guide. The primary objective is to assess
the capabilities and constraints of ChatGPT, a prominent representative of
large language models, within the context of automated essay scoring. The
prevailing methodologies for automated essay scoring involve the utilization of
deep neural networks, statistical machine learning techniques, and fine-tuning
pre-trained models. However, these techniques face challenges when applied to
different contexts or subjects, primarily due to their substantial data
requirements and limited adaptability to small sample sizes. In contrast, this
study employs ChatGPT to conduct an automated evaluation of English essays,
even with a small sample size, employing an experimental approach. The
empirical findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide operational functionality
for automated essay scoring, although the results exhibit a regression effect.
It is imperative to underscore that the effective design and implementation of
ChatGPT prompts necessitate a profound domain expertise and technical
proficiency, as these prompts are subject to specific threshold criteria.

<p class="mathjax">Chiral molecule assignation is crucial for asymmetric catalysis, functional
materials, and the drug industry. The conventional approach requires
theoretical calculations of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, which
is time-consuming and costly. To speed up this process, we have incorporated
deep learning techniques for the ECD prediction. We first set up a large-scale
dataset of Chiral Molecular ECD spectra (CMCDS) with calculated ECD spectra. We
further develop the ECDFormer model, a Transformer-based model to learn the
chiral molecular representations and predict corresponding ECD spectra with
improved efficiency and accuracy. Unlike other models for spectrum prediction,
our ECDFormer creatively focused on peak properties rather than the whole
spectrum sequence for prediction, inspired by the scenario of chiral molecule
assignation. Specifically, ECDFormer predicts the peak properties, including
number, position, and symbol, then renders the ECD spectra from these peak
properties, which significantly outperforms other models in ECD prediction, Our
ECDFormer reduces the time of acquiring ECD spectra from 1-100 hours per
molecule to 1.5s.

Multi Action Dribble, (ii) Pass Prediction and (iii) Marking Decision. The
Multi Action Dribbling strategy enabled CYRUS to succeed more often and to be
safer when dribbling actions were performed during a game. The Pass Prediction
enhanced our gameplay by predicting our teammate's passing behavior,
anticipating and making our agents collaborate better towards scoring goals.
Finally, the Marking Decision addressed the multi-agent matching problem to
improve CYRUS defensive strategy by finding an optimal solution to mark
opponents' players.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel bilateral reference framework (***BiRefNet***) for
high-resolution dichotomous image segmentation (DIS). It comprises two
essential components: the localization module (LM) and the reconstruction
module (RM) with our proposed bilateral reference (BiRef). The LM aids in
object localization using global semantic information. Within the RM, we
utilize BiRef for the reconstruction process, where hierarchical patches of
images provide the source reference and gradient maps serve as the target
reference. These components collaborate to generate the final predicted maps.
We also introduce auxiliary gradient supervision to enhance focus on regions
with finer details. Furthermore, we outline practical training strategies
tailored for DIS to improve map quality and training process. To validate the
general applicability of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four
tasks to evince that *BiRefNet* exhibits remarkable performance, outperforming
task-specific cutting-edge methods across all benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Governments are increasingly considering integrating autonomous AI agents in
high-stakes military and foreign-policy decision-making, especially with the
emergence of advanced generative AI models like GPT-4. Our work aims to
scrutinize the behavior of multiple AI agents in simulated wargames,
specifically focusing on their predilection to take escalatory actions that may
exacerbate multilateral conflicts. Drawing on political science and
international relations literature about escalation dynamics, we design a novel
wargame simulation and scoring framework to assess the escalation risks of
actions taken by these agents in different scenarios. Contrary to prior
studies, our research provides both qualitative and quantitative insights and
focuses on large language models (LLMs). We find that all five studied
off-the-shelf LLMs show forms of escalation and difficult-to-predict escalation
patterns. We observe that models tend to develop arms-race dynamics, leading to
greater conflict, and in rare cases, even to the deployment of nuclear weapons.
Qualitatively, we also collect the models' reported reasonings for chosen
actions and observe worrying justifications based on deterrence and
first-strike tactics. Given the high stakes of military and foreign-policy
contexts, we recommend further examination and cautious consideration before
deploying autonomous language model agents for strategic military or diplomatic
decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) is a simulation of a real soccer game in two
dimensions. In soccer, passing behavior is an essential action for keeping the
ball in possession of our team and creating goal opportunities. Similarly, for
SS2D, predicting the passing behaviors of both opponents and our teammates
helps manage resources and score more goals. Therefore, in this research, we
have tried to address the modeling of passing behavior of soccer 2D players
using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Random Forest (RF). We propose an embedded
data extraction module that can record the decision-making of agents in an
online format. Afterward, we apply four data sorting techniques for training
data preparation. After, we evaluate the trained models' performance playing
against 6 top teams of RoboCup 2019 that have distinctive playing strategies.
Finally, we examine the importance of different feature groups on the
prediction of a passing strategy. All results in each step of this work prove
our suggested methodology's effectiveness and improve the performance of the
pass prediction in Soccer Simulation 2D games ranging from 5\% (e.g., playing

<p class="mathjax">The increasing use of transformer-based large language models brings forward
the challenge of processing long sequences. In document visual question
answering (DocVQA), leading methods focus on the single-page setting, while
documents can span hundreds of pages. We present GRAM, a method that seamlessly
extends pre-trained single-page models to the multi-page setting, without
requiring computationally-heavy pretraining. To do so, we leverage a
single-page encoder for local page-level understanding, and enhance it with
document-level designated layers and learnable tokens, facilitating the flow of
information across pages for global reasoning. To enforce our model to utilize
the newly introduced document-level tokens, we propose a tailored bias
adaptation method. For additional computational savings during decoding, we
introduce an optional compression stage using our C-Former model, which reduces
the encoded sequence length, thereby allowing a tradeoff between quality and
latency. Extensive experiments showcase GRAM's state-of-the-art performance on
the benchmarks for multi-page DocVQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of our

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and dense mapping in large-scale environments is essential for
various robot applications. Recently, implicit neural signed distance fields
(SDFs) have shown promising advances in this task. However, most existing
approaches employ projective distances from range data as SDF supervision,
introducing approximation errors and thus degrading the mapping quality. To
address this problem, we introduce N3-Mapping, an implicit neural mapping
system featuring normal-guided neural non-projective signed distance fields.
Specifically, we directly sample points along the surface normal, instead of
the ray, to obtain more accurate non-projective distance values from range
data. Then these distance values are used as supervision to train the implicit
map. For large-scale mapping, we apply a voxel-oriented sliding window
mechanism to alleviate the forgetting issue with a bounded memory footprint.
Besides, considering the uneven distribution of measured point clouds, a
hierarchical sampling strategy is designed to improve training efficiency.
Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates SDF approximation
errors and achieves state-of-the-art mapping quality compared to existing
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">While automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade significantly in
noisy environments, audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems aim to
complement the audio stream with noise-invariant visual cues and improve the
system's robustness. However, current studies mainly focus on fusing the
well-learned modality features, like the output of modality-specific encoders,
without considering the contextual relationship during the modality feature
learning. In this study, we propose a multi-layer cross-attention fusion based
AVSR (MLCA-AVSR) approach that promotes representation learning of each
modality by fusing them at different levels of audio/visual encoders.
Experimental results on the MISP2022-AVSR Challenge dataset show the efficacy
of our proposed system, achieving a concatenated minimum permutation character
error rate (cpCER) of 30.57% on the Eval set and yielding up to 3.17% relative
improvement compared with our previous system which ranked the second place in
the challenge. Following the fusion of multiple systems, our proposed approach
surpasses the first-place system, establishing a new SOTA cpCER of 29.13% on
this dataset.

<p class="mathjax">We address the problem of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian fusion on
unimodular Lie groups. Starting from a stochastic differential equation (SDE)
defined on Lie groups via Mckean-Gangolli injection, we first convert it to a
parametric SDE in exponential coordinates. The coefficient transform method for
the conversion is stated for both Ito's and Stratonovich's interpretation of
the SDE. Then we derive a mean and covariance fitting formula for probability
distributions on Lie groups defined by a concentrated distribution on the
exponential coordinate. It is used to derive the mean and covariance
propagation equations for the SDE defined by injection, which coincides with
the result derived from a Fokker-Planck equation in previous work. We also
propose a simple modification to the update step of Kalman filters using the
fitting formula, which improves the fusion accuracy with moderate computation
time.

<p class="mathjax">Entity resolution, the task of identifying and consolidating records that
pertain to the same real-world entity, plays a pivotal role in various sectors
such as e-commerce, healthcare, and law enforcement. The emergence of Large
Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has introduced a new dimension to this task,
leveraging their advanced linguistic capabilities. This paper explores the
potential of LLMs in the entity resolution process, shedding light on both
their advantages and the computational complexities associated with large-scale
matching. We introduce strategies for the efficient utilization of LLMs,
including the selection of an optimal set of matching questions, namely MQsSP,
which is proved to be a NP-hard problem. Our approach optimally chooses the
most effective matching questions while keep consumption limited to your budget
. Additionally, we propose a method to adjust the distribution of possible
partitions after receiving responses from LLMs, with the goal of reducing the
uncertainty of entity resolution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using entropy as a metric, and our experimental results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods, offering promising
prospects for real-world applications.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential
equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to
the curse of dimensionality. We extend the forward-backward stochastic neural
networks (FBSNNs) which depends on forward-backward stochastic differential
equation (FBSDE) to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. For
Cahn-Hilliard equation, we derive a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation from a
widely used stabilized scheme for original Cahn-Hilliard equation. This
equation can be written as a continuous parabolic system, where FBSDE can be
applied and the unknown solution is approximated by neural network. Also our
method is successfully developed to Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS)
equation. The accuracy and stability of our methods are shown in many numerical
experiments, specially in high dimension.

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent agents stand out as a potential path toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). Thus, researchers have dedicated significant effort to
diverse implementations for them. Benefiting from recent progress in large
language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents that use universal natural language as
an interface exhibit robust generalization capabilities across various
applications -- from serving as autonomous general-purpose task assistants to
applications in coding, social, and economic domains, LLM-based agents offer
extensive exploration opportunities. This paper surveys current research to
provide an in-depth overview of LLM-based intelligent agents within
single-agent and multi-agent systems. It covers their definitions, research
frameworks, and foundational components such as their composition, cognitive
and planning methods, tool utilization, and responses to environmental
feedback. We also delve into the mechanisms of deploying LLM-based agents in
multi-agent systems, including multi-role collaboration, message passing, and
strategies to alleviate communication issues between agents. The discussions
also shed light on popular datasets and application scenarios. We conclude by
envisioning prospects for LLM-based agents, considering the evolving landscape
of AI and natural language processing.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing user
experience in human-computer interaction. Over the past few decades,
researchers have proposed a series of algorithms and achieved impressive
progress. Although each method shows its superior performance, different
methods lack a fair comparison due to inconsistencies in feature extractors,
evaluation manners, and experimental settings. These inconsistencies severely
hinder the development of this field. Therefore, we build MERBench, a unified
evaluation benchmark for multimodal emotion recognition. We aim to reveal the
contribution of some important techniques employed in previous works, such as
feature selection, multimodal fusion, robustness analysis, fine-tuning,
pre-training, etc. We hope this benchmark can provide clear and comprehensive
guidance for follow-up researchers. Based on the evaluation results of
MERBench, we further point out some promising research directions.
Additionally, we introduce a new emotion dataset MER2023, focusing on the
Chinese language environment. This dataset can serve as a benchmark dataset for
research on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised
learning. We will open-source the code and encourage researchers to evaluate
their algorithms under the same experimental setup as MERBench for fair
comparisons.

<p class="mathjax">We present See360, which is a versatile and efficient framework for 360
panoramic view interpolation using latent space viewpoint estimation. Most of
the existing view rendering approaches only focus on indoor or synthetic 3D
environments and render new views of small objects. In contrast, we suggest to
tackle camera-centered view synthesis as a 2D affine transformation without
using point clouds or depth maps, which enables an effective 360? panoramic
scene exploration. Given a pair of reference images, the See360 model learns to
render novel views by a proposed novel Multi-Scale Affine Transformer (MSAT),
enabling the coarse-to-fine feature rendering. We also propose a Conditional
Latent space AutoEncoder (C-LAE) to achieve view interpolation at any arbitrary
angle. To show the versatility of our method, we introduce four training
datasets, namely UrbanCity360, Archinterior360, HungHom360 and Lab360, which
are collected from indoor and outdoor environments for both real and synthetic
rendering. Experimental results show that the proposed method is generic enough
to achieve real-time rendering of arbitrary views for all four datasets. In
addition, our See360 model can be applied to view synthesis in the wild: with
only a short extra training time (approximately 10 mins), and is able to render
unknown real-world scenes. The superior performance of See360 opens up a
promising direction for camera-centered view rendering and 360 panoramic view
interpolation.

<p class="mathjax">Text-conditional image editing based on large diffusion generative model has
attracted the attention of both the industry and the research community. Most
existing methods are non-reference editing, with the user only able to provide
a source image and text prompt. However, it restricts user's control over the
characteristics of editing outcome. To increase user freedom, we propose a new
task called Specific Reference Condition Real Image Editing, which allows user
to provide a reference image to further control the outcome, such as replacing
an object with a particular one. To accomplish this, we propose a fast baseline
method named SpecRef. Specifically, we design a Specific Reference Attention
Controller to incorporate features from the reference image, and adopt a mask
mechanism to prevent interference between editing and non-editing regions. We
evaluate SpecRef on typical editing tasks and show that it can achieve
satisfactory performance. The source code is available on

<p class="mathjax">In the wake of the rapid deployment of large-scale low-Earth orbit satellite
constellations, exploiting the full computing potential of Commercial
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices in these environments has become a pressing issue.
However, understanding this problem is far from straightforward due to the
inherent differences between the terrestrial infrastructure and the satellite
platform in space. In this paper, we take an important step towards closing
this knowledge gap by presenting the first measurement study on the thermal
control, power management, and performance of COTS devices on satellites. Our
measurements reveal that the satellite platform and COTS devices significantly
interplay in terms of the temperature and energy consumption, forming the main
constraints on satellite computing. Further, we analyze the critical factors
that shape the characteristics of onboard COTS computing devices. We provide
guidelines for future research on optimizing the use of such devices for
computing purposes. Finally, we plan to release our datasets to facilitate the
future study.

<p class="mathjax">Network dynamic (e.g., traffic burst in data center networks and channel
fading in cellular WiFi networks) has a great impact on the performance of
communication networks (e.g., throughput, capacity, delay, and jitter). This
article proposes a unified prediction-based method to handle the dynamic of
various network systems. From the view of graph deep learning, I generally
formulate the dynamic prediction of networks as a temporal link prediction task
and analyze the possible challenges of the prediction of weighted networks,
where link weights have the wide-value-range and sparsity issues. Inspired by
the high-resolution video frame prediction with generative adversarial network
(GAN), I try to adopt adversarial learning to generate high-quality predicted
snapshots for network dynamic, which is expected to support the precise and
fine-grained network control. A novel high-quality temporal link prediction
(HQ-TLP) model with GAN is then developed to illustrate the potential of my
basic idea. Extensive experiments for various application scenarios further
demonstrate the powerful capability of HQ-TLP.

<p class="mathjax">Structure from motion is the process of recovering information about cameras
and 3D scene from a set of images. Generally, in a noise-free setting, all
information can be uniquely recovered if enough images and image points are
provided. There are, however, certain cases where unique recovery is
impossible, even in theory; these are called critical configurations. We use a
recently developed algebraic approach to classify all critical configurations
for any number of projective cameras. We show that they form well-known
algebraic varieties, such as quadric surfaces and curves of degree at most 4.
This paper also improves upon earlier results both by finding previously
unknown critical configurations and by showing that some configurations
previously believed to be critical are in fact not.

<p class="mathjax">Correspondence pruning aims to establish reliable correspondences between two
related images and recover relative camera motion. Existing approaches often
employ a progressive strategy to handle the local and global contexts, with a
prominent emphasis on transitioning from local to global, resulting in the
neglect of interactions between different contexts. To tackle this issue, we
propose a parallel context learning strategy that involves acquiring bilateral
consensus for the two-view correspondence pruning task. In our approach, we
design a distinctive self-attention block to capture global context and
parallel process it with the established local context learning module, which
enables us to simultaneously capture both local and global consensuses. By
combining these local and global consensuses, we derive the required bilateral
consensus. We also design a recalibration block, reducing the influence of
erroneous consensus information and enhancing the robustness of the model. The
culmination of our efforts is the Bilateral Consensus Learning Network
(BCLNet), which efficiently estimates camera pose and identifies inliers (true
correspondences). Extensive experiments results demonstrate that our network
not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets but also
showcases robust generalization abilities across various feature extraction
techniques. Noteworthily, BCLNet obtains 3.98\% mAP5$^{\circ}$ gains over the
second best method on unknown outdoor dataset, and obviously accelerates model
training speed. The source code will be available at:

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of the metaverse, envisioned as a hyperreal virtual universe
facilitating boundless human interaction, stands to revolutionize our
conception of media, with significant impacts on addiction, creativity,
relationships, and social polarization. This paper aims to dissect the
addictive potential of the metaverse due to its immersive and interactive
features, scrutinize the effects of its recommender systems on creativity and
social polarization, and explore potential consequences stemming from the
metaverse development. We employed a literature review methodology, drawing
parallels from the research on new media platforms and examining the
progression of reality-mimicking features in media from historical perspectives
to understand this transformative digital frontier. The findings suggest that
these immersive and interactive features could potentially exacerbate media
addiction. The designed recommender systems, while aiding personalization and
user engagement, might contribute to social polarization and affect the
diversity of creative output. However, our conclusions are based primarily on
theoretical propositions from studies conducted on existing media platforms and
lack empirical support specific to the metaverse. Therefore, this paper
identifies a critical gap requiring further research, through empirical studies
focused on metaverse use and addiction and exploration of privacy, security,
and ethical implications associated with this burgeoning digital universe. As
the development of the metaverse accelerates, it is incumbent on scholars,
technologists, and policymakers to navigate its multilayered impacts
thoughtfully to balance innovation with societal well-being.

<p class="mathjax">The utilization of long contexts poses a big challenge for large language
models due to their limited context window length. Although the context window
can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at
both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's
original capabilities. In this work, we propose Activation Beacon, which
condenses LLM's raw activations into more compact forms such that it can
perceive a much longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon
is introduced as a plug-and-play module for the LLM. It fully preserves the
LLM's original capability on short contexts while extending the new capability
on processing longer contexts. Besides, it works with short sliding windows to
process the long context, which achieves a competitive memory and time
efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is learned by the
auto-regression task conditioned on a mixture of beacons with diversified
condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be efficiently trained
purely with short-sequence data in just 10K steps, which consumes less than 9
hours on a single 8xA800 GPU machine. The experimental studies show that
Activation Beacon is able to extend Llama-2-7B's context length by $\times100$
times (from 4K to 400K), meanwhile achieving a superior result on both
long-context generation and understanding tasks. Our model and code will be
available at the BGE repository.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid growth of online news platforms has led to an increased need for
reliable methods to evaluate the quality and credibility of news articles. This
paper proposes a comprehensive framework to analyze online news texts using
natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly a language model
specifically trained for this purpose, alongside other well-established NLP
methods. The framework incorporates ten journalism standards-objectivity,
balance and fairness, readability and clarity, sensationalism and clickbait,
ethical considerations, public interest and value, source credibility,
relevance and timeliness, factual accuracy, and attribution and transparency-to
assess the quality of news articles. By establishing these standards,
researchers, media organizations, and readers can better evaluate and
understand the content they consume and produce. The proposed method has some
limitations, such as potential difficulty in detecting subtle biases and the
need for continuous updating of the language model to keep pace with evolving
language patterns.

<p class="mathjax">System-level testing of avionics software systems requires compliance with
different international safety standards such as DO-178C. An important
consideration of the avionics industry is automated test data generation
according to the criteria suggested by safety standards. One of the recommended
criteria by DO-178C is the modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)
criterion. The current model-based test data generation approaches use
constraints written in Object Constraint Language (OCL), and apply search
techniques to generate test data. These approaches either do not support MC/DC
criterion or suffer from performance issues while generating test data for
large-scale avionics systems. In this paper, we propose an effective way to
automate MC/DC test data generation during model-based testing. We develop a
strategy that utilizes case-based reasoning (CBR) and range reduction
heuristics designed to solve MC/DC-tailored OCL constraints. We performed an
empirical study to compare our proposed strategy for MC/DC test data generation
using CBR, range reduction, both CBR and range reduction, with an original
search algorithm, and random search. We also empirically compared our strategy
with existing constraint-solving approaches. The results show that both CBR and
range reduction for MC/DC test data generation outperform the baseline
approach. Moreover, the combination of both CBR and range reduction for MC/DC
test data generation is an effective approach compared to existing constraint
solvers.

<p class="mathjax">Indoor scene generation has attracted significant attention recently as it is
crucial for applications of gaming, virtual reality, and interior design.
Current indoor scene generation methods can produce reasonable room layouts but
often lack diversity and realism. This is primarily due to the limited coverage
of existing datasets, including only large furniture without tiny furnishings
in daily life. To address these challenges, we propose FurniScene, a
large-scale 3D room dataset with intricate furnishing scenes from interior
design professionals. Specifically, the FurniScene consists of 11,698 rooms and
39,691 unique furniture CAD models with 89 different types, covering things
from large beds to small teacups on the coffee table. To better suit
fine-grained indoor scene layout generation, we introduce a novel Two-Stage
Diffusion Scene Model (TSDSM) and conduct an evaluation benchmark for various
indoor scene generation based on FurniScene. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the capability of our method to generate highly
realistic indoor scenes. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

<p class="mathjax">Document pair extraction aims to identify key and value entities as well as
their relationships from visually-rich documents. Most existing methods divide
it into two separate tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation
extraction (RE). However, simply concatenating SER and RE serially can lead to
severe error propagation, and it fails to handle cases like multi-line entities
in real scenarios. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
framework, PEneo (Pair Extraction new decoder option), which performs document
pair extraction in a unified pipeline, incorporating three concurrent
sub-tasks: line extraction, line grouping, and entity linking. This approach
alleviates the error accumulation problem and can handle the case of multi-line
entities. Furthermore, to better evaluate the model's performance and to
facilitate future research on pair extraction, we introduce RFUND, a
re-annotated version of the commonly used FUNSD and XFUND datasets, to make
them more accurate and cover realistic situations. Experiments on various
benchmarks demonstrate PEneo's superiority over previous pipelines, boosting
the performance by a large margin (e.g., 19.89%-22.91% F1 score on RFUND-EN)
when combined with various backbones like LiLT and LayoutLMv3, showing its
effectiveness and generality. Codes and the new annotations will be open to the
public.

<p class="mathjax">Current talking avatars mostly generate co-speech gestures based on audio and
text of the utterance, without considering the non-speaking motion of the
speaker. Furthermore, previous works on co-speech gesture generation have
designed network structures based on individual gesture datasets, which results
in limited data volume, compromised generalizability, and restricted speaker
movements. To tackle these issues, we introduce FreeTalker, which, to the best
of our knowledge, is the first framework for the generation of both spontaneous
(e.g., co-speech gesture) and non-spontaneous (e.g., moving around the podium)
speaker motions. Specifically, we train a diffusion-based model for speaker
motion generation that employs unified representations of both speech-driven
gestures and text-driven motions, utilizing heterogeneous data sourced from
various motion datasets. During inference, we utilize classifier-free guidance
to highly control the style in the clips. Additionally, to create smooth
transitions between clips, we utilize DoubleTake, a method that leverages a
generative prior and ensures seamless motion blending. Extensive experiments
show that our method generates natural and controllable speaker movements. Our
code, model, and demo are are available at

often explored as potential way of preventing academic misconduct, but this
could also be a limiting factor when aiming to promote a culture of academic
integrity. The findings underscore that LLM led research may be option in the
academic integrity field, but that there is also a need for continued
traditional research. The findings also indicate that researchers and
educational providers should continue to develop policy and operational
frameworks for academic integrity. This will help to ensure that academic
standards are maintained across the wide range of settings that are present in
modern education.

<p class="mathjax">The importance of uncertainty quantification is increasingly recognized in
the diverse field of machine learning. Accurately assessing model prediction
uncertainty can help provide deeper understanding and confidence for
researchers and practitioners. This is especially critical in medical diagnosis
and drug discovery areas, where reliable predictions directly impact research
quality and patient health.
<br />In this paper, we proposed incorporating uncertainty quantification into
clinical trial outcome predictions. Our main goal is to enhance the model's
ability to discern nuanced differences, thereby significantly improving its
overall performance.
<br />We have adopted a selective classification approach to fulfill our objective,
integrating it seamlessly with the Hierarchical Interaction Network (HINT),
which is at the forefront of clinical trial prediction modeling. Selective
classification, encompassing a spectrum of methods for uncertainty
quantification, empowers the model to withhold decision-making in the face of
samples marked by ambiguity or low confidence, thereby amplifying the accuracy
of predictions for the instances it chooses to classify. A series of
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating selective
classification into clinical trial predictions markedly enhances the model's
performance, as evidenced by significant upticks in pivotal metrics such as
PR-AUC, F1, ROC-AUC, and overall accuracy.
<br />Specifically, the proposed method achieved 32.37\%, 21.43\%, and 13.27\%
relative improvement on PR-AUC over the base model (HINT) in phase I, II, and
III trial outcome prediction, respectively. When predicting phase III, our
method reaches 0.9022 PR-AUC scores.
<br />These findings illustrate the robustness and prospective utility of this
strategy within the area of clinical trial predictions, potentially setting a
new benchmark in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning based automatic modulation classification (AMC) has received
significant attention owing to its potential applications in both military and
civilian use cases. Recently, data-driven subsampling techniques have been
utilized to overcome the challenges associated with computational complexity
and training time for AMC. Beyond these direct advantages of data-driven
subsampling, these methods also have regularizing properties that may improve
the adversarial robustness of the modulation classifier. In this paper, we
investigate the effects of an adversarial attack on an AMC system that employs
deep learning models both for AMC and for subsampling. Our analysis shows that
subsampling itself is an effective deterrent to adversarial attacks. We also
uncover the most efficient subsampling strategy when an adversarial attack on
both the classifier and the subsampler is anticipated.

<p class="mathjax">In Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), agents aim to collaboratively
learn a common task, while each agent is acting in its local environment
without exchanging raw trajectories. Existing approaches for FRL either (a) do
not provide any fault-tolerance guarantees (against misbehaving agents), or (b)
rely on a trusted central agent (a single point of failure) for aggregating
updates. We provide the first decentralized Byzantine fault-tolerant FRL
method. Towards this end, we first propose a new centralized Byzantine
fault-tolerant policy gradient (PG) algorithm that improves over existing
methods by relying only on assumptions standard for non-fault-tolerant PG.
Then, as our main contribution, we show how a combination of robust aggregation
and Byzantine-resilient agreement methods can be leveraged in order to
eliminate the need for a trusted central entity. Since our results represent
the first sample complexity analysis for Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized
federated non-convex optimization, our technical contributions may be of
independent interest. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
experimentally for common RL environments, demonstrating the speed-up of
decentralized federations w.r.t. the number of participating agents and
resilience against various Byzantine attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Sophisticated cyber attacks present significant challenges for organizations
in detecting and preventing such threats. To address this critical need for
advanced defense mechanisms, we propose an Ensemble Defense System (EDS). An
EDS is a cybersecurity framework aggregating multiple security tools designed
to monitor and alert an organization during cyber attacks. The proposed EDS
leverages a comprehensive range of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
capabilities by introducing a hybrid of signature-based IDS and anomaly-based
IDS tools. It also incorporates Elasticsearch, an open-source Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, to facilitate data analysis and
interactive visualization of alerts generated from IDSs. The effectiveness of
the EDS is evaluated through a payload from a bash script that executes various
attacks, including port scanning, privilege escalation, and Denial-of-Service
(DoS). The evaluation demonstrates the EDS's ability to detect diverse cyber
attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising
alternative to conventional numerical methods for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs). PIML models are increasingly built via deep neural networks
(NNs) whose architecture and training process are designed such that the
network satisfies the PDE system. While such PIML models have substantially
advanced over the past few years, their performance is still very sensitive to
the NN's architecture and loss function. Motivated by this limitation, we
introduce kernel-weighted Corrective Residuals (CoRes) to integrate the
strengths of kernel methods and deep NNs for solving nonlinear PDE systems. To
achieve this integration, we design a modular and robust framework which
consistently outperforms competing methods in solving a broad range of
benchmark problems. This performance improvement has a theoretical
justification and is particularly attractive since we simplify the training
process while negligibly increasing the inference costs. Additionally, our
studies on solving multiple PDEs indicate that kernel-weighted CoRes
considerably decrease the sensitivity of NNs to factors such as random
initialization, architecture type, and choice of optimizer. We believe our
findings have the potential to spark a renewed interest in leveraging kernel
methods for solving PDEs.

<p class="mathjax">The pre-insertion resistors (PIR) within high-voltage circuit breakers are
critical components and warm up by generating Joule heat when an electric
current flows through them. Elevated temperature can lead to temporary closure
failure and, in severe cases, the rupture of PIR. To accurately predict the
temperature of PIR, this study combines finite element simulation techniques
with Support Vector Regression (SVR) optimized by an Improved Whale
Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) approach. The IWOA includes Tent mapping, a
convergence factor based on the sigmoid function, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
variation strategy. The IWOA-SVR model is compared with the SSA-SVR and
WOA-SVR. The results reveal that the prediction accuracies of the IWOA-SVR
model were 90.2% and 81.5% (above 100$^\circ$C) in the 3$^\circ$C temperature
deviation range and 96.3% and 93.4% (above 100$^\circ$C) in the 4$^\circ$C
temperature deviation range, surpassing the performance of the comparative
models. This research demonstrates the method proposed can realize the online
monitoring of the temperature of the PIR, which can effectively prevent thermal
faults PIR and provide a basis for the opening and closing of the circuit
breaker within a short period.

<br />As an use case, we apply our method to redraw any hand-drawn animated
character eyes based on any design specifications - eyes serve as a focal point
that captures viewer attention and conveys a range of emotions, however, the
labor-intensive nature of traditional animation often leads to compromises in
the complexity and consistency of eye design. Furthermore, we remove the need
for production data for training and introduce a new character recognition
method that surpasses existing work by not requiring fine-tuning to specific
productions. This proposed use case could help maintain consistency throughout
production and unlock bolder and more detailed design choices without the

<p class="mathjax">Safe stabilization is a significant challenge for quadrotors, which involves
reaching a goal position while avoiding obstacles. Most of the existing
solutions for this problem rely on optimization-based methods, demanding
substantial onboard computational resources. This paper introduces a novel
approach to address this issue and provides a solution that offers fast
computational capabilities tailored for onboard execution. Drawing inspiration
from Sontag's universal formula, we propose an analytical control strategy that
incorporates the conditions of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control
barrier functions (CBFs), effectively avoiding the need for solving
optimization problems onboard. Moreover, we extend our approach by
incorporating the concepts of input-to-state stability (ISS) and input-to-state
safety (ISSf), enhancing the universal formula's capacity to effectively manage
disturbances. Furthermore, we present a projection-based approach to ensure
that the universal formula remains effective even when faced with control input
constraints. The basic idea of this approach is to project the control input
derived from the universal formula onto the closest point within the control
input domain. Through comprehensive simulations and experimental results, we
validate the efficacy and highlight the advantages of our methodology.

last hidden layer's activations of an agent's policy network, translating them
into discrete messages. This approach outperforms no communication and competes
favorably with unbounded, continuous communication and hence poses a simple yet
effective strategy for enhancing collaborative task-solving in MARL.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel approach for decomposing and learning every scale of a
given multiscale objective function in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\ge 1$. This
approach leverages a recently demonstrated implicit bias of the optimization
method of gradient descent by Kong and Tao, which enables the automatic
generation of data that nearly follow Gibbs distribution with an effective
potential at any desired scale. One application of this automated effective
potential modeling is to construct reduced-order models. For instance, a
deterministic surrogate Hamiltonian model can be developed to substantially
soften the stiffness that bottlenecks the simulation, while maintaining the
accuracy of phase portraits at the scale of interest. Similarly, a stochastic
surrogate model can be constructed at a desired scale, such that both its
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behaviors (characterized by auto-correlation
function and mean path) align with those of a damped mechanical system with the
original multiscale function being its potential. The robustness and efficiency
of our proposed approach in multi-dimensional scenarios have been demonstrated
through a series of numerical experiments. A by-product of our development is a
method for anisotropic noise estimation and calibration. More precisely,
Langevin model of stochastic mechanical systems may not have isotropic noise in
practice, and we provide a systematic algorithm to quantify its covariance
matrix without directly measuring the noise. In this case, the system may not
admit closed form expression of its invariant distribution either, but with
this tool, we can design friction matrix appropriately to calibrate the system
so that its invariant distribution has a closed form expression of Gibbs.

<p class="mathjax">Finetuned large language models (such as ChatGPT and Qwen-chat) can generate
Chinese classical poetry following human's instructions. LLMs perform well in
content, but are usually lacking in format, with occasionally excess or
insufficient number of characters in each line. Since most SOTA LLMs are
token-based, we assume that the format inaccuracy is due to the difficulty of
the "token planning" task, which means that the LLM need to know exactly how
much characters are contained in each token and do length-control planning
based on that knowledge. In this paper, we first confirm our assumption by
showing that existing token-based large language models has limited knowledge
on token-character relationship. We use a spelling bee probing procedure, and
find that Qwen-chat failed in nearly 15% Chinese spelling test. We then show
that a token-based model can be easily tailored into a token-free model (in
terms of Chinese), which can largely solve the format accuracy problem. Our
tailoring procedure removes long-token from vocabulary and keeps only
character-level or byte-level tokens. As part of our contribution, we release
the finetuned token-free model (which is based on Qwen-chat-7B), which can
generate chinese classical poetry following complex instructions like LLMs
(such as story paraphrasing), and also perform well in format. On the test set,
our token-free model achives an format accuracy of 0.96, compared to 0.84 for
token-based counterparts and 0.38 for GPT-4.

<p class="mathjax">While language models have made many milestones in text inference and
classification tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that can
lead to unforeseen outcomes. Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping
language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often
rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model
performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using
such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an
innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon
diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising
stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional
language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases,
superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as
advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong
textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM
outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are
fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable
and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as
advisors.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic anomaly detection (TAD) in driving videos is critical for ensuring
the safety of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems.
Previous single-stage TAD methods primarily rely on frame prediction, making
them vulnerable to interference from dynamic backgrounds induced by the rapid
movement of the dashboard camera. While two-stage TAD methods appear to be a
natural solution to mitigate such interference by pre-extracting
background-independent features (such as bounding boxes and optical flow) using
perceptual algorithms, they are susceptible to the performance of first-stage
perceptual algorithms and may result in error propagation. In this paper, we
introduce TTHF, a novel single-stage method aligning video clips with text
prompts, offering a new perspective on traffic anomaly detection. Unlike
previous approaches, the supervised signal of our method is derived from
languages rather than orthogonal one-hot vectors, providing a more
comprehensive representation. Further, concerning visual representation, we
propose to model the high frequency of driving videos in the temporal domain.
This modeling captures the dynamic changes of driving scenes, enhances the
perception of driving behavior, and significantly improves the detection of
traffic anomalies. In addition, to better perceive various types of traffic
anomalies, we carefully design an attentive anomaly focusing mechanism that
visually and linguistically guides the model to adaptively focus on the visual
context of interest, thereby facilitating the detection of traffic anomalies.
It is shown that our proposed TTHF achieves promising performance,
outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by +5.4% AUC on the DoTA dataset and
achieving high generalization on the DADA dataset.

<p class="mathjax">External fragmentation of physical memory occurs when adjacent differently
sized regions of allocated physical memory are freed at different times,
causing free memory to be physically discontiguous. It can significantly
degrade system performance and efficiency, such as reducing the ability to use
huge pages, a critical optimization on modern large-memory system. For decades
system developers have sought to avoid and mitigate fragmentation, but few
prior studies quantify and characterize it in production settings.
<br />Moreover, prior work often artificially fragments physical memory to create
more realistic performance evaluations, but their fragmentation methodologies
are ad hoc and unvalidated. Out of 13 papers, we found 11 different
methodologies, some of which were subsequently found inadequate. The importance
of addressing fragmentation necessitates a validated and principled
methodology.
<br />Our work fills these gaps in knowledge and methodology. We conduct a study of
memory fragmentation in production by observing 248 machines in the Computer
Sciences Department at University of Wisconsin - Madison for a week. We
identify six key memory usage patterns, and find that Linux's file cache and
page reclamation systems are major contributors to fragmentation because they
often obliviously break up contiguous memory. Finally, we create and\'uril, a
tool to artificially fragment memory during experimental research evaluations.
While and\'uril ultimately fails as a scientific tool, we discuss its design
ideas, merits, and failings in hope that they may inspire future research.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the question: if an AI agent is known to be safe in one
setting, is it also safe in a new setting similar to the first? This is a core
question of AI alignment--we train and test models in a certain environment,
but deploy them in another, and we need to guarantee that models that seem safe
in testing remain so in deployment. Our notion of safety is based on
power-seeking--an agent which seeks power is not safe. In particular, we focus
on a crucial type of power-seeking: resisting shutdown. We model agents as
policies for Markov decision processes, and show (in two cases of interest)
that not resisting shutdown is "stable": if an MDP has certain policies which
don't avoid shutdown, the corresponding policies for a similar MDP also don't
avoid shutdown. We also show that there are natural cases where safety is _not_
stable--arbitrarily small perturbations may result in policies which never shut
down. In our first case of interest--near-optimal policies--we use a
bisimulation metric on MDPs to prove that small perturbations won't make the
agent take longer to shut down. Our second case of interest is policies for
MDPs satisfying certain constraints which hold for various models (including
language models). Here, we demonstrate a quantitative bound on how fast the
probability of not shutting down can increase: by defining a metric on MDPs;
proving that the probability of not shutting down, as a function on MDPs, is
lower semicontinuous; and bounding how quickly this function decreases.

<p class="mathjax">As the use of Blockchain for digital payments continues to rise in
popularity, it also becomes susceptible to various malicious attacks.
Successfully detecting anomalies within Blockchain transactions is essential
for bolstering trust in digital payments. However, the task of anomaly
detection in Blockchain transaction data is challenging due to the infrequent
occurrence of illicit transactions. Although several studies have been
conducted in the field, a limitation persists: the lack of explanations for the
model's predictions. This study seeks to overcome this limitation by
integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and anomaly
rules into tree-based ensemble classifiers for detecting anomalous Bitcoin
transactions. The Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed to
measure the contribution of each feature, and it is compatible with ensemble
models. Moreover, we present rules for interpreting whether a Bitcoin
transaction is anomalous or not. Additionally, we have introduced an
under-sampling algorithm named XGBCLUS, designed to balance anomalous and
non-anomalous transaction data. This algorithm is compared against other
commonly used under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. Finally, the
outcomes of various tree-based single classifiers are compared with those of
stacking and voting ensemble classifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate
that: (i) XGBCLUS enhances TPR and ROC-AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art
under-sampling and over-sampling techniques, and (ii) our proposed ensemble
classifiers outperform traditional single tree-based machine learning
classifiers in terms of accuracy, TPR, and FPR scores.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid advancement of energy-efficient parallel ultra-low-power (ULP)
ucontrollers units (MCUs) is enabling the development of autonomous nano-sized
unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs). These sub-10cm drones represent the next
generation of unobtrusive robotic helpers and ubiquitous smart sensors.
However, nano-UAVs face significant power and payload constraints while
requiring advanced computing capabilities akin to standard drones, including
real-time Machine Learning (ML) performance and the safe co-existence of
general-purpose and real-time OSs. Although some advanced parallel ULP MCUs
offer the necessary ML computing capabilities within the prescribed power
limits, they rely on small main memories (&lt;1MB) and ucontroller-class CPUs with
no virtualization or security features, and hence only support simple
bare-metal runtimes. In this work, we present Shaheen, a 9mm2 200mW SoC
implemented in 22nm FDX technology. Differently from state-of-the-art MCUs,
Shaheen integrates a Linux-capable RV64 core, compliant with the v1.0 ratified
Hypervisor extension and equipped with timing channel protection, along with a
low-cost and low-power memory controller exposing up to 512MB of off-chip
low-cost low-power HyperRAM directly to the CPU. At the same time, it
integrates a fully programmable energy- and area-efficient multi-core cluster
of RV32 cores optimized for general-purpose DSP as well as reduced- and
mixed-precision ML. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first
silicon prototype of a ULP SoC coupling the RV64 and RV32 cores in a
heterogeneous host+accelerator architecture fully based on the RISC-V ISA. We
demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed SoC on a wide range of benchmarks
relevant to nano-UAV applications. The cluster can deliver up to 90GOp/s and up
to 1.8TOp/s/W on 2-bit integer kernels and up to 7.9GFLOp/s and up to
150GFLOp/s/W on 16-bit FP kernels.

<p class="mathjax">Increasingly online platforms are becoming popular arenas of political
amplification in India. With known instances of pre-organized coordinated
operations, researchers are questioning the legitimacy of political expression
and its consequences on the democratic processes in India. In this paper, we
study an evolved form of political amplification by first identifying and then
characterizing political campaigns with lexical mutations. By lexical mutation,
we mean content that is reframed, paraphrased, or altered while preserving the
same underlying message. Using multilingual embeddings and network analysis, we
detect over 3.8K political campaigns with text mutations spanning multiple
languages and social media platforms in India. By further assessing the
political leanings of accounts repeatedly involved in such amplification
campaigns, we contribute a broader understanding of how political amplification
is used across various political parties in India. Moreover, our temporal
analysis of the largest amplification campaigns suggests that political
campaigning can evolve as temporally ordered arguments and counter-arguments
between groups with competing political interests. Overall, our work
contributes insights into how lexical mutations can be leveraged to bypass the
platform manipulation policies and how such competing campaigning can provide
an exaggerated sense of political divide on Indian social media.

<p class="mathjax">This dissertation investigates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as
candidate models for encoding governing equations, and assesses their
performance on experimental data from two different systems. The first system
is a simple nonlinear pendulum, and the second is 2D heat diffusion across the
surface of a metal block. We show that for the pendulum system the PINNs
outperformed equivalent uninformed neural networks (NNs) in the ideal data
case, with accuracy improvements of 18x and 6x for 10 linearly-spaced and 10
uniformly-distributed random training points respectively. In similar test
cases with real data collected from an experiment, PINNs outperformed NNs with
9.3x and 9.1x accuracy improvements for 67 linearly-spaced and
uniformly-distributed random points respectively. For the 2D heat diffusion, we
show that both PINNs and NNs do not fare very well in reconstructing the
heating regime due to difficulties in optimizing the network parameters over a
large domain in both time and space. We highlight that data denoising and
smoothing, reducing the size of the optimization problem, and using LBFGS as
the optimizer are all ways to improve the accuracy of the predicted solution
for both PINNs and NNs. Additionally, we address the viability of deploying
physics-informed models within physical systems, and we choose FPGAs as the
compute substrate for deployment. In light of this, we perform our experiments
using a PYNQ-Z1 FPGA and identify issues related to time-coherent sensing and
spatial data alignment. We discuss the insights gained from this work and list
future work items based on the proposed architecture for the system that our
methods work to develop.

<p class="mathjax">The dot product self-attention (DPSA) is a fundamental component of
transformers. However, scaling them to long sequences, like documents or
high-resolution images, becomes prohibitively expensive due to quadratic time

employed to simplify computations by approximating softmax but often lead to
performance drops compared to softmax attention. We propose SeTformer, a novel
transformer, where DPSA is purely replaced by Self-optimal Transport (SeT) for
achieving better performance and computational efficiency. SeT is based on two
essential softmax properties: maintaining a non-negative attention matrix and
using a nonlinear reweighting mechanism to emphasize important tokens in input
sequences. By introducing a kernel cost function for optimal transport,
SeTformer effectively satisfies these properties. In particular, with small and
basesized models, SeTformer achieves impressive top-1 accuracies of 84.7% and
86.2% on ImageNet-1K. In object detection, SeTformer-base outperforms the
FocalNet counterpart by +2.2 mAP, using 38% fewer parameters and 29% fewer
FLOPs. In semantic segmentation, our base-size model surpasses NAT by +3.5 mIoU
with 33% fewer parameters. SeTformer also achieves state-of-the-art results in
language modeling on the GLUE benchmark. These findings highlight SeTformer's
applicability in vision and language tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Citations are a key ingredient of scientific research to relate a paper to
others published in the community. Recently, it has been noted that there is a
citation age bias in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, one of
the currently fastest growing AI subfields, in that the mean age of the
bibliography of NLP papers has become ever younger in the last few years,
leading to `citation amnesia' in which older knowledge is increasingly
forgotten. In this work, we put such claims into perspective by analyzing the
bibliography of $\sim$300k papers across 15 different scientific fields
submitted to the popular preprint server Arxiv in the time period from 2013 to
2022. We find that all AI subfields (in particular: cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG)
have similar trends of citation amnesia, in which the age of the bibliography
has roughly halved in the last 10 years (from above 12 in 2013 to below 7 in
2022), on average. Rather than diagnosing this as a citation age bias in the
NLP community, we believe this pattern is an artefact of the dynamics of these
research fields, in which new knowledge is produced in ever shorter time
intervals.

vehicles, delivery robots, and cooking robots, it is increasingly necessary to
design and comprehensively evaluate algorithms that tackle the ``open-world''.
To this end, we introduce NovelGym, a flexible and adaptable ecosystem designed
to simulate gridworld environments, serving as a robust platform for
benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid planning and learning
agents in open-world contexts. The modular architecture of NovelGym facilitates
rapid creation and modification of task environments, including multi-agent

performances of interactive robots using an android that closely resembles a
human. In 2023, the third competition DRC2023 was held. The task of DRC2023 was
designed to be more challenging than the previous travel agent dialogue tasks.
Since anyone can now develop a dialogue system using LLMs, the participating
teams are required to develop a system that effectively uses information about
the situation on the spot (real-time information), which is not handled by
ChatGPT and other systems. DRC2023 has two rounds, a preliminary round and the
final round as well as the previous competitions. The preliminary round has
held on Oct.27 -- Nov.20, 2023 at real travel agency stores. The final round
will be held on December 23, 2023. This paper provides an overview of the task
settings and evaluation method of DRC2023 and the preliminary round results.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has recently arisen as a revolutionary approach to
collaborative training Machine Learning models. According to this novel
framework, multiple participants train a global model collaboratively,
coordinating with a central aggregator without sharing their local data. As FL
gains popularity in diverse domains, security, and privacy concerns arise due
to the distributed nature of this solution. Therefore, integrating this
strategy with Blockchain technology has been consolidated as a preferred choice
to ensure the privacy and security of participants.
<br />This paper explores the research efforts carried out by the scientific
community to define privacy solutions in scenarios adopting Blockchain-Enabled
FL. It comprehensively summarizes the background related to FL and Blockchain,
evaluates existing architectures for their integration, and the primary attacks
and possible countermeasures to guarantee privacy in this setting. Finally, it
reviews the main application scenarios where Blockchain-Enabled FL approaches
have been proficiently applied. This survey can help academia and industry
practitioners understand which theories and techniques exist to improve the
performance of FL through Blockchain to preserve privacy and which are the main
challenges and future directions in this novel and still under-explored
context. We believe this work provides a novel contribution respect to the
previous surveys and is a valuable tool to explore the current landscape,
understand perspectives, and pave the way for advancements or improvements in
this amalgamation of Blockchain and Federated Learning.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is concerned with developing a software tool, called IMPaCT, for
the parallelized verification and controller synthesis of large-scale
stochastic systems using interval Markov chains (IMCs) and interval Markov
decision processes (IMDPs), respectively. The tool serves to (i) construct
IMCs/IMDPs as finite abstractions of underlying original systems, and (ii)
leverage interval iteration algorithms for formal verification and controller
synthesis over infinite-horizon properties, including safety, reachability, and
reach-avoid, while offering convergence guarantees. IMPaCT is developed in C++
and designed using AdaptiveCpp, an independent open-source implementation of
SYCL, for adaptive parallelism over CPUs and GPUs of all hardware vendors,
including Intel and NVIDIA. IMPaCT stands as the first software tool for the
parallel construction of IMCs/IMDPs, empowered with the capability to leverage
high-performance computing platforms and cloud computing services.
Specifically, parallelism offered by IMPaCT effectively addresses the
challenges arising from the state-explosion problem inherent in
discretization-based techniques applied to large-scale stochastic systems. We
benchmark IMPaCT on several physical case studies, adopted from the ARCH tool
competition for stochastic models, including a 2-dimensional robot, a
3-dimensional autonomous vehicle, a 5-dimensional room temperature system, and
a 7-dimensional building automation system. To show the scalability of our
tool, we also employ IMPaCT for the formal analysis of a 14-dimensional case
study.

<p class="mathjax">Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aim to detect the presence of an
intruder by analyzing network packets arriving at an internet connected device.
Data-driven deep learning systems, popular due to their superior performance
compared to traditional IDS, depend on availability of high quality training
data for diverse intrusion classes. A way to overcome this limitation is
through transferable learning, where training for one intrusion class can lead
to detection of unseen intrusion classes after deployment. In this paper, we
provide a detailed study on the transferability of intrusion detection. We
investigate practical federated learning configurations to enhance the
transferability of intrusion detection. We propose two techniques to
significantly improve the transferability of a federated intrusion detection
system. The code for this work can be found at

the surface finite element method (SFEM) of Dziuk-Elliott combined with a
Hood-Taylor pair of finite element spaces has been used in the literature. We
call this method Hood-Taylor-SFEM. This method uses a penalty technique to
weakly satisfy the tangentiality constraint. In this paper we present a
discretization error analysis of this method resulting in optimal
discretization error bounds in an energy norm. We also address linear algebra

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prospective solution for
collaboratively learning a shared model across clients without sacrificing
their data privacy. However, the federated learned model tends to be biased
against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the
inherent FL properties, such as data heterogeneity and party selection. Unlike
centralized learning, mitigating bias in FL is particularly challenging as
private training datasets and their sensitive attributes are typically not
directly accessible. Most prior research in this field only focuses on global
fairness while overlooking the local fairness of individual clients. Moreover,
existing methods often require sensitive information about the client's local
datasets to be shared, which is not desirable. To address these issues, we
propose GLOCALFAIR, a client-server co-design fairness framework that can
jointly improve global and local group fairness in FL without the need for
sensitive statistics about the client's private datasets. Specifically, we
utilize constrained optimization to enforce local fairness on the client side
and adopt a fairness-aware clustering-based aggregation on the server to
further ensure the global model fairness across different sensitive groups
while maintaining high utility. Experiments on two image datasets and one
tabular dataset with various state-of-the-art fairness baselines show that
GLOCALFAIR can achieve enhanced fairness under both global and local data
distributions while maintaining a good level of utility and client fairness.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, multi-task instruction tuning has been applied into sentence
representation learning, which endows the capability of generating specific
representations with the guidance of task instruction, exhibiting strong
generalization ability on new tasks. However, these methods mostly neglect the
potential interference problems across different tasks and instances, which may
affect the training and convergence of the model. To address it, we propose a
data curriculum method, namely Data-CUBE, that arranges the orders of all the
multi-task data for training, to minimize the interference risks from the two
views. In the task level, we aim to find the optimal task order to minimize the
total cross-task interference risk, which is exactly the traveling salesman
problem, hence we utilize a simulated annealing algorithm to find its solution.
In the instance level, we measure the difficulty of all instances per task,
then divide them into the easy-to-difficult mini-batches for training.
Experiments on MTEB sentence representation evaluation tasks show that our
approach can boost the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Our code and
data are publicly available at the link:

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal AI systems will likely become a ubiquitous presence in our
everyday lives. A promising approach to making these systems more interactive
is to embody them as agents within physical and virtual environments. At
present, systems leverage existing foundation models as the basic building
blocks for the creation of embodied agents. Embedding agents within such
environments facilitates the ability of models to process and interpret visual
and contextual data, which is critical for the creation of more sophisticated
and context-aware AI systems. For example, a system that can perceive user
actions, human behavior, environmental objects, audio expressions, and the
collective sentiment of a scene can be used to inform and direct agent
responses within the given environment. To accelerate research on agent-based
multimodal intelligence, we define "Agent AI" as a class of interactive systems
that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other
environmentally-grounded data, and can produce meaningful embodied action with
infinite agent. In particular, we explore systems that aim to improve agents
based on next-embodied action prediction by incorporating external knowledge,
multi-sensory inputs, and human feedback. We argue that by developing agentic
AI systems in grounded environments, one can also mitigate the hallucinations
of large foundation models and their tendency to generate environmentally
incorrect outputs. The emerging field of Agent AI subsumes the broader embodied
and agentic aspects of multimodal interactions. Beyond agents acting and
interacting in the physical world, we envision a future where people can easily
create any virtual reality or simulated scene and interact with agents embodied
within the virtual environment.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Li et al. [2022] presented a dynamic Dyck-reachability algorithm
for bidirected graphs. The basic idea is based on updating edge weights in a
data structure called the merged graph $G_m$. As noted in Krishna et al.
[2023], the edge deletion procedure described in the algorithm of Li et al.
[2022] cannot properly update the weights in the presence of cycles in $G_m$.

<p class="mathjax">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complicated neurological condition which
is challenging to diagnose. Numerous studies demonstrate that children
diagnosed with autism struggle with maintaining attention spans and have less
focused vision. The eye-tracking technology has drawn special attention in the
context of ASD since anomalies in gaze have long been acknowledged as a
defining feature of autism in general. Deep Learning (DL) approaches coupled
with eye-tracking sensors are exploiting additional capabilities to advance the
diagnostic and its applications. By learning intricate nonlinear input-output
relations, DL can accurately recognize the various gaze and eye-tracking
patterns and adjust to the data. Convolutions alone are insufficient to capture
the important spatial information in gaze patterns or eye tracking. The dynamic
kernel-based process known as involutions can improve the efficiency of
classifying gaze patterns or eye tracking data. In this paper, we utilise two
different image-processing operations to see how these processes learn
eye-tracking patterns. Since these patterns are primarily based on spatial
information, we use involution with convolution making it a hybrid, which adds
location-specific capability to a deep learning model. Our proposed model is
implemented in a simple yet effective approach, which makes it easier for
applying in real life. We investigate the reasons why our approach works well
for classifying eye-tracking patterns. For comparative analysis, we experiment
with two separate datasets as well as a combined version of both. The results
show that IC with three involution layers outperforms the previous approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving
mental health, and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the
accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content
generation for mindfulness practice in these methods, high-quality
computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal
guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However, the
user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been
evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation, which requires emotional
expressiveness. In addition, work has not yet been done to study the effect of
physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS
voices for mindfulness. To that end, we designed a two-phase human subject
study. In Phase 1, an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471)
evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with
2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists' voices in 3 different physical
embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot)
with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an
in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed
for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated
user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from
Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all
TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were
poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices.
Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the
user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices,
suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to
improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.

<p class="mathjax">All vehicles must follow the rules that govern traffic behavior, regardless
of whether the vehicles are human-driven or Connected Autonomous Vehicles
(CAVs). Road signs indicate locally active rules, such as speed limits and
requirements to yield or stop. Recent research has demonstrated attacks, such
as adding stickers or projected colored patches to signs, that cause CAV
misinterpretation, resulting in potential safety issues. Humans can see and
potentially defend against these attacks. But humans can not detect what they
can not observe. We have developed an effective physical-world attack that
leverages the sensitivity of filterless image sensors and the properties of
Infrared Laser Reflections (ILRs), which are invisible to humans. The attack is
designed to affect CAV cameras and perception, undermining traffic sign
recognition by inducing misclassification. In this work, we formulate the
threat model and requirements for an ILR-based traffic sign perception attack
to succeed. We evaluate the effectiveness of the ILR attack with real-world
experiments against two major traffic sign recognition architectures on four
IR-sensitive cameras. Our black-box optimization methodology allows the attack
to achieve up to a 100% attack success rate in indoor, static scenarios and a
&gt;80.5% attack success rate in our outdoor, moving vehicle scenarios. We find
the latest state-of-the-art certifiable defense is ineffective against ILR
attacks as it mis-certifies &gt;33.5% of cases. To address this, we propose a
detection strategy based on the physical properties of IR laser reflections
which can detect 96% of ILR attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Systolic arrays are popular for executing deep neural networks (DNNs) at the
edge. Low latency and energy efficiency are key requirements in edge devices
such as drones and autonomous vehicles. Monolithic 3D (MONO3D) is an emerging
3D integration technique that offers ultra-high bandwidth among processing and
memory elements with a negligible area overhead. Such high bandwidth can help
meet the ever-growing latency and energy efficiency demands for DNNs. This
paper presents a novel implementation for weight stationary (WS) dataflow in
MONO3D systolic arrays, called WS-MONO3D. WS-MONO3D utilizes multiple resistive
RAM layers and SRAM with high-density vertical interconnects to multicast
inputs and perform high-bandwidth weight pre-loading while maintaining the same
order of multiply-and-accumulate operations as in native WS dataflow.
Consequently, WS-MONO3D eliminates input and weight forwarding cycles and,
thus, provides up to 40% improvement in energy-delay-product (EDP) over the
native WS implementation in 2D at iso-configuration. WS-MONO3D also provides
10X improvement in inference per second per watt per footprint due to multiple
vertical tiers. Finally, we also show that temperature impacts the energy
efficiency benefits in WS-MONO3D.

<p class="mathjax">In the dynamic urban landscape, where the interplay of vehicles and
pedestrians defines the rhythm of life, integrating advanced technology for
safety and efficiency is increasingly crucial. This study delves into the
application of cutting-edge technological methods in smart cities, focusing on
enhancing public safety through improved traffic accident detection. Action
recognition plays a pivotal role in interpreting visual data and tracking
object motion such as human pose estimation in video sequences. The challenges
of action recognition include variability in rapid actions, limited dataset,
and environmental factors such as (Weather, Illumination, and Occlusions). In
this paper, we present a novel comprehensive dataset for traffic accident
detection. This datasets is specifically designed to bolster computer vision
and action recognition systems in predicting and detecting road traffic
accidents. We integrated datasets from wide variety of data sources, road
networks, weather conditions, and regions across the globe. This approach is
underpinned by empirical studies, aiming to contribute to the discourse on how
technology can enhance the quality of life in densely populated areas. This
research aims to bridge existing research gaps by introducing benchmark
datasets that leverage state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for traffic
accident detection in smart cities. These dataset is expected to advance
academic research and also enhance real-time accident detection applications,
contributing significantly to the evolution of smart urban environments. Our
study marks a pivotal step towards safer, more efficient smart cities,
harnessing the power of AI and machine learning to transform urban living.

<p class="mathjax">Question answering (QA) is the task of answering questions posed in natural
language with free-form natural language answers extracted from a given
passage. In the OpenQA variant, only a question text is given, and the system
must retrieve relevant passages from an unstructured knowledge source and use
them to provide answers, which is the case in the mainstream QA systems on the
Web. QA systems currently are mostly limited to the English language due to the
lack of large-scale labeled QA datasets in non-English languages. In this
paper, we show that effective, low-cost OpenQA systems can be developed for
low-resource languages. The key ingredients are (1) weak supervision using
machine-translated labeled datasets and (2) a relevant unstructured knowledge
source in the target language. Furthermore, we show that only a few hundred
gold assessment examples are needed to reliably evaluate these systems. We
apply our method to Turkish as a challenging case study, since English and
Turkish are typologically very distinct. We present SQuAD-TR, a machine
translation of SQuAD2.0, and we build our OpenQA system by adapting ColBERT-QA
for Turkish. We obtain a performance improvement of 9-34% in the EM score and
13-33% in the F1 score compared to the BM25-based and DPR-based baseline QA
reader models by using two versions of Wikipedia dumps spanning two years. Our
results show that SQuAD-TR makes OpenQA feasible for Turkish, which we hope
encourages researchers to build OpenQA systems in other low-resource languages.
We make all the code, models, and the dataset publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">To resolve the semantic ambiguity in texts, we propose a model, which
innovatively combines a knowledge graph with an improved attention mechanism.
An existing knowledge base is utilized to enrich the text with relevant
contextual concepts. The model operates at both character and word levels to
deepen its understanding by integrating the concepts. We first adopt
information gain to select import words. Then an encoder-decoder framework is
used to encode the text along with the related concepts. The local attention
mechanism adjusts the weight of each concept, reducing the influence of
irrelevant or noisy concepts during classification. We improve the calculation
formula for attention scores in the local self-attention mechanism, ensuring
that words with different frequencies of occurrence in the text receive higher
attention scores. Finally, the model employs a Bi-directional Gated Recurrent
Unit (Bi-GRU), which is effective in feature extraction from texts for improved
classification accuracy. Its performance is demonstrated on datasets such as
AGNews, Ohsumed, and TagMyNews, achieving accuracy of 75.1%, 58.7%, and 68.5%
respectively, showing its effectiveness in classifying tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has been developed to address
the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which consist of
various types of nodes and edges. The core concept of HGFL is to extract
knowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to
a target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data,
and finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods
typically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share
the same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these
three types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited
availability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2)
the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution
shifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance
in existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution
(OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a
novel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF. In
COHF, we first characterize distribution shifts in HGs with a structural causal
model, establishing an invariance principle for OOD generalization in HGFL.
Then, following this invariance principle, we propose a new variational
autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network to mitigate the impact of
distribution shifts. Finally, by integrating this network with a novel
meta-learning framework, COHF effectively transfers knowledge to the target HG
to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven
real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the
state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Effective interaction modeling and behavior prediction of dynamic agents play
a significant role in interactive motion planning for autonomous robots.
Although existing methods have improved prediction accuracy, few research
efforts have been devoted to enhancing prediction model interpretability and
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability. This work addresses these two
challenging aspects by designing a variational auto-encoder framework that
integrates graph-based representations and time-sequence models to efficiently
capture spatio-temporal relations between interactive agents and predict their
dynamics. Our model infers dynamic interaction graphs in a latent space
augmented with interpretable edge features that characterize the interactions.
Moreover, we aim to enhance model interpretability and performance in OOD
scenarios by disentangling the latent space of edge features, thereby
strengthening model versatility and robustness. We validate our approach
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. The
results show superior performance compared to existing methods in modeling
spatio-temporal relations, motion prediction, and identifying time-invariant
latent features.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR), a
new metric for evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to follow
instructions. Addressing a gap in current methodologies, DRFR breaks down
complex instructions into simpler criteria, facilitating a detailed analysis of
LLMs' compliance with various aspects of tasks. Alongside this metric, we
present InFoBench, a benchmark comprising 500 diverse instructions and 2,250
decomposed questions across multiple constraint categories. Our experiments
compare DRFR with traditional scoring methods and explore annotation sources,
including human experts, crowd-sourced workers, and GPT-4. The findings
demonstrate DRFR's higher reliability and the effectiveness of using GPT-4 as a
cost-efficient annotator. The evaluation of several advanced LLMs using this
framework reveals their strengths and areas needing improvement, particularly
in complex instruction-following. This study contributes a novel metric and
benchmark, offering insights for future LLM development and evaluation.

<p class="mathjax">Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms estimate the accurate camera
trajectory by using camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
applications of VIO span a diverse range, including augmented reality and
indoor navigation. VIO algorithms hold the potential to facilitate navigation
for visually impaired individuals in both indoor and outdoor settings.
Nevertheless, state-of-the-art VIO algorithms encounter substantial challenges
in dynamic environments, particularly in densely populated corridors. Existing
VIO datasets, e.g., ADVIO, typically fail to effectively exploit these
challenges. In this paper, we introduce the Amirkabir campus dataset (AUT-VI)
to address the mentioned problem and improve the navigation systems. AUT-VI is
a novel and super-challenging dataset with 126 diverse sequences in 17
different locations. This dataset contains dynamic objects, challenging
loop-closure/map-reuse, different lighting conditions, reflections, and sudden
camera movements to cover all extreme navigation scenarios. Moreover, in
support of ongoing development efforts, we have released the Android
application for data capture to the public. This allows fellow researchers to
easily capture their customized VIO dataset variations. In addition, we
evaluate state-of-the-art Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Odometry
(VO) methods on our dataset, emphasizing the essential need for this
challenging dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation algorithms have been pivotal in handling the overwhelming
volume of online content. However, these algorithms seldom consider direct user
input, resulting in superficial interaction between them. Efforts have been
made to include the user directly in the recommendation process through
conversation, but these systems too have had limited interactivity. Recently,
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained popularity due to their
ease of use and their ability to adapt dynamically to various tasks while
responding to feedback. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
ChatGPT as a top-n conversational recommendation system. We build a rigorous
pipeline around ChatGPT to simulate how a user might realistically probe the
model for recommendations: by first instructing and then reprompting with
feedback to refine a set of recommendations. We further explore the effect of
popularity bias in ChatGPT's recommendations, and compare its performance to
baseline models. We find that reprompting ChatGPT with feedback is an effective
strategy to improve recommendation relevancy, and that popularity bias can be
mitigated through prompt engineering.

<p class="mathjax">The use of machine learning (ML) for cancer staging through medical image
analysis has gained substantial interest across medical disciplines. When
accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques
can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure. Given
the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records,
leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise
for cancer staging. However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume
that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This
oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a
portion of data modalities within the system. In this work, we introduce a
novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of
data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data
modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with
varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our
FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by
devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting
strategy tailored for multi-modal FL. To show the superiority of our method, we
conduct experiments using The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) datalake
considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA
sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information.

<p class="mathjax">We employ an agent-based contact network model to study the relationship
between vaccine uptake and disease dynamics in a hypothetical country town from
New South Wales, Australia, undergoing a COVID-19 epidemic, over a period of
three years. We model the contact network in this hypothetical township of N =
10000 people as a scale-free network, and simulate the spread of COVID-19 and
vaccination program using disease and vaccination uptake parameters typically
observed in such a NSW town. We simulate the spread of the ancestral variant of
COVID-19 in this town, and study the disease dynamics while the town maintains
limited but non-negligible contact with the rest of the country which is
assumed to be undergoing a severe COVID-19 epidemic. We also simulate a maximum
three doses of Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine being administered in this town, with
limited vaccine supply at first which gradually increases, and analyse how the
vaccination uptake affects the disease dynamics in this town, which is captured
using an extended compartmental model with epidemic parameters typical for a
COVID-19 epidemic in Australia. Our results show that, in such a township,
three vaccination doses are sufficient to contain but not eradicate COVID-19,
and the disease essentially becomes endemic. We also show that the average
degree of infected nodes (the average number of contacts for infected people)
predicts the proportion of infected people. Therefore, if the hubs (people with
a relatively high number of contacts) are disproportionately infected, this
indicates an oncoming peak of the infection, though the lag time thereof
depends on the maximum number of vaccines administered to the populace.
Overall, our analysis provides interesting insights in understanding the
interplay between network topology, vaccination levels, and COVID-19 disease
dynamics in a typical remote NSW country town.

<p class="mathjax">Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its many variants are the widespread
optimization algorithms for training deep neural networks. However, SGD suffers
from inevitable drawbacks, including vanishing gradients, lack of theoretical
guarantees, and substantial sensitivity to input. The Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been proposed to address these shortcomings as
an effective alternative to the gradient-based methods. It has been
successfully employed for training deep neural networks. However, ADMM-based
optimizers have a slow convergence rate. This paper proposes an Anderson
Acceleration for Deep Learning ADMM (AA-DLADMM) algorithm to tackle this
drawback. The main intention of the AA-DLADMM algorithm is to employ Anderson
acceleration to ADMM by considering it as a fixed-point iteration and attaining
a nearly quadratic convergence rate. We verify the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed AA-DLADMM algorithm by conducting extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets contrary to other state-of-the-art optimizers.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is a new edge computing paradigm that
enables neighboring edge servers to share computational resources with each
other. Although CEC can enhance the utilization of computational resources, it
still suffers from resource waste. The primary reason is that end-users from
the same area are likely to offload similar tasks to edge servers, thereby
leading to duplicate computations. To improve system efficiency, the
computation results of previously executed tasks can be cached and then reused
by subsequent tasks. However, most existing computation reuse algorithms only
consider one edge server, which significantly limits the effectiveness of
computation reuse. To address this issue, this paper applies computation reuse
in CEC networks to exploit the collaboration among edge servers. We formulate
an optimization problem that aims to minimize the overall task response time
and decompose it into a caching subproblem and a scheduling subproblem. By
analyzing the properties of optimal solutions, we show that the optimal caching
decisions can be efficiently searched using the bisection method. For the
scheduling subproblem, we utilize projected gradient descent and backtracking
to find a local minimum. Numerical results show that our algorithm
significantly reduces the response time in various situations.

<p class="mathjax">Decision-making stands as a pivotal component in the realm of autonomous
vehicles (AVs), playing a crucial role in navigating the intricacies of
autonomous driving. Amidst the evolving landscape of data-driven methodologies,
enhancing decision-making performance in complex scenarios has emerged as a
prominent research focus. Despite considerable advancements, current
learning-based decision-making approaches exhibit potential for refinement,
particularly in aspects of policy articulation and safety assurance. To address
these challenges, we introduce DDM-Lag, a Diffusion Decision Model,augmented
with Lagrangian-based safety enhancements.In our approach, the autonomous
driving decision-making conundrum is conceptualized as a Constrained Markov
Decision Process (CMDP). We have crafted an Actor-Critic framework, wherein the
diffusion model is employed as the actor,facilitating policy exploration and
learning. The integration of safety constraints in the CMDP and the adoption of
a Lagrangian relaxation-based policy optimization technique ensure enhanced
decision safety. A PID controller is employed for the stable updating of model
parameters. The effectiveness of DDM-Lag is evaluated through different driving
tasks, showcasing improvements in decision-making safety and overall
performance compared to baselines.

<p class="mathjax">With the explosive influence caused by the success of large language models
(LLM) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, there has been an extensive amount of recent work
showing that foundation models can be used to solve a large variety of tasks.
However, there is very limited work that shares insights on multi-agent
planning. Multi-agent planning is different from other domains by combining the
difficulty of multi-agent coordination and planning, and making it hard to
leverage external tools to facilitate the reasoning needed. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of multi-agent path finding (MAPF), which is also known as
multi-robot route planning, and study how to solve MAPF with LLMs. We first
show the motivating success on an empty room map without obstacles, then the
failure to plan on a slightly harder room map. We present our hypothesis of why
directly solving MAPF with LLMs has not been successful yet, and we use various
experiments to support our hypothesis.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the high prevalence and burden of mental health conditions, there is
a global shortage of mental health providers. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
methods have been proposed as a way to address this shortage, by supporting
providers with less extensive training as they deliver care. To this end, we
developed the AI-Assisted Provider Platform (A2P2), a text-based virtual
therapy interface that includes a response suggestion feature, which supports
providers in delivering protocolized therapies empathetically. We studied
providers with and without expertise in mental health treatment delivering a
therapy session using the platform with (intervention) and without (control)
AI-assistance features. Upon evaluation, the AI-assisted system significantly
decreased response times by 29.34% (p=0.002), tripled empathic response
accuracy (p=0.0001), and increased goal recommendation accuracy by 66.67%
(p=0.001) across both user groups compared to the control. Both groups rated
the system as having excellent usability.

<p class="mathjax">Scene text spotting is a challenging task, especially for inverse-like scene
text, which has complex layouts, e.g., mirrored, symmetrical, or retro-flexed.
In this paper, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable inverse-like
antagonistic text spotting framework dubbed IATS, which can effectively spot
inverse-like scene texts without sacrificing general ones. Specifically, we
propose an innovative reading-order estimation module (REM) that extracts
reading-order information from the initial text boundary generated by an
initial boundary module (IBM). To optimize and train REM, we propose a joint
reading-order estimation loss consisting of a classification loss, an
orthogonality loss, and a distribution loss. With the help of IBM, we can
divide the initial text boundary into two symmetric control points and
iteratively refine the new text boundary using a lightweight boundary
refinement module (BRM) for adapting to various shapes and scales. To alleviate
the incompatibility between text detection and recognition, we propose a
dynamic sampling module (DSM) with a thin-plate spline that can dynamically
sample appropriate features for recognition in the detected text region.
Without extra supervision, the DSM can proactively learn to sample appropriate
features for text recognition through the gradient returned by the recognition
module. Extensive experiments on both challenging scene text and inverse-like
scene text datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
both on irregular and inverse-like text spotting.

<p class="mathjax">Graph contrastive learning is usually performed by first conducting Graph
Data Augmentation (GDA) and then employing a contrastive learning pipeline to
train GNNs. As we know that GDA is an important issue for graph contrastive
learning. Various GDAs have been developed recently which mainly involve
dropping or perturbing edges, nodes, node attributes and edge attributes.
However, to our knowledge, it still lacks a universal and effective augmentor
that is suitable for different types of graph data. To address this issue, in
this paper, we first introduce the graph message representation of graph data.
Based on it, we then propose a novel Graph Message Augmentation (GMA), a
universal scheme for reformulating many existing GDAs. The proposed unified GMA
not only gives a new perspective to understand many existing GDAs but also
provides a universal and more effective graph data augmentation for graph
self-supervised learning tasks. Moreover, GMA introduces an easy way to
implement the mixup augmentor which is natural for images but usually
challengeable for graphs. Based on the proposed GMA, we then propose a unified
graph contrastive learning, termed Graph Message Contrastive Learning (GMCL),
that employs attribution-guided universal GMA for graph contrastive learning.
Experiments on many graph learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
benefits of the proposed GMA and GMCL approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of autonomous driving, two important features of autonomous
driving car systems are the explainability of decision logic and the accuracy
of environmental perception. This paper introduces DME-Driver, a new autonomous
driving system that enhances the performance and reliability of autonomous
driving system. DME-Driver utilizes a powerful vision language model as the
decision-maker and a planning-oriented perception model as the control signal
generator. To ensure explainable and reliable driving decisions, the logical
decision-maker is constructed based on a large vision language model. This
model follows the logic employed by experienced human drivers and makes
decisions in a similar manner. On the other hand, the generation of accurate
control signals relies on precise and detailed environmental perception, which
is where 3D scene perception models excel. Therefore, a planning oriented
perception model is employed as the signal generator. It translates the logical
decisions made by the decision-maker into accurate control signals for the
self-driving cars. To effectively train the proposed model, a new dataset for
autonomous driving was created. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of
human driver behaviors and their underlying motivations. By leveraging this
dataset, our model achieves high-precision planning accuracy through a logical
thinking process.

<p class="mathjax">Novelty, akin to gene mutation in evolution, opens possibilities for
scientific advancement. Despite peer review being the gold standard for
evaluating novelty in scholarly communication and resource allocation, the vast
volume of submissions necessitates an automated measure of scientific novelty.
Adopting a perspective that views novelty as the atypical combination of
existing knowledge, we introduce an information-theoretic measure of novelty in
scholarly publications. This measure is quantified by the degree of `surprise'
perceived by a language model that represents the distribution of scientific
discourse. The proposed measure is accompanied by face and construct validity
evidence; the former demonstrates correspondence to scientific common sense,
and the latter is endorsed through alignments with novelty evaluations from a
select panel of domain experts. Additionally, characterized by its
interpretability, fine granularity, and accessibility, this measure addresses
gaps prevalent in existing methods. We believe this measure holds great
potential to benefit editors, stakeholders, and policymakers, and it provides a
confident lens for examining the relationship between novelty and scientific
dynamics such as creativity, interdisciplinarity, scientific advances, and
more.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a novel neural network framework, denoted as spectral
integrated neural networks (SINNs), for resolving three-dimensional forward and
inverse dynamic problems. In the SINNs, the spectral integration method is
applied to perform temporal discretization, and then a fully connected neural
network is adopted to solve resulting partial differential equations (PDEs) in
the spatial domain. Specifically, spatial coordinates are employed as inputs in
the network architecture, and the output layer is configured with multiple
outputs, each dedicated to approximating solutions at different time instances
characterized by Gaussian points used in the spectral method. By leveraging the
automatic differentiation technique and spectral integration scheme, the SINNs
minimize the loss function, constructed based on the governing PDEs and
boundary conditions, to obtain solutions for dynamic problems. Additionally, we
utilize polynomial basis functions to expand the unknown function, aiming to
enhance the performance of SINNs in addressing inverse problems. The conceived
framework is tested on six forward and inverse dynamic problems, involving
nonlinear PDEs. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of SINNs
over the popularly used physics-informed neural networks in terms of
convergence speed, computational accuracy and efficiency. It is also noteworthy
that the SINNs exhibit the capability to deliver accurate and stable solutions
for long-time dynamic problems.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced a rapid rise in AI, changing a
wide range of applications with their advanced capabilities. As these models
become increasingly integral to decision-making, the need for thorough
interpretability has never been more critical. Mechanistic Interpretability
offers a pathway to this understanding by identifying and analyzing specific
sub-networks or 'circuits' within these complex systems. A crucial aspect of
this approach is Automated Circuit Discovery, which facilitates the study of
large models like GPT4 or LLAMA in a feasible manner. In this context, our
research evaluates a recent method, Brain-Inspired Modular Training (BIMT),
designed to enhance the interpretability of neural networks. We demonstrate how
BIMT significantly improves the efficiency and quality of Automated Circuit
Discovery, overcoming the limitations of manual methods. Our comparative
analysis further reveals that BIMT outperforms existing models in terms of
circuit quality, discovery time, and sparsity. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive computational analysis of BIMT, including aspects such as
training duration, memory allocation requirements, and inference speed. This
study advances the larger objective of creating trustworthy and transparent AI
systems in addition to demonstrating how well BIMT works to make neural
networks easier to understand.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-aspect dense retrieval aims to incorporate aspect information (e.g.,
brand and category) into dual encoders to facilitate relevance matching. As an
early and representative multi-aspect dense retriever, MADRAL learns several
extra aspect embeddings and fuses the explicit aspects with an implicit aspect
"OTHER" for final representation. MADRAL was evaluated on proprietary data and
its code was not released, making it challenging to validate its effectiveness
on other datasets. We failed to reproduce its effectiveness on the public
MA-Amazon data, motivating us to probe the reasons and re-examine its
components. We propose several component alternatives for comparisons,
including replacing "OTHER" with "CLS" and representing aspects with the first
several content tokens. Through extensive experiments, we confirm that learning
"OTHER" from scratch in aspect fusion is harmful. In contrast, our proposed
variants can greatly enhance the retrieval performance. Our research not only
sheds light on the limitations of MADRAL but also provides valuable insights
for future studies on more powerful multi-aspect dense retrieval models. Code
will be released at:

<p class="mathjax">In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a
hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the
hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said
to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an
adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by
an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of
matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study
of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing
the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend
the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some
useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on
hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design
control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems
on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical
systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a
higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability
results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Stakeholders constantly make assumptions in the development of deep learning
(DL) frameworks. These assumptions are related to various types of software
artifacts (e.g., requirements, design decisions, and technical debt) and can
turn out to be invalid, leading to system failures. Existing approaches and
tools for assumption management usually depend on manual identification of
assumptions. However, assumptions are scattered in various sources (e.g., code
comments, commits, pull requests, and issues) of DL framework development, and
manually identifying assumptions has high costs (e.g., time and resources). To
overcome the issues of manually identifying assumptions in DL framework
development, we constructed a new and largest dataset (i.e., AssuEval) of
assumptions collected from the TensorFlow and Keras repositories on GitHub;
explored the performance of seven traditional machine learning models (e.g.,
Support Vector Machine, Classification and Regression Trees), a popular DL
model (i.e., ALBERT), and a large language model (i.e., ChatGPT) of identifying
assumptions on the AssuEval dataset. The experiment results show that: ALBERT
achieves the best performance (f1-score: 0.9584) of identifying assumptions on
the AssuEval dataset, which is much better than the other models (the 2nd best
f1-score is 0.6211, achieved by ChatGPT). Though ChatGPT is the most popular
large language model, we do not recommend using it to identify assumptions in
DL framework development because of its low performance on the task.
Fine-tuning ChatGPT specifically for assumption identification could improve
the performance. This study provides researchers with the largest dataset of
assumptions for further research (e.g., assumption classification, evaluation,
and reasoning) and helps practitioners better understand assumptions and how to
manage them in their projects.

<p class="mathjax">This paper builds further rigorous analysis on the root-exponential
convergence for lightning schemes approximating corner singularity problems. By
utilizing Poisson summation formula, Runge's approximation theorem and Cauchy's
integral theorem, the optimal rate is obtained for efficient lightning plus
polynomial schemes, newly developed by Herremans, Huybrechs and Trefethen
\cite{Herremans2023}, for approximation of $g(z)z^\alpha$ or $g(z)z^\alpha\log
z$ in a sector-shaped domain with tapered exponentially clustering poles, where
$g(z)$ is analytic on the sector domain. From these results, Conjecture 5.3 in
\cite{Herremans2023} on the root-exponential convergence rate is confirmed and
the choice of the parameter
$\sigma_{opt}=\frac{\sqrt{2(2-\beta)}\pi}{\sqrt{\alpha}}$ may achieve the
fastest convergence rate among all $\sigma&gt;0$. Furthermore, based on Lehman and
Wasow's study of corner singularities \cite{Lehman1954DevelopmentsIT, Wasow},
together with the decomposition of Gopal and Trefethen \cite{Gopal2019},
root-exponential rates for lightning plus polynomial schemes in corner domains
$\Omega$ are validated, and the best choice of lightning clustering parameter
$\sigma$ for $\Omega$ is also obtained explicitly. The thorough analysis
provides a solid foundation for lightning schemes.

<p class="mathjax">We propose GrainGNN, a surrogate model for polycrystalline grain formation
under rapid solidification conditions in metal additive manufacturing. Such
grain formation problems are modeled by a multicomponent partial differential
equation PDE with moving interfaces. The inherent randomness of the PDE initial
conditions (grain seeds) necessitates ensemble simulations to predict
microstructure statistics, e.g., grain size, aspect ratio, and crystallographic
orientation. Currently such ensemble simulations are prohibitively expensive
and surrogates are necessary.
<br />In GrainGNN, we use a dynamic graph to represent interface motion and
topological changes due to grain coarsening. We use a reduced representation of
the microstructure using hand-crafted features; we combine pattern finding and
altering graph algorithms with two neural networks, a classifier (for
topological changes) and a regressor (for interface motion). Both networks have
an encoder-decoder architecture; the encoder has a multi-layer transformer
long-short-term-memory architecture; the decoder is a single layer perceptron.
<br />We evaluate GrainGNN by comparing it to high-fidelity phase field simulations
for in-distribution and out-of-distribution grain configurations for
solidification under laser power bed fusion conditions. GrainGNN results in
80\%--90\% pointwise accuracy; and nearly identical distributions of scalar
quantities of interest (QoI) between phase field and GrainGNN simulations
compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. GrainGNN's inference speedup (PyTorch
on single x86 node) over a high-fidelity phase-field simulation (CUDA on a
single NVIDIA A100 GPU) is 300$\times$--2000$\times$ for 100-initial grain
problem. Further, using GrainGNN, we model the formation of 11,600 grains in
220 seconds on a single CPU core.

<p class="mathjax">The construction of 3D medical image datasets presents several issues,
including requiring significant financial costs in data collection and
specialized expertise for annotation, as well as strict privacy concerns for
patient confidentiality compared to natural image datasets. Therefore, it has
become a pressing issue in 3D medical image segmentation to enable
data-efficient learning with limited 3D medical data and supervision. A
promising approach is pre-training, but improving its performance in 3D medical
image segmentation is difficult due to the small size of existing 3D medical
image datasets. We thus present the Primitive Geometry Segment Pre-training
(PrimGeoSeg) method to enable the learning of 3D semantic features by
pre-training segmentation tasks using only primitive geometric objects for 3D
medical image segmentation. PrimGeoSeg performs more accurate and efficient 3D
medical image segmentation without manual data collection and annotation.
Further, experimental results show that PrimGeoSeg on SwinUNETR improves
performance over learning from scratch on BTCV, MSD (Task06), and BraTS
datasets by 3.7%, 4.4%, and 0.3%, respectively. Remarkably, the performance was
equal to or better than state-of-the-art self-supervised learning despite the
equal number of pre-training data. From experimental results, we conclude that
effective pre-training can be achieved by looking at primitive geometric
objects only. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/SUPER-TADORY/PrimGeoSeg.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the dynamics of cheap talk interactions between a sender
and receiver, departing from conventional models by focusing on the receiver's
perspective. We study two models, one with transparent motives and another one
in which the receiver can \emph{filter} the information that is accessible by
the sender. We give a geometric characterization of the best receiver
equilibrium under transparent motives and prove that the receiver does not
benefit from filtering information in this case. However, in general, we show
that the receiver can strictly benefit from filtering and provide efficient
algorithms for computing optimal equilibria. This innovative analysis aligns
with user-based platforms where receivers (users) control information
accessible to senders (sellers). Our findings provide insights into
communication dynamics, leveling the sender's inherent advantage, and offering
strategic interaction predictions.

(MsFEM) to address steady-state Stokes-Darcy problems with BJS interface
conditions in highly heterogeneous porous media. We assume the existence of
multiscale features in the Darcy region and propose an algorithm for the

construct permeability-dependent offline bases for efficient coarse-grid

In the online phase, we use the Robin-Robin algorithm to derive the model's

our approach, we present extensive numerical tests on highly heterogeneous

<p class="mathjax">Link prediction aims to predict the potential existence of links between two
unconnected nodes within a network based on the known topological
characteristics. Evaluation metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of
algorithms in link prediction. The discriminating ability of these evaluation
metrics is vitally important for accurately evaluating link prediction
algorithms. In this study, we propose an artificial network model, based on
which one can adjust a single parameter to monotonically and continuously turn
the prediction accuracy of the specifically designed link prediction algorithm.
Building upon this foundation, we show a framework to depict the effectiveness
of evaluating metrics by focusing on their discriminating ability.
Specifically, a quantitative comparison in the abilities of correctly
discerning varying prediction accuracies was conducted encompassing nine
evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Measure, Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC), Balanced Precision (BP), the Area Under the receiver
operating characteristic Curve (AUC), the Area Under the Precision-Recall curve
(AUPR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Area Under the
magnified ROC (AUC-mROC). The results indicate that the discriminating
abilities of the three metrics, AUC, AUPR, and NDCG, are significantly higher
than those of other metrics.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the usage of cloud services has been increasing annually, and with
remote work becoming one of the new forms of employment within enterprises, the
security of cloud-based remote work environments has become important. The
existing work environment relies on a perimeter security model, where accessing
one's resources is based on the assumption that everything within the internal
network is secure. However, due to the limitations of the perimeter security
model, which assumes the safety of everything within the internal network, the
adoption of Zero Trust is now being demanded. Accordingly, NIST and DoD have
published guidelines related to Zero Trust architecture. However, these
guidelines describe security requirements at an abstract level, focusing on
logical architecture. In this paper, we conduct a threat modeling for OpenStack
cloud to propose more detailed security requirements compared to NIST and DoD
guidelines. Subsequently, we perform a security analysis of commercial cloud
services such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service, and Google Cloud to
validate these requirements. The security analysis results identify security
requirements that each cloud service fails to satisfy, indicating potential
exposure to threats. This paper proposes detailed security requirements based
on the Zero Trust model and conducts security analyses of various cloud
services accordingly. As a result of the security analysis, we proposed
potential threats and countermeasures for cloud services with Zero Trust, and
this is intended to help build a secure Zero Trust-based remote work
environment.

potential exploitation of imperfections in Artificial Intelligence Generated
Content (AIGC) Detectors for academic misconduct. In this paper, we present an
empirical study where the LLM is examined for its attempts to bypass detection
by AIGC Detectors. This is achieved by generating code in response to a given
question using different variants. We collected a dataset comprising 5,069
samples, with each sample consisting of a textual description of a coding
problem and its corresponding human-written Python solution codes. These
samples were obtained from various sources, including 80 from Quescol, 3,264
from Kaggle, and 1,725 from LeetCode. From the dataset, we created 13 sets of
code problem variant prompts, which were used to instruct ChatGPT to generate
the outputs. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five AIGC detectors.
Our results demonstrate that existing AIGC Detectors perform poorly in
distinguishing between human-written code and AI-generated code.

<p class="mathjax">Better forecasts may not lead to better decision-making. To address this
challenge, decision-oriented learning (DOL) has been proposed as a new branch
of machine learning that replaces traditional statistical loss with a decision
loss to form an end-to-end model. Applications of DOL in power systems have
been developed in recent years. For renewable-rich power systems, uncertainties
propagate through sequential tasks, where traditional statistical-based
approaches focus on minimizing statistical errors at intermediate stages but
may fail to provide optimal decisions at the final stage. This paper first
elaborates on the mismatch between more accurate forecasts and more optimal
decisions in the power system caused by statistical-based learning (SBL) and
explains how DOL resolves this problem. Secondly, this paper extensively
reviews DOL techniques and their applications in power systems while
highlighting their pros and cons in relation to SBL. Finally, this paper
identifies the challenges to adopt DOL in the energy sector and presents future
research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Distillation (FD) is a novel and promising distributed machine
learning paradigm, where knowledge distillation is leveraged to facilitate a
more efficient and flexible cross-device knowledge transfer in federated
learning. By optimizing local models with knowledge distillation, FD
circumvents the necessity of uploading large-scale model parameters to the
central server, simultaneously preserving the raw data on local clients.
Despite the growing popularity of FD, there is a noticeable gap in previous
works concerning the exploration of poisoning attacks within this framework.
This can lead to a scant understanding of the vulnerabilities to potential
adversarial actions. To this end, we introduce FDLA, a poisoning attack method
tailored for FD. FDLA manipulates logit communications in FD, aiming to
significantly degrade model performance on clients through misleading the
discrimination of private samples. Through extensive simulation experiments
across a variety of datasets, attack scenarios, and FD configurations, we
demonstrate that LPA effectively compromises client model accuracy,
outperforming established baseline algorithms in this regard. Our findings
underscore the critical need for robust defense mechanisms in FD settings to
mitigate such adversarial threats.

<p class="mathjax">Video Text Spotting (VTS) is a fundamental visual task that aims to predict
the trajectories and content of texts in a video. Previous works usually
conduct local associations and apply IoU-based distance and complex
post-processing procedures to boost performance, ignoring the abundant temporal
information and the morphological characteristics in VTS. In this paper, we
propose a novel Global Video Text Spotting Transformer GloTSFormer to model the
tracking problem as global associations and utilize the Gaussian Wasserstein
distance to guide the morphological correlation between frames. Our main
contributions can be summarized as three folds. 1). We propose a
Transformer-based global tracking method GloTSFormer for VTS and associate
multiple frames simultaneously. 2). We introduce a Wasserstein distance-based
method to conduct positional associations between frames. 3). We conduct
extensive experiments on public datasets. On the ICDAR2015 video dataset,
GloTSFormer achieves 56.0 MOTA with 4.6 absolute improvement compared with the
previous SOTA method and outperforms the previous Transformer-based method by a
significant 8.3 MOTA.

<p class="mathjax">Fairness has been a critical issue that affects the adoption of deep learning
models in real practice. To improve model fairness, many existing methods have
been proposed and evaluated to be effective in their own contexts. However,
there is still no systematic evaluation among them for a comprehensive
comparison under the same context, which makes it hard to understand the
performance distinction among them, hindering the research progress and
practical adoption of them. To fill this gap, this paper endeavours to conduct
the first large-scale empirical study to comprehensively compare the
performance of existing state-of-the-art fairness improving techniques.
Specifically, we target the widely-used application scenario of image
classification, and utilized three different datasets and five commonly-used
performance metrics to assess in total 13 methods from diverse categories. Our
findings reveal substantial variations in the performance of each method across
different datasets and sensitive attributes, indicating over-fitting on
specific datasets by many existing methods. Furthermore, different fairness
evaluation metrics, due to their distinct focuses, yield significantly
different assessment results. Overall, we observe that pre-processing methods
and in-processing methods outperform post-processing methods, with
pre-processing methods exhibiting the best performance. Our empirical study
offers comprehensive recommendations for enhancing fairness in deep learning
models. We approach the problem from multiple dimensions, aiming to provide a
uniform evaluation platform and inspire researchers to explore more effective
fairness solutions via a set of implications.

quality of patient treatment. Surrounding each patient's treatment,
communication among HCPs can be examined as temporal networks, constructed from
Electronic Health Record (EHR) access logs. This paper introduces a visual
analytics system designed to study the effectiveness and efficiency of temporal
communication networks mediated by the EHR system. We present a method that
associates network measures with patient survival outcomes and devises
effectiveness metrics based on these associations. To analyze communication
efficiency, we extract the latencies and frequencies of EHR accesses. Our
visual analytics system is designed to assist in inspecting and understanding

<p class="mathjax">Natural language provides an intuitive and expressive way of conveying human
intent to robots. Prior works employed end-to-end methods for learning
trajectory deformations from language corrections. However, such methods do not
generalize to new initial trajectories or object configurations. This work
presents ExTraCT, a modular framework for trajectory corrections using natural
language that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language
understanding and trajectory deformation functions. Given a scene, ExTraCT
generates the trajectory modification features (scene-specific and
scene-independent) and their corresponding natural language textual
descriptions for the objects in the scene online based on a template. We use
LLMs for semantic matching of user utterances to the textual descriptions of
features. Based on the feature matched, a trajectory modification function is
applied to the initial trajectory, allowing generalization to unseen
trajectories and object configurations. Through user studies conducted both in
simulation and with a physical robot arm, we demonstrate that trajectories
deformed using our method were more accurate and were preferred in about 80\%
of cases, outperforming the baseline. We also showcase the versatility of our
system in a manipulation task and an assistive feeding task.

<p class="mathjax">Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as
GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a
natural extension of the `learning from parity with error' problem to higher
moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear
code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard.
Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the
learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open
question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., non-quantum).
<br />We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based
on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is
also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new
cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems:
the public key is of size $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and encrypting a message increases
its size by a factor of $\tilde{O}(n)$ (in previous cryptosystems these values
are $\tilde{O}(n^4)$ and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$, respectively). In fact, under the
assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$, the size of the public key can be reduced to $\tilde{O}(n)$.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-view surface reconstruction is an ill-posed, inverse problem in 3D
vision research. It involves modeling the geometry and appearance with
appropriate surface representations. Most of the existing methods rely either
on explicit meshes, using surface rendering of meshes for reconstruction, or on
implicit field functions, using volume rendering of the fields for
reconstruction. The two types of representations in fact have their respective
merits. In this work, we propose a new hybrid representation, termed Sur2f,
aiming to better benefit from both representations in a complementary manner.
Technically, we learn two parallel streams of an implicit signed distance field
and an explicit surrogate surface Sur2f mesh, and unify volume rendering of the
implicit signed distance function (SDF) and surface rendering of the surrogate
mesh with a shared, neural shader; the unified shading promotes their
convergence to the same, underlying surface. We synchronize learning of the
surrogate mesh by driving its deformation with functions induced from the
implicit SDF. In addition, the synchronized surrogate mesh enables
surface-guided volume sampling, which greatly improves the sampling efficiency
per ray in volume rendering. We conduct thorough experiments showing that
Sur$^2$f outperforms existing reconstruction methods and surface
representations, including hybrid ones, in terms of both recovery quality and
recovery efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">We present a joint learning scheme of video super-resolution and deblurring,
called VSRDB, to restore clean high-resolution (HR) videos from blurry
low-resolution (LR) ones. This joint restoration problem has drawn much less
attention compared to single restoration problems. In this paper, we propose a
novel flow-guided dynamic filtering (FGDF) and iterative feature refinement
with multi-attention (FRMA), which constitutes our VSRDB framework, denoted as
FMA-Net. Specifically, our proposed FGDF enables precise estimation of both
spatio-temporally-variant degradation and restoration kernels that are aware of
motion trajectories through sophisticated motion representation learning.
Compared to conventional dynamic filtering, the FGDF enables the FMA-Net to
effectively handle large motions into the VSRDB. Additionally, the stacked FRMA
blocks trained with our novel temporal anchor (TA) loss, which temporally
anchors and sharpens features, refine features in a course-to-fine manner
through iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed FMA-Net over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative quality. Codes and pre-trained models are

<p class="mathjax">We propose a method for checking generalized reachability properties in Petri
nets that takes advantage of structural reductions and that can be used,
transparently, as a pre-processing step of existing model-checkers. Our
approach is based on a new procedure that can project a property, about an
initial Petri net, into an equivalent formula that only refers to the reduced
version of this net. Our projection is defined as a variable elimination
procedure for linear integer arithmetic tailored to the specific kind of
constraints we handle. It has linear complexity, is guaranteed to return a
sound property, and makes use of a simple condition to detect when the result
is exact. Experimental results show that our approach works well in practice
and that it can be useful even when there is only a limited amount of
reductions.

<p class="mathjax">Time-series data exists in every corner of real-world systems and services,
ranging from satellites in the sky to wearable devices on human bodies.
Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from
these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of
particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned
representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively.
Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance
in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual
feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three
fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation
learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we
comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and
insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations.
Finally, as a guideline for future studies, we summarize commonly used
experimental setups and datasets and discuss several promising research
directions. An up-to-date corresponding resource is available at

<p class="mathjax">Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to
process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event
Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although
convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets,
benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of
convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential
time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network
(RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention
module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of
spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and
temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of
efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of
our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model
makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions
with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.

<p class="mathjax">Thyroid cancer, the most prevalent endocrine cancer, has gained significant
global attention due to its impact on public health. Extensive research efforts
have been dedicated to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the
early detection of this disease, aiming to reduce its morbidity rates. However,
a comprehensive understanding of the structured organization of research
applications in this particular field remains elusive. To address this
knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and developed a comprehensive
taxonomy of machine learning-based applications in thyroid cancer pathogenesis,
diagnosis, and prognosis. Our primary objective was to facilitate the research
community's ability to stay abreast of technological advancements and
potentially lead the emerging trends in this field. This survey presents a
coherent literature review framework for interpreting the advanced techniques
used in thyroid cancer research. A total of 758 related studies were identified
and scrutinized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that
provides an in-depth analysis of the various aspects of AI applications
employed in the context of thyroid cancer. Furthermore, we highlight key
challenges encountered in this domain and propose future research opportunities
for those interested in studying the latest trends or exploring
less-investigated aspects of thyroid cancer research. By presenting this
comprehensive review and taxonomy, we contribute to the existing knowledge in
the field, while providing valuable insights for researchers, clinicians, and
stakeholders in advancing the understanding and management of this disease.

<p class="mathjax">Database systems often rely on historical query traces to perform
workload-based performance tuning. However, real production workloads are
time-evolving, making historical queries ineffective for optimizing future
workloads. To address this challenge, we propose SIBYL, an end-to-end machine
learning-based framework that accurately forecasts a sequence of future
queries, with the entire query statements, in various prediction windows.
Drawing insights from real-workloads, we propose template-based featurization
techniques and develop a stacked-LSTM with an encoder-decoder architecture for
accurate forecasting of query workloads. We also develop techniques to improve
forecasting accuracy over large prediction windows and achieve high scalability
over large workloads with high variability in arrival rates of queries.
Finally, we propose techniques to handle workload drifts. Our evaluation on
four real workloads demonstrates that SIBYL can forecast workloads with an
$87.3\%$ median F1 score, and can result in $1.7\times$ and $1.3\times$
performance improvement when applied to materialized view selection and index
selection applications, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly being used to label data across
many domains and for myriad tasks. By simply asking the LLM for an answer, or
``prompting,'' practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get a response for
an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of decisions by the
practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to requesting the output in a
certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that address more
sensitive topics. In this work, we ask: do variations in the way a prompt is
constructed change the ultimate decision of the LLM? We answer this using a
series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks. We
find that even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end
of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that
requesting responses in XML and commonly used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic
effects on the data labeled by LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive competency in various
text-related tasks. However, their opaque internal mechanisms become a
hindrance to leveraging them in mathematical problems. In this paper, we study
a fundamental question: whether language models understand numbers, which play
a basic element in mathematical problems. We assume that to solve mathematical
problems, language models should be capable of understanding numbers and
compressing these numbers in their hidden states. We construct a synthetic
dataset comprising addition problems and utilize linear probes to read out
input numbers from the hidden states of models. Experimental results
demonstrate evidence supporting the existence of compressed numbers in the
LLaMA-2 model family from early layers. However, the compression process seems
to be not lossless, presenting difficulty in precisely reconstructing the
original numbers. Further experiments show that language models can utilize the
encoded numbers to perform arithmetic computations, and the computational
ability scales up with the model size. Our preliminary research suggests that
language models exhibit a partial understanding of numbers, offering insights
into future investigations about the models' capability of solving mathematical
problems.

study, there is little discussion regarding the reproduction and replication of
external studies within one's own research. To initiate this discussion,
drawing lessons from our experience reproducing an operational product for
predicting tropical cyclogenesis, we present a two-dimensional framework to
offer guidance on reproduction and replication. Our framework, representing
model fitting on one axis and its use in inference on the other, builds upon
three key aspects: the dataset, the metrics, and the model itself. By assessing
the trajectories of our studies on this 2D plane, we can better inform the
claims made using our research. Additionally, we use this framework to
contextualize the utility of benchmark datasets in the atmospheric sciences.
Our two-dimensional framework provides a tool for researchers, especially early
career researchers, to incorporate prior work in their own research and to
inform the claims they can make in this context.

<p class="mathjax">This research addresses the complex challenge of automated repair of code
vulnerabilities, vital for enhancing digital security in an increasingly
technology-driven world. The study introduces a novel and efficient format for
the representation of code modification, using advanced Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as Code Llama and Mistral. These models, fine-tuned on datasets
featuring C code vulnerabilities, significantly improve the accuracy and
adaptability of automated code repair techniques. A key finding is the enhanced
repair accuracy of these models when compared to previous methods such as
VulRepair, which underscores their practical utility and efficiency. The
research also offers a critical assessment of current evaluation metrics, such
as perfect predictions, and their limitations in reflecting the true
capabilities of automated repair models in real-world scenarios. Following
this, it underscores the importance of using test datasets devoid of train
samples, emphasizing the need for dataset integrity to enhance the
effectiveness of LLMs in code repair tasks. The significance of this work is
its contribution to digital security, setting new standards for automated code
vulnerability repair and paving the way for future advancements in the fields
of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The study does not only highlight
the potential of LLMs in enhancing code security but also fosters further
exploration and research in these crucial areas.

activities, with hand-drawn versions facilitating real-time collaboration.
However, there's a growing need to digitize them for efficient processing.
Automated conversion methods are essential to overcome manual conversion
challenges. Existing sketch recognition methods face limitations in practical
situations, being field-specific and lacking digital conversion steps. Our
paper introduces the Flowmind2digital method and hdFlowmind dataset to address
these challenges. Flowmind2digital, utilizing neural networks and keypoint

<p class="mathjax">In Federated Recommendation (FedRec) systems, communication costs are a
critical bottleneck that arises from the need to transmit neural network models
between user devices and a central server. Prior approaches to these challenges
often lead to issues such as computational overheads, model specificity
constraints, and compatibility issues with secure aggregation protocols. In
response, we propose a novel framework, called Correlated Low-rank Structure
(CoLR), which leverages the concept of adjusting lightweight trainable
parameters while keeping most parameters frozen. Our approach substantially
reduces communication overheads without introducing additional computational
burdens. Critically, our framework remains fully compatible with secure
aggregation protocols, including the robust use of Homomorphic Encryption. Our
approach resulted in a reduction of up to 93.75% in payload size, with only an
approximate 8% decrease in recommendation performance across datasets. Code for
reproducing our experiments can be found at

<p class="mathjax">Aiming at the characteristics of the flying bird object in surveillance
video, such as the single frame image feature is not obvious, the size is small
in most cases, and asymmetric, this paper proposes a Flying Bird Object
Detection method for Surveillance Video (FBOD-SV). Firstly, a new feature
aggregation module, the Correlation Attention Feature Aggregation
(Co-Attention-FA) module, is designed to aggregate the features of the flying
bird object according to the bird object's correlation on multiple consecutive
frames of images. Secondly, a Flying Bird Object Detection Network (FBOD-Net)
with down-sampling and then up-sampling is designed, which uses a large feature
layer that fuses fine spatial information and large receptive field information
to detect special multi-scale (mostly small-scale) bird objects. Finally, the
SimOTA dynamic label allocation method is applied to One-Category object
detection, and the SimOTA-OC dynamic label strategy is proposed to solve the
difficult problem of label allocation caused by irregular flying bird objects.
In this paper, the algorithm's performance is verified by the experimental data
set of the surveillance video of the flying bird object of the traction
substation. The experimental results show that the surveillance video flying
bird object detection method proposed in this paper effectively improves the
detection performance of flying bird objects.

participants respond to changing sensory input. They promise simple and precise
measurement of time and inputs and offer interesting insights into human
behavior. However, several previous studies have discovered imprecisions in
timing appearing as delays, depending on the browser, software and programming
used for conducting such studies. Since the accuaracy of the collected data is
widely discussed, we aim to provide new results on the effect of unintended
delays on participants' behavior. For this purpose, a new reaction time study
was conducted. Computer delays were added to the experiment to investigate
their effects on participants' performance and repulsion. Minimal changes in
participants' behavior did occur and should be furtherly investigated, as the
power of this study was rather low and might not have uncovered all underlying
effects. The following report details our study design and results and offers

<p class="mathjax">Conventional distributed approaches to coverage control may suffer from lack
of convergence and poor performance, due to the fact that agents have limited
information, especially in non-convex discrete environments. To address this
issue, we extend the approach of [Marden 2016] which demonstrates how a limited
degree of inter-agent communication can be exploited to overcome such pitfalls
in one-dimensional discrete environments. The focus of this paper is on
extending such results to general dimensional settings. We show that the
extension is convergent and keeps the approximation ratio of 2, meaning that
any stable solution is guaranteed to have a performance within 50% of the
optimal one. We also show that the computational complexity and communication
complexity are both polynomial in the size of the problem. The experimental
results exhibit that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art
algorithms, and also that the runtime is scalable as per theory.

<p class="mathjax">Both space and ground communications have been proven effective solutions
under different perspectives in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper
investigates multiple-access scenarios, where plenty of IoT users are
cooperatively served by a satellite in space and access points (APs) on the
ground. Available users in each coherence interval are split into scheduled and
unscheduled subsets to optimize limited radio resources. We compute the uplink
ergodic throughput of each scheduled user under imperfect channel state
information (CSI) and non-orthogonal pilot signals. As maximum-radio combining
is deployed locally at the ground gateway and the APs, the uplink ergodic
throughput is obtained in a closed-form expression. The analytical results
explicitly unveil the effects of channel conditions and pilot contamination on
each scheduled user. By maximizing the sum throughput, the system can
simultaneously determine scheduled users and perform power allocation based on
either a model-based approach with alternating optimization or a learning-based
approach with the graph neural network. Numerical results manifest that
integrated satellite-terrestrial cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output systems can significantly improve the sum ergodic throughput
over coherence intervals. The integrated systems can schedule the vast majority
of users; some might be out of service due to the limited power budget.

<p class="mathjax">With the recent emergence of mixed precision hardware, there has been a
renewed interest in its use for solving numerical linear algebra problems fast
and accurately. The solution of least squares (LS) problems $\min_x\|b-Ax\|_2$,
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, arise in numerous application areas.
Overdetermined standard least squares problems can be solved by using mixed
precision within the iterative refinement method of Bj\"{o}rck, which
transforms the least squares problem into an $(m+n)\times(m+n)$ ''augmented''
system. It has recently been shown that mixed precision GMRES-based iterative
refinement can also be used, in an approach termed GMRES-LSIR. In practice, we
often encounter types of least squares problems beyond standard least squares,
including weighted least squares (WLS), $\min_x\|D^{1/2}(b-Ax)\|_2$, where
$D^{1/2}$ is a diagonal matrix of weights. In this paper, we discuss a mixed
precision FGMRES-WLSIR algorithm for solving WLS problems using two different
preconditioners.

<p class="mathjax">Individualized treatment recommendation is a crucial task in evidence-based
decision-making. In this study, we formulate this task as a fixed-budget best
arm identification (BAI) problem with contextual information. In this setting,
we consider an adaptive experiment given multiple treatment arms. At each
round, a decision-maker observes a context (covariate) that characterizes an
experimental unit and assigns the unit to one of the treatment arms. At the end
of the experiment, the decision-maker recommends a treatment arm estimated to
yield the highest expected outcome conditioned on a context (best treatment
arm). The effectiveness of this decision is measured in terms of the worst-case
expected simple regret (policy regret), which represents the largest difference
between the conditional expected outcomes of the best and recommended treatment
arms given a context. Our initial step is to derive asymptotic lower bounds for
the worst-case expected simple regret, which also implies ideal treatment
assignment rules. Following the lower bounds, we propose the Adaptive Sampling
(AS)-Policy Learning recommendation (PL) strategy. Under this strategy, we
randomly assign a treatment arm with a ratio of a target assignment ratio at
each round. At the end of the experiment, we train a policy, a function that
recommends a treatment arm given a context, by maximizing the counterfactual
empirical policy value. Our results show that the AS-PL strategy is
asymptotically minimax optimal, with its leading factor of expected simple
regret converging with our established worst-case lower bound. This research
has broad implications in various domains, and in light of existing literature,
our method can be perceived as an adaptive experimental design tailored for
policy learning, on-policy learning, or adaptive welfare maximization.

<p class="mathjax">AvatarStaging framework consists in directing avatars on a mixed theatrical
stage, enabling a co-presence between the materiality of the physical actor and
the virtuality of avatars controlled in real time by motion capture or specific
animation players. It led to the implementation of the AKN_Regie authoring
tool, programmed with the Blueprint visual language as a plugin for the Unreal
Engine (UE) video game engine. The paper describes AKN_Regie main
functionalities as a tool for non-programmer theatrical people. It gives
insights of its implementation in the Blueprint visual language specific to UE.
It details how the tool evolved along with its use in around ten theater
productions. A circulation process between a nonprogramming point of view on
AKN_Regie called Plugin Perspective and a programming acculturation to its
development called Blueprint Perspective is discussed. Finally, a C++
Perspective is suggested to enhance the cultural appropriation of technological
issues, bridging the gap between performing arts deeply involved in human
materiality and avatars inviting to discover new worlds.

<p class="mathjax">We study the Fr\'echet queries problem. It is a data structure problem, where
we are given a set $S$ of $n$ polygonal curves and a distance threshold $\rho$.
The data structure should support queries with a polygonal curve $q$ for the
elements of $S$, for which the continuous Fr\'echet distance to $q$ is at most
$\rho$. Afshani and Driemel in 2018 studied this problem for two-dimensional
polygonal curves and gave upper and lower bounds on the space-query time
tradeoff. We study the case that the ambient space of the curves is
one-dimensional and show an intimate connection to the well-studied rectangle
stabbing problem. Here, we are given a set of hyperrectangles as input and a
query with a point $q$ should return all input rectangles that contain this
point. Using known data structures for rectangle stabbing or orthogonal range
searching this directly leads to a data structure with $\mathcal{O}(n \log
^{t-1} n)$ storage and $\mathcal{O}(\log^{t-1} n+k)$ query time, where $k$
denotes the output size and $t$ can be chosen as the maximum number of vertices
of either (a) the stored curves or (b) the query curves. The resulting bounds
improve upon the bounds by Afshani and Driemel in both the storage and query
time. In addition, we show that known lower bounds for rectangle stabbing and
orthogonal range reporting with dimension parameter $d= \lfloor t/2 \rfloor$
can be applied to our problem via reduction. .

<p class="mathjax">Existing 3D-aware portrait synthesis methods can generate impressive
high-quality images while preserving strong 3D consistency. However, most of
them cannot support the fine-grained part-level control over synthesized
images. Conversely, some GAN-based 2D portrait synthesis methods can achieve
clear disentanglement of facial regions, but they cannot preserve view
consistency due to a lack of 3D modeling abilities. To address these issues, we
propose 3D-SSGAN, a novel framework for 3D-aware compositional portrait image
synthesis. First, a simple yet effective depth-guided 2D-to-3D lifting module
maps the generated 2D part features and semantics to 3D. Then, a volume
renderer with a novel 3D-aware semantic mask renderer is utilized to produce
the composed face features and corresponding masks. The whole framework is
trained end-to-end by discriminating between real and synthesized 2D images and
their semantic masks. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the
superiority of 3D-SSGAN in controllable part-level synthesis while preserving
3D view consistency.

<p class="mathjax">The convenience of 3D sensors has led to an increase in the use of 3D point
clouds in various applications. However, the differences in acquisition devices
or scenarios lead to divergence in the data distribution of point clouds, which
requires good generalization of point cloud representation learning methods.
While most previous methods rely on domain adaptation, which involves
fine-tuning pre-trained models on target domain data, this may not always be
feasible in real-world scenarios where target domain data may be unavailable.
To address this issue, we propose InvariantOODG, which learns invariability
between point clouds with different distributions using a two-branch network to
extract local-to-global features from original and augmented point clouds.
Specifically, to enhance local feature learning of point clouds, we define a
set of learnable anchor points that locate the most useful local regions and
two types of transformations to augment the input point clouds. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on 3D
domain generalization benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Given the nonlinearity of the interaction between weather and soil variables,
a novel deep neural network regressor (DNNR) was carefully designed with
considerations to the depth, number of neurons of the hidden layers, and the
hyperparameters with their optimizations. Additionally, a new metric, the
average of absolute root squared error (ARSE) was proposed to address the
shortcomings of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)
while combining their strengths. Using the ARSE metric, the random forest
regressor (RFR) and the extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGBR), were
compared with DNNR. The RFR and XGBR achieved yield errors of 0.0000294 t/ha,
and 0.000792 t/ha, respectively, compared to the DNNR(s) which achieved 0.0146
t/ha and 0.0209 t/ha, respectively. All errors were impressively small.
However, with changes to the explanatory variables to ensure generalizability
to unforeseen data, DNNR(s) performed best. The unforeseen data, different from
unseen data, is coined to represent sudden and unexplainable change to weather
and soil variables due to climate change. Further analysis reveals that a
strong interaction does exist between weather and soil variables. Using
precipitation and silt, which are strong-negatively and strong-positively
correlated with yield, respectively, yield was observed to increase when
precipitation was reduced and silt increased, and vice-versa.

challenge of identifying similarities within a wide range of crisis-related
information. To overcome this challenge, we employed an ontology-based crisis
situation knowledge base enriched with crisis-related information.
Additionally, we implemented a semantic similarity measure to assess the degree

on recognizing similar crises through the application of ontology-based
knowledge mining. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and

<p class="mathjax">The capabilities of monocular depth estimation (MDE) models are limited by
the availability of sufficient and diverse datasets. In the case of MDE models
for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the
captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline
to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training
datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and
robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call "NeRFmentation",
trains NeRFs on each scene in the dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on
relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured
from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in
conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular
autonomous driving dataset KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen
split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a
separate popular driving set, and our own synthetic test set.

<p class="mathjax">The machinery of industrial environments was connected to the Internet years
ago with the scope of increasing their performance. However, this made such
environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct
functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Lately, an increase of
cyberattacks to industrial environments has been experienced. Moreover,
implementing cryptosystems in the communications between OT devices is a more
challenging task than for IT environments since the OT are generally composed
of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities.
Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks
faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the
amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI)
refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and
economical development, e.g. electricity or water, and their communications are
a very exposed target to cyberattacks. Furthermore, a new threat to
cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers,
due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography
protocols, such as RSA or ECC. The chase of functional quantum computers has
resulted in a technological race involving many global agents. Those agents
have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum
secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of
fault-tolerance. In this sense, two main cryptographic solutions have been
proposed: QKD and PQC. Nevertheless, quantum secure solutions have been mainly
centered from the perspective of IT environments. In this paper, we provide a
perspective of the problem of applying PQC solutions to CI and analyze which
could be the most suitable cryptography schemes for these scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">To better understand the behavior of image classifiers, it is useful to
visualize the contribution of individual pixels to the model prediction. In
this study, we propose a method, MoXI~($\textbf{Mo}$del e$\textbf{X}$planation
by $\textbf{I}$nteractions), that efficiently and accurately identifies a group
of pixels with high prediction confidence. The proposed method employs
game-theoretic concepts, Shapley values and interactions, taking into account
the effects of individual pixels and the cooperative influence of pixels on
model confidence. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that our
method better identifies the pixels that are highly contributing to the model
outputs than widely-used visualization methods using Grad-CAM, Attention
rollout, and Shapley value. While prior studies have suffered from the
exponential computational cost in the computation of Shapley value and
interactions, we show that this can be reduced to linear cost for our task.

<p class="mathjax">Safety is an indispensable requirement for applying reinforcement learning
(RL) to real problems. Although there has been a surge of safe RL algorithms
proposed in recent years, most existing work typically 1) relies on receiving
numeric safety feedback; 2) does not guarantee safety during the learning
process; 3) limits the problem to a priori known, deterministic transition
dynamics; and/or 4) assume the existence of a known safe policy for any states.
Addressing the issues mentioned above, we thus propose Long-term Binaryfeedback
Safe RL (LoBiSaRL), a safe RL algorithm for constrained Markov decision
processes (CMDPs) with binary safety feedback and an unknown, stochastic state
transition function. LoBiSaRL optimizes a policy to maximize rewards while
guaranteeing a long-term safety that an agent executes only safe state-action
pairs throughout each episode with high probability. Specifically, LoBiSaRL
models the binary safety function via a generalized linear model (GLM) and
conservatively takes only a safe action at every time step while inferring its
effect on future safety under proper assumptions. Our theoretical results show
that LoBiSaRL guarantees the long-term safety constraint, with high
probability. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm is
safer than existing methods without significantly compromising performance in
terms of reward.

<p class="mathjax">Low-light image enhancement techniques have significantly progressed, but
unstable image quality recovery and unsatisfactory visual perception are still
significant challenges. To solve these problems, we propose a novel and robust
low-light image enhancement method via CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion,
abbreviated as CFWD. Specifically, we design a guided network with a multiscale
visual language in the frequency domain based on the wavelet transform to
achieve effective image enhancement iteratively. In addition, we combine the
advantages of Fourier transform in detail perception to construct a hybrid
frequency domain space with significant perceptual capabilities(HFDPM). This
operation guides wavelet diffusion to recover the fine-grained structure of the
image and avoid diversity confusion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and better reproduces images
similar to normal images. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We propose GNNInfer, the first automatic property inference technique for
GNNs. To tackle the challenge of varying input structures in GNNs, GNNInfer
first identifies a set of representative influential structures that contribute
significantly towards the prediction of a GNN. Using these structures, GNNInfer
converts each pair of an influential structure and the GNN to their equivalent
FNN and then leverages existing property inference techniques to effectively
capture properties of the GNN that are specific to the influential structures.
GNNINfer then generalizes the captured properties to any input graphs that
contain the influential structures. Finally, GNNInfer improves the correctness
of the inferred properties by building a model (either a decision tree or
linear regression) that estimates the deviation of GNN output from the inferred
properties given full input graphs. The learned model helps GNNInfer extend the
inferred properties with constraints to the input and output of the GNN,
obtaining stronger properties that hold on full input graphs.
<br />Our experiments show that GNNInfer is effective in inferring likely
properties of popular real-world GNNs, and more importantly, these inferred
properties help effectively defend against GNNs' backdoor attacks. In
particular, out of the 13 ground truth properties, GNNInfer re-discovered 8
correct properties and discovered likely correct properties that approximate
the remaining 5 ground truth properties. Using properties inferred by GNNInfer
to defend against the state-of-the-art backdoor attack technique on GNNs,
namely UGBA, experiments show that GNNInfer's defense success rate is up to 30
times better than existing baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring water contaminants is of paramount importance, ensuring public
health and environmental well-being. Turbidity, a key parameter, poses a
significant problem, affecting water quality. Its accurate assessment is
crucial for safeguarding ecosystems and human consumption, demanding meticulous
attention and action. For this, our study pioneers a novel approach to monitor
the Turbidity contaminant, integrating CatBoost Machine Learning (ML) with
high-resolution data from Sentinel-2 Level-2A. Traditional methods are
labor-intensive while CatBoost offers an efficient solution, excelling in
predictive accuracy. Leveraging atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 data
through the Google Earth Engine (GEE), our study contributes to scalable and
precise Turbidity monitoring. A specific tabular dataset derived from Hong Kong
contaminants monitoring stations enriches our study, providing region-specific
insights. Results showcase the viability of this integrated approach, laying
the foundation for adopting advanced techniques in global water quality
management.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic well-being coaches have been shown to successfully promote people's
mental well-being. To provide successful coaching, a robotic coach should have
the capability to repair the mistakes it makes. Past investigations of robot
mistakes are limited to game or task-based, one-off and in-lab studies. This
paper presents a 4-phase design process to design repair strategies for robotic
longitudinal well-being coaching with the involvement of real-world
stakeholders: 1) designing repair strategies with a professional well-being
coach; 2) a longitudinal study with the involvement of experienced users (i.e.,
who had already interacted with a robotic coach) to investigate the repair
strategies defined in (1); 3) a design workshop with users from the study in
(2) to gather their perspectives on the robotic coach's repair strategies; 4)
discussing the results obtained in (2) and (3) with the mental well-being
professional to reflect on how to design repair strategies for robotic
coaching. Our results show that users have different expectations for a robotic
coach than a human coach, which influences how repair strategies should be
designed. We show that different repair strategies (e.g., apologizing,
explaining, or repairing empathically) are appropriate in different scenarios,
and that preferences for repair strategies change during longitudinal
interactions with the robotic coach.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI and transfer learning fields have experienced remarkable
advancements in recent years especially in the domain of Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Transformers were at the heart of these advancements where
the cutting-edge transformer-based Language Models (LMs) enabled new
state-of-the-art results in a wide spectrum of applications. While the number
of research works involving neural LMs is exponentially increasing, their vast
majority are high-level and far from self-contained. Consequently, a deep
understanding of the literature in this area is a tough task especially at the
absence of a unified mathematical framework explaining the main types of neural
LMs. We address the aforementioned problem in this tutorial where the objective
is to explain neural LMs in a detailed, simplified and unambiguous mathematical
framework accompanied with clear graphical illustrations. Concrete examples on
widely used models like BERT and GPT2 are explored. Finally, since transformers
pretrained on language-modeling-like tasks have been widely adopted in computer
vision and time series applications, we briefly explore some examples of such
solutions in order to enable readers understand how transformers work in the
aforementioned domains and compare this use with the original one in NLP.

<p class="mathjax">We present a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) framework
under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the
uncertainty that arises from predicting future behaviors of moving obstacles,
which may exhibit multiple modes (for example, turning left or right). To
address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC
formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained
planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories
generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in
conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust
chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on
the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency
planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal
planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction
algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.

<p class="mathjax">High-quality imaging is crucial for ensuring safety supervision and
intelligent deployment in fields like transportation and industry. It enables
precise and detailed monitoring of operations, facilitating timely detection of
potential hazards and efficient management. However, adverse weather
conditions, such as atmospheric haziness and precipitation, can have a
significant impact on image quality. When the atmosphere contains dense haze or
water droplets, the incident light scatters, leading to degraded captured
images. This degradation is evident in the form of image blur and reduced
contrast, increasing the likelihood of incorrect assessments and
interpretations by intelligent imaging systems (IIS). To address the challenge
of restoring degraded images in hazy and rainy conditions, this paper proposes
a novel multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (termed MvKSR).
Specifically, guided filtering is performed on the degraded image to separate
high/low-frequency components. Subsequently, an en-decoder-based multi-view
feature coarse extraction module (MCE) is used to coarsely extract features
from different views of the degraded image. The multi-view feature fine fusion
module (MFF) will learn and infer the restoration of degraded images through
mixed supervision under different views. Additionally, we suggest an atrous
residual block to handle global restoration and local repair in
hazy/rainy/mixed scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MvKSR
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and stability
for restoring degraded scenarios in IIS.

<p class="mathjax">In this technical report, we present TeleChat, a collection of large language
models (LLMs) with parameters of 3 billion, 7 billion and 12 billion. It
includes pretrained language models as well as fine-tuned chat models that is
aligned with human preferences. TeleChat is initially pretrained on an
extensive corpus containing a diverse collection of texts from both English and
Chinese languages, including trillions of tokens. Subsequently, the model
undergoes fine-tuning to align with human preferences, following a detailed
methodology that we describe. We evaluate the performance of TeleChat on
various tasks, including language understanding, mathematics, reasoning, code
generation, and knowledge-based question answering. Our findings indicate that
TeleChat achieves comparable performance to other open-source models of similar
size across a wide range of public benchmarks. To support future research and
applications utilizing LLMs, we release the fine-tuned model checkpoints of
TeleChat's 7B and 12B variant, along with code and a portion of our pretraining
data, to the public community.

<p class="mathjax">Zinc electrolysis is one of the key processes in zinc smelting, and
maintaining stable operation of zinc electrolysis is an important factor in
ensuring production efficiency and product quality. However, poor contact
between the zinc electrolysis cathode and the anode is a common problem that
leads to reduced production efficiency and damage to the electrolysis cell.
Therefore, online monitoring of the contact status of the plates is crucial for
ensuring production quality and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
an end-to-end network, the Frequency-masked Multimodal Autoencoder (FM-AE).
This method takes the cell voltage signal and infrared image information as
input, and through automatic encoding, fuses the two features together and
predicts the poor contact status of the plates through a cascaded detector.
Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high accuracy
(86.2%) while having good robustness and generalization ability, effectively
detecting poor contact status of the zinc electrolysis cell, providing strong
support for production practice.

<p class="mathjax">The Learning With Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem asks to find $\mathbf{s}$
from an input of the form $(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b} =
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{e}) \in (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^{m \times n}
\times (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^{m}$, for a vector $\mathbf{e}$ that has
small-magnitude entries. In this work, we do not focus on solving
$\mathsf{LWE}$ but on the task of sampling instances. As these are extremely
sparse in their range, it may seem plausible that the only way to proceed is to
first create $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{e}$ and then set $\mathbf{b} =
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{e}$. In particular, such an instance sampler knows
the solution. This raises the question whether it is possible to obliviously
sample $(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{e})$, namely, without knowing
the underlying $\mathbf{s}$. A variant of the assumption that oblivious
$\mathsf{LWE}$ sampling is hard has been used in a series of works constructing
Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) in the standard model.
As the assumption is related to $\mathsf{LWE}$, these SNARKs have been
conjectured to be secure in the presence of quantum adversaries.
<br />Our main result is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples
well-distributed $\mathsf{LWE}$ instances while provably not knowing the
solution, under the assumption that $\mathsf{LWE}$ is hard. Moreover, the
approach works for a vast range of $\mathsf{LWE}$ parametrizations, including
those used in the above-mentioned SNARKs.

Decomposition (ACD), a structure used to define optimal transformations of
Muller into parity automata and to obtain theoretical results about the

this work, we study the complexity of computing the ACD and its DAG-version,

<p class="mathjax">The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)-compliant solutions lack crucial
details to perform effective control loops at multiple time scales. In this
vein, we propose ORANUS, an O-RAN-compliant mathematical framework to allocate
radio resources to multiple ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC)
services. In the near-RT control loop, ORANUS relies on a novel Stochastic
Network Calculus (SNC)-based model to compute the amount of guaranteed radio
resources for each uRLLC service. Unlike traditional approaches as queueing
theory, the SNC-based model allows ORANUS to ensure the probability the packet
transmission delay exceeds a budget, i.e., the violation probability, is below
a target tolerance. ORANUS also utilizes a RT control loop to monitor service
transmission queues, dynamically adjusting the guaranteed radio resources based
on detected traffic anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, ORANUS is the
first O-RAN-compliant solution which benefits from SNC to carry out near-RT and
RT control loops. Simulation results show that ORANUS significantly improves
over reference solutions, with an average violation probability 10x lower.

studying the surface of the loss function in order to better understand
training with methods based on gradient descent. This search for an appropriate
description, both analytical and topological, has led to numerous efforts to
identify spurious minima and characterize gradient dynamics. Our work aims to
contribute to this field by providing a topological measure to evaluate loss
complexity in the case of multilayer neural networks. We compare deep and
shallow architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions by deriving
upper and lower bounds on the complexity of their loss function and revealing
how that complexity is influenced by the number of hidden units, training
models, and the activation function used. Additionally, we found that certain
variations in the loss function or model architecture, such as adding an
$\ell_2$ regularization term or implementing skip connections in a feedforward
network, do not affect loss topology in specific cases.

<p class="mathjax">Gesture recognition is an indispensable component of natural and efficient
human-computer interaction technology, particularly in desktop-level
applications, where it can significantly enhance people's productivity.
However, the current gesture recognition community lacks a suitable
desktop-level (top-view perspective) dataset for lightweight gesture capture
devices. In this study, we have established a dataset named GR4DHCI. What
distinguishes this dataset is its inherent naturalness, intuitive
characteristics, and diversity. Its primary purpose is to serve as a valuable
resource for the development of desktop-level portable applications. GR4DHCI
comprises over 7,000 gesture samples and a total of 382,447 frames for both
Stereo IR and skeletal modalities. We also address the variances in hand
positioning during desktop interactions by incorporating 27 different hand
positions into the dataset. Building upon the GR4DHCI dataset, we conducted a
series of experimental studies, the results of which demonstrate that the
fine-grained classification blocks proposed in this paper can enhance the
model's recognition accuracy. Our dataset and experimental findings presented
in this paper are anticipated to propel advancements in desktop-level gesture
recognition research.

<p class="mathjax">Training and running deep neural networks (NNs) often demands a lot of
computation and energy-intensive specialized hardware (e.g. GPU, TPU...). One
way to reduce the computation and power cost is to use binary weight NNs, but
these are hard to train because the sign function has a non-smooth gradient. We
present a model based on Mathematical Morphology (MM), which can binarize
ConvNets without losing performance under certain conditions, but these
conditions may not be easy to satisfy in real-world scenarios. To solve this,
we propose two new approximation methods and develop a robust theoretical
framework for ConvNets binarization using MM. We propose as well regularization
losses to improve the optimization. We empirically show that our model can
learn a complex morphological network, and explore its performance on a
classification task.

<p class="mathjax">In Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification tasks such as topic
categorisation and sentiment analysis, model generalizability is generally
measured with standard metrics such as Accuracy, F-Measure, or AUC-ROC. The
diversity of metrics, and the arbitrariness of their application suggest that
there is no agreement within NLP on a single best metric to use. This lack
suggests there has not been sufficient examination of the underlying heuristics
which each metric encodes. To address this we compare several standard
classification metrics with more 'exotic' metrics and demonstrate that a
random-guess normalised Informedness metric is a parsimonious baseline for task
performance. To show how important the choice of metric is, we perform
extensive experiments on a wide range of NLP tasks including a synthetic
scenario, natural language understanding, question answering and machine
translation. Across these tasks we use a superset of metrics to rank models and
find that Informedness best captures the ideal model characteristics. Finally,
we release a Python implementation of Informedness following the SciKitLearn
classifier format.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile app reviews are a large-scale data source for software-related
knowledge generation activities, including software maintenance, evolution and
feedback analysis. Effective extraction of features (i.e., functionalities or
characteristics) from these reviews is key to support analysis on the
acceptance of these features, identification of relevant new feature requests
and prioritization of feature development, among others. Traditional methods
focus on syntactic pattern-based approaches, typically context-agnostic,
evaluated on a closed set of apps, difficult to replicate and limited to a
reduced set and domain of apps. Meanwhile, the pervasiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture in software engineering
tasks lays the groundwork for empirical evaluation of the performance of these
models to support feature extraction. In this study, we present T-FREX, a
Transformer-based, fully automatic approach for mobile app review feature
extraction. First, we collect a set of ground truth features from users in a
real crowdsourced software recommendation platform and transfer them
automatically into a dataset of app reviews. Then, we use this newly created
dataset to fine-tune multiple LLMs on a named entity recognition task under
different data configurations. We assess the performance of T-FREX with respect
to this ground truth, and we complement our analysis by comparing T-FREX with a
baseline method from the field. Finally, we assess the quality of new features
predicted by T-FREX through an external human evaluation. Results show that
T-FREX outperforms on average the traditional syntactic-based method,
especially when discovering new features from a domain for which the model has
been fine-tuned.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral imaging empowers computer vision systems with the distinct
capability of identifying materials through recording their spectral
signatures. Recent efforts in data-driven spectral reconstruction aim at
extracting spectral information from RGB images captured by cost-effective RGB
cameras, instead of dedicated hardware.
<br />In this paper we systematically analyze the performance of such methods,
evaluating both the practical limitations with respect to current datasets and
overfitting, as well as fundamental limits with respect to the nature of the
information encoded in the RGB images, and the dependency of this information
on the optical system of the camera.
<br />We find that the current models are not robust under slight variations, e.g.,
in noise level or compression of the RGB file. Both the methods and the
datasets are also limited in their ability to cope with metameric colors. This
issue can in part be overcome with metameric data augmentation. Moreover,
optical lens aberrations can help to improve the encoding of the metameric
information into the RGB image, which paves the road towards higher performing
spectral imaging and reconstruction approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we present WidthFormer, a novel transformer-based
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) 3D detection method tailored for real-time
autonomous-driving applications. WidthFormer is computationally efficient,
robust and does not require any special engineering effort to deploy. In this
work, we propose a novel 3D positional encoding mechanism capable of accurately
encapsulating 3D geometric information, which enables our model to generate
high-quality BEV representations with only a single transformer decoder layer.
This mechanism is also beneficial for existing sparse 3D object detectors.
Inspired by the recently-proposed works, we further improve our model's
efficiency by vertically compressing the image features when serving as
attention keys and values. We also introduce two modules to compensate for
potential information loss due to feature compression. Experimental evaluation
on the widely-used nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark demonstrates that our
method outperforms previous approaches across different 3D detection
architectures. More importantly, our model is highly efficient. For example,
when using $256\times 704$ input images, it achieves 1.5 ms latency on NVIDIA
3090 GPU. Furthermore, WidthFormer also exhibits strong robustness to different
degrees of camera perturbations. Our study offers valuable insights into the
deployment of BEV transformation methods in real-world, complex road

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies indicate that Vision Transformers (ViTs) are robust against
out-of-distribution scenarios. In particular, the Fully Attentional Network
(FAN) - a family of ViT backbones, has achieved state-of-the-art robustness. In
this paper, we revisit the FAN models and improve their pre-training with a
self-emerging token labeling (STL) framework. Our method contains a two-stage
training framework. Specifically, we first train a FAN token labeler (FAN-TL)
to generate semantically meaningful patch token labels, followed by a FAN
student model training stage that uses both the token labels and the original
class label. With the proposed STL framework, our best model based on
FAN-L-Hybrid (77.3M parameters) achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy and 42.1% mCE on
ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-C, and sets a new state-of-the-art for ImageNet-A
(46.1%) and ImageNet-R (56.6%) without using extra data, outperforming the
original FAN counterpart by significant margins. The proposed framework also
demonstrates significantly enhanced performance on downstream tasks such as
semantic segmentation, with up to 1.7% improvement in robustness over the
counterpart model. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/STL.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we raise a new issue on Unidentified Foreground Object (UFO)
detection in 3D point clouds, which is a crucial technology in autonomous
driving in the wild. UFO detection is challenging in that existing 3D object
detectors encounter extremely hard challenges in both 3D localization and
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. To tackle these challenges, we suggest a
new UFO detection framework including three tasks: evaluation protocol,
methodology, and benchmark. The evaluation includes a new approach to measure
the performance on our goal, i.e. both localization and OOD detection of UFOs.
The methodology includes practical techniques to enhance the performance of our
goal. The benchmark is composed of the KITTI Misc benchmark and our additional
synthetic benchmark for modeling a more diverse range of UFOs. The proposed
framework consistently enhances performance by a large margin across all four
baseline detectors: SECOND, PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and PartA2, giving insight
for future work on UFO detection in the wild.

<p class="mathjax">No one can dispute the disruptive impact of blockchain technology, which has
long been considered one of the major revolutions of contemporary times. Its
integration into the healthcare ecosystem has helped overcome numerous
difficulties and constraints faced by healthcare systems. This has been notably
demonstrated in the meticulous management of electronic health records (EHR)
and their access rights, as well as in its capabilities in terms of security,
scalability, flexibility, and interoperability with other systems. This article
undertakes the study and analysis of the most commonly adopted approaches in
healthcare data management systems using blockchain technology. An evaluation
is then conducted based on a set of observed common characteristics,
distinguishing one approach from the others. The results of this analysis
highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach, thus facilitating
the choice of the method best suited to the readers' specific case study.
Furthermore, for effective implementation in the context of e-health, we
emphasize the existence of crucial challenges, such as the incomplete
representation of major stakeholders in the blockchain network, the lack of
regulatory flexibility to ensure legal interoperability by country, and the
insufficient integration of an official regulatory authority ensuring
compliance with ethical and legal standards. To address these challenges, it is
necessary to establish close collaboration between regulators, technology
developers, and healthcare stakeholders.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, there has been a surge in the popularity of pre trained large
language models (LLMs) (such as GPT-4), sweeping across the entire Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) communities. These LLMs have
demonstrated advanced multi-modal understanding capabilities and showcased
strong performance across various benchmarks. The LLM has started to embody
traits of artificial general intelligence, which holds vital guidance for
enhancing brain-like characteristics within visual encoding models. Hence, This
paper proposes a new multi-modal training paradigm, aligning with LLM, for
encoding fMRI activity in visual cortex. Based on this paradigm, we trained an
encoding model in fMRI data named the LLM-Visual Encoding Model (LLM-VEM).
Specifically, we utilize LLM (miniGPT4) to generate descriptive text for all
stimulus images, forming a high-quality textual description set. Moreover, we
use the pre-trained text encoder (CLIP) to process these detailed descriptions,
obtaining the text embedding features. Next, we use the contrast loss function
to minimize the distance between the image embedding features and the text
embedding features to complete the alignment operation of the stimulus image
and text information. With the assistance of the pre-trained LLM, this
alignment process facilitates better learning of the visual encoding model,
resulting in higher precision. The final experimental results indicate that our
training paradigm has significantly aided in enhancing the performance of the
visual encoding model.

<p class="mathjax">The latest assessments of the emerging technologies for reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) have indicated the concept's significant potential
for localization and sensing, either as individual or simultaneously realized
tasks. However, in the vast majority of those studies, the RIS state (i.e., its
position and rotation angles) is required to be known a priori. In this paper,
we address the problem of the joint three-dimensional (3D) localization of a
hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user. The most cost- and power-efficient hybrid version
of an RIS is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency chain and
meta-atoms capable of simultaneous reconfigurable reflection and sensing. This
dual functionality is controlled by adjustable power splitters embedded at each
hybrid meta-atom. Focusing on a downlink scenario where a multi-antenna base
station transmits multicarrier signals to a user via an HRIS, we propose a
multistage approach to jointly estimate the metasurface's 3D position and 3D
rotation matrix (i.e., 6D parameter estimation) as well as the user's 3D
position. Our simulation results verify the validity of the proposed estimator
via extensive comparisons of the root-mean-square error of the state
estimations with the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRB), which is analytically
derived. Furthermore, it is showcased that there exists an optimal hybrid
reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) power splitting ratio for the desired
multi-parameter estimation problem. We also study the robustness of the
proposed method in the presence of scattering points in the wireless
propagation environment.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, AIGC image quality assessment (AIGCIQA), which aims to assess the
quality of AI-generated images from a human perception perspective, has emerged
as a new topic in computer vision. Unlike common image quality assessment tasks
where images are derived from original ones distorted by noise, blur, and
compression, in AIGCIQA tasks, images are typically generated by generative
models using text prompts. Considerable efforts have been made in the past
years to advance AIGCIQA. However, most existing AIGCIQA methods regress
predicted scores directly from individual generated images, overlooking the
information contained in the text prompts of these images. This oversight
partially limits the performance of these AIGCIQA methods. To address this
issue, we propose a text and image encoder-based regression (TIER) framework.
Specifically, we process the generated images and their corresponding text
prompts as inputs, utilizing a text encoder and an image encoder to extract
features from these text prompts and generated images, respectively. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TIER method, we conduct extensive
experiments on several mainstream AIGCIQA databases, including AGIQA-1K,
AGIQA-3K, and AIGCIQA2023. The experimental results indicate that our proposed
TIER method generally demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline in
most cases.

presents a large-scale human evaluation of HumanEval and MBPP, two widely used

<p class="mathjax">Singing voice separation and vocal pitch estimation are pivotal tasks in
music information retrieval. Existing methods for simultaneous extraction of
clean vocals and vocal pitches can be classified into two categories: pipeline
methods and naive joint learning methods. However, the efficacy of these
methods is limited by the following problems: On the one hand, pipeline methods
train models for each task independently, resulting a mismatch between the data
distributions at the training and testing time. On the other hand, naive joint
learning methods simply add the losses of both tasks, possibly leading to a
misalignment between the distinct objectives of each task. To solve these
problems, we propose a Deep Joint Cascade Model (DJCM) for singing voice
separation and vocal pitch estimation. DJCM employs a novel joint cascade model
structure to concurrently train both tasks. Moreover, task-specific weights are
used to align different objectives of both tasks. Experimental results show
that DJCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, with great
improvements of 0.45 in terms of Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) for singing
voice separation and 2.86% in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) for vocal pitch
estimation. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness
of each design of our proposed model. The code of DJCM is available at
https://github.com/Dream-High/DJCM .

<p class="mathjax">Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) techniques deal with the problem of
deducing a reward function that explains the behavior of an expert agent who is
assumed to act optimally in an underlying unknown task. In several problems of
interest, however, it is possible to observe the behavior of multiple experts
with different degree of optimality (e.g., racing drivers whose skills ranges
from amateurs to professionals). For this reason, in this work, we extend the
IRL formulation to problems where, in addition to demonstrations from the
optimal agent, we can observe the behavior of multiple sub-optimal experts.
Given this problem, we first study the theoretical properties of the class of
reward functions that are compatible with a given set of experts, i.e., the
feasible reward set. Our results show that the presence of multiple sub-optimal
experts can significantly shrink the set of compatible rewards. Furthermore, we
study the statistical complexity of estimating the feasible reward set with a
generative model. To this end, we analyze a uniform sampling algorithm that
results in being minimax optimal whenever the sub-optimal experts' performance
level is sufficiently close to the one of the optimal agent.

<p class="mathjax">Congestion games offer a primary model in the study of pure Nash equilibria
in non-cooperative games, and a number of generalized models have been proposed
in the literature. One line of generalization includes weighted congestion
games, in which the cost of a resource is a function of the total weight of the
players choosing that resource. Another line includes congestion games with
mixed costs, in which the cost imposed on a player is a convex combination of
the total cost and the maximum cost of the resources in her strategy. This
model is further generalized to that of congestion games with
complementarities. For the above models, the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium is proved under some assumptions, including that the strategy space
of each player is the base family of a matroid and that the cost functions have
a certain kind of monotonicity. In this paper, we deal with common
generalizations of these two lines, namely weighted matroid congestion games
with complementarities, and its further generalization. Our main technical
contribution is a proof of the existence of pure Nash equilibria in these
generalized models under a simplified assumption on the monotonicity, which
provide a common extension of the previous results. We also present some
extensions on the existence of pure Nash equilibria in player-specific and
weighted matroid congestion games with mixed costs.

<p class="mathjax">The Domain Name System (DNS) comprises name servers translating domain names
into, commonly, IP addresses. Authoritative name servers hosts the resource
records (RR) for certain zones, and resolver name servers are responsible for
querying and answering DNS queries on behalf of their clients. Unfortunately,
cybercriminals often use DNS for malicious purposes, such as phishing, malware
distribution, and botnet communication. To combat these threats, filtering
resolvers have become increasingly popular, employing various techniques to
identify and block malicious requests. In this paper, we survey several
techniques to implement and enhance the capabilities of filtering resolvers
including response policy zones, threat intelligence feeds, and detection of
algorithmically generated domains. We identify the current trends of each area
and find missing intersections in the literature, which could be used to
improve the effectiveness of filtering resolvers. In addition, we propose
future work designing a framework for filtering resolvers using
state-of-the-art approaches identified in this study.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting the trend of stock prices is an enduring topic at the
intersection of finance and computer science. Incremental updates to
forecasters have proven effective in alleviating the impacts of concept drift
arising from non-stationary stock markets. However, there is a need for
refinement in the incremental learning of stock trends, as existing methods
disregard recurring patterns. To address this issue, we propose meta-learning
with dynamic adaptation (MetaDA) for the incremental learning of stock trends,
which performs dynamic model adaptation considering both the recurring and
emerging patterns. We initially organize the stock trend forecasting into
meta-learning tasks and train a forecasting model following meta-learning
protocols. During model adaptation, MetaDA adapts the forecasting model with
the latest data and a selected portion of historical data, which is dynamically
identified by a task inference module. The task inference module first extracts
task-level embeddings from the historical tasks, and then identifies the
informative data with a task inference network. MetaDA has been evaluated on
real-world stock datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
satisfactory efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have made a significant impact
on various domains. However, LLMs' efficiency suffers from both heavy
computation and memory overheads. Compression techniques like sparsification
and quantization are commonly used to mitigate the gap between LLM's
computation/memory overheads and hardware capacity. However, existing GPU and
transformer-based accelerators cannot efficiently process compressed LLMs, due
to the following unresolved challenges: low computational efficiency,
underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads.
<br />This paper proposes FlightLLM, enabling efficient LLMs inference with a
complete mapping flow on FPGAs. In FlightLLM, we highlight an innovative
solution that the computation and memory overhead of LLMs can be solved by
utilizing FPGA-specific resources (e.g., DSP48 and heterogeneous memory
hierarchy). We propose a configurable sparse DSP chain to support different
sparsity patterns with high computation efficiency. Second, we propose an
always-on-chip decode scheme to boost memory bandwidth with mixed-precision
support. Finally, to make FlightLLM available for real-world LLMs, we propose a
length adaptive compilation method to reduce the compilation overhead.
Implemented on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, FlightLLM achieves 6.0$\times$
higher energy efficiency and 1.8$\times$ better cost efficiency against
commercial GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100S) on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2-7B) using
vLLM and SmoothQuant under the batch size of one. FlightLLM beats NVIDIA A100
GPU with 1.2$\times$ higher throughput using the latest Versal VHK158 FPGA.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer has been popular in recent crowd counting work since it breaks
the limited receptive field of traditional CNNs. However, since crowd images
always contain a large number of similar patches, the self-attention mechanism
in Transformer tends to find a homogenized solution where the attention maps of
almost all patches are identical. In this paper, we address this problem by
proposing Gramformer: a graph-modulated transformer to enhance the network by
adjusting the attention and input node features respectively on the basis of
two different types of graphs. Firstly, an attention graph is proposed to
diverse attention maps to attend to complementary information. The graph is
building upon the dissimilarities between patches, modulating the attention in
an anti-similarity fashion. Secondly, a feature-based centrality encoding is
proposed to discover the centrality positions or importance of nodes. We encode
them with a proposed centrality indices scheme to modulate the node features
and similarity relationships. Extensive experiments on four challenging crowd
counting datasets have validated the competitiveness of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Performance of modern trackers degrades substantially on transparent objects
compared to opaque objects. This is largely due to two distinct reasons.
Transparent objects are unique in that their appearance is directly affected by
the background. Furthermore, transparent object scenes often contain many
visually similar objects (distractors), which often lead to tracking failure.
However, development of modern tracking architectures requires large training
sets, which do not exist in transparent object tracking. We present two
contributions addressing the aforementioned issues. We propose the first
transparent object tracking training dataset Trans2k that consists of over 2k
sequences with 104,343 images overall, annotated by bounding boxes and
segmentation masks. Standard trackers trained on this dataset consistently
improve by up to 16%. Our second contribution is a new distractor-aware
transparent object tracker (DiTra) that treats localization accuracy and target
identification as separate tasks and implements them by a novel architecture.
DiTra sets a new state-of-the-art in transparent object tracking and
generalizes well to opaque objects.

<p class="mathjax">Extensive research is underway to meet the hyper-connectivity demands of 6G
networks, driven by applications like XR/VR and holographic communications,
which generate substantial data requiring network-based processing,
transmission, and analysis. However, adhering to diverse data privacy and
security policies in the anticipated multi-domain, multi-tenancy scenarios of
6G presents a significant challenge. Federated Analytics (FA) emerges as a
promising distributed computing paradigm, enabling collaborative data value
generation while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. FA
applies big data principles to manage and secure distributed heterogeneous
networks, improving performance, reliability, visibility, and security without
compromising data confidentiality. This paper provides a comprehensive overview
of potential FA applications, domains, and types in 6G networks, elucidating
analysis methods, techniques, and queries. It explores complementary approaches
to enhance privacy and security in 6G networks alongside FA and discusses the
challenges and prerequisites for successful FA implementation. Additionally,
distinctions between FA and Federated Learning are drawn, highlighting their
synergistic potential through a network orchestration scenario.

<p class="mathjax">Many real world optimization problems are formulated as mixed-variable
optimization problems (MVOPs) which involve both continuous and discrete
variables. MVOPs including dimensional variables are characterized by a
variable-size search space. Depending on the values of dimensional variables,
the number and type of the variables of the problem can vary dynamically. MVOPs
and variable-size MVOPs (VMVOPs) are difficult to solve and raise a number of
scientific challenges in the design of metaheuristics. Standard metaheuristics
have been first designed to address continuous or discrete optimization
problems, and are not able to tackle (V)MVOPs in an efficient way. The
development of metaheuristics for solving such problems has attracted the
attention of many researchers and is increasingly popular. However, to our
knowledge there is no well established taxonomy and comprehensive survey for
handling this important family of optimization problems.
<br />This paper presents a unified taxonomy for metaheuristic solutions for
solving (V)MVOPs in an attempt to provide a common terminology and
classification mechanisms. It provides a general mathematical formulation and
concepts of (V)MVOPs, and identifies the various solving methodologies than can
be applied in metaheuristics. The advantages, the weaknesses and the
limitations of the presented methodologies are discussed. The proposed taxonomy
also allows to identify some open research issues which needs further in-depth
investigations.

<p class="mathjax">Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems leverage vast amounts of
behavioral user data, which poses severe privacy risks. Thus, often, random
noise is added to the data to ensure Differential Privacy (DP). However, to
date, it is not well understood, in which ways this impacts personalized
recommendations. In this work, we study how DP impacts recommendation accuracy
and popularity bias, when applied to the training data of state-of-the-art
recommendation models. Our findings are three-fold: First, we find that nearly
all users' recommendations change when DP is applied. Second, recommendation
accuracy drops substantially while recommended item popularity experiences a
sharp increase, suggesting that popularity bias worsens. Third, we find that DP
exacerbates popularity bias more severely for users who prefer unpopular items
than for users that prefer popular items.

<p class="mathjax">Facing economic challenges due to the diverse objectives of businesses, and
consumers, commercial greenhouses strive to minimize energy costs while
addressing CO2 emissions. This scenario is intensified by rising energy costs
and the global imperative to curtail CO2 emissions. To address these dynamic
economic challenges, this paper proposes an architectural design for an energy
economic dispatch testbed for commercial greenhouses. Utilizing the
Attribute-Driven De-sign method, core architectural components of a
software-in-the-loop testbed are proposed which emphasizes modularity and
careful consideration of the multi-objective optimization problem. This
approach extends prior research by implementing a modular multi-objective
optimization framework in Java. The results demonstrate the successful
integration of the CO2 reduction objective within the modular architecture with
minimal effort. The multi-objective optimization output can also be employed to
examine cost and CO2 objectives, ultimately serving as a valuable
decision-support tool. The novel testbed architecture and a modular approach
can tackle the multi-objective optimization problem and enable commercial
greenhouses to navigate the intricate landscape of energy cost and CO2
emissions management.

<p class="mathjax">3D Gaussian splatting (3D GS) has recently emerged as a transformative
technique in the explicit radiance field and computer graphics landscape. This
innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of 3D
Gaussians, represents a significant departure from the neural radiance field
(NeRF) methodologies, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models
to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene
representations and differentiable rendering algorithms, not only promises
real-time rendering capabilities but also introduces unprecedented levels of
control and editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for
the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present
paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and
critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed
exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the
advent of 3D GS, setting the stage for understanding its significance. A focal
point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By
facilitating real-time performance, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications,
ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is
complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated
across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical
utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting
potential avenues for future research in this domain. Through this survey, we
aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers,
fostering further exploration and advancement in applicable and explicit
radiance field representation.

<p class="mathjax">Recently it has been shown that tensor networks (TNs) have the ability to
represent the expected return of a single-agent finite Markov decision process
(FMDP). The TN represents a distribution model, where all possible trajectories
are considered. When extending these ideas to a multi-agent setting,
distribution models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the exponential
relation between the number of possible trajectories and the number of agents.
The key advantage of using TNs in this setting is that there exists a large
number of established optimisation and decomposition techniques that are
specific to TNs, that one can apply to ensure the most efficient representation
is found. In this report, these methods are used to form a TN that represents
the expected return of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) task. This
model is then applied to a 2 agent random walker example, where it was shown
that the policy is correctly optimised using a DMRG technique. Finally, I
demonstrate the use of an exact decomposition technique, reducing the number of
elements in the tensors by 97.5%, without experiencing any loss of information.

article provides a contemporary overview of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO networks, and
addresses important unresolved questions on their future deployment. We first
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research on CF-MMIMO and
ultra-dense networks. Then, we discuss the key challenges of CF-MMIMO under
ultra-dense scenarios such as low-complexity architecture and processing,
low-complexity/scalable resource allocation, fronthaul limitation, massive
access, synchronization, and channel acquisition. Finally, we answer key open
questions, considering different design comparisons and discussing suitable
methods dealing with the key challenges of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO. The discussion
aims to provide a valuable roadmap for interesting future research directions
in this area, facilitating the development of CF-MMIMO MIMO for 6G.

<p class="mathjax">Recently we have witnessed the rapid development of video question answering
models. However, most models can only handle simple videos in terms of temporal
reasoning, and their performance tends to drop when answering
temporal-reasoning questions on long and informative videos. To tackle this
problem we propose STAIR, a Spatial-Temporal Reasoning model with Auditable
Intermediate Results for video question answering. STAIR is a neural module
network, which contains a program generator to decompose a given question into
a hierarchical combination of several sub-tasks, and a set of lightweight
neural modules to complete each of these sub-tasks. Though neural module
networks are already widely studied on image-text tasks, applying them to
videos is a non-trivial task, as reasoning on videos requires different
abilities. In this paper, we define a set of basic video-text sub-tasks for
video question answering and design a set of lightweight modules to complete
them. Different from most prior works, modules of STAIR return intermediate
outputs specific to their intentions instead of always returning attention
maps, which makes it easier to interpret and collaborate with pre-trained
models. We also introduce intermediate supervision to make these intermediate
outputs more accurate. We conduct extensive experiments on several video
question answering datasets under various settings to show STAIR's performance,
explainability, compatibility with pre-trained models, and applicability when
program annotations are not available. Code:

<p class="mathjax">Torch relay is an important tradition of the Olympics and heralds the start
of the Games. Robots applied in the torch relay activity can not only
demonstrate the technological capability of humans to the world but also
provide a sight of human lives with robots in the future. This article presents
an aerial manipulator designed for the robot-to-robot torch relay task of the
Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. This aerial manipulator system is composed of a
quadrotor, a 3 DoF (Degree of Freedom) manipulator, and a monocular camera.
This article primarily describes the system design and system control scheme of
the aerial manipulator. The experimental results demonstrate that it can
complete robot-to-robot torch relay task under the guidance of vision in the
ice and snow field.

<p class="mathjax">Time-optimal control of a multi-rotor remains an open problem due to the
under-actuation and nonlinearity of its dynamics, which make it difficult to
solve this problem directly. In this paper, the time-optimal control problem of
the multi-rotor is studied. Firstly, a thrust limit optimal decomposition
method is proposed, which can reasonably decompose the limited thrust into
three directions according to the current state and the target state. As a
result, the thrust limit constraint is decomposed as a linear constraint. With
the linear constraint and decoupled dynamics, a time-optimal guidance
trajectory can be obtained. Then, a cost function is defined based on the
time-optimal guidance trajectory, which has a quadratic form and can be used to
evaluate the time-optimal performance of the system outputs. Finally, based on
the cost function, the time-optimal control problem is reformulated as an MPC
(Model Predictive Control) problem. The experimental results demonstrate the
feasibility and validity of the proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">Typically available dialogue frameworks have adopted a semantic
representation based on dialogue-acts and slot-value pairs. Despite its
simplicity, this representation has disadvantages such as the lack of
expressivity, scalability and explainability. We present WEBDial: a dialogue
framework that relies on a graph formalism by using RDF triples instead of
slot-value pairs. We describe its overall architecture and the graph-based
semantic representation. We show its applicability from simple to complex
applications, by varying the complexity of domains and tasks: from single
domain and tasks to multiple domains and complex tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal 3D object detectors are dedicated to exploring secure and
reliable perception systems for autonomous driving (AD). However, while
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on clean benchmark datasets, they
tend to overlook the complexity and harsh conditions of real-world
environments. Meanwhile, with the emergence of visual foundation models (VFMs),
opportunities and challenges are presented for improving the robustness and
generalization of multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving.
Therefore, we propose RoboFusion, a robust framework that leverages VFMs like
SAM to tackle out-of-distribution (OOD) noise scenarios. We first adapt the
original SAM for autonomous driving scenarios named SAM-AD. To align SAM or
SAM-AD with multi-modal methods, we then introduce AD-FPN for upsampling the
image features extracted by SAM. We employ wavelet decomposition to denoise the
depth-guided images for further noise reduction and weather interference.
Lastly, we employ self-attention mechanisms to adaptively reweight the fused
features, enhancing informative features while suppressing excess noise. In
summary, our RoboFusion gradually reduces noise by leveraging the
generalization and robustness of VFMs, thereby enhancing the resilience of
multi-modal 3D object detection. Consequently, our RoboFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance in noisy scenarios, as demonstrated by the KITTI-C
and nuScenes-C benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable proficiency in a
broad spectrum of language-based tasks, some of which are traditionally
associated with hallmarks of human intelligence. This has prompted ongoing
disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of
linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep
philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of
artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article -- the first part
of two companion papers -- serves both as a primer on language models for
philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to
classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence,
and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language
acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission
of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges
several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we
also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better
understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion
paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner
workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their
latest developments.

<p class="mathjax">Distance measures between graphs are important primitives for a variety of
learning tasks. In this work, we describe an unsupervised, optimal transport
based approach to define a distance between graphs. Our idea is to derive
representations of graphs as Gaussian mixture models, fitted to distributions
of sampled node embeddings over the same space. The Wasserstein distance
between these Gaussian mixture distributions then yields an interpretable and
easily computable distance measure, which can further be tailored for the
comparison at hand by choosing appropriate embeddings. We propose two
embeddings for this framework and show that under certain assumptions about the
shape of the resulting Gaussian mixture components, further computational
improvements of this Wasserstein distance can be achieved. An empirical
validation of our findings on synthetic data and real-world Functional Brain
Connectivity networks shows promising performance compared to existing
embedding methods.

<p class="mathjax">Three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation using a monocular camera has
gained increasing attention due to its ease of implementation and the abundance
of data available from daily life. However, owing to the inherent depth
ambiguity in images, the accuracy of existing monocular camera-based 3D pose
estimation methods remains unsatisfactory, and the estimated 3D poses usually
include much noise. By observing the histogram of this noise, we find each
dimension of the noise follows a certain distribution, which indicates the
possibility for a neural network to learn the mapping between noisy poses and
ground truth poses. In this work, in order to obtain more accurate 3D poses, a
Diffusion-based 3D Pose Refiner (D3PRefiner) is proposed to refine the output
of any existing 3D pose estimator. We first introduce a conditional
multivariate Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of noisy 3D poses,
using paired 2D poses and noisy 3D poses as conditions to achieve greater
accuracy. Additionally, we leverage the architecture of current diffusion
models to convert the distribution of noisy 3D poses into ground truth 3D
poses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two
state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence 3D pose estimators are used as basic 3D
pose estimation models, and the proposed method is evaluated on different types
of 2D poses and different lengths of the input sequence. Experimental results
demonstrate the proposed architecture can significantly improve the performance
of current sequence-to-sequence 3D pose estimators, with a reduction of at
least 10.3% in the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) and at least 11.0% in
the Procrustes MPJPE (P-MPJPE).

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a fully algebraic two-level additive Schwarz
preconditioner for general sparse large-scale matrices. The preconditioner is
analyzed for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. For those matrices,
the coarse space is constructed based on approximating two local subspaces in
each subdomain. These subspaces are obtained by approximating a number of
eigenvectors corresponding to dominant eigenvalues of two judiciously posed
generalized eigenvalue problems. The number of eigenvectors can be chosen to
control the condition number. For general sparse matrices, the coarse space is
constructed by approximating the image of a local operator that can be defined
from information in the coefficient matrix. The connection between the coarse
spaces for SPD and general matrices is also discussed. Numerical experiments
show the great effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners on matrices
arising from a wide range of applications. The set of matrices includes SPD,
symmetric indefinite, nonsymmetric, and saddle-point matrices. In addition, we
compare the proposed preconditioners to the state-of-the-art domain
decomposition preconditioners.

<p class="mathjax">In the Exact Matching problem, we are given a graph whose edges are colored
red or blue and the task is to decide for a given integer k, if there is a
perfect matching with exactly k red edges. Since 1987 it is known that the
Exact Matching Problem can be solved in randomized polynomial time. Despite
numerous efforts, it is still not known today whether a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm exists as well. In this paper, we make substantial
progress by solving the problem for a multitude of different classes of dense
graphs. We solve the Exact Matching problem in deterministic polynomial time
for complete r-partite graphs, for unit interval graphs, for bipartite unit
interval graphs, for graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity, for chain
graphs, and for graphs without a complete bipartite t-hole. We solve the
problem in quasi-polynomial time for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs G(n, 1/2).
We also reprove an earlier result for bounded independence number/bipartite
independence number. We use two main tools to obtain these results: A local
search algorithm as well as a generalization of an earlier result by Karzanov.

Rastro-DM (Trail Data Mining), with a focus not on the model that is generated,
but on the processes behind its construction, in order to leave a trail (Rastro

methodologies of DM, such as CRISP-DM, which establish a methodological and
paradigmatic framework for the DM process. The application of best practices
and their benefits is illustrated in a project called 'Cladop' that was created
for the classification of PDF documents associated with the investigative

a framework for surface flux estimation with drones. Our approach uses data

reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the drone's sampling strategy. Herein,
we demonstrate that a RL-trained drone can quantify a CO2 hotspot more
accurately than a drone sampling along a predefined flight path that traverses
the emission plume. We find that information-based reward functions can match
the performance of an error-based reward function that quantifies the
difference between the estimated surface flux and the true value. Reward
functions based on information gain and information entropy can motivate
actions that increase the drone's confidence in its updated belief, without
requiring knowledge of the true surface flux. These findings provide valuable
insights for further development of the framework for the mapping of more
complex surface flux fields.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we propose a novel approach aimed at recovering the 3D position
of an UUV from UAV imagery in shallow-water environments. Through combination
of UAV and UUV measurements, we show that our method can be utilized as an
accurate and cost-effective alternative when compared to acoustic sensing
methods, typically required to obtain ground truth information in underwater
localization problems. Furthermore, our approach allows for a seamless
conversion to geo-referenced coordinates which can be utilized for navigation
purposes. To validate our method, we present the results with data collected
through a simulation environment and field experiments, demonstrating the
ability to successfully recover the UUV position with sub-meter accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Quantitative measurement of crystals in high-resolution images allows for
important insights into underlying material characteristics. Deep learning has
shown great progress in vision-based automatic crystal size measurement, but
current instance segmentation methods reach their limits with images that have
large variation in crystal size or hard to detect crystal boundaries. Even
small image segmentation errors, such as incorrectly fused or separated
segments, can significantly lower the accuracy of the measured results. Instead
of improving the existing pixel-wise boundary segmentation methods, we propose
to use an instance-based segmentation method, which gives more robust
segmentation results to improve measurement accuracy. Our novel method enhances
flow maps with a size-aware multi-scale attention module. The attention module
adaptively fuses information from multiple scales and focuses on the most
relevant scale for each segmented image area. We demonstrate that our proposed
attention fusion strategy outperforms state-of-the-art instance and boundary
segmentation methods, as well as simple average fusion of multi-scale
predictions. We evaluate our method on a refractory raw material dataset of
high-resolution images with large variation in crystal size and show that our
model can be used to calculate the crystal size more accurately than existing
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Individuals with tetraplegia and similar forms of paralysis suffer physically
and emotionally due to a lack of autonomy. To help regain part of this
autonomy, assistive robotic arms have been shown to increase living
independence. However, users with paralysis pose unique challenging conditions
for the control of these devices. In this article, we present the use of
Diegetic Graphical User Interfaces, a novel, intuitive, and computationally
inexpensive approach for gaze-controlled interfaces applied to robots. By using
symbols paired with fiducial markers, interactive buttons can be defined in the
real world which the user can trigger via gaze, and which can be embedded
easily into the environment. We apply this system to pilot a
3-degree-of-freedom robotic arm for precision pick-and-place tasks. The
interface is placed directly on the robot to allow intuitive and direct
interaction, eliminating the need for context-switching between external
screens, menus, and the robot. After calibration and a brief habituation
period, twenty-one participants from multiple backgrounds, ages and eye-sight
conditions completed the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Block Pick and Place Protocol
to benchmark the system, achieving a mean score of 13.71 out of the maximum
16.00 points. Good usability and user experience were reported (System
Usability Score of 75.36) while achieving a low task workload measure (NASA-TLX
of 44.76). Results show that users can employ multiple interface elements to
perform actions with minimal practice and with a small cognitive load. To our
knowledge, this is the first easily reconfigurable screenless system that
enables robot control entirely via gaze for Cartesian robot control without the
need for eye or face gestures.

<p class="mathjax">Human communication is a complex and diverse process that not only involves
multiple factors such as language, commonsense, and cultural backgrounds but
also requires the participation of multimodal information, such as speech.
Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated
promising performance in simulating human society. Can we leverage LLM-based
multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? However, current LLM-based
multi-agent systems mainly rely on text as the primary medium. In this paper,
we propose SpeechAgents, a multi-modal LLM based multi-agent system designed
for simulating human communication. SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLM as
the control center for individual agent and employes multi-modal signals as the
medium for exchanged messages among agents. Additionally, we propose
Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without
compromising general abilities. To strengthen and evaluate the effectiveness of
human communication simulation, we build the Human-Communication Simulation
Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SpeechAgents can simulate
human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and
rich emotions and demonstrate excellent scalability even with up to 25 agents,
which can apply to tasks such as drama creation and audio novels generation.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to high-quality
Machine-Generated Text (MGT), giving rise to countless new use cases and
applications. However, easy access to LLMs is posing new challenges due to
misuse. To address malicious usage, researchers have released datasets to
effectively train models on MGT-related tasks. Similar strategies are used to
compile these datasets, but no tool currently unifies them. In this scenario,
we introduce TextMachina, a modular and extensible Python framework, designed
to aid in the creation of high-quality, unbiased datasets to build robust
models for MGT-related tasks such as detection, attribution, or boundary
detection. It provides a user-friendly pipeline that abstracts away the
inherent intricacies of building MGT datasets, such as LLM integrations, prompt
templating, and bias mitigation. The quality of the datasets generated by
TextMachina has been assessed in previous works, including shared tasks where
more than one hundred teams trained robust MGT detectors.

crucial across various domains, including environmental monitoring and
greenhouse gas emission analysis. This study investigates two drone sampling
strategies for inferring source term parameters of gas plumes from atmospheric
measurements. Both strategies are guided by the goal of maximizing information
gain attained from observations at sequential locations. Our research compares
the myopic approach of infotaxis to a far-sighted navigation strategy trained
through deep reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the superior performance of
deep reinforcement learning over infotaxis in environments with non-isotropic

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we are concerned about the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs)
based on vector-kinetic models for hyperbolic partial differential equations.
In addition to usual lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) derived by explicit
discretisation of vector-kinetic equation (VKE), we also consider LBE derived
by semi-implicit discretisation of VKE and compare the relaxation factors of
both. We study the properties such as H-inequality, total variation boundedness
and positivity of both the LBEs, and infer that the LBE due to semi-implicit
discretisation naturally satisfies all the properties while the LBE due to
explicit discretisation requires more restrictive condition on relaxation
factor compared to the usual condition obtained from Chapman-Enskog expansion.
We also derive the macroscopic finite difference form of the LBEs, and utilise
it to establish the consistency of LBEs with the hyperbolic system. Further, we
extend this LBM framework to hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms,
such that there is no spurious numerical convection due to imbalance between
convection and source terms. We also present a D$2$Q$9$ model that allows
upwinding even along diagonal directions in addition to the usual upwinding
along coordinate directions. The different aspects of the results are validated
numerically on standard benchmark problems.

<p class="mathjax">Large Pretrained models for Zero/Few-shot learning excel in language and
vision domains but encounter challenges in multivariate time series (TS) due to
the diverse nature and scarcity of publicly available pretraining data.
Consequently, there has been a recent surge in utilizing pretrained large
language models (LLMs) with various adaptations for time series forecasting.
These approaches employ cross-domain transfer learning, yielding highly
impressive results. However, these models are typically very large ($\sim$
billion parameters), exhibit slow execution, and do not consider cross-channel
correlations. To address this, we present Multi-level Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a
significantly smaller model based on the lightweight TSMixer architecture. TTM
marks the first success in developing tiny pretrained models ($\le$1 million
parameters), exclusively trained on public TS data with effective transfer
learning capabilities. To tackle the complexity of pretraining on multiple
datasets with varied temporal resolutions, we introduce several novel
enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling,
and resolution prefix tuning. Moreover, we employ a multi-level modeling
strategy to effectively model channel correlations and incorporate exogenous
signals during finetuning, a crucial capability lacking in existing benchmarks.
TTM excels in few/zero-shot forecasting, demonstrating significant accuracy
gains (12-38%) over existing benchmarks. Further, it achieves a remarkable
14-106X reduction in model parameters, enabling 54-65X faster
training/inference as compared to the LLM-TS benchmarks. In fact, TTM's
zero-shot results often surpass the few-shot results in many benchmarks,
highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Code and Pretrained Models will be
open-sourced.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a new approach for approximating functions in $C([0,1]^d)$ via
Kolmogorov superposition theorem (KST) based on the linear spline approximation
of the K-outer function in Kolmogorov superposition representation. We improve
the results in \cite{LaiShenKST21} by showing that the optimal approximation
rate based on our proposed approach is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n^2})$, with $n$
being the number of knots over $[0,1]$, and the approximation constant
increases linearly in $d$. We show that there is a dense subclass in
$C([0,1]^d)$ whose approximation can achieve such optimal rate, and the number
of parameters needed in such approximation is at most $\mathcal{O}(nd)$.
Moreover, for $d\geq 4$, we apply the tensor product spline denoising technique
to smooth the KB-splines and get the corresponding LKB-splines. We use those
LKB-splines as the basis to approximate functions for the cases when $d=4$ and
$d=6$, which extends the results in \cite{LaiShenKST21} for $d=2$ and $d=3$.
Based on the idea of pivotal data locations introduced in \cite{LaiShenKST21},
we validate via numerical experiments that fewer than $\mathcal{O}(nd)$
function values are enough to achieve the approximation rates such as
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n})$ or $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n^2})$ based on the
smoothness of the K-outer function. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach
can be applied to numerically solving partial differential equation such as the
Poisson equation with accurate approximation results.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the future climate is crucial for informed policy decisions on
climate change prevention and mitigation. Earth system models play an important
role in predicting future climate, requiring accurate representation of complex
sub-processes that span multiple time scales and spatial scales. One such
process that links seasonal and interannual climate variability to cyclical
biological events is tree phenology in deciduous broadleaf forests.
Phenological dates, such as the start and end of the growing season, are
critical for understanding the exchange of carbon and water between the
biosphere and the atmosphere. Mechanistic prediction of these dates is
challenging. Hybrid modelling, which integrates data-driven approaches into
complex models, offers a solution. In this work, as a first step towards this
goal, train a deep neural network to predict a phenological index from
meteorological time series. We find that this approach outperforms traditional
process-based models. This highlights the potential of data-driven methods to
improve climate predictions. We also analyze which variables and aspects of the
time series influence the predicted onset of the season, in order to gain a
better understanding of the advantages and limitations of our model.

<p class="mathjax">We address the numerical treatment of source terms in algebraic flux
correction schemes for steady convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations.
The proposed algorithm constrains a continuous piecewise-linear finite element
approximation using a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) strategy. Failure to
discretize the convective derivatives and source terms in a compatible manner
produces spurious ripples, e.g., in regions where the coefficients of the
continuous problem are constant and the exact solution is linear. We cure this
deficiency by incorporating source term components into the fluxes and
intermediate states of the MCL procedure. The design of our new limiter is
motivated by the desire to preserve simple steady-state equilibria exactly, as
in well-balanced schemes for the shallow water equations. The results of our
numerical experiments for two-dimensional CDR problems illustrate potential
benefits of well-balanced flux limiting in the scalar case.

<p class="mathjax">This short, self-contained article seeks to introduce and survey
continuous-time deep learning approaches that are based on neural ordinary
differential equations (neural ODEs). It primarily targets readers familiar
with ordinary and partial differential equations and their analysis who are
curious to see their role in machine learning. Using three examples from
machine learning and applied mathematics, we will see how neural ODEs can
provide new insights into deep learning and a foundation for more efficient
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In this article we present a numerical method for the Stokes flow of an
Oldroyd-B fluid. The viscoelastic stress evolves according to a constitutive
law formulated in terms of the upper convected time derivative. A finite
difference method is used to discretise along fluid trajectories to approximate
the advection and deformation terms of the upper convected derivative in a
simple, cheap and cohesive manner, as well as ensuring that the discrete
conformation tensor is positive definite. A full implementation with coupling
to the fluid flow is presented, along with detailed discussion of the issues
that arise with such schemes. We demonstrate the performance of this method
with detailed numerical experiments in a lid-driven cavity setup. Numerical
results are benchmarked against published data, and the method is shown to
perform well in this challenging case.

<p class="mathjax">DETR accomplishes end-to-end object detection through iteratively generating
multiple object candidates based on image features and promoting one candidate
for each ground-truth object. The traditional training procedure using
one-to-one supervision in the original DETR lacks direct supervision for the
object detection candidates.
<br />We aim at improving the DETR training efficiency by explicitly supervising
the candidate generation procedure through mixing one-to-one supervision and
one-to-many supervision. Our approach, namely MS-DETR, is simple, and places
one-to-many supervision to the object queries of the primary decoder that is
used for inference. In comparison to existing DETR variants with one-to-many
supervision, such as Group DETR and Hybrid DETR, our approach does not need
additional decoder branches or object queries. The object queries of the
primary decoder in our approach directly benefit from one-to-many supervision
and thus are superior in object candidate prediction. Experimental results show
that our approach outperforms related DETR variants, such as DN-DETR, Hybrid
DETR, and Group DETR, and the combination with related DETR variants further
improves the performance.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress across various
domains, with large language models like ChatGPT gaining substantial attention
for their human-like text-generation capabilities. Despite these achievements,
spatial reasoning remains a significant challenge for these models. Benchmarks
like StepGame evaluate AI spatial reasoning, where ChatGPT has shown
unsatisfactory performance. However, the presence of template errors in the
benchmark has an impact on the evaluation results. Thus there is potential for
ChatGPT to perform better if these template errors are addressed, leading to
more accurate assessments of its spatial reasoning capabilities. In this study,
we refine the StepGame benchmark, providing a more accurate dataset for model
evaluation. We analyze GPT's spatial reasoning performance on the rectified
benchmark, identifying proficiency in mapping natural language text to spatial
relations but limitations in multi-hop reasoning. We provide a flawless
solution to the benchmark by combining template-to-relation mapping with
logic-based reasoning. This combination demonstrates proficiency in performing
qualitative reasoning on StepGame without encountering any errors. We then
address the limitations of GPT models in spatial reasoning. We deploy
Chain-of-thought and Tree-of-thoughts prompting strategies, offering insights
into GPT's ``cognitive process", and achieving remarkable improvements in
accuracy. Our investigation not only sheds light on model deficiencies but also
proposes enhancements, contributing to the advancement of AI with more robust
spatial reasoning capabilities.

<p class="mathjax">This paper describes methods for training autonomous agents to play the game
"Doom 2" through Imitation Learning (IL) using only pixel data as input. We
also explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) compares to IL for humanness by
comparing camera movement and trajectory data. Through behavioural cloning, we
examine the ability of individual models to learn varying behavioural traits.
We attempt to mimic the behaviour of real players with different play styles,
and find we can train agents that behave aggressively, passively, or simply
more human-like than traditional AIs. We propose these methods of introducing
more depth and human-like behaviour to agents in video games. The trained IL
agents perform on par with the average players in our dataset, whilst
outperforming the worst players. While performance was not as strong as common
RL approaches, it provides much stronger human-like behavioural traits to the
agent.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel control framework for addressing the
satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain
high-order MIMO nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often
assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can
handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential
infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints
essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable,
representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying
output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is
designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the
time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a
novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the
satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a
mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a
least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for
some time. Finally, simulation examples of trajectory and region tracking for a
mobile robot validate the proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">Past research into robotic planning with temporal logic specifications,
notably Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), was largely based on singular formulas for
individual or groups of robots. But with increasing task complexity, LTL
formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and
specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the
planners. In order to maximize the potential of LTL specifications, we
capitalized on the intrinsic structure of tasks and introduced a hierarchical
structure to LTL specifications, and designed an algorithm to ascertain whether
they are satisfied given an input sequence. Second, we employ a search-based
approach to synthesize plans for a multi-robot system, accomplishing
simultaneous task allocation and planning. The search space is approximated by
loosely interconnected sub-spaces, with each sub-space corresponding to one LTL
specification. The search is predominantly confined to a single sub-space,
transitioning to another sub-space under certain conditions, determined by the
decomposition of automatons. Moreover, multiple heuristics are formulated to
expedite the search significantly. A theoretical analysis concerning
completeness and optimality is conducted under mild assumptions. When compared
with existing methods on service tasks, our method outperforms in terms of
execution times with comparable solution quality. Finally, scalability is
evaluated by testing a group of 30 robots and achieving reasonable runtimes.

<p class="mathjax">Fault detection and isolation in complex systems are critical to ensure
reliable and efficient operation. However, traditional fault detection methods
often struggle with issues such as nonlinearity and multivariate
characteristics of the time series variables. This article proposes a
generative adversarial wavelet neural operator (GAWNO) as a novel unsupervised
deep learning approach for fault detection and isolation of multivariate time
series processes.The GAWNO combines the strengths of wavelet neural operators
and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to effectively capture both the
temporal distributions and the spatial dependencies among different variables
of an underlying system. The approach of fault detection and isolation using
GAWNO consists of two main stages. In the first stage, the GAWNO is trained on
a dataset of normal operating conditions to learn the underlying data
distribution. In the second stage, a reconstruction error-based threshold
approach using the trained GAWNO is employed to detect and isolate faults based
on the discrepancy values. We validate the proposed approach using the
Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset and Avedore wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP) and N2O emissions named as WWTPN2O datasets. Overall, we showcase that
the idea of harnessing the power of wavelet analysis, neural operators, and
generative models in a single framework to detect and isolate faults has shown
promising results compared to various well-established baselines in the
literature.

<p class="mathjax">When planning with an inaccurate dynamics model, a practical strategy is to
restrict planning to regions of state-action space where the model is accurate:
also known as a model precondition. Empirical real-world trajectory data is
valuable for defining data-driven model preconditions regardless of the model
form (analytical, simulator, learned, etc...). However, real-world data is
often expensive and dangerous to collect. In order to achieve data efficiency,
this paper presents an algorithm for actively selecting trajectories to learn a
model precondition for an inaccurate pre-specified dynamics model. Our proposed
techniques address challenges arising from the sequential nature of
trajectories, and potential benefit of prioritizing task-relevant data. The
experimental analysis shows how algorithmic properties affect performance in
three planning scenarios: icy gridworld, simulated plant watering, and
real-world plant watering. Results demonstrate an improvement of approximately
80% after only four real-world trajectories when using our proposed techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Dense Matrix Multiplication (MatMul) is arguably one of the most ubiquitous
compute-intensive kernels, spanning linear algebra, DSP, graphics, and machine
learning applications. Thus, MatMul optimization is crucial not only in
high-performance processors but also in embedded low-power platforms. Several
Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) have recently included matrix extensions
to improve MatMul performance and efficiency at the cost of added matrix
register files and units. In this paper, we propose Matrix eXtension (MX), a
lightweight approach that builds upon the open-source RISC-V Vector (RVV) ISA
to boost MatMul energy efficiency. Instead of adding expensive dedicated
hardware, MX uses the pre-existing vector register file and functional units to
create a hybrid vector/matrix engine at a negligible area cost (&lt; 3%), which
comes from a compact near-FPU tile buffer for higher data reuse, and no clock
frequency overhead. We implement MX on a compact and highly energy-optimized
RVV processor and evaluate it in both a Dual- and 64-Core cluster in a 12-nm
technology node. MX boosts the Dual-Core's energy efficiency by 10% for a
double-precision 64x64x64 matrix multiplication with the same FPU utilization
(~97%) and by 25% on the 64-Core cluster for the same benchmark on 32-bit data,
with a 56% performance gain.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models, such as wide neural networks, can be conceptualized as
nonlinear dynamical physical systems characterized by a multitude of
interacting degrees of freedom. Such systems in the infinite limit, tend to
exhibit simplified dynamics. This paper delves into gradient descent-based
learning algorithms, that display a linear structure in their parameter
dynamics, reminiscent of the neural tangent kernel. We establish this apparent
linearity arises due to weak correlations between the first and higher-order
derivatives of the hypothesis function, concerning the parameters, taken around
their initial values. This insight suggests that these weak correlations could
be the underlying reason for the observed linearization in such systems. As a
case in point, we showcase this weak correlations structure within neural
networks in the large width limit. Exploiting the relationship between
linearity and weak correlations, we derive a bound on deviations from linearity
observed during the training trajectory of stochastic gradient descent. To
facilitate our proof, we introduce a novel method to characterise the
asymptotic behavior of random tensors.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this paper is to show that evanescent plane waves are much better
at numerically approximating Helmholtz solutions than classical propagative
plane waves. By generalizing the Jacobi$\unicode{x2013}$Anger identity to
complex-valued directions, we first prove that any solution of the Helmholtz
equation on a three-dimensional ball can be written as a continuous
superposition of evanescent plane waves in a stable way. We then propose a
practical numerical recipe to select discrete approximation sets of evanescent
plane waves, which exhibits considerable improvements over standard propagative
plane wave schemes in numerical experiments. We show that all this is not
possible for propagative plane waves: they cannot stably represent general
Helmholtz solutions, and any approximation based on discrete sets of
propagative plane waves is doomed to have exponentially large coefficients and
thus to be numerically unstable. This paper is motivated by applications to
Trefftz-type Galerkin schemes and extends the recent results in [Parolin,
Huybrechs and Moiola, M2AN, 2023] from two to three space dimensions.

<p class="mathjax">In response to the evolving landscape of data storage, researchers have
increasingly explored non-traditional platforms, with DNA-based storage
emerging as a cutting-edge solution. Our work is motivated by the potential of
in-vivo DNA storage, known for its capacity to store vast amounts of
information efficiently and confidentially within an organism's native DNA.
While promising, in-vivo DNA storage faces challenges, including susceptibility
to errors introduced by mutations. To understand the long-term behavior of such
mutation systems, we investigate the frequency of $k$-tuples after multiple
mutation applications.
<br />Drawing inspiration from related works, we generalize results from the study
of mutation systems, particularly focusing on the frequency of $k$-tuples. In
this work, we provide a broad analysis through the construction of a
specialized matrix and the identification of its eigenvectors. In the context
of substitution and duplication systems, we leverage previous results on almost
sure convergence, equating the expected frequency to the limiting frequency.
Moreover, we demonstrate convergence in probability under certain assumptions.

<p class="mathjax">Fabricated papers do not just need text, images, and data, they also require
a fabricated or partially fabricated network of authors. Most `authors' on a
fabricated paper have not been associated with the research, but rather are
added through a transaction. This lack of deeper connection means that there is
a low likelihood that co-authors on fabricated papers will ever appear together
on the same paper more than once. This paper constructs a model that encodes
some of the key characteristics of this activity in an `authorship-for-sale'
network with the aim to create a robust method to detect this type of activity.
A characteristic network fingerprint arises from this model that provides a
robust statistical approach to the detection of paper-mill networks. The model
suggested in this paper detects networks that have a statistically significant
overlap with other approaches that principally rely on textual analysis for the
detection of fraudulent papers. Researchers connected to networks identified
using the methodology outlined in this paper are shown to be connected with 37%
of papers identified through the tortured-phrase and clay-feet methods deployed
in the Problematic Paper Screener website. Finally, methods to limit the
expansion and propagation of these networks is discussed both in technological
and social terms.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, researchers combine both audio and video signals to deal
with challenges where actions are not well represented or captured by visual
cues. However, how to effectively leverage the two modalities is still under
development. In this work, we develop a multiscale multimodal Transformer (MMT)
that leverages hierarchical representation learning. Particularly, MMT is
composed of a novel multiscale audio Transformer (MAT) and a multiscale video
Transformer [43]. To learn a discriminative cross-modality fusion, we further
design multimodal supervised contrastive objectives called audio-video
contrastive loss (AVC) and intra-modal contrastive loss (IMC) that robustly
align the two modalities. MMT surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches by
7.3% and 2.1% on Kinetics-Sounds and VGGSound in terms of the top-1 accuracy
without external training data. Moreover, the proposed MAT significantly
outperforms AST [28] by 22.2%, 4.4% and 4.7% on three public benchmark
datasets, and is about 3% more efficient based on the number of FLOPs and 9.8%
more efficient based on GPU memory usage.

<p class="mathjax">Language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) have been very effective in various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and text mining tasks including text classification. However,
some tasks still pose challenges for these models, including text
classification with limited labels. This can result in a cold-start problem.
Although some approaches have attempted to address this problem through
single-stage clustering as an intermediate training step coupled with a
pre-trained language model, which generates pseudo-labels to improve
classification, these methods are often error-prone due to the limitations of
the clustering algorithms. To overcome this, we have developed a novel
two-stage intermediate clustering with subsequent fine-tuning that models the
pseudo-labels reliably, resulting in reduced prediction errors. The key novelty
in our model, IDoFew, is that the two-stage clustering coupled with two
different clustering algorithms helps exploit the advantages of the
complementary algorithms that reduce the errors in generating reliable
pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. Our approach has shown significant improvements
compared to strong comparative models.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) play an increasingly important role in the
safety and sustainability of open sea operations. Since most maritime accidents
are related to human failure, intelligent algorithms for autonomous collision
avoidance and path following can drastically reduce the risk in the maritime
sector. A DT is a virtual representative of a real physical system and can
enhance the situational awareness (SITAW) of such an ASV to generate optimal
decisions. This work builds on an existing DT framework for ASVs and
demonstrates foundations for enabling predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous
capabilities. In this context, sophisticated target tracking approaches are
crucial for estimating and predicting the position and motion of other dynamic
objects. The applied tracking method is enabled by real-time automatic
identification system (AIS) data and synthetic light detection and ranging
(Lidar) measurements. To guarantee safety during autonomous operations, we
applied a predictive safety filter, based on the concept of nonlinear model
predictive control (NMPC). The approaches are implemented into a DT built with
the Unity game engine. As a result, this work demonstrates the potential of a
DT capable of making predictions, playing through various what-if scenarios,
and providing optimal control decisions according to its enhanced SITAW.

<p class="mathjax">The Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta (BD) method proposed in 2001 has become a popular
tool for comparing video codec compression efficiency. It was initially
proposed to compute bitrate and quality differences between two Rate-Distortion
curves using PSNR as a distortion metric. Over the years, many works have
calculated and reported BD results using other objective quality metrics such
as SSIM, VMAF and, in some cases, even subjective ratings (mean opinion
scores). However, the lack of consolidated literature explaining the metric,
its evolution over the years, and a systematic evaluation of the same under
different test conditions can result in a wrong interpretation of the BD
results thus obtained.
<br />Towards this end, this paper presents a detailed tutorial describing the BD
method and example cases where the metric might fail. We also provide a
detailed history of its evolution, including a discussion of various proposed
improvements and variations over the last 20 years. In addition, we evaluate
the various BD methods and their open-source implementations, considering
different objective quality metrics and subjective ratings taking into account
different RD characteristics. Based on our results, we present a set of
recommendations on using existing BD metrics and various insights for possible
exploration towards developing more effective tools for codec compression
efficiency evaluation and comparison.

<p class="mathjax">The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their
performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to
deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU. Due to the memory and
power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used
to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency. This usually
results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency. Therefore,
optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on
commodity hardware. A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the
Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\frac{2}{3}$
total parameters and inference latency. In this paper, we first observe that
only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens,
a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different
tokens. Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts
according to the heavy hitters. We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of
existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with
heavy hitters. In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\% and
bring $1.25\sim1.56\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with
negligible accuracy drop.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models for downstream tasks remains a
critical challenge in natural language processing. This paper presents an
empirical analysis comparing two efficient fine-tuning methods - BitFit and
adapter modules - to standard full model fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on
GLUE benchmark datasets (MRPC, COLA, STS-B) reveal several key insights. The
BitFit approach, which trains only bias terms and task heads, matches full
fine-tuning performance across varying amounts of training data and time
constraints. It demonstrates remarkable stability even with only 30\% of data,
outperforming full fine-tuning at intermediate data levels. Adapter modules
exhibit high variability, with inconsistent gains over default models. The
findings indicate BitFit offers an attractive balance between performance and
parameter efficiency. Our work provides valuable perspectives on model tuning,
emphasizing robustness and highlighting BitFit as a promising alternative for
resource-constrained or streaming task settings. The analysis offers actionable
guidelines for efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models, while
illustrating open challenges in stabilizing techniques like adapter modules.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the role of text in visualizations, specifically the
impact of text position, semantic content, and biased wording. Two empirical
studies were conducted based on two tasks (predicting data trends and
appraising bias) using two visualization types (bar and line charts). While the
addition of text had a minimal effect on how people perceive data trends, there
was a significant impact on how biased they perceive the authors to be. This
finding revealed a relationship between the degree of bias in textual
information and the perception of the authors' bias. Exploratory analyses
support an interaction between a person's prediction and the degree of bias
they perceived. This paper also develops a crowdsourced method for creating
chart annotations that range from neutral to highly biased. This research
highlights the need for designers to mitigate potential polarization of
readers' opinions based on how authors' ideas are expressed.

ranking policies we wish to learn. We propose a theoretically grounded method
to incorporate 2nd-level feedback into any 1st-level ranking model. Online
experiments on a large-scale recommendation system confirm our theoretical
findings.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional information retrieval is based on sparse bag-of-words vector
representations of documents and queries. More recent deep-learning approaches
have used dense embeddings learned using a transformer-based large language
model. We show that on a classic benchmark on scientific document retrieval in
the medical domain of cystic fibrosis, that both of these models perform
roughly equivalently. Notably, dense vectors from the state-of-the-art SPECTER2
model do not significantly enhance performance. However, a hybrid model that we
propose combining these methods yields significantly better results,
underscoring the merits of integrating classical and contemporary deep learning
techniques in information retrieval in the domain of specialized scientific

<p class="mathjax">We present Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO), an algorithm for
reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our approach is minimalist in that
it does not require training a reward model nor unstable adversarial training
and is therefore rather simple to implement. Our approach is maximalist in that
it provably handles non-Markovian, intransitive, and stochastic preferences
while being robust to the compounding errors that plague offline approaches to
sequential prediction. To achieve the preceding qualities, we build upon the
concept of a Minimax Winner (MW), a notion of preference aggregation from the
social choice theory literature that frames learning from preferences as a
zero-sum game between two policies. By leveraging the symmetry of this game, we
prove that rather than using the traditional technique of dueling two policies
to compute the MW, we can simply have a single agent play against itself while
maintaining strong convergence guarantees. Practically, this corresponds to
sampling multiple trajectories from a policy, asking a rater or preference
model to compare them, and then using the proportion of wins as the reward for
a particular trajectory. We demonstrate that on a suite of continuous control
tasks, we are able to learn significantly more efficiently than reward-model
based approaches while maintaining robustness to the intransitive and
stochastic preferences that frequently occur in practice when aggregating human
judgments.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), has intensified the imperative to scrutinize fairness alongside
accuracy. Recent studies have begun to investigate fairness evaluations for
LLMs within domains such as recommendations. Given that personalization is an
intrinsic aspect of recommendation systems, its incorporation into fairness
assessments is paramount. Yet, the degree to which current fairness evaluation
frameworks account for personalization remains unclear. Our comprehensive
literature review aims to fill this gap by examining how existing frameworks
handle fairness evaluations of LLMs, with a focus on the integration of
personalization factors. Despite an exhaustive collection and analysis of
relevant works, we discovered that most evaluations overlook personalization, a
critical facet of recommendation systems, thereby inadvertently perpetuating
unfair practices. Our findings shed light on this oversight and underscore the
urgent need for more nuanced fairness evaluations that acknowledge
personalization. Such improvements are vital for fostering equitable
development within the AI community.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system, where a transmitter vehicle
exploits a dual reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to send confidential
information to legitimate receiver vehicles under the non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) scheme in the presence of an eavesdropper vehicle. In particular,
it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is
close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment.
Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the
Fisher-Snedecor F fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the
marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver
vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem (CLT). Then, in order to
evaluate the PLS performance of the considered secure communication system, we
derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy
outage probability (SOP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by using the
Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to
gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of
the ASC is obtained. The numerical results indicate that incorporating the dual
RIS in the secure V2V communication under the NOMA scheme can significantly
provide ultra-reliable transmission and guarantee more secure communication for
intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

<p class="mathjax">Online controlled experiments, such as A/B-tests, are commonly used by modern
tech companies to enable continuous system improvements. Despite their
paramount importance, A/B-tests are expensive: by their very definition, a
percentage of traffic is assigned an inferior system variant. To ensure
statistical significance on top-level metrics, online experiments typically run
for several weeks. Even then, a considerable amount of experiments will lead to
inconclusive results (i.e. false negatives, or type-II error). The main culprit
for this inefficiency is the variance of the online metrics. Variance reduction
techniques have been proposed in the literature, but their direct applicability
to commonly used ratio metrics (e.g. click-through rate or user retention) is
limited.
<br />In this work, we successfully apply variance reduction techniques to ratio
metrics on a large-scale short-video platform: ShareChat. Our empirical results
show that we can either improve A/B-test confidence in 77% of cases, or can
retain the same level of confidence with 30% fewer data points. Importantly, we
show that the common approach of including as many covariates as possible in
regression is counter-productive, highlighting that control variates based on
Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree predictors are most effective. We discuss the
practicalities of implementing these methods at scale and showcase the cost
reduction they beget.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposes a class of augmented subspace schemes for the weak
Galerkin (WG) finite element method used to solve eigenvalue problems. The
augmented subspace is built with the conforming linear finite element space
defined on the coarse mesh and the eigenfunction approximations in the WG
finite element space defined on the fine mesh. Based on this augmented
subspace, solving the eigenvalue problem in the fine WG finite element space
can be reduced to the solution of the linear boundary value problem in the same
WG finite element space and a low dimensional eigenvalue problem in the
augmented subspace. The proposed augmented subspace techniques have the second
order convergence rate with respect to the coarse mesh size, as demonstrated by
the accompanying error estimates. Finally, a few numerical examples are
provided to validate the proposed numerical techniques.

analysis of interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs). IntervalMDP.jl
facilitates the synthesis of optimal strategies and verification of IMDPs
against reachability specifications and discounted reward properties. The
library supports sparse matrices and is compatible with common tools for
analysis of probabilistic models, such as PRISM. A key feature of
IntervalMDP.jl is that it presents both a multi-threaded CPU and a
GPU-accelerated implementation of value iteration algorithms for IMDPs. In
particular, IntervalMDP.jl takes advantage of the Julia type system and the
inherently parallelizable nature of value iteration to improve the efficiency
of performing analysis of IMDPs. On a set of examples, we show that
IntervalMDP.jl substantially outperforms existing tools for verification and
strategy synthesis for IMDPs in both computation time and memory consumption.

<p class="mathjax">Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds
and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and
machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its
variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, \ie
a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only
allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored
previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either
maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these
interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction
algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common
computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization
problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of
principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework,
creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable
flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more
algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we
propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing
the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic
scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in
terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model.
Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each
layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at
each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state
and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the
selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has
access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference.
Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or
matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular,
Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and
multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow
instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo,
Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both
the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generative methods, there is a notable
absence of reliable evaluation metrics. Existing metrics usually focus on a
single criterion each, such as how well the asset aligned with the input text.
These metrics lack the flexibility to generalize to different evaluation
criteria and might not align well with human preferences. Conducting user
preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and
human-aligned results. User studies, however, can be very expensive to scale.
This paper presents an automatic, versatile, and human-aligned evaluation
metric for text-to-3D generative models. To this end, we first develop a prompt
generator using GPT-4V to generate evaluating prompts, which serve as input to
compare text-to-3D models. We further design a method instructing GPT-4V to
compare two 3D assets according to user-defined criteria. Finally, we use these
pairwise comparison results to assign these models Elo ratings. Experimental
results suggest our metric strongly align with human preference across
different evaluation criteria.

<p class="mathjax">Age of incorrect information (AoII) has recently been proposed as an
alternative to existing information freshness metrics for real-time sampling
and estimation problems involving information sources that are tracked by
remote monitors. Different from existing metrics, AoII penalizes the incorrect
information by increasing linearly with time as long as the source and the
monitor are de-synchronized, and is reset when they are synchronized back.
While AoII has generally been investigated for discrete time information
sources, we develop a novel analytical model in this paper for push- and
pull-based sampling and transmission of a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC)
process. In the pull-based model, the sensor starts transmitting information on
the observed CTMC only when a pull request from the monitor is received. On the
other hand, in the push-based scenario, the sensor, being aware of the AoII
process, samples and transmits when the AoII process exceeds a random
threshold. The proposed analytical model for both scenarios is based on the
construction of a discrete time MC (DTMC) making state transitions at the
embedded epochs of synchronization points, using the theory of absorbing CTMCs,
and in particular phase-type distributions. For a given sampling policy,
analytical models to obtain the mean AoII and the average sampling rate are
developed. Numerical results are presented to validate the analytical model as
well as to provide insight on optimal sampling policies under sampling rate
constraints.

<p class="mathjax">Given the growing need for automatic 3D content creation pipelines, various
3D representations have been studied to generate 3D objects from a single
image. Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based
models have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D
Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often
optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation
steps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D
Gaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single
image, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an
intermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D
Gaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization.
Moreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse
representation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian
super-resolution module. Our method is evaluated against existing
optimization-based 3D Gaussian frameworks and sampling-based pipelines
utilizing other 3D representations, where AGG showcases competitive generation
abilities both qualitatively and quantitatively while being several orders of
magnitude faster. Project page: https://ir1d.github.io/AGG/

<p class="mathjax">Large pretrained models are increasingly crucial in modern computer vision
tasks. These models are typically used in downstream tasks by end-to-end
finetuning, which is highly memory-intensive for tasks with high-resolution
data, e.g., video understanding, small object detection, and point cloud
analysis. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks,
or Dr$^2$Net, a novel family of network architectures that acts as a surrogate
network to finetune a pretrained model with substantially reduced memory
consumption. Dr$^2$Net contains two types of residual connections, one
maintaining the residual structure in the pretrained models, and the other
making the network reversible. Due to its reversibility, intermediate
activations, which can be reconstructed from output, are cleared from memory
during training. We use two coefficients on either type of residual connections
respectively, and introduce a dynamic training strategy that seamlessly
transitions the pretrained model to a reversible network with much higher
numerical precision. We evaluate Dr$^2$Net on various pretrained models and
various tasks, and show that it can reach comparable performance to
conventional finetuning but with significantly less memory usage.

<p class="mathjax">The quantum SearchRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future quantum
search engine based on PageRank quantization. However, this algorithm loses its
functionality when the $N/M$ ratio between the network size $N$ and the number
of marked nodes $M$ is sufficiently large. We propose a modification of the
algorithm, replacing the underlying Szegedy quantum walk with a semiclassical
walk. To maintain the same time complexity as the quantum SearchRank algorithm
we propose a simplification of the algorithm. This new algorithm is called
Randomized SearchRank, since it corresponds to a quantum walk over a randomized
mixed state. The performance of the SearchRank algorithms is first analyzed on
an example network, and then statistically on a set of different networks of
increasing size and different number of marked nodes. On the one hand, to test
the search ability of the algorithms, it is computed how the probability of
measuring the marked nodes decreases with $N/M$ for the quantum SearchRank, but
remarkably it remains at a high value around $0.9$ for our semiclassical
algorithms, solving the quantum SearchRank problem. The time complexity of the
algorithms is also analyzed, obtaining a quadratic speedup with respect to the
classical ones. On the other hand, the ranking functionality of the algorithms
has been investigated, obtaining a good agreement with the classical PageRank
distribution. Finally, the dependence of these algorithms on the intrinsic
PageRank damping parameter has been clarified. Our results suggest that this
parameter should be below a threshold so that the execution time does not
increase drastically.

<p class="mathjax">Magmas form at depth, move upwards and evolve chemically through a
combination of processes. Magmatic processes are investigated by means of
fieldwork combined with geophysics, geochemistry, analog and numerical models,
and many other approaches. However, scientists in the field still struggle to
understand how the variety of magmatic products arises, and there is no
consensus yet on models of volcanic plumbing systems. This is because eruptions
result from the integration of multiple processes, rooted in the magma source
either in the mantle or lower crust that feeds a complex network of magma
bodies linking magma source and volcano. In this work, we investigate the
potential of the network approach through a prototype of magma pool interaction
and magma transfer across the crust. In network terms, it describes a diffusion
process on a dynamic spatial network, in which diffusion and network evolution
are intertwined: the diffusion affects the network structure, and reciprocally.
The diffusion process and network evolution mechanisms come from rules of
behaviour derived from rock mechanics and melting processes. Nodes represent
magma pools and edges physical connections between them, e.g., dykes or
veinlets.

<p class="mathjax">Vessel structure is one of the most important parts of the retina which
physicians can detect many diseases by analysing its features. Localization of
blood vessels in retina images is an important process in medical image
analysis. This process is also more challenging with the presence of bright and
dark lesions. In this thesis, two automated vessel localization methods to
handle both healthy and unhealthy (pathological) retina images are analyzed.
Each method consists of two major steps and the second step is the same in the
two methods. In the first step, an algorithm is used to decrease the effect of
bright lesions. In Method 1, this algorithm is based on K- Means segmentation,
and in Method 2, it is based on a regularization procedure. In the second step
of both methods, a multi-scale line operator is used to localize the
line-shaped vascular structures and ignore the dark lesions which are generally
assumed to have irregular patterns. After the introduction of the methods, a
detailed quantitative and qualitative comparison of the methods with one
another as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in the literature based on
the segmentation results on the images of the two publicly available datasets,
DRIVE and STARE, is reported. The results demonstrate that the methods are
highly comparable with other solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Species distribution modeling is a highly versatile tool for understanding
the intricate relationship between environmental conditions and species
occurrences. However, the available data often lacks information on confirmed
species absence and is limited to opportunistically sampled, presence-only
observations. To overcome this limitation, a common approach is to employ
pseudo-absences, which are specific geographic locations designated as negative
samples. While pseudo-absences are well-established for single-species
distribution models, their application in the context of multi-species neural
networks remains underexplored. Notably, the significant class imbalance
between species presences and pseudo-absences is often left unaddressed.
Moreover, the existence of different types of pseudo-absences (e.g., random and
target-group background points) adds complexity to the selection process.
Determining the optimal combination of pseudo-absences types is difficult and
depends on the characteristics of the data, particularly considering that
certain types of pseudo-absences can be used to mitigate geographic biases. In
this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges can be effectively tackled by
integrating pseudo-absences in the training of multi-species neural networks
through modifications to the loss function. This adjustment involves assigning
different weights to the distinct terms of the loss function, thereby
addressing both the class imbalance and the choice of pseudo-absence types.
Additionally, we propose a strategy to set these loss weights using spatial
block cross-validation with presence-only data. We evaluate our approach using
a benchmark dataset containing independent presence-absence data from six
different regions and report improved results when compared to competing
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The clustering coefficient is a valuable tool for understanding the structure
of complex networks. It is widely used to analyze social networks, biological
networks, and other complex systems. While there is generally a single common
definition for the local clustering coefficient, there are two different ways
to calculate the global clustering coefficient. The first approach takes the
average of the local clustering coefficients for each node in the network. The
second one is based on the ratio of closed triplets to all triplets. It is
shown that these two definitions of the global clustering coefficients are
strongly inequivalent and may significantly impact the accuracy of the outcome.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models for medical image analysis easily suffer from
distribution shifts caused by dataset artifacts bias, camera variations,
differences in the imaging station, etc., leading to unreliable diagnoses in
real-world clinical settings. Domain generalization (DG) methods, which aim to
train models on multiple domains to perform well on unseen domains, offer a
promising direction to solve the problem. However, existing DG methods assume
domain labels of each image are available and accurate, which is typically
feasible for only a limited number of medical datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel DG framework for medical image classification
without relying on domain labels, called Prompt-driven Latent Domain
Generalization (PLDG). PLDG consists of unsupervised domain discovery and
prompt learning. This framework first discovers pseudo domain labels by
clustering the bias-associated style features, then leverages collaborative
domain prompts to guide a Vision Transformer to learn knowledge from discovered
diverse domains. To facilitate cross-domain knowledge learning between
different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables
knowledge sharing between domain prompts and a shared prompt. A domain mixup
strategy is additionally employed for more flexible decision margins and
mitigates the risk of incorrect domain assignments. Extensive experiments on
three medical image classification tasks and one debiasing task demonstrate
that our method can achieve comparable or even superior performance than
conventional DG algorithms without relying on domain labels. Our code will be
publicly available upon the paper is accepted.

<p class="mathjax">With the global population on the rise, our cities have been expanding to
accommodate the growing number of people. The expansion of cities generally
leads to the engulfment of peripheral areas. However, such expansion of urban
areas is likely to cause increment in areas with increased land surface
temperature (LST). By considering each summer as a data point, we form LST
multi-year time-series and cluster it to obtain spatio-temporal pattern. We
observe several interesting phenomena from these patterns, e.g., some clusters
show reasonable similarity to the built-up area, whereas the locations with
high temporal variation are seen more in the peripheral areas. Furthermore, the
LST center of mass shifts over the years for cities with development activities
tilted towards a direction. We conduct the above-mentioned studies for three
different cities in three different continents.

<p class="mathjax">This study develops a computationally efficient phase-field lattice Boltzmann
model with the capability to simulate thermocapillary flows. The model was
implemented into the open-source simulation framework, waLBerla, and extended
to conduct the collision stage using central moments. The multiphase model was
coupled with both a passive-scalar thermal LB, and a RK solution to the energy
equation in order to resolve temperature-dependent surface tension phenomena.
Various lattice stencils (D3Q7, D3Q15, D3Q19, D3Q27) were tested for the
passive-scalar LB and both the second- and fourth-order RK methods were
investigated. There was no significant difference observed in the accuracy of
the LB or RK schemes. The passive scalar D3Q7 LB discretisation tended to
provide computational benefits, while the second order RK scheme is superior in
memory usage. This paper makes contributions relating to the modelling of
thermocapillary flows and to understanding the behaviour of droplet capture
with thermal sources analogous to thermal tweezers. Four primary contributions
to the literature are identified. First, a new 3D thermocapillary,
central-moment phase-field LB model is presented and implemented in the
open-source software, waLBerla. Second, the accuracy and computational
performance of various techniques to resolve the energy equation for
multiphase, incompressible fluids is investigated. Third, the dynamic droplet
transport behaviour in the presence of thermal sources is studied and insight
is provided on the potential ability to manipulate droplets based on local
domain heating. Finally, a concise analysis of the computational performance
together with near-perfect scaling results on NVIDIA and AMD GPU-clusters is
shown. This research enables the detailed study of droplet manipulation and
control in thermocapillary devices.

<p class="mathjax">Second-order optimization methods, such as cubic regularized Newton methods,
are known for their rapid convergence rates; nevertheless, they become
impractical in high-dimensional problems due to their substantial memory
requirements and computational costs. One promising approach is to execute
second-order updates within a lower-dimensional subspace, giving rise to
subspace second-order methods. However, the majority of existing subspace
second-order methods randomly select subspaces, consequently resulting in
slower convergence rates depending on the problem's dimension $d$. In this
paper, we introduce a novel subspace cubic regularized Newton method that
achieves a dimension-independent global convergence rate of
${O}\left(\frac{1}{mk}+\frac{1}{k^2}\right)$ for solving convex optimization
problems. Here, $m$ represents the subspace dimension, which can be
significantly smaller than $d$. Instead of adopting a random subspace, our
primary innovation involves performing the cubic regularized Newton update
within the Krylov subspace associated with the Hessian and the gradient of the
objective function. This result marks the first instance of a
dimension-independent convergence rate for a subspace second-order method.
Furthermore, when specific spectral conditions of the Hessian are met, our
method recovers the convergence rate of a full-dimensional cubic regularized
Newton method. Numerical experiments show our method converges faster than
existing random subspace methods, especially for high-dimensional problems.

<p class="mathjax">Eye morphology varies significantly across the population, especially for the
orbit and optic nerve. These variations limit the feasibility and robustness of
generalizing population-wise features of eye organs to an unbiased spatial
reference. To tackle these limitations, we propose a process for creating
high-resolution unbiased eye atlases. First, to restore spatial details from
scans with a low through-plane resolution compared to a high in-plane
resolution, we apply a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Then, we
generate an initial unbiased reference with an iterative metric-based
registration using a small portion of subject scans. We register the remaining
scans to this template and refine the template using an unsupervised deep
probabilistic approach that generates a more expansive deformation field to
enhance the organ boundary alignment. We demonstrate this framework using
magnetic resonance images across four different MRI tissue contrasts,
generating four atlases in separate spatial alignments. For each tissue
contrast, we find a significant improvement in the average Dice score across
four labeled regions compared to a standard registration framework consisting
of rigid, affine, and deformable transformations. These results highlight the
effective alignment of eye organs and boundaries using our proposed process. By
combining super-resolution preprocessing and deep probabilistic models, we
address the challenge of generating an eye atlas to serve as a standardized
reference across a largely variable population.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a deep neural network (DNN) based least distance (LD) estimator
(DNN-LD) for a multivariate regression problem, addressing the limitations of
the conventional methods. Due to the flexibility of a DNN structure, both
linear and nonlinear conditional mean functions can be easily modeled, and a
multivariate regression model can be realized by simply adding extra nodes at
the output layer. The proposed method is more efficient in capturing the
dependency structure among responses than the least squares loss, and robust to
outliers. In addition, we consider $L_1$-type penalization for variable
selection, crucial in analyzing high-dimensional data. Namely, we propose what
we call (A)GDNN-LD estimator that enjoys variable selection and model
estimation simultaneously, by applying the (adaptive) group Lasso penalty to
weight parameters in the DNN structure. For the computation, we propose a
quadratic smoothing approximation method to facilitate optimizing the
non-smooth objective function based on the least distance loss. The simulation
studies and a real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Alzheimer's is a brain disease that gets worse over time and affects memory,
thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be treated and managed if
it is diagnosed early, which can slow the progression of symptoms and improve
quality of life. In this study, we suggested using the Visual Transformer (ViT)
and bi-LSTM to process MRI images for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We used
ViT to extract features from the MRI and then map them to a feature sequence.
Then, we used Bi-LSTM sequence modeling to keep the interdependencies between
related features. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the proposed
model for the binary classification of AD patients using data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Finally, we evaluated our
method against other deep learning models in the literature. The proposed
method performs well in terms of accuracy, precision, F-score, and recall for
the diagnosis of AD.

<p class="mathjax">The motile micro-organisms such as E. coli, sperm, or some seaweed are
usually modelled by self-propelled particles that move with the run-and-tumble
process. Individual-based stochastic models are usually employed to model the
aggregation phenomenon at the boundary, which is an active research field that
has attracted a lot of biologists and biophysicists. Self-propelled particles
at the microscale have complex behaviors, while characteristics at the
population level are more important for practical applications but rely on
individual behaviors. Kinetic PDE models that describe the time evolution of
the probability density distribution of the motile micro-organisms are widely
used. However, how to impose the appropriate boundary conditions that take into
account the boundary aggregation phenomena is rarely studied. In this paper, we
propose the boundary conditions for a 2D confined run-and-tumble model (CRTM)
for self-propelled particle populations moving between two parallel plates with
a run-and-tumble process. The proposed model satisfies the relative entropy
inequality and thus long-time convergence. We establish the relation between
CRTM and the confined Fokker-Planck model (CFPM) studied in [22]. We prove
theoretically that when the tumble is highly forward peaked and frequent
enough, CRTM converges asymptotically to the CFPM. A numerical comparison of
the CRTM with aggregation and CFPM is given. The time evolution of both the
deterministic PDE model and individual-based stochastic simulations are
displayed, which match each other well.

<p class="mathjax">Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models, however their
generated samples are known to suffer from a characteristic blurriness, as
compared to the outputs of alternative generating techniques. Extensive
research efforts have been made to tackle this problem, and several works have
focused on modifying the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound
(ELBO). In particular, many have experimented with augmenting the
reconstruction loss with losses in the frequency domain. Such loss functions
usually employ the Fourier transform to explicitly penalise the lack of higher
frequency components in the generated samples, which are responsible for sharp
visual features. In this paper, we explore the aspects of previous such
approaches which aren't well understood, and we propose an augmentation to the
reconstruction term in response to them. Our reasoning leads us to use the
short-time Fourier transform and to emphasise on local phase coherence between
the input and output samples. We illustrate the potential of our proposed loss
on the MNIST dataset by providing both qualitative and quantitative results.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of medical imaging, breast ultrasound has emerged as a crucial
diagnostic tool for early detection of breast cancer. However, the accuracy of
diagnosing the location of the affected area and the extent of the disease
depends on the experience of the physician. In this paper, we propose a novel
model called UGGNet, combining the power of the U-Net and VGG architectures to
enhance the performance of breast ultrasound image analysis. The U-Net
component of the model helps accurately segment the lesions, while the VGG
component utilizes deep convolutional layers to extract features. The fusion of
these two architectures in UGGNet aims to optimize both segmentation and
feature representation, providing a comprehensive solution for accurate
diagnosis in breast ultrasound images. Experimental results have demonstrated
that the UGGNet model achieves a notable accuracy of 78.2% on the "Breast
Ultrasound Images Dataset."

<p class="mathjax">Intelligent metasurfaces are one of the favorite technologies for integrating
sixth-generation (6G) networks, especially the reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) that has been extensively researched in various applications. In
this context, a feature that deserves further exploration is the frequency
scattering that occurs when the elements are periodically switched, referred to
as Space-Time-Coding metasurface (STCM) topology. This type of topology causes
impairments to the established communication methods by generating undesirable
interference both in frequency and space, which is worsened when using wideband
signals. Nevertheless, it has the potential to bring forward useful features
for sensing and localization. This work exploits STCM sensing capabilities in
target detection, localization, and classification using narrowband downlink
pilot signals at the base station (BS). The results of this novel approach
reveal the ability to retrieve a scattering point (SP) localization within the
sub-centimeter and sub-decimeter accuracy depending on the SP position in
space. We also analyze the associated detection and classification
probabilities, which show reliable detection performance in the whole analyzed
environment. In contrast, the classification is bounded by physical
constraints, and we conclude that this method presents a promising approach for
future integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) protocols by providing a
tool to perform sensing and localization services using legacy communication
signals.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have become the go-to method for large-scale generative
models in real-world applications. These applications often involve data
distributions confined within bounded domains, typically requiring ad-hoc
thresholding techniques for boundary enforcement. Reflected diffusion models
(Lou23) aim to enhance generalizability by generating the data distribution
through a backward process governed by reflected Brownian motion. However,
reflected diffusion models may not easily adapt to diverse domains without the
derivation of proper diffeomorphic mappings and do not guarantee optimal
transport properties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Reflected
Schrodinger Bridge algorithm: an entropy-regularized optimal transport approach
tailored for generating data within diverse bounded domains. We derive elegant
reflected forward-backward stochastic differential equations with Neumann and
Robin boundary conditions, extend divergence-based likelihood training to
bounded domains, and explore natural connections to entropic optimal transport
for the study of approximate linear convergence - a valuable insight for
practical training. Our algorithm yields robust generative modeling in diverse
domains, and its scalability is demonstrated in real-world constrained
generative modeling through standard image benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">To generate actions in the face of physiological delays, the brain must
predict the future. Here we explore how prediction may lie at the core of brain
function by considering a neuron predicting the future of a scalar time series
input. Assuming that the dynamics of the lag vector (a vector composed of
several consecutive elements of the time series) are locally linear, Normal
Mode Decomposition decomposes the dynamics into independently evolving
(eigen-)modes allowing for straightforward prediction. We propose that a neuron
learns the top mode and projects its input onto the associated subspace. Under
this interpretation, the temporal filter of a neuron corresponds to the left
eigenvector of a generalized eigenvalue problem. We mathematically analyze the
operation of such an algorithm on noisy observations of synthetic data
generated by a linear system. Interestingly, the shape of the temporal filter
varies with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): a noisy input yields a monophasic
filter and a growing SNR leads to multiphasic filters with progressively
greater number of phases. Such variation in the temporal filter with input SNR
resembles that observed experimentally in biological neurons.

<p class="mathjax">Confidence estimation of predictions from an End-to-End (E2E) Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) model benefits ASR's downstream and upstream tasks.
Class-probability-based confidence scores do not accurately represent the
quality of overconfident ASR predictions. An ancillary Confidence Estimation
Model (CEM) calibrates the predictions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions use
binary target scores for CEM training. However, the binary labels do not reveal
the granular information of predicted words, such as temporal alignment between
reference and hypothesis and whether the predicted word is entirely incorrect
or contains spelling errors. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel
Temporal-Lexeme Similarity (TeLeS) confidence score to train CEM. To address
the data imbalance of target scores while training CEM, we use shrinkage loss
to focus on hard-to-learn data points and minimise the impact of easily learned
data points. We conduct experiments with ASR models trained in three languages,
namely Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada, with varying training data sizes. Experiments
show that TeLeS generalises well across domains. To demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed method, we formulate a TeLeS-based Acquisition
(TeLeS-A) function for sampling uncertainty in active learning. We observe a
significant reduction in the Word Error Rate (WER) as compared to SOTA methods.

<p class="mathjax">Searching for similar images in archives of histology and histopathology
images is a crucial task that may aid in patient matching for various purposes,
ranging from triaging and diagnosis to prognosis and prediction. Whole slide
images (WSIs) are highly detailed digital representations of tissue specimens
mounted on glass slides. Matching WSI to WSI can serve as the critical method
for patient matching. In this paper, we report extensive analysis and
validation of four search methods bag of visual words (BoVW), Yottixel, SISH,
RetCCL, and some of their potential variants. We analyze their algorithms and
structures and assess their performance. For this evaluation, we utilized four
internal datasets ($1269$ patients) and three public datasets ($1207$
patients), totaling more than $200,000$ patches from $38$ different
classes/subtypes across five primary sites. Certain search engines, for
example, BoVW, exhibit notable efficiency and speed but suffer from low
accuracy. Conversely, search engines like Yottixel demonstrate efficiency and
speed, providing moderately accurate results. Recent proposals, including SISH,
display inefficiency and yield inconsistent outcomes, while alternatives like
RetCCL prove inadequate in both accuracy and efficiency. Further research is
imperative to address the dual aspects of accuracy and minimal storage

<p class="mathjax">In general, providing an axiomatization for an arbitrary logic is a task that
may require some ingenuity. In the case of logics defined by a finite logical
matrix (three-valued logics being a particularly simple example), the
generation of suitable finite axiomatizations can be completely automatized,
essentially by expressing the matrix tables via inference rules. In this
chapter we illustrate how two formalisms, the 3-labelled calculi of Baaz,
Ferm\"uller and Zach and the multiple-conclusion (or Set-Set) Hilbert-style
calculi of Shoesmith and Smiley, may be uniformly employed to axiomatize logics
defined by a three-valued logical matrix. The generating procedure common to
both formalisms can be described as follows: first (i) convert the matrix
semantics into rule form (we refer to this step as the generating subprocedure)
and then (ii) simplify the set of rules thus obtained, essentially relying on
the defining properties of any Tarskian consequence relation (we refer to this
step as the streamlining subprocedure). We illustrate through some examples
that, if a minimal expressiveness assumption is met (namely, if the matrix
defining the logic is monadic), then it is straightforward to define effective
translations guaranteeing the equivalence between the 3-labelled and the
Set-Set approach.

<p class="mathjax">An important aspect of a humanoid robot is audition. Previous work has
presented robot systems capable of sound localization and source segregation
based on microphone arrays with various configurations. However, no theoretical
framework for the design of these arrays has been presented. In the current
paper, a design framework is proposed based on a novel array quality measure.
The measure is based on the effective rank of a matrix composed of the
generalized head related transfer functions (GHRTFs) that account for
microphone positions other than the ears. The measure is shown to be
theoretically related to standard array performance measures such as
beamforming robustness and DOA estimation accuracy. Then, the measure is
applied to produce sample designs of microphone arrays. Their performance is
investigated numerically, verifying the advantages of array design based on the
proposed theoretical framework.

<p class="mathjax">Spherical microphone arrays (SMAs) and spherical loudspeaker arrays (SLAs)
facilitate the study of room acoustics due to the three-dimensional analysis
they provide. More recently, systems that combine both arrays, referred to as
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, have been proposed due to the
added spatial diversity they facilitate. The literature provides frameworks for
designing SMAs and SLAs separately, including error analysis from which the
operating frequency range (OFR) of an array is defined. However, such a
framework does not exist for the joint design of a SMA and a SLA that comprise
a MIMO system. This paper develops a design framework for MIMO systems based on
a model that addresses errors and highlights the importance of a matched
design. Expanding on a free-field assumption, errors are incorporated
separately for each array and error bounds are defined, facilitating error
analysis for the system. The dependency of the error bounds on the SLA and SMA
parameters is studied and it is recommended that parameters should be chosen to
assure matched OFRs of the arrays in MIMO system design. A design example is
provided, demonstrating the superiority of a matched system over an unmatched
system in the synthesis of directional room impulse responses.

<p class="mathjax">In the field of medical sciences, reliable detection and classification of
brain tumors from images remains a formidable challenge due to the rarity of
tumors within the population of patients. Therefore, the ability to detect
tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and
improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep
learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging
situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML)
comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The
detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive
tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and
pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients
of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with
real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the
testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to
Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the
detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor
region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both
in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data
Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer
(ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification
phase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection
and classification, offering potential advancements in tumor diagnosis for
real-world medical imaging scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Astronomical observations typically provide three-dimensional maps, encoding
the distribution of the observed flux in (1) the two angles of the celestial
sphere and (2) energy/frequency. An important task regarding such maps is to
statistically characterize populations of point sources too dim to be
individually detected. As the properties of a single dim source will be poorly
constrained, instead one commonly studies the population as a whole, inferring
a source-count distribution (SCD) that describes the number density of sources
as a function of their brightness. Statistical and machine learning methods for
recovering SCDs exist; however, they typically entirely neglect spectral
information associated with the energy distribution of the flux. We present a
deep learning framework able to jointly reconstruct the spectra of different
emission components and the SCD of point-source populations. In a
proof-of-concept example, we show that our method accurately extracts even
complex-shaped spectra and SCDs from simulated maps.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen a rapid growth of machine learning in cheminformatics
problems. In order to tackle the problem of insufficient training data in
reality, more and more researchers pay attention to data augmentation
technology. However, few researchers pay attention to the problem of
construction rules and domain information of data, which will directly impact
the quality of augmented data and the augmentation performance. While in
graph-based molecular research, the molecular connectivity index, as a critical
topological index, can directly or indirectly reflect the topology-based
physicochemical properties and biological activities. In this paper, we propose
a novel data augmentation technique that modifies the topology of the molecular
graph to generate augmented data with the same molecular connectivity index as
the original data. The molecular connectivity index combined with data
augmentation technology helps to retain more topology-based molecular
properties information and generate more reliable data. Furthermore, we adopt
five benchmark datasets to test our proposed models, and the results indicate
that the augmented data generated based on important molecular topology
features can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of molecular
properties, which also provides a new perspective on data augmentation in
cheminformatics studies.

<p class="mathjax">Unscheduled islanding events of microgrids result in the transition between
grid-connected and islanded modes and induce a sudden and unknown power
imbalance, posing a threat to frequency security. To achieve seamless
islanding, we propose a distributionally robust frequency-constrained microgrid
scheduling model considering unscheduled islanding events. This model
co-optimizes unit commitments, power dispatch, upward/downward primary
frequency response reserves, virtual inertia provisions from renewable energy
sources (RESs), deloading ratios of RESs, and battery operations, while
ensuring the system frequency security during unscheduled islanding. We
establish an affine relationship between the actual power exchange and RES
uncertainty in grid-connected mode, describe RES uncertainty with a
Wasserstein-metric ambiguity set, and formulate frequency constraints under
uncertain post-islanding power imbalance as distributionally robust quadratic
chance constraints, which are further transformed by a tight conic relaxation.
We solve the proposed mixed-integer convex program and demonstrate its
effectiveness through case studies.

<p class="mathjax">During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the
emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries,
other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The
impact of the variant and the timing of epidemic peaks in a country highly
depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the
spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods
work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest
and has a significant prevalence. The question arises: Can we predict when (and
if) a variant that exists elsewhere will arrive in a given country and reach a
certain prevalence? We propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network
(GNN) approach. First, We derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across
pairs of regions (countries) that applies to a large class of epidemic models.
The dynamics suggest that ratios of variant proportions lead to simpler
patterns. Therefore, we use ratios of variant proportions along with some
parameters estimated from the dynamics as features in a GNN. We develop a
benchmarking tool to evaluate variant emergence prediction over 87 countries
and 36 variants. We leverage this tool to compare our GNN-based approach
against our dynamics-only model and a number of machine learning models.
Results show that the proposed dynamics-informed GNN method retrospectively
outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporates the dynamics in the
loss function.

<p class="mathjax">Speech separation involves extracting an individual speaker's voice from a
multi-speaker audio signal. The increasing complexity of real-world
environments, where multiple speakers might converse simultaneously,
underscores the importance of effective speech separation techniques. This work
presents a single-microphone speaker separation network with TF attention
aiming at noisy and reverberant environments. We dub this new architecture as
Separation TF Attention Network (Sep-TFAnet). In addition, we present a variant
of the separation network, dubbed $ \text{Sep-TFAnet}^{\text{VAD}}$, which
incorporates a voice activity detector (VAD) into the separation network.
<br />The separation module is based on a temporal convolutional network (TCN)
backbone inspired by the Conv-Tasnet architecture with multiple modifications.
Rather than a learned encoder and decoder, we use short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) and inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) for the analysis and
synthesis, respectively. Our system is specially developed for human-robotic
interactions and should support online mode. The separation capabilities of $
\text{Sep-TFAnet}^{\text{VAD}}$ and Sep-TFAnet were evaluated and extensively
analyzed under several acoustic conditions, demonstrating their advantages over
competing methods. Since separation networks trained on simulated data tend to
perform poorly on real recordings, we also demonstrate the ability of the
proposed scheme to better generalize to realistic examples recorded in our
acoustic lab by a humanoid robot. Project page: https://Sep-TFAnet.github.io

<p class="mathjax">Besides training, mathematical optimization is also used in deep learning to
model and solve formulations over trained neural networks for purposes such as
verification, compression, and optimization with learned constraints. However,
solving these formulations soon becomes difficult as the network size grows due
to the weak linear relaxation and dense constraint matrix. We have seen
improvements in recent years with cutting plane algorithms, reformulations, and
an heuristic based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). In this work, we
propose a more scalable heuristic based on exploring global and local linear
relaxations of the neural network model. Our heuristic is competitive with a
state-of-the-art MILP solver and the prior heuristic while producing better
solutions with increases in input, depth, and number of neurons.

<p class="mathjax">Spatial analysis of room acoustics is an ongoing research topic. Microphone
arrays have been employed for spatial analyses with an important objective
being the estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of direct sound and
early room reflections using room impulse responses (RIRs). An optimal method
for DOA estimation is the multiple signal classification algorithm. When RIRs
are considered, this method typically fails due to the correlation of room
reflections, which leads to rank deficiency of the cross-spectrum matrix.
Preprocessing methods for rank restoration, which may involve averaging over
frequency, for example, have been proposed exclusively for spherical arrays.
However, these methods fail in the case of reflections with equal time delays,
which may arise in practice and could be of interest. In this paper, a method
is proposed for systems that combine a spherical microphone array and a
spherical loudspeaker array, referred to as multiple-input multiple-output
systems. This method, referred to as modal smoothing, exploits the additional
spatial diversity for rank restoration and succeeds where previous methods
fail, as demonstrated in a simulation study. Finally, combining modal smoothing
with a preprocessing method is proposed in order to increase the number of DOAs
that can be estimated using low-order spherical loudspeaker arrays.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised speech pre-training methods have developed rapidly in recent
years, which show to be very effective for many near-field single-channel
speech tasks. However, far-field multichannel speech processing is suffering
from the scarcity of labeled multichannel data and complex ambient noises. The
efficacy of self-supervised learning for far-field multichannel and multi-modal
speech processing has not been well explored. Considering that visual
information helps to improve speech recognition performance in noisy scenes, in
this work we propose a multichannel multi-modal speech self-supervised learning
framework AV-wav2vec2, which utilizes video and multichannel audio data as
inputs. First, we propose a multi-path structure to process multichannel audio
streams and a visual stream in parallel, with intra- and inter-channel
contrastive losses as training targets to fully exploit the spatiotemporal
information in multichannel speech data. Second, based on contrastive learning,
we use additional single-channel audio data, which is trained jointly to
improve the performance of speech representation. Finally, we use a Chinese
multichannel multi-modal dataset in real scenarios to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR),
automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR) and
audio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD) tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Spatial attributes of room acoustics have been widely studied using
microphone and loudspeaker arrays. However, systems that combine both arrays,
referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, have only been
studied to a limited degree in this context. These systems can potentially
provide a powerful tool for room acoustics analysis due to the ability to
simultaneously control both arrays. This paper offers a theoretical framework
for the spatial analysis of enclosed sound fields using a MIMO system
comprising spherical loudspeaker and microphone arrays. A system transfer
function is formulated in matrix form for free-field conditions, and its
properties are studied using tools from linear algebra. The system is shown to
have unit-rank, regardless of the array types, and its singular vectors are
related to the directions of arrival and radiation at the microphone and
loudspeaker arrays, respectively. The formulation is then generalized to apply
to rooms, using an image source method. In this case, the rank of the system is
related to the number of significant reflections. The paper ends with
simulation studies, which support the developed theory, and with an extensive
reflection analysis of a room impulse response, using the platform of a MIMO
system.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the inherent flexibility of prompting, foundation models have emerged
as the predominant force in the fields of natural language processing and
computer vision. The recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
signifies a noteworthy expansion of the prompt-driven paradigm into the domain
of image segmentation, thereby introducing a plethora of previously unexplored
capabilities. However, the viability of its application to medical image
segmentation remains uncertain, given the substantial distinctions between
natural and medical images. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview
of recent endeavors aimed at extending the efficacy of SAM to medical image
segmentation tasks, encompassing both empirical benchmarking and methodological
adaptations. Additionally, we explore potential avenues for future research
directions in SAM's role within medical image segmentation. While direct
application of SAM to medical image segmentation does not yield satisfactory
performance on multi-modal and multi-target medical datasets so far, numerous
insights gleaned from these efforts serve as valuable guidance for shaping the
trajectory of foundational models in the realm of medical image analysis. To
support ongoing research endeavors, we maintain an active repository that
contains an up-to-date paper list and a succinct summary of open-source
projects at https://github.com/YichiZhang98/SAM4MIS.

<p class="mathjax">Audio self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training, which aims to learn good
representations from unlabeled audio, has made remarkable progress. However,
the extensive computational demands during pre-training pose a significant
barrier to the potential application and optimization of audio SSL models. In
this paper, inspired by the success of data2vec 2.0 in image modality and
Audio-MAE in audio modality, we introduce Efficient Audio Transformer (EAT) to
further improve the effectiveness and efficiency in audio SSL. The proposed EAT
adopts the bootstrap self-supervised training paradigm to the audio domain. A
novel Utterance-Frame Objective (UFO) is designed to enhance the modeling
capability of acoustic events. Furthermore, we reveal that the masking strategy
is critical in audio SSL pre-training, and superior audio representations can
be obtained with large inverse block masks. Experiment results demonstrate that
EAT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a range of audio-related
tasks, including AudioSet (AS-2M, AS-20K), ESC-50, and SPC-2, along with a
significant pre-training speedup up to ~15x compared to existing audio SSL
models.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce DiarizationLM, a framework to leverage large
language models (LLM) to post-process the outputs from a speaker diarization
system. Various goals can be achieved with the proposed framework, such as
improving the readability of the diarized transcript, or reducing the word
diarization error rate (WDER). In this framework, the outputs of the automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization systems are represented as a
compact textual format, which is included in the prompt to an optionally
finetuned LLM. The outputs of the LLM can be used as the refined diarization
results with the desired enhancement. As a post-processing step, this framework
can be easily applied to any off-the-shelf ASR and speaker diarization systems
without retraining existing components. Our experiments show that a finetuned
PaLM 2-S model can reduce the WDER by rel. 25.9% on the Fisher telephone
conversation dataset, and rel. 31% on the Callhome English dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we explore the task of hierarchical distance-based speech
separation defined on a hyperbolic manifold. Based on the recent advent of
audio-related tasks performed in non-Euclidean spaces, we propose to make use
of the Poincar\'e ball to effectively unveil the inherent hierarchical
structure found in complex speaker mixtures. We design two sets of experiments
in which the distance-based parent sound classes, namely "near" and "far", can
contain up to two or three speakers (i.e., children) each. We show that our
hyperbolic approach is suitable for unveiling hierarchical structure from the
problem definition, resulting in improved child-level separation. We further
show that a clear correlation emerges between the notion of hyperbolic
certainty (i.e., the distance to the ball's origin) and acoustic semantics such
as speaker density, inter-source location, and microphone-to-speaker distance.

<p class="mathjax">RNA secondary structure is modeled with the novel arbitrary-order hidden
Markov model ({\alpha}-HMM). The {\alpha}-HMM extends over the traditional HMM
with capability to model stochastic events that may be in influenced by
historically distant ones, making it suitable to account for long-range
canonical base pairings between nucleotides, which constitute the RNA secondary
structure. Unlike previous heavy-weight extensions over HMM, the {\alpha}-HMM
has the flexibility to apply restrictions on how one event may influence
another in stochastic processes, enabling efficient prediction of RNA secondary
structure including pseudoknots.

<p class="mathjax">Optical turbulence presents a significant challenge for communication,
directed energy, and imaging systems, especially in the atmospheric boundary
layer. Effective modeling of optical turbulence strength is critical for the
development and deployment of these systems. The lack of standard evaluation
tools, especially long-term data sets, modeling tasks, metrics, and baseline
models, prevent effective comparisons between approaches and models. This
reduces the ease of reproducing results and contributes to over-fitting on
local micro-climates. Performance characterized using evaluation metrics
provides some insight into the applicability of a model for predicting the
strength of optical turbulence. However, these metrics are not sufficient for
understanding the relative quality of a model. We introduce the
\texttt{otbench} package, a Python package for rigorous development and
evaluation of optical turbulence strength prediction models. The package
provides a consistent interface for evaluating optical turbulence models on a
variety of benchmark tasks and data sets. The \texttt{otbench} package includes
a range of baseline models, including statistical, data-driven, and deep
learning models, to provide a sense of relative model quality. \texttt{otbench}
also provides support for adding new data sets, tasks, and evaluation metrics.

<p class="mathjax">This study proposes a Newton based multiple objective optimization algorithm
for hyperparameter search. The first order differential (gradient) is
calculated using finite difference method and a gradient matrix with
vectorization is formed for fast computation. The Newton Raphson iterative
solution is used to update model parameters with iterations, and a
regularization term is included to eliminate the singularity issue. The
algorithm is applied to search the optimal probability threshold (a vector of
eight parameters) for a multiclass object detection problem of a convolutional
neural network. The algorithm quickly finds the improved parameter values to
produce an overall higher true positive (TP) and lower false positive (FP)
rates, as compared to using the default value of 0.5. In comparison, the
Bayesian optimization generates lower performance in the testing case. However,
the performance and parameter values may oscillate for some cases during
iterations, which may be due to the data driven stochastic nature of the
subject. Therefore, the optimal parameter value can be identified from a list
of iteration steps according to the optimal TP and FP results.

<p class="mathjax">Myopic macular degeneration is the most common complication of myopia and the
primary cause of vision loss in individuals with pathological myopia. Early
detection and prompt treatment are crucial in preventing vision impairment due
to myopic maculopathy. This was the focus of the Myopic Maculopathy Analysis
Challenge (MMAC), in which we participated. In task 1, classification of myopic
maculopathy, we employed the contrastive learning framework, specifically
SimCLR, to enhance classification accuracy by effectively capturing enriched
features from unlabeled data. This approach not only improved the intrinsic
understanding of the data but also elevated the performance of our
classification model. For Task 2 (segmentation of myopic maculopathy plus
lesions), we have developed independent segmentation models tailored for
different lesion segmentation tasks and implemented a test-time augmentation
strategy to further enhance the model's performance. As for Task 3 (prediction
of spherical equivalent), we have designed a deep regression model based on the
data distribution of the dataset and employed an integration strategy to
enhance the model's prediction accuracy. The results we obtained are promising
and have allowed us to position ourselves in the Top 6 of the classification
task, the Top 2 of the segmentation task, and the Top 1 of the prediction task.

categorize ML and DL methods by TBI severity and showcase their application in
mTBI and moderate-to-severe TBI scenarios. Finally, we emphasize the role of ML
and DL in mTBI diagnosis, where conventional methods often fall short, and
comment on the potential of CT-based ML applications in TBI. This review may
serve as a source of inspiration for future research endeavours aimed at
improving the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.

<p class="mathjax">The visual pathway involves complex networks of cells and regions which
contribute to the encoding and processing of visual information. While some
aspects of visual perception are understood, there are still many unanswered
questions regarding the exact mechanisms of visual encoding and the
organization of visual information along the pathway. This chapter discusses
the importance of visual perception and the challenges associated with
understanding how visual information is encoded and represented in the brain.
Furthermore, this chapter introduces the concept of neuroprostheses: devices
designed to enhance or replace bodily functions, and highlights the importance
of constructing computational models of the visual pathway in the
implementation of such devices. A number of such models, employing the use of
deep learning models, are outlined, and their value to understanding visual
coding and natural vision is discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Clipping is a common nonlinear distortion that occurs whenever the input or
output of an audio system exceeds the supported range. This phenomenon
undermines not only the perception of speech quality but also downstream
processes utilizing the disrupted signal. Therefore, a real-time-capable,
robust, and low-response-time method for speech declipping (SD) is desired. In
this work, we introduce DDD (Demucs-Discriminator-Declipper), a
real-time-capable speech-declipping deep neural network (DNN) that requires
less response time by design. We first observe that a previously untested
real-time-capable DNN model, Demucs, exhibits a reasonable declipping
performance. Then we utilize adversarial learning objectives to increase the
perceptual quality of output speech without additional inference overhead.
Subjective evaluations on harshly clipped speech shows that DDD outperforms the
baselines by a wide margin in terms of speech quality. We perform detailed
waveform and spectral analyses to gain an insight into the output behavior of
DDD in comparison to the baselines. Finally, our streaming simulations also
show that DDD is capable of sub-decisecond mean response times, outperforming
the state-of-the-art DNN approach by a factor of six.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on the classification task of breast ultrasound images and
researches on the reliability measurement of classification results. We
proposed a dual-channel evaluation framework based on the proposed inference
reliability and predictive reliability scores. For the inference reliability
evaluation, human-aligned and doctor-agreed inference rationales based on the
improved feature attribution algorithm SP-RISA are gracefully applied.
Uncertainty quantification is used to evaluate the predictive reliability via
the Test Time Enhancement. The effectiveness of this reliability evaluation
framework has been verified on our breast ultrasound clinical dataset YBUS, and
its robustness is verified on the public dataset BUSI. The expected calibration
errors on both datasets are significantly lower than traditional evaluation
methods, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed reliability
measurement.

<p class="mathjax">Packet loss is a common and unavoidable problem in voice over internet phone
(VoIP) systems. To deal with the problem, we propose a band-split packet loss
concealment network (BS-PLCNet). Specifically, we split the full-band signal
into wide-band (0-8kHz) and high-band (8-24kHz). The wide-band signals are
processed by a gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN), while the
high-band counterpart is processed by a simple GRU network. To ensure high
speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) compatibility, multi-task
learning (MTL) framework including fundamental frequency (f0) prediction,
linguistic awareness, and multi-discriminators are used. The proposed approach
tied for 1st place in the ICASSP 2024 PLC Challenge.

<p class="mathjax">Many factors have separately shown their effectiveness on improving
multilingual ASR. They include language identity (LID) and phoneme information,
language-specific processing modules and cross-lingual self-supervised speech
representation, etc. However, few studies work on synergistically combining
them to contribute a unified solution, which still remains an open question. To
this end, a novel view to incorporate hierarchical information path LUPET into
multilingual ASR is proposed. The LUPET is a path encoding multiple information
in different granularity from shallow to deep encoder layers. Early information
in this path is beneficial for deriving later occurred information.
Specifically, the input goes from LID prediction to acoustic unit discovery
followed by phoneme sharing, and then dynamically routed by mixture-of-expert
for final token recognition. Experiments on 10 languages of Common Voice
examined the superior performance of LUPET. Importantly, LUPET significantly
boosts the recognition on high-resource languages, thus mitigating the
compromised phenomenon towards low-resource languages in a multilingual
setting.

<p class="mathjax">Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and
inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by
the increasing needs of an aging population, the over-subscription of existing
services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the
intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning
and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting
optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for
state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper
introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem
(JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called AGGNNI-CG (Attention and Gated
GNN- Informed Column Generation), that hybridizes column generation and machine
learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with the real-time
constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component
is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing
component, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column
generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an
attention mechanism and a gated architecture, that is particularly suited to
cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has
been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system
of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces dramatic improvements compared to the
baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce feasible
solutions in reasonable time on both medium-sized and large-scale complex
instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service compared
to the existing system.

<p class="mathjax">The measurement of deep water gravity wave elevations using in-situ devices,
such as wave gauges, typically yields spatially sparse data. This sparsity
arises from the deployment of a limited number of gauges due to their
installation effort and high operational costs. The reconstruction of the
spatio-temporal extent of surface elevation poses an ill-posed data
assimilation problem, challenging to solve with conventional numerical
techniques. To address this issue, we propose the application of a
physics-informed neural network (PINN), aiming to reconstruct physically
consistent wave fields between two designated measurement locations several
meters apart.
<br />Our method ensures this physical consistency by integrating residuals of the
hydrodynamic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) into the PINN's loss
function. Using synthetic wave elevation time series from distinct locations
within a wave tank, we initially achieve successful reconstruction quality by
employing constant, predetermined NLSE coefficients. However, the
reconstruction quality is further improved by introducing NLSE coefficients as
additional identifiable variables during PINN training. The results not only
showcase a technically relevant application of the PINN method but also
represent a pioneering step towards improving the initialization of
deterministic wave prediction methods.

<p class="mathjax">Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enabled by unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology to facilitate target tracking
applications. In contrast to conventional UAV-based ISAC system designs that
mainly focus on estimating the target position, the target velocity estimation
also needs to be considered due to its crucial impacts on link maintenance and
real-time response, which requires new designs on resource allocation and
tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based
tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving
object and also communicates with a device attached to the object.
Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB)
for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing
the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the
successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with
the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is
obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity.
Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB
minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when
predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the
effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme. Moreover, three interesting
trade-offs on system performance resulted from the fixed elevation angle are
illustrated.

<p class="mathjax">Incorporating neural networks for the solution of Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs) represents a pivotal research direction within computational
mathematics. Within neural network architectures, the integration of the
intrinsic structure of ODEs offers advantages such as enhanced predictive
capabilities and reduced data utilization. Among these structural ODE forms,
the Lagrangian representation stands out due to its significant physical
underpinnings. Building upon this framework, Bhattoo introduced the concept of
Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs). Then in this article, we introduce a
groundbreaking extension (Genralized Lagrangian Neural Networks) to Lagrangian
Neural Networks (LNNs), innovatively tailoring them for non-conservative
systems. By leveraging the foundational importance of the Lagrangian within
Lagrange's equations, we formulate the model based on the generalized
Lagrange's equation. This modification not only enhances prediction accuracy
but also guarantees Lagrangian representation in non-conservative systems.
Furthermore, we perform various experiments, encompassing 1-dimensional and
2-dimensional examples, along with an examination of the impact of network
parameters, which proved the superiority of Generalized Lagrangian Neural
Networks(GLNNs).

<p class="mathjax">Color plays a crucial role in the visualization, interpretation, and analysis
of multi-wavelength astronomical images. However, generating color images that
accurately represent the full dynamic range of astronomical sources is
challenging. In response, Gnuastro v0.22 introduces the program
'astscript-color-faint-gray', which is extensively documented in the Gnuastro
manual. It employs a non-linear transformation to assign an 8-bit RGB
(Red-Green-Blue) value to brighter pixels, while the fainter ones are shown in
an inverse grayscale. This approach enables the simultaneous visualization of
low surface brightness features within the same image. This research note is
reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 48f5408.

<p class="mathjax">This research is about the creation of personalized synthetic voices for head
and neck cancer survivors. It is focused particularly on tongue cancer patients
whose speech might exhibit severe articulation impairment. Our goal is to
restore normal articulation in the synthesized speech, while maximally
preserving the target speaker's individuality in terms of both the voice timbre
and speaking style. This is formulated as a task of learning from noisy labels.
We propose to augment the commonly used speech reconstruction loss with two
additional terms. The first term constitutes a regularization loss that
mitigates the impact of distorted articulation in the training speech. The
second term is a consistency loss that encourages correct articulation in the
generated speech. These additional loss terms are obtained from frame-level
articulation scores of original and generated speech, which are derived using a
separately trained phone classifier. Experimental results on a real case of
tongue cancer patient confirm that the synthetic voice achieves comparable
articulation quality to unimpaired natural speech, while effectively
maintaining the target speaker's individuality. Audio samples are available at

<p class="mathjax">Estimating a covariance matrix and its associated principal components is a
fundamental problem in contemporary statistics. While optimal estimation
procedures have been developed with well-understood properties, the increasing
demand for privacy preservation introduces new complexities to this classical
problem. In this paper, we study optimal differentially private Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and covariance estimation within the spiked covariance
model.
<br />We precisely characterize the sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
under this model and establish the minimax rates of convergence for estimating
both the principal components and covariance matrix. These rates hold up to
logarithmic factors and encompass general Schatten norms, including spectral
norm, Frobenius norm, and nuclear norm as special cases.
<br />We introduce computationally efficient differentially private estimators and
prove their minimax optimality, up to logarithmic factors. Additionally,
matching minimax lower bounds are established. Notably, in comparison with
existing literature, our results accommodate a diverging rank, necessitate no
eigengap condition between distinct principal components, and remain valid even
if the sample size is much smaller than the dimension.

<p class="mathjax">This paper delves into the analysis of nonlinear deformation induced by
dielectric actuation in pre-stressed ideal dielectric elastomers. It formulates
a nonlinear ordinary differential equation governing this deformation based on
the hyperelastic model under dielectric stress. Through numerical integration
and neural network approximations, the relationship between voltage and stretch
is established. Neural networks are employed to approximate solutions for
voltage-to-stretch and stretch-to-voltage transformations obtained via an
explicit Runge-Kutta method. The effectiveness of these approximations is
demonstrated by leveraging them for compensating nonlinearity through the
waveshaping of the input signal. The comparative analysis highlights the
superior accuracy of the approximated solutions over baseline methods,
resulting in minimized harmonic distortions when utilizing dielectric
elastomers as acoustic actuators. This study underscores the efficacy of the
proposed approach in mitigating nonlinearities and enhancing the performance of
dielectric elastomers in acoustic actuation applications.

<p class="mathjax">Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a crucial means for crystal structure
determination. Such determination often involves external database matching to
find a structural analogue and Rietveld refinement to obtain finer structure.
However, databases may be incomplete and Rietveld refinement often requires
intensive trial-and-error efforts from trained experimentalists, which remains
ineffective in practice. To settle these issues, we propose XtalNet, the first
end-to-end deep learning-based framework capable of ab initio generation of
crystal structures that accurately match given PXRD patterns. The model employs
contrastive learning and Diffusion-based conditional generation to enable the
simultaneous execution of two tasks: crystal structure retrieval based on PXRD
patterns and conditional structure generations. To validate the effectiveness
of XtalNet, we curate a much more challenging and practical dataset hMOF-100,
XtalNet performs well on this dataset, reaching 96.3\% top-10 hit ratio on the
database retrieval task and 95.0\% top-10 match rate on the ranked structure
generation task.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from noise arising from both
intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Leveraging domain knowledge
specific to HSIs, such as global spectral correlation (GSC) and non-local
spatial self-similarity (NSS), is crucial for effective denoising. Existing
methods tend to independently utilize each of these knowledge components with
multiple blocks, overlooking the inherent 3D nature of HSIs where domain
knowledge is strongly interlinked, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a spatial-spectral recurrent
transformer U-Net (SSRT-UNet) for HSI denoising. The proposed SSRT-UNet
integrates NSS and GSC properties within a single SSRT block. This block
consists of a spatial branch and a spectral branch. The spectral branch employs
a combination of transformer and recurrent neural network to perform recurrent
computations across bands, allowing for GSC exploitation beyond a fixed number
of bands. Concurrently, the spatial branch encodes NSS for each band by sharing
keys and values with the spectral branch under the guidance of GSC. This
interaction between the two branches enables the joint utilization of NSS and
GSC, avoiding their independent treatment. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms several alternative approaches. The source code
will be available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSRT.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new mean-field ODE and corresponding interacting particle
systems for sampling from an unnormalized target density or Bayesian posterior.
The interacting particle systems are gradient-free, available in closed form,
and only require the ability to sample from the reference density and compute
the (unnormalized) target-to-reference density ratio. The mean-field ODE is
obtained by solving a Poisson equation for a velocity field that transports
samples along the geometric mixture of the two densities, which is the path of
a particular Fisher-Rao gradient flow. We employ a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space ansatz for the velocity field, which makes the Poisson equation tractable
and enables us to discretize the resulting mean-field ODE over finite samples,
as a simple interacting particle system. The mean-field ODE can be additionally
be derived from a discrete-time perspective as the limit of successive
linearizations of the Monge-Amp\`ere equations within a framework known as
sample-driven optimal transport. We demonstrate empirically that our
interacting particle systems can produce high-quality samples from
distributions with varying characteristics.

<p class="mathjax">The assessment of breast density is crucial in the context of breast cancer
screening, especially in populations with a higher percentage of dense breast
tissues. This study introduces a novel data augmentation technique termed
Attention-Guided Erasing (AGE), devised to enhance the downstream
classification of four distinct breast density categories in mammography
following the BI-RADS recommendation in the Vietnamese cohort. The proposed
method integrates supplementary information during transfer learning, utilizing
visual attention maps derived from a vision transformer backbone trained using
the self-supervised DINO method. These maps are utilized to erase background
regions in the mammogram images, unveiling only the potential areas of dense
breast tissues to the network. Through the incorporation of AGE during transfer
learning with varying random probabilities, we consistently surpass
classification performance compared to scenarios without AGE and the
traditional random erasing transformation. We validate our methodology using
the publicly available VinDr-Mammo dataset. Specifically, we attain a mean
F1-score of 0.5910, outperforming values of 0.5594 and 0.5691 corresponding to
scenarios without AGE and with random erasing (RE), respectively. This
superiority is further substantiated by t-tests, revealing a p-value of
p&lt;0.0001, underscoring the statistical significance of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, poses a growing
global challenge and underscores the urgency of accurate and early diagnosis.
The clinical technique radiologists adopt for distinguishing between mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using Machine Resonance Imaging (MRI)
encounter hurdles because they are not consistent and reliable. Machine
learning has been shown to offer promise for early AD diagnosis. However,
existing models focused on focal fine-grain features without considerations to
focal structural features that give off information on neurodegeneration of the
brain cerebral cortex. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates Gamma correction, an image enhancement technique, and
includes a structure-focused neurodegeneration convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture called SNeurodCNN for discriminating between AD and MCI. The
ML framework leverages the mid-sagittal and para-sagittal brain image
viewpoints of the structure-focused Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) dataset. Through experiments, our proposed machine learning framework
shows exceptional performance. The parasagittal viewpoint set achieves 97.8%
accuracy, with 97.0% specificity and 98.5% sensitivity. The midsagittal
viewpoint is shown to present deeper insights into the structural brain changes
given the increase in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, which are 98.1%
97.2%, and 99.0%, respectively. Using GradCAM technique, we show that our
proposed model is capable of capturing the structural dynamics of MCI and AD
which exist about the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and parietal
lobe. Therefore, our model itself as a potential brain structural change
Digi-Biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.

<p class="mathjax">Characterizing the distribution of high-dimensional statistical estimators is
a challenging task, due to the breakdown of classical asymptotic theory in high
dimension. This paper makes progress towards this by developing non-asymptotic
distributional characterizations for approximate message passing (AMP) -- a
family of iterative algorithms that prove effective as both fast estimators and
powerful theoretical machinery -- for both sparse and robust regression. Prior
AMP theory, which focused on high-dimensional asymptotics for the most part,
failed to describe the behavior of AMP when the number of iterations exceeds
$o\big({\log n}/{\log \log n}\big)$ (with $n$ the sample size). We establish
the first finite-sample non-asymptotic distributional theory of AMP for both
sparse and robust regression that accommodates a polynomial number of
iterations. Our results derive approximate accuracy of Gaussian approximation
of the AMP iterates, which improves upon all prior results and implies enhanced
distributional characterizations for both optimally tuned Lasso and robust
M-estimator.

<p class="mathjax">Most recent speech privacy efforts have focused on anonymizing acoustic
speaker attributes but there has not been as much research into protecting
information from speech content. We introduce a toy problem that explores an
emerging type of privacy called "content masking" which conceals selected words
and phrases in speech. In our efforts to define this problem space, we evaluate
an introductory baseline masking technique based on modifying sequences of
discrete phone representations (phone codes) produced from a pre-trained
vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and re-synthesized using
WaveRNN. We investigate three different masking locations and three types of
masking strategies: noise substitution, word deletion, and phone sequence
reversal. Our work attempts to characterize how masking affects two downstream
tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speaker verification
(ASV). We observe how the different masks types and locations impact these
downstream tasks and discuss how these issues may influence privacy goals.

<p class="mathjax">What is the power of polynomial-time quantum computation with access to an NP
oracle? In this work, we focus on two fundamental tasks from the study of
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems: search-to-decision reductions, and
approximate counting. We first show that, in strong contrast to the classical
setting where a poly-time Turing machine requires $\Theta(n)$ queries to an NP
oracle to compute a witness to a given SAT formula, quantumly $\Theta(\log n)$
queries suffice. We then show this is tight in the black-box model - any
quantum algorithm with "NP-like" query access to a formula requires
$\Omega(\log n)$ queries to extract a solution with constant probability.
Moving to approximate counting of SAT solutions, by exploiting a quantum link
between search-to-decision reductions and approximate counting, we show that
existing classical approximate counting algorithms are likely optimal. First,
we give a lower bound in the "NP-like" black-box query setting: Approximate
counting requires $\Omega(\log n)$ queries, even on a quantum computer. We then
give a "white-box" lower bound (i.e. where the input formula is not hidden in
the oracle) - if there exists a randomized poly-time classical or quantum
algorithm for approximate counting making $o(log n)$ NP queries, then
$\text{BPP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$ contains a $\text{P}^{\text{NP}}$-complete
problem if the algorithm is classical and $\text{FBQP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$
contains an $\text{FP}^{\text{NP}}$-complete problem if the algorithm is
quantum.

<p class="mathjax">In bilevel optimization problems, a leader and a follower make their
decisions in a hierarchy, and both decisions influence each other. Usually one
assumes that both players have full knowledge also of the other player's data.
In a more realistic model, uncertainty can be quantified, e.g., using the
robust optimization approach: We assume that the leader does not know the
follower's objective precisely, but only up to some uncertainty set, and her
aim is to optimize the worst case of the corresponding scenarios. Now the
question arises how the complexity of bilevel optimization changes under the
additional complications of this uncertainty.
<br />We make a further step towards answering this question by examining an easy
bilevel problem. In the Bilevel Selection Problem (BSP), the leader and the
follower each select some items, while a common number of items to select in
total is given, and each player minimizes the total costs of the selected
items, according to different sets of item costs. We show that the BSP can be
solved in polynomial time and then investigate its robust version. If the item
sets controlled by the players are disjoint, it can still be solved in
polynomial time for several types of uncertainty sets. Otherwise, we show that
the Robust BSP is NP-hard and present a 2-approximation algorithm and exact
exponential-time approaches.
<br />Furthermore, we investigate variants of the BSP where one or both of the two
players take a continuous decision. One variant leads to an example of a
bilevel optimization problem whose optimum value may not be attained. For the
Robust Continuous BSP, where all variables are continuous, we also develop a
new approach for the setting of discrete uncorrelated uncertainty, which gives
a polynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Continuous BSP and a
pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Bilevel Continuous Knapsack
Problem.

<p class="mathjax">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are important for studying the
biology of development or diseases at single-cell level. To better understand
the properties of the data, to build controlled benchmark data for testing
downstream methods, and to augment data when collecting sufficient real data is
challenging, generative models have been proposed to computationally generate
synthetic scRNA-seq data. However, the data generated with current models are
not very realistic yet, especially when we need to generate data with
controlled conditions. In the meantime, the Diffusion models have shown their
power in generating data in computer vision at high fidelity, providing a new
opportunity for scRNA-seq generation.
<br />In this study, we developed scDiffusion, a diffusion-based model to generate
high-quality scRNA-seq data with controlled conditions. We designed multiple
classifiers to guide the diffusion process simultaneously, enabling scDiffusion
to generate data under multiple condition combinations. We also proposed a new
control strategy called Gradient Interpolation. This strategy allows the model
to generate continuous trajectories of cell development from a given cell
state.
<br />Experiments showed that scDiffusion can generate single-cell gene expression
data closely resembling real scRNA-seq data, surpassing state-of-the-art models
in multiple metrics. Also, scDiffusion can conditionally produce data on
specific cell types including rare cell types. Furthermore, we could use the
multiple-condition generation of scDiffusion to generate cell type that was out
of the training data. Leveraging the Gradient Interpolation strategy, we
generated a continuous developmental trajectory of mouse embryonic cells. These
experiments demonstrate that scDiffusion is a powerful tool for augmenting the
real scRNA-seq data and can provide insights into cell fate research.

<p class="mathjax">We consider cost allocation for set covering problems. We allocate as much
cost to the elements (players) as possible without violating the group
rationality condition (no subset of players pays more than covering this subset
would cost), and so that the excess vector is lexicographically maximized. This
is identical to the well-known nucleolus if the core of the corresponding
cooperative game is nonempty, i.e., if some optimum fractional cover is
integral. In general, we call this the 'happy nucleolus'. Like for the
nucleolus, the excess vector contains an entry for every subset of players, not
only for the sets in the given set covering instance. Moreover, it is NP-hard
to compute a single entry because this requires solving a set covering problem.
Nevertheless, we give an explicit family of at most $mn$ subsets, each with a
trivial cover (by a single set), such that the happy nucleolus is always
completely determined by this proxy excess vector; here $m$ and $n$ denote the
number of sets and the number of players in our set covering instance. We show
that this is the unique minimal such family in a natural sense. While computing
the nucleolus for set covering is NP-hard, our results imply that the happy
nucleolus can be computed in polynomial time.

<p class="mathjax">Histopathology plays a central role in clinical medicine and biomedical
research. While artificial intelligence shows promising results on many
pathological tasks, generalization and dealing with rare diseases, where
training data is scarce, remains a challenge. Distilling knowledge from
unlabeled data into a foundation model before learning from, potentially
limited, labeled data provides a viable path to address these challenges. In
this work, we extend the state of the art of foundation models for digital
pathology whole slide images by semi-automated data curation and incorporating
pathologist domain knowledge. Specifically, we combine computational and
pathologist domain knowledge (1) to curate a diverse dataset of 103k slides
corresponding to 750 million image patches covering data from different
fixation, staining, and scanning protocols as well as data from different
indications and labs across the EU and US, (2) for grouping semantically
similar slides and tissue patches, and (3) to augment the input images during
training. We evaluate the resulting model on a set of public and internal
benchmarks and show that although our foundation model is trained with an order
of magnitude less slides, it performs on par or better than competing models.
We expect that scaling our approach to more data and larger models will further
increase its performance and capacity to deal with increasingly complex real
world tasks in diagnostics and biomedical research.

<p class="mathjax">Protein design often begins with knowledge of a desired function from a motif
which motif-scaffolding aims to construct a functional protein around.
Recently, generative models have achieved breakthrough success in designing
scaffolds for a diverse range of motifs. However, the generated scaffolds tend
to lack structural diversity, which can hinder success in wet-lab validation.
In this work, we extend FrameFlow, an SE(3) flow matching model for protein
backbone generation, to perform motif-scaffolding with two complementary
approaches. The first is motif amortization, in which FrameFlow is trained with
the motif as input using a data augmentation strategy. The second is motif
guidance, which performs scaffolding using an estimate of the conditional score
from FrameFlow, and requires no additional training. Both approaches achieve an
equivalent or higher success rate than previous state-of-the-art methods, with
2.5 times more structurally diverse scaffolds. Code: https://github.com/

<p class="mathjax">In this manuscript, we present various proposed methods estimate the
prevalence of disease, a critical prerequisite for the adequate interpretation
of screening tests. To address the limitations of these approaches, which
revolve primarily around their a posteriori nature, we introduce a novel method
to estimate the pretest probability of disease, a priori, utilizing the Logit
function from the logistic regression model. This approach is a modification of
McGee's heuristic, originally designed for estimating the posttest probability
of disease. In a patient presenting with $n_\theta$ signs or symptoms, the
minimal bound of the pretest probability, $\phi$, can be approximated by:
<br />$\phi \approx
\frac{1}{5}{ln\left[\displaystyle\prod_{\theta=1}^{i}\kappa_\theta\right]}$

ratio associated with the sign or symptom in question.
