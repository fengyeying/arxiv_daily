<p class="mathjax">Climate change and global warming have been trending topics worldwide since
the Eco-92 conference. However, little progress has been made in reducing
greenhouse gases (GHGs). The problems and challenges related to emissions are
complex and require a concerted and comprehensive effort to address them.
Emissions reporting is a critical component of GHG reduction policy and is
therefore the focus of this work. The main goal of this work is two-fold: (i)
to propose an emission reporting evaluation model to leverage emissions
reporting overall quality and (ii) to use artificial intelligence (AI) to
support the initiatives that improve emissions reporting. Thus, this work
presents an Emissions Reporting Maturity Model (ERMM) for examining,
clustering, and analysing data from emissions reporting initiatives to help the
cities to deal with climate change and global warming challenges. The
Performance Indicator Development Process (PIDP) proposed in this work provides
ways to leverage the quality of the available data necessary for the execution
of the evaluations identified by the ERMM. Hence, the PIDP supports the
preparation of the data from emissions-related databases, the classification of
the data according to similarities highlighted by different clustering
techniques, and the identification of performance indicator candidates, which
are strengthened by a qualitative analysis of selected data samples. Thus, the
main goal of ERRM is to evaluate and classify the cities regarding the emission
reporting processes, pointing out the drawbacks and challenges faced by other
cities from different contexts, and at the end to help them to leverage the
underlying emissions-related processes and emissions mitigation initiatives.

<p class="mathjax">Data science pipelines commonly utilize dataframe and array operations for
tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. The most
popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are
limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing
large-scale data. Several systems have attempted to distribute data science
applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node
libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without
significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing
large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data
partitioning. To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a
high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to
distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar
APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch
between graph construction and graph execution. Xorbits has been successfully
deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications
span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation
systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk
management in the finance industry. Users can easily scale their data science
workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code.
Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large
datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems. Over the fastest
state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66* speedup on
average. In terms of API coverage, Xorbits attains a compatibility rate of
96.7%, surpassing the fastest framework by an impressive margin of 60
percentage points. Xorbits is available at https:

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we show how tensor networks help in developing explainability
of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised
clustering algorithm based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and apply it in the
context of a real use-case of adversary-generated threat intelligence. Our
investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as
autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer
model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of
feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information,
offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering
an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something
fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence
decisions.

<p class="mathjax">In the evolving field of machine learning, video generation has witnessed
significant advancements with autoregressive-based transformer models and
diffusion models, known for synthesizing dynamic and realistic scenes. However,
these models often face challenges with prolonged inference times, even for
generating short video clips such as GIFs. This paper introduces FlashVideo, a
novel framework tailored for swift Text-to-Video generation. FlashVideo
represents the first successful adaptation of the RetNet architecture for video
generation, bringing a unique approach to the field. Leveraging the
RetNet-based architecture, FlashVideo reduces the time complexity of inference
from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for a sequence of length $L$,
significantly accelerating inference speed. Additionally, we adopt a
redundant-free frame interpolation method, enhancing the efficiency of frame
interpolation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FlashVideo
achieves a $\times9.17$ efficiency improvement over a traditional
autoregressive-based transformer model, and its inference speed is of the same
order of magnitude as that of BERT-based transformer models.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven powerful, but the risk of privacy
leakage remains a significant concern. Traditional privacy-preserving methods,
such as Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption, are inadequate for
black-box API-only settings, demanding either model transparency or heavy
computational resources. We propose Prompt2Forget (P2F), the first framework
designed to tackle the LLM local privacy challenge by teaching LLM to forget.
The method involves decomposing full questions into smaller segments,
generating fabricated answers, and obfuscating the model's memory of the
original input. A benchmark dataset was crafted with questions containing
privacy-sensitive information from diverse fields. P2F achieves zero-shot
generalization, allowing adaptability across a wide range of use cases without
manual adjustments. Experimental results indicate P2F's robust capability to
obfuscate LLM's memory, attaining a forgetfulness score of around 90\% without
any utility loss. This represents an enhancement of up to 63\% when contrasted
with the naive direct instruction technique, highlighting P2F's efficacy in
mitigating memory retention of sensitive information within LLMs. Our findings
establish the first benchmark in the novel field of the LLM forgetting task,
representing a meaningful advancement in privacy preservation in the emerging
LLM domain.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying spatially complete planar primitives from visual data is a
crucial task in computer vision. Prior methods are largely restricted to either
2D segment recovery or simplifying 3D structures, even with extensive plane
annotations. We present PlanarNeRF, a novel framework capable of detecting
dense 3D planes through online learning. Drawing upon the neural field
representation, PlanarNeRF brings three major contributions. First, it enhances
3D plane detection with concurrent appearance and geometry knowledge. Second, a
lightweight plane fitting module is proposed to estimate plane parameters.
Third, a novel global memory bank structure with an update mechanism is
introduced, ensuring consistent cross-frame correspondence. The flexible
architecture of PlanarNeRF allows it to function in both 2D-supervised and
self-supervised solutions, in each of which it can effectively learn from
sparse training signals, significantly improving training efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanarNeRF in
various scenarios and remarkable improvement over existing works.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning is a popular and powerful method for utilizing large
amounts of unlabeled data, for which a wide variety of training objectives have
been proposed in the literature. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis
of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the
underlying probabilistic graphical models in each class and presenting a
standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The
analysis also indicates a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning
with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the
realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing
a novel lower bound which is proven to reliably penalize the most important
failure modes. Furthermore, this newly proposed lower bound enables the
training of a standard backbone architecture without the necessity for
asymmetric elements such as stop gradients, momentum encoders, or specialized
clustering layers - typically introduced to avoid learning trivial solutions.
Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and
real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, thus showing that our
objective function allows to outperform existing self-supervised learning
strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection
performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated
into a neural-symbolic framework to mitigate the reasoning shortcut problem and
to learn higher quality symbolic representations thanks to the enhanced
classification performance.

<p class="mathjax">Analyzing connections between brain regions of interest (ROI) is vital to
detect neurological disorders such as autism or schizophrenia. Recent
advancements employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to utilize graph structures in
brains, improving detection performances. Current methods use correlation
measures between ROI's blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to generate
the graph structure. Other methods use the training samples to learn the
optimal graph structure through end-to-end learning. However, implementing
those methods independently leads to some issues with noisy data for the
correlation graphs and overfitting problems for the optimal graph. In this
work, we proposed Bargrain (balanced graph structure for brains), which models
two graph structures: filtered correlation matrix and optimal sample graph
using graph convolution networks (GCNs). This approach aims to get advantages
from both graphs and address the limitations of only relying on a single type
of structure. Based on our extensive experiment, Bargrain outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain disease datasets, as
measured by average F1 scores.

<p class="mathjax">In the absence of data protection measures, software applications lead to
privacy breaches, posing threats to end-users and software organisations.
Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are technical measures that protect
personal data, thus minimising such privacy breaches. However, for software
applications to deliver data protection using PETs, software developers should
actively and correctly incorporate PETs into the software they develop.
Therefore, to uncover ways to encourage and support developers to embed PETs
into software, this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyses 39 empirical
studies on developers' privacy practices. It reports the usage of six PETs in
software application scenarios. Then, it discusses challenges developers face
when integrating PETs into software, ranging from intrinsic challenges, such as
the unawareness of PETs, to extrinsic challenges, such as the increased
development cost. Next, the SLR presents the existing solutions to address
these challenges, along with the limitations of the solutions. Further, it
outlines future research avenues to better understand PETs from a developer
perspective and minimise the challenges developers face when incorporating PETs
into software.

<p class="mathjax">When reasoning about actions, e.g., by means of task planning or agent
programming with Golog, the robot's actions are typically modeled on an
abstract level, where complex actions such as picking up an object are treated
as atomic primitives with deterministic effects and preconditions that only
depend on the current state. However, when executing such an action on a robot
it can no longer be seen as a primitive. Instead, action execution is a complex
task involving multiple steps with additional temporal preconditions and timing
constraints. Furthermore, the action may be noisy, e.g., producing erroneous
sensing results and not always having the desired effects. While these aspects
are typically ignored in reasoning tasks, they need to be dealt with during
execution. In this thesis, we propose several approaches towards closing this
gap.

<p class="mathjax">Leukemia is one of the most common and death-threatening types of cancer that
threaten human life. Medical data from some of the patient's critical
parameters contain valuable information hidden among these data. On this
subject, deep learning can be used to extract this information. In this paper,
AutoEncoders have been used to develop valuable features to help the precision
of leukemia diagnosis. It has been attempted to get the best activation
function and optimizer to use in AutoEncoder and designed the best architecture
for this neural network. The proposed architecture is compared with this area's
classical machine learning models. Our proposed method performs better than
other machine learning in precision and f1-score metrics by more than 11%.

<p class="mathjax">Reservoir computing is a machine learning technique which has been shown to
be able to replicate the chaotic attractor, including the fractal dimension and
the entire Lyapunov spectrum, of the dynamical system on which it is trained.
We quantitatively relate the generalized synchronization dynamics of a driven
reservoir computer during the training stage to the performance of the
autonomous reservoir computer at the attractor reconstruction task. We show
that, for successful attractor reconstruction and Lyapunov exponent estimation,
the largest conditional Lyapunov exponent of the driven reservoir must be
significantly smaller (more negative) than the smallest (most negative)
Lyapunov exponent of the true system. We find that the maximal conditional
Lyapunov exponent of the reservoir depends strongly on the spectral radius of
the reservoir adjacency matrix, and therefore, for attractor reconstruction and
Lyapunov exponent estimation, small spectral radius reservoir computers perform
better in general. Our arguments are supported by numerical examples on
well-known chaotic systems.

<p class="mathjax">While head-mounted devices are becoming more compact, they provide egocentric
views with significant self-occlusions of the device user. Hence, existing
methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric
views. In this work, we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve
egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation, which leverages the scene
information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically, we
utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with
uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames, and 2) human joint
queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able
to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios, such as
crouching and sitting. Furthermore, we introduce two new benchmark datasets,
i.e., UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). The proposed datasets offer a
much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human
motions than the existing datasets, allowing comprehensive evaluation of
existing and upcoming methods. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed
approach significantly outperforms previous methods. We will release
UnrealEgo2, UnrealEgo-RW, and trained models on our project page.

<p class="mathjax">The proliferation of social network data has unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for extensive, data-driven exploration of human behavior. The
structural intricacies of social networks offer insights into various
computational social science issues, particularly concerning social influence
and information diffusion. However, modeling large-scale social network data
comes with computational challenges. Though large language models make it
easier than ever to model textual content, any advanced network representation
methods struggle with scalability and efficient deployment to out-of-sample
users. In response, we introduce a novel approach tailored for modeling social
network data in user detection tasks. This innovative method integrates
localized social network interactions with the capabilities of large language
models. Operating under the premise of social network homophily, which posits
that socially connected users share similarities, our approach is designed to
address these challenges. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method across
seven real-world social network datasets, spanning a diverse range of topics
and detection tasks, showcasing its applicability to advance research in
computational social science.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) underpins advancements in privacy-preserving
distributed computing by collaboratively training neural networks without
exposing clients' raw data. Current FL paradigms primarily focus on uni-modal
data, while exploiting the knowledge from distributed multimodal data remains
largely unexplored. Existing multimodal FL (MFL) solutions are mainly designed
for statistical or modality heterogeneity from the input side, however, have
yet to solve the fundamental issue,"modality imbalance", in distributed
conditions, which can lead to inadequate information exploitation and
heterogeneous knowledge aggregation on different modalities.In this paper, we
propose a novel Cross-Modal Infiltration Federated Learning (FedCMI) framework
that effectively alleviates modality imbalance and knowledge heterogeneity via
knowledge transfer from the global dominant modality. To avoid the loss of
information in the weak modality due to merely imitating the behavior of
dominant modality, we design the two-projector module to integrate the
knowledge from dominant modality while still promoting the local feature
exploitation of weak modality. In addition, we introduce a class-wise
temperature adaptation scheme to achieve fair performance across different
classes. Extensive experiments over popular datasets are conducted and give us
a gratifying confirmation of the proposed framework for fully exploring the
information of each modality in MFL.

<p class="mathjax">Within recent approaches to text-to-video (T2V) generation, achieving
controllability in the synthesized video is often a challenge. Typically, this
issue is addressed by providing low-level per-frame guidance in the form of
edge maps, depth maps, or an existing video to be altered. However, the process
of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on
enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward
bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for
neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use
of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a
pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a
bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing.
Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject
trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box
and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The
method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the
underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box
guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects
including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size
increases.

<p class="mathjax">As the deep learning revolution marches on, self-supervised learning has
garnered increasing attention in recent years thanks to its remarkable
representation learning ability and the low dependence on labeled data. Among
these varied self-supervised techniques, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training. This paradigm enables deep models to
learn robust representations and has demonstrated exceptional performance in
the context of computer vision, natural language processing, and other
modalities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the masked
modeling framework and its methodology. We elaborate on the details of
techniques within masked modeling, including diverse masking strategies,
recovering targets, network architectures, and more. Then, we systematically
investigate its wide-ranging applications across domains. Furthermore, we also
explore the commonalities and differences between masked modeling methods in
different fields. Toward the end of this paper, we conclude by discussing the
limitations of current techniques and point out several potential avenues for
advancing masked modeling research. A paper list project with this survey is

<p class="mathjax">Video grounding aims to localize a spatio-temporal section in a video
corresponding to an input text query. This paper addresses a critical
limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an
Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent
closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to
limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages
pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This
empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and
diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and
open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal
video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set
evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in
open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and
Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in
open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model
surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.26$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$
accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual
concepts for improved video understanding. Our codes will be released at

the development of a wide range of applications across various fields. There is
a growing trend in the construction of specialized platforms based on LLMs,

various functionalities like web browsing and code execution, they also
introduce significant security threats. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy issues arising from the
custom GPT platform. Our systematic examination categorizes potential attack
scenarios into three threat models based on the role of the malicious actor,
and identifies critical data exchange channels in custom GPTs. Utilizing the
STRIDE threat modeling framework, we identify 26 potential attack vectors, with
19 being partially or fully validated in real-world settings. Our findings
emphasize the urgent need for robust security and privacy measures in the
custom GPT ecosystem, especially in light of the forthcoming launch of the

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) adapts a trained model to specific
downstream tasks, significantly improving task-specific performance. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a common approach, where an LLM is trained to produce
desired answers. However, LLMs trained with SFT sometimes make simple mistakes
and result in hallucinations on reasoning tasks such as question-answering.
Without external feedback, it is difficult for SFT to learn a good mapping
between the question and the desired answer, especially with a small dataset.
This paper introduces an alternative to SFT called Natural Language Feedback
for Finetuning LLMs (LaFFi). LaFFi has LLMs directly predict the feedback they
will receive from an annotator. We find that requiring such reflection can
significantly improve the accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks,
providing a promising direction for the application of natural language
feedback in the realm of SFT LLMs. Additional ablation studies show that the
portion of human-annotated data in the annotated datasets affects the
fine-tuning performance.

<p class="mathjax">Enterprise documents such as forms, invoices, receipts, reports, contracts,
and other similar records, often carry rich semantics at the intersection of
textual and spatial modalities. The visual cues offered by their complex
layouts play a crucial role in comprehending these documents effectively. In
this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large
language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account
both textual semantics and spatial layout. Our model differs from existing
multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on
bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure.
Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is
captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a
set of disentangled matrices. Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective
that learns to infill text segments. This approach allows us to address
irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual
documents. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction
dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks. We demonstrate that
our solution outperforms SotA LLMs on 14 out of 16 datasets across all tasks,
and generalizes well to 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the remarkable performance of score distillation in text-to-3D
generation, such techniques notoriously suffer from view inconsistency issues,
also known as "Janus" artifact, where the generated objects fake each view with
multiple front faces. Although empirically effective methods have approached
this problem via score debiasing or prompt engineering, a more rigorous
perspective to explain and tackle this problem remains elusive. In this paper,
we reveal that the existing score distillation-based text-to-3D generation
frameworks degenerate to maximal likelihood seeking on each view independently
and thus suffer from the mode collapse problem, manifesting as the Janus
artifact in practice. To tame mode collapse, we improve score distillation by
re-establishing in entropy term in the corresponding variational objective,
which is applied to the distribution of rendered images. Maximizing the entropy
encourages diversity among different views in generated 3D assets, thereby
mitigating the Janus problem. Based on this new objective, we derive a new
update rule for 3D score distillation, dubbed Entropic Score Distillation
(ESD). We theoretically reveal that ESD can be simplified and implemented by
just adopting the classifier-free guidance trick upon variational score
distillation. Although embarrassingly straightforward, our extensive
experiments successfully demonstrate that ESD can be an effective treatment for
Janus artifacts in score distillation.

<p class="mathjax">Motion segmentation is a complex yet indispensable task in autonomous
driving. The challenges introduced by the ego-motion of the cameras, radial
distortion in fisheye lenses, and the need for temporal consistency make the
task more complicated, rendering traditional and standard Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) approaches less effective. The consequent laborious data
labeling, representation of diverse and uncommon scenarios, and extensive data
capture requirements underscore the imperative of synthetic data for improving
machine learning model performance. To this end, we employ the PD-WoodScape
synthetic dataset developed by Parallel Domain, alongside the WoodScape fisheye
dataset. Thus, we present the WoodScape fisheye motion segmentation challenge
for autonomous driving, held as part of the CVPR 2023 Workshop on
Omnidirectional Computer Vision (OmniCV). As one of the first competitions
focused on fisheye motion segmentation, we aim to explore and evaluate the
potential and impact of utilizing synthetic data in this domain. In this paper,
we provide a detailed analysis on the competition which attracted the
participation of 112 global teams and a total of 234 submissions. This study
delineates the complexities inherent in the task of motion segmentation,
emphasizes the significance of fisheye datasets, articulate the necessity for
synthetic datasets and the resultant domain gap they engender, outlining the
foundational blueprint for devising successful solutions. Subsequently, we
delve into the details of the baseline experiments and winning methods
evaluating their qualitative and quantitative results, providing with useful
insights.

<p class="mathjax">Window-based transformers have demonstrated strong ability in large-scale
point cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with
affordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, because
of the sparse nature of point clouds, the number of voxels per window varies
significantly. Current methods partition the voxels in each window into
multiple subsets of equal size, which cost expensive overhead in sorting and
padding the voxels, making them run slower than sparse convolution based
methods. In this paper, we present ScatterFormer, which, for the first time to
our best knowledge, could directly perform attention on voxel sets with
variable length. The key of ScatterFormer lies in the innovative Scatter Linear
Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the linear attention mechanism to
process in parallel all voxels scattered in different windows. Harnessing the
hierarchical computation units of the GPU and matrix blocking algorithm, we
reduce the latency of the proposed SLA module to less than 1 ms on moderate
GPUs. Besides, we develop a cross-window interaction module to simultaneously
enhance the local representation and allow the information flow across windows,
eliminating the need for window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer
demonstrates 73 mAP (L2) on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and 70.5 NDS on
the NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 28 FPS. Code

<p class="mathjax">Hybrid model predictive control with both continuous and discrete variables
is widely applicable to robotic control tasks, especially those involving
contact with the environment. Due to the combinatorial complexity, the solving
speed of hybrid MPC can be insufficient for real-time applications. In this
paper, we proposed a hybrid MPC solver based on Generalized Benders
Decomposition (GBD). The algorithm enumerates and stores cutting planes online
inside a finite buffer. After a short cold-start phase, the stored cuts provide
warm-starts for the new problem instances to enhance the solving speed. Despite
the disturbance and randomly changing environment, the solving speed maintains.
Leveraging on the sparsity of feasibility cuts, we also propose a fast
algorithm for Benders master problems. Our solver is validated through
controlling a cart-pole system with randomly moving soft contact walls, and a
free-flying robot navigating around obstacles. The results show that with
significantly less data than previous works, the solver reaches competitive
speeds to the off-the-shelf solver Gurobi despite the Python overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the
field of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on
masked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height.
However, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates
or temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is
suboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized
features as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically,
we propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action
representation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher
encoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent
contextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the
self-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher
encoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples,
leading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal
correlations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking
strategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs
persistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the
model to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on
action-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and
PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms
previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p class="mathjax">Shape modeling research in Computer Graphics has been an active area for
decades. The ability to create and edit complex 3D shapes has been of key
importance in Computer-Aided Design, Animation, Architecture, and
Entertainment. With the growing popularity of Virtual and Augmented Reality,
new applications and tools have been developed for artistic content creation;
real-time interactive shape modeling has become increasingly important for a
continuum of virtual and augmented reality environments (eXtended Reality
(XR)). Shape modeling in XR opens new possibilities for intuitive design and
shape modeling in an accessible way. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches
generating shape information from text prompts are set to change how artists
create and edit 3D models. There has been a substantial body of research on
interactive 3D shape modeling. However, there is no recent extensive review of
the existing techniques and what AI shape generation means for shape modeling
in interactive XR environments. In this state-of-the-art paper, we fill this
research gap in the literature by surveying free-form shape modeling work in
XR, with a focus on sculpting and 3D sketching, the most intuitive forms of
free-form shape modeling. We classify and discuss these works across five
dimensions: contribution of the articles, domain setting, interaction tool,
auto-completion, and collaborative designing. The paper concludes by discussing
the disconnect between interactive 3D sculpting and sketching and how this will
likely evolve with the prevalence of AI shape-generation tools in the future.

<p class="mathjax">In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to
manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using
microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic
leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types
of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This
methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a
high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and
environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent
classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes
an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and
Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte
scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid
(HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as
weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module
and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus
enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the
issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable
self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and
cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the
extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The
effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR
method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte
detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets. Our
source code and private WBCCD dataset are available at
https://github.com/JustlfC03/MFDS-DETR.

<p class="mathjax">Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations, which rely entirely on
publicly available data such as social media, play an increasingly important
role in solving crimes and holding governments accountable. The growing volume
of data and complex nature of tasks, however, means there is a pressing need to
scale and speed up OSINT investigations. Expert-led crowdsourcing approaches
show promise but tend to either focus on narrow tasks or domains or require
resource-intense, long-term relationships between expert investigators and
crowds. We address this gap by providing a flexible framework that enables
investigators across domains to enlist crowdsourced support for the discovery
and verification of OSINT. We use a design-based research (DBR) approach to
develop OSINT Research Studios (ORS), a sociotechnical system in which novice
crowds are trained to support professional investigators with complex OSINT
investigations. Through our qualitative evaluation, we found that ORS
facilitates ethical and effective OSINT investigations across multiple domains.
We also discuss broader implications of expert-crowd collaboration and
opportunities for future work.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents GenH2R, a framework for learning generalizable
vision-based human-to-robot (H2R) handover skills. The goal is to equip robots
with the ability to reliably receive objects with unseen geometry handed over
by humans in various complex trajectories. We acquire such generalizability by
learning H2R handover at scale with a comprehensive solution including
procedural simulation assets creation, automated demonstration generation, and
effective imitation learning. We leverage large-scale 3D model repositories,
dexterous grasp generation methods, and curve-based 3D animation to create an
H2R handover simulation environment named \simabbns, surpassing the number of
scenes in existing simulators by three orders of magnitude. We further
introduce a distillation-friendly demonstration generation method that
automatically generates a million high-quality demonstrations suitable for
learning. Finally, we present a 4D imitation learning method augmented by a
future forecasting objective to distill demonstrations into a visuo-motor
handover policy. Experimental evaluations in both simulators and the real world
demonstrate significant improvements (at least +10\% success rate) over
baselines in all cases. The project page is https://GenH2R.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">We present a differentiable model that explicitly models boundaries --
including contours, corners and junctions -- using a new mechanism that we call
boundary attention. We show that our model provides accurate results even when
the boundary signal is very weak or is swamped by noise. Compared to previous
classical methods for finding faint boundaries, our model has the advantages of
being differentiable; being scalable to larger images; and automatically
adapting to an appropriate level of geometric detail in each part of an image.
Compared to previous deep methods for finding boundaries via end-to-end
training, it has the advantages of providing sub-pixel precision, being more
resilient to noise, and being able to process any image at its native
resolution and aspect ratio.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the relationship between scientific innovation in
biomedical sciences and its impact on industrial activities, focusing on how
the historical impact and content of scientific papers influenced future
funding and innovation grant application content for small businesses. The
research incorporates bibliometric analyses along with SBIR (Small Business
Innovation Research) data to yield a holistic view of the science-industry
interface. By evaluating the influence of scientific innovation on industry
across 10,873 biomedical topics and taking into account their taxonomic
relationships, we present an in-depth exploration of science-industry
interactions where we quantify the temporal effects and impact latency of
scientific advancements on industrial activities, spanning from 2010 to 2021.
Our findings indicate that scientific progress substantially influenced
industrial innovation funding and the direction of industrial innovation
activities. Approximately 76% and 73% of topics showed a correlation and
Granger-causality between scientific interest in papers and future funding
allocations to relevant small businesses. Moreover, around 74% of topics
demonstrated an association between the semantic content of scientific
abstracts and future grant applications. Overall, the work contributes to a
more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the science-industry interface,
opening avenues for more strategic resource allocation and policy developments
aimed at fostering innovation.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach for frequency sub-band
allocation in wireless networks using graph-based learning. We consider a dense
deployment of subnetworks in the factory environment with a limited number of
sub-bands which must be optimally allocated to coordinate inter-subnetwork
interference. We model the subnetwork deployment as a conflict graph and
propose an unsupervised learning approach inspired by the graph colouring
heuristic and the Potts model to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph
neural networks. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method
achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band
allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it
incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization
heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information. We
further demonstrate that the method is robust to different network settings.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking neural networks (SNNs) take inspiration from the brain to enable
energy-efficient computations. Since the advent of Transformers, SNNs have
struggled to compete with artificial networks on modern sequential tasks, as
they inherit limitations from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with the added
challenge of training with non-differentiable binary spiking activations.
However, a recent renewed interest in efficient alternatives to Transformers
has given rise to state-of-the-art recurrent architectures named state space
models (SSMs). This work systematically investigates, for the first time, the
intersection of state-of-the-art SSMs with SNNs for long-range sequence
modelling. Results suggest that SSM-based SNNs can outperform the Transformer
on all tasks of a well-established long-range sequence modelling benchmark. It
is also shown that SSM-based SNNs can outperform current state-of-the-art SNNs
with fewer parameters on sequential image classification. Finally, a novel
feature mixing layer is introduced, improving SNN accuracy while challenging
assumptions about the role of binary activations in SNNs. This work paves the
way for deploying powerful SSM-based architectures, such as large language
models, to neuromorphic hardware for energy-efficient long-range sequence
modelling.

<p class="mathjax">Structured data in the form of tabular datasets contain features that are
distinct and discrete, with varying individual and relative importances to the
target. Combinations of one or more features may be more predictive and
meaningful than simple individual feature contributions. R's mixed effect
linear models library allows users to provide such interactive feature
combinations in the model design. However, given many features and possible
interactions to select from, model selection becomes an exponentially difficult
task. We aim to automate the model selection process for predictions on tabular
datasets incorporating feature interactions while keeping computational costs
small. The framework includes two distinct approaches for feature selection: a
Priority-based Random Grid Search and a Greedy Search method. The
Priority-based approach efficiently explores feature combinations using prior
probabilities to guide the search. The Greedy method builds the solution
iteratively by adding or removing features based on their impact. Experiments
on synthetic demonstrate the ability to effectively capture predictive feature
combinations.

<p class="mathjax">This research idea paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to
enhance the productivity of Dafny developers. Although the use of
verification-aware languages, such as Dafny, has increased considerably in the
last decade, these are still not widely adopted. Often the cost of using such
languages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the
developers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program
correct. Even though Dafny automates a lot of the verification process,
sometimes there are steps that are too complex for Dafny to perform on its own.
One such case is that of missing lemmas, i.e. Dafny is unable to prove a result
without being given further help in the form of a theorem that can assist it in
the proof of the step.
<br />In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that
leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant
lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use. Moreover, for the lemmas that
cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide
accompanying calculational proofs. We also discuss ideas for future work by
describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of
verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity
and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal
specifications and proving program properties.

<p class="mathjax">The recognition of human activities based on WiFi Channel State Information
(CSI) enables contactless and visual privacy-preserving sensing in indoor
environments. However, poor model generalization, due to varying environmental
conditions and sensing hardware, is a well-known problem in this space. To
address this issue, in this work, data augmentation techniques commonly used in
image-based learning are applied to WiFi CSI to investigate their effects on
model generalization performance in cross-scenario and cross-system settings.
In particular, we focus on the generalization between line-of-sight (LOS) and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) through-wall scenarios, as well as on the
generalization between different antenna systems, which remains under-explored.
We collect and make publicly available a dataset of CSI amplitude spectrograms
of human activities. Utilizing this data, an ablation study is conducted in
which activity recognition models based on the EfficientNetV2 architecture are
trained, allowing us to assess the effects of each augmentation on model
generalization performance. The gathered results show that specific
combinations of simple data augmentation techniques applied to CSI amplitude
data can significantly improve cross-scenario and cross-system generalization.

<p class="mathjax">Exploring generative model training for synthetic tabular data, specifically
in sequential contexts such as credit card transaction data, presents
significant challenges. This paper addresses these challenges, focusing on
attaining both high fidelity to actual data and optimal utility for machine
learning tasks. We introduce five pre-processing schemas to enhance the
training of the Conditional Probabilistic Auto-Regressive Model (CPAR),
demonstrating incremental improvements in the synthetic data's fidelity and
utility. Upon achieving satisfactory fidelity levels, our attention shifts to
training fraud detection models tailored for time-series data, evaluating the
utility of the synthetic data. Our findings offer valuable insights and
practical guidelines for synthetic data practitioners in the finance sector,
transitioning from real to synthetic datasets for training purposes, and
illuminating broader methodologies for synthesizing credit card transaction
time series.

Addressing these requirements, this study presents a novel neural network model
adept at optical character recognition (OCR) across diverse domains, leveraging
the strengths of multi-task learning to improve efficiency and generalization.
The model is designed to achieve rapid adaptation to new domains, maintain a

<p class="mathjax">Objective: Blood transfusions, crucial in managing anemia and coagulopathy in
ICU settings, require accurate prediction for effective resource allocation and
patient risk assessment. However, existing clinical decision support systems
have primarily targeted a particular patient demographic with unique medical
conditions and focused on a single type of blood transfusion. This study aims
to develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability
of transfusion necessity over the next 24 hours for a diverse range of
non-traumatic ICU patients.
<br />Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult
non-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic
hospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine
learning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year
data and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years.
<br />Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the
other models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable
performance metrics, including an Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1-score
of 0.89 in the best scenario.
<br />Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for
predicting blood transfusion needs in a diverse cohort of critically ill
patients. The findings of this evaluation confirm that our model not only
predicts transfusion requirements effectively but also identifies key
biomarkers for making transfusion decisions.

learning model training techniques for fNIRS data. This project will build a
local model in a centralized setting with both differential privacy (DP) and

<p class="mathjax">Devising procedures for downstream task-oriented generative model selections
is an unresolved problem of practical importance. Existing studies focused on
the utility of a single family of generative models. They provided limited
insights on how synthetic data practitioners select the best family generative
models for synthetic training tasks given a specific combination of machine
learning model class and performance metric. In this paper, we approach the
downstream task-oriented generative model selections problem in the case of
training fraud detection models and investigate the best practice given
different combinations of model interpretability and model performance
constraints. Our investigation supports that, while both Neural
Network(NN)-based and Bayesian Network(BN)-based generative models are both
good to complete synthetic training task under loose model interpretability
constrain, the BN-based generative models is better than NN-based when
synthetic training fraud detection model under strict model interpretability
constrain. Our results provides practical guidance for machine learning
practitioner who is interested in replacing their training dataset from real to
synthetic, and shed lights on more general downstream task-oriented generative
model selection problems.

<p class="mathjax">Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) pervade real-world
applications in science, engineering, and design. Constraint violation has been
a building block in designing evolutionary multi-objective optimization
algorithms for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems.
However, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or
inadequately defined, making constraint violation unattainable and potentially
misleading for conventional constrained evolutionary multi-objective
optimization algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its
kind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the
alternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and
constraint functions. This framework tackles CMOPs with unknown constraints by
reformulating the original problem into an additive form of two subproblems,
each of which is allotted a dedicated evolutionary population. Notably, these
two populations operate towards complementary evolutionary directions during
their optimization processes. In order to minimize discrepancy, their
evolutionary directions alternate, aiding the discovery of feasible solutions.
Comparative experiments conducted against five state-of-the-art constrained
evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, on 120 benchmark test
problem instances with varying properties, as well as two real-world
engineering optimization problems, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our proposed framework. Its salient features include faster
convergence and enhanced resilience to various Pareto front shapes.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes,
objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs
and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,
current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting
hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations
remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable
visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,
given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a
mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric
and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the
visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge
features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.
Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator
within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional
discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,
the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing
fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to
improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the
Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms
conventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page:

<p class="mathjax">Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a challenge because the existing
methodologies do not identify the patients in their preclinical stage, which
can last up to a decade prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Several
research studies demonstrate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers,
amyloid beta 1-42, T-tau, and P-tau, in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
stages. In this work, we used machine learning models to classify different
stages of Alzheimer's disease based on the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels
alone. An electronic health record of patients from the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Centre database was analyzed and the patients were subdivided
based on mini-mental state scores and clinical dementia ratings. Statistical
and correlation analyses were performed to identify significant differences
between the Alzheimer's stages. Afterward, machine learning classifiers
including K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Bagged Tree,
Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers were
employed to classify the Alzheimer's disease stages. The results demonstrate
that Ensemble Boosted Tree (84.4%) and Logistic Regression (73.4%) provide the
highest accuracy for binary classification, while Ensemble Bagged Tree (75.4%)
demonstrates better accuracy for multiclassification. The findings from this
research are expected to help clinicians in making an informed decision
regarding the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's from the cerebrospinal fluid
biomarkers alone, monitoring of the disease progression, and implementation of
appropriate intervention measures.

<p class="mathjax">A hybrid encryption (HE) system is an efficient public key encryption system
for arbitrarily long messages. An HE system consists of a public key component
called key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and a symmetric key component called
data encapsulation mechanism (DEM). The HE encryption algorithm uses a KEM
generated key k to encapsulate the message using DEM, and send the ciphertext
together with the encapsulaton of k, to the decryptor who decapsulates k and
uses it to decapsulate the message using the corresponding KEM and DEM
components. The KEM/DEM composition theorem proves that if KEM and DEM satisfy
well-defined security notions, then HE will be secure with well defined
security. We introduce HE in correlated randomness model where the encryption
and decryption algorithms have samples of correlated random variables that are
partially leaked to the adversary. Security of the new KEM/DEM paradigm is
defined against computationally unbounded or polynomially bounded adversaries.
We define iKEM and cKEM with respective information theoretic computational
security, and prove a composition theorem for them and a computationally secure
DEM, resulting in secure HEs with proved computational security (CPA and CCA)
and without any computational assumption. We construct two iKEMs that provably
satisfy the required security notions of the composition theorem. The iKEMs are
used to construct two efficient quantum-resistant HEs when used with an AES
based DEM. We also define and construct combiners with proved security that
combine the new KEM/DEM paradigm of HE with the traditional public key based
paradigm of HE.

<p class="mathjax">Detection of small, undetermined moving objects or objects in an occluded
environment with a cluttered background is the main problem of computer vision.
This greatly affects the detection accuracy of deep learning models. To
overcome these problems, we concentrate on deep learning models for real-time
detection of cars and tanks in an occluded environment with a cluttered
background employing SSD and YOLO algorithms and improved precision of
detection and reduce problems faced by these models. The developed method makes
the custom dataset and employs a preprocessing technique to clean the noisy
dataset. For training the developed model we apply the data augmentation
technique to balance and diversify the data. We fine-tuned, trained, and
evaluated these models on the established dataset by applying these techniques
and highlighting the results we got more accurately than without applying these
techniques. The accuracy and frame per second of the SSD-Mobilenet v2 model are
higher than YOLO V3 and YOLO V4. Furthermore, by employing various techniques
like data enhancement, noise reduction, parameter optimization, and model
fusion we improve the effectiveness of detection and recognition. We further
added a counting algorithm, and target attributes experimental comparison, and
made a graphical user interface system for the developed model with features of
object counting, alerts, status, resolution, and frame per second.
Subsequently, to justify the importance of the developed method analysis of
YOLO V3, V4, and SSD were incorporated. Which resulted in the overall
completion of the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in
language-based driving tasks. However, existing research typically focuses on
limited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is
crucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
NuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17
subtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal,
multi-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level. To
obtain NuInstruct, we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate
instruction-response pairs automatically, which is inspired by the driving
logical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM, an end-to-end
method for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
features, language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates
multi-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs'
capabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module
is a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct
demonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g.
around 9% improvement on various tasks. We plan to release our NuInstruct for
future research development.

<p class="mathjax">Since distribution shifts are likely to occur after a model's deployment and
can drastically decrease the model's performance, online test-time adaptation
(TTA) continues to update the model during test-time, leveraging the current
test data. In real-world scenarios, test data streams are not always
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Instead, they are frequently
temporally correlated, making them non-i.i.d. Many existing methods struggle to
cope with this scenario. In response, we propose a diversity-aware and
category-balanced buffer that can simulate an i.i.d. data stream, even in
non-i.i.d. scenarios. Combined with a diversity and entropy-weighted entropy
loss, we show that a stable adaptation is possible on a wide range of
corruptions and natural domain shifts, based on ImageNet. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on most considered benchmarks.

attacks on the application, a meticulous selection process was employed,
resulting in 115 carefully chosen attacks based on coverage and relevance. For
enhanced interpretability, a second LLM was utilized to evaluate the responses
generated from these simulated attacks. Unlike conventional malicious content
classifiers that provide only a confidence score, the LLM-based evaluation
produces a score accompanied by an explanation, thereby enhancing
interpretability. Subsequently, a resilience score is computed by assigning
higher weights to attacks with greater impact, thus providing a robust
measurement of the application resilience. To assess the framework's efficacy,
it was applied on two LLMs, namely Llama2 and ChatGLM. Results revealed that
Llama2, the newer model exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM. This
finding substantiates the effectiveness of the framework, aligning with the
prevailing notion that newer models tend to possess greater resilience.
Moreover, the framework exhibited exceptional versatility, requiring only
minimal adjustments to accommodate emerging attack techniques and
classifications, thereby establishing itself as an effective and practical
solution. Overall, the framework offers valuable insights that empower
organizations to make well-informed decisions to fortify their applications
against potential threats from prompt injection.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of LLM (Large Language Model) integrated virtual assistants has
brought about a rapid transformation in communication dynamics. During virtual
assistant development, some developers prefer to leverage the system message,
also known as an initial prompt or custom prompt, for preconditioning purposes.
However, it is important to recognize that an excessive reliance on this
functionality raises the risk of manipulation by malicious actors who can
exploit it with carefully crafted prompts. Such malicious manipulation poses a
significant threat, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of
the virtual assistant's responses. Consequently, safeguarding the virtual
assistants with detection and defense mechanisms becomes of paramount
importance to ensure their safety and integrity. In this study, we explored
three detection and defense mechanisms aimed at countering attacks that target
the system message. These mechanisms include inserting a reference key,
utilizing an LLM evaluator, and implementing a Self-Reminder. To showcase the
efficacy of these mechanisms, they were tested against prominent attack
techniques. Our findings demonstrate that the investigated mechanisms are
capable of accurately identifying and counteracting the attacks. The
effectiveness of these mechanisms underscores their potential in safeguarding
the integrity and reliability of virtual assistants, reinforcing the importance
of their implementation in real-world scenarios. By prioritizing the security
of virtual assistants, organizations can maintain user trust, preserve the
integrity of the application, and uphold the high standards expected in this
era of transformative technologies.

<p class="mathjax">The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is
increasing rapidly, hindering the large-scale deployment on resource-restricted
devices (e.g., smartphones). To mitigate this issue, AI software compression
plays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high
performance. However, the intrinsic defects in a big model may be inherited by
the compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by adversaries, since
a compressed model is usually deployed in a large number of devices without
adequate protection. In this article, we aim to address the safe model
compression problem from the perspective of safety-performance co-optimization.
Specifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm in
software engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training framework called
SafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as safety testing,
SafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following
the dynamic sparse training paradigm. Then, considering two kinds of
representative and heterogeneous attack mechanisms, i.e., black-box membership
inference attack and white-box membership inference attack, we develop two
concrete instances called BMIA-SafeCompress and WMIA-SafeCompress. Further, we
implement another instance called MMIA-SafeCompress by extending SafeCompress
to defend against the occasion when adversaries conduct black-box and white-box
membership inference attacks simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments
on five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing
tasks. The results show the effectiveness and generalizability of our
framework. We also discuss how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides
membership inference attack, demonstrating the flexibility of SafeCompress.

<p class="mathjax">The sensitivity of Impact Factors (IFs) to journal size causes systematic
bias in IF rankings, in a process akin to {\it stacking the cards}: A random
``journal'' of $n$ papers can attain a range of IF values that decreases
rapidly with size, as $\sim 1/\sqrt{n}$ . The Central Limit Theorem, which
underlies this effect, also allows us to correct it by standardizing citation
averages for scale {\it and} subject in a geometrically intuitive manner
analogous to calculating the $z$-score. We thus propose the $\Phi$ index, a
standardized scale- and subject-independent citation average. The $\Phi$ index
passes the ``random sample test'', a simple check for scale and subject
independence that we argue ought to be used for every citation indicator. We
present $\Phi$ index rankings for 12,173 journals using 2020 Journal Citation
Reports data. We show how scale standardization alone affects rankings,
demonstrate the additional effect of subject standardization for
monodisciplinary journals, and discuss how to treat multidisciplinary journals.
$\Phi$ index rankings offer a clear improvement over IF rankings. And because
the $\Phi$ index methodology is general, it can also be applied to compare
individual researchers, universities, or countries.

<p class="mathjax">Hockey rink registration is a useful tool for aiding and automating sports
analysis. When combined with player tracking, it can provide location
information of players on the rink by estimating a homography matrix that can
warp broadcast video frames onto an overhead template of the rink, or vice
versa. However, most existing techniques require accurate ground truth
information, which can take many hours to annotate, and only work on the
trained rink types. In this paper, we propose a generalized rink registration
pipeline that, once trained, can be applied to both seen and unseen rink types
with only an overhead rink template and the video frame as inputs. Our pipeline
uses domain adaptation techniques, semi-supervised learning, and synthetic data
during training to achieve this ability and overcome the lack of non-NHL
training data. The proposed method is evaluated on both NHL (source) and
non-NHL (target) rink data and the results demonstrate that our approach can
generalize to non-NHL rinks, while maintaining competitive performance on NHL
rinks.

<p class="mathjax">A global effort has been initiated to reduce the worldwide greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, primarily carbon emissions, by half by 2030 and reach net-zero
by 2050. The development of 6G must also be compliant with this goal.
Unfortunately, developing a sustainable and net-zero emission systems to meet
the users' fast growing demands on mobile services, especially smart services
and applications, may be much more challenging than expected. Particularly,
despite the energy efficiency improvement in both hardware and software
designs, the overall energy consumption and carbon emission of mobile networks
are still increasing at a tremendous speed. The growing penetration of
resource-demanding AI algorithms and solutions further exacerbate this
challenge. In this article, we identify the major emission sources and
introduce an evaluation framework for analyzing the lifecycle of network AI
implementations. A novel joint dynamic energy trading and task allocation
optimization framework, called DETA, has been introduced to reduce the overall
carbon emissions. We consider a federated edge intelligence-based network AI
system as a case study to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution.
Experimental results based on a hardware prototype suggest that our proposed
solution can reduce carbon emissions of network AI systems by up to 74.9%.
Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated unprecedented abilities at
flexible and realistic image synthesis. However, the iterative process required
to produce a single image is costly and incurs a high latency, prompting
researchers to further investigate its efficiency. Typically, improvements in
latency have been achieved in two ways: (1) training smaller models through
knowledge distillation (KD); and (2) adopting techniques from ODE-theory to
facilitate larger step sizes. In contrast, we propose a training-free approach
that does not alter the step-size of the sampler. Specifically, we find the
repeated calculation of attention maps to be both costly and redundant;
therefore, we propose a structured reuse of attention maps during sampling. Our
initial reuse policy is motivated by rudimentary ODE-theory, which suggests
that reuse is most suitable late in the sampling procedure. After noting a
number of limitations in this theoretical approach, we empirically search for a
better policy. Unlike methods that rely on KD, our reuse policies can easily be
adapted to a variety of setups in a plug-and-play manner. Furthermore, when
applied to Stable Diffusion-1.5, our reuse policies reduce latency with minimal
repercussions on sample quality.

<p class="mathjax">Minimizing the use of CNOT gates in quantum state preparation is a crucial
step in quantum compilation, as they introduce coupling constraints and more
noise than single-qubit gates. Reducing the number of CNOT gates can lead to
more efficient and accurate quantum computations. However, the lack of
compatibility to model superposition and entanglement challenges the
scalability and optimality of CNOT optimization algorithms on classical
computers. In this paper, we propose an effective state preparation algorithm
using an exact CNOT synthesis formulation. Our method represents a milestone as
the first design automation algorithm to surpass manual design, reducing the
best CNOT numbers to prepare a Dicke state by 2x. For general states with up to
20 qubits, our method reduces the CNOT number by 9% and 32% for dense and
sparse states, on average, compared to the latest algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in
industrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient
labeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on
supervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the
absence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different
classes sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy
computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised
Continual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with
continual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the
proposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a
concise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly'
model predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover,
Structure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation
results. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features
within the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature
representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on
unsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that
our method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with
rehearsal training. The code will be available at
https://github.com/shirowalker/UCAD.

<p class="mathjax">Programming problems can be solved in a multitude of functionally correct
ways, but the quality of these solutions (e.g. readability, maintainability)
can vary immensely. When code quality is poor, symptoms emerge in the form of
'code smells', which are specific negative characteristics (e.g. duplicate
code) that can be resolved by applying refactoring patterns. Many undergraduate
computing curricula train students on this software engineering practice, often
doing so via exercises on unfamiliar instructor-provided code. Our observation,
however, is that this makes it harder for novices to internalise refactoring as
part of their own development practices. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to teaching refactoring, in which students must first complete a
programming exercise constrained to ensure they will produce a code smell. This
simple intervention is based on the idea that learning refactoring is easier if
students are familiar with the code (having built it), that it brings
refactoring closer to their regular development practice, and that it presents
a powerful opportunity to learn from a 'mistake'. We designed and conducted a
study with 35 novice undergraduates in which they completed various refactoring
exercises alternately taught using a traditional and our 'mistake-based'
approach, finding that students were significantly more effective and confident
at completing exercises using the latter.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research at CHU Sainte Justine's Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PICU)
has revealed that traditional machine learning methods, such as semi-supervised
label propagation and K-nearest neighbors, outperform Transformer-based models
in artifact detection from PPG signals, mainly when data is limited. This study
addresses the underutilization of abundant unlabeled data by employing
self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract latent features from these data,
followed by fine-tuning on labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that SSL
significantly enhances the Transformer model's ability to learn
representations, improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks.
Among various SSL techniques, including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO
(self-distillation with no labels)-contrastive learning exhibited the most
stable and superior performance in small PPG datasets. Further, we delve into
optimizing contrastive loss functions, which are crucial for contrastive SSL.
Inspired by InfoNCE, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function that
facilitates smoother training and better convergence, thereby enhancing
performance in artifact classification. In summary, this study establishes the
efficacy of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data, particularly in enhancing the
capabilities of the Transformer model. This approach holds promise for broader
applications in PICU environments, where annotated data is often limited.

<p class="mathjax">Computation task offloading is one of the enabling technologies for
computation-intensive applications and edge intelligence, which experiences the
explosive growth of massive data generated. Different techniques, wireless
technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature for task
offloading in order to improve the services provided to the users. Although
there is a rich literature of computation task offloading, the role of data in
the scope of it has not received much attention yet. This motivates us to
propose a survey which classified the state-of-the-art (SoTA) of computation
task offloading from the view point of data. First, a thorough literature
review is conducted to reveal the SoTA from various aspects with the
consideration of task generation, i.e., architecture, objective, offloading
strategy, task types, etc. It is found that types of task offloading is related
to the data and will affect the offloading procedure, which contains resource
allocation, task allocation etc. Then computation offloading is classified into
two categories based on task types, namely static task based offloading and
dynamic task based offloading. Finally, our views on future computation
offloading are provided with the corresponding challenges and opportunities.

<p class="mathjax">Personalized PageRank (PPR) is an extensively studied and applied node
proximity measure in graphs. For a pair of nodes $s$ and $t$ on a graph
$G=(V,E)$, the PPR value $\pi(s,t)$ is defined as the probability that an
$\alpha$-discounted random walk from $s$ terminates at $t$, where the walk
terminates with probability $\alpha$ at each step. We study the classic
Single-Source PPR query, which asks for PPR approximations from a given source
node $s$ to all nodes in the graph. Specifically, we aim to provide
approximations with absolute error guarantees, ensuring that the resultant PPR
estimates $\hat{\pi}(s,t)$ satisfy $\max_{t\in
V}\big|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)\big|\le\varepsilon$ for a given error bound
$\varepsilon$. We propose an algorithm that achieves this with high
probability, with an expected running time of
<br />- $\widetilde{O}\big(\sqrt{m}/\varepsilon\big)$ for directed graphs, where
$m=|E|$;
<br />- $\widetilde{O}\big(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{max}}}/\varepsilon\big)$ for undirected
graphs, where $d_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum node degree in the graph;
<br />- $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{\gamma-1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ for power-law
graphs, where $n=|V|$ and $\gamma\in\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)$ is the extent
of the power law.
<br />These sublinear bounds improve upon existing results. We also study the case
when degree-normalized absolute error guarantees are desired, requiring
$\max_{t\in V}\big|\hat{\pi}(s,t)/d(t)-\pi(s,t)/d(t)\big|\le\varepsilon_d$ for
a given error bound $\varepsilon_d$, where the graph is undirected and $d(t)$
is the degree of node $t$. We give an algorithm that provides this error
guarantee with high probability, achieving an expected complexity of
$\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\sum_{t\in
V}\pi(s,t)/d(t)}\big/\varepsilon_d\right)$. This improves over the previously
known $O(1/\varepsilon_d)$ complexity.

<p class="mathjax">Image classification plays a pivotal role across diverse applications, yet
challenges persist when models are deployed in real-world scenarios. Notably,
these models falter in detecting unfamiliar classes that were not incorporated
during classifier training, a formidable hurdle for safe and effective
real-world model deployment, commonly known as out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. While existing techniques, like max logits, aim to leverage logits
for OOD identification, they often disregard the intricate interclass
relationships that underlie effective detection. This paper presents an
innovative class relevance learning method tailored for OOD detection. Our
method establishes a comprehensive class relevance learning framework,
strategically harnessing interclass relationships within the OOD pipeline. This
framework significantly augments OOD detection capabilities. Extensive
experimentation on diverse datasets, encompassing generic image classification
datasets (Near OOD and Far OOD datasets), demonstrates the superiority of our
method over state-of-the-art alternatives for OOD detection.

<p class="mathjax">Suicide is recognized as one of the most serious concerns in the modern
society. Suicide causes tragedy that affects countries, communities, and
families. There are many factors that lead to suicidal ideations. Early
detection of suicidal ideations can help to prevent suicide occurrence by
providing the victim with the required professional support, especially when
the victim does not recognize the danger of having suicidal ideations. As
technology usage has increased, people share and express their ideations
digitally via social media, chatbots, and other digital platforms. In this
paper, we proposed a novel, simple deep learning-based model to detect suicidal
ideations in digital content, mainly focusing on chatbots as the primary data
source. In addition, we provide a framework that employs the proposed suicide
detection integration with a chatbot-based support system.

<p class="mathjax">Serverless computing allows developers to break their code into small
components, known as functions, which are automatically managed by a service
provider. Being lightweight and modular, serverless functions have been
increasingly employed in edge computing, where quick responses and adaptability
are key to meeting strict latency requirements. In particular, edge nodes are
intrinsically resource-constrained, and efficient resource allocation
strategies are crucial for optimizing their usage. Different approaches exist
in the literature, but they often overlook the dependencies among functions,
that is, how and when functions invoke other functions, obtaining suboptimal
results.
<br />This paper presents NEPTUNE+, a dependency-aware resource (CPU cores)
allocation solution for serverless functions deployed at the edge. The approach
extends NEPTUNE, an existing framework for managing edge infrastructures, with
a new theoretical model and control algorithm that take dependencies into
account function. We evaluated NEPTUNE+ by using three applications and it is
able to allocate up to 42% fewer cores compared to NEPTUNE.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation models trained on annotated data fail to generalize
well when the input data distribution changes over extended time period,
leading to requiring re-training to maintain performance. Classic Unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to address a similar problem when there is
target domain with no annotated data points through transferring knowledge from
a source domain with annotated data. We develop an online UDA algorithm for
semantic segmentation of images that improves model generalization on
unannotated domains in scenarios where source data access is restricted during
adaptation. We perform model adaptation is by minimizing the distributional
distance between the source latent features and the target features in a shared
embedding space. Our solution promotes a shared domain-agnostic latent feature
space between the two domains, which allows for classifier generalization on
the target dataset. To alleviate the need of access to source samples during
adaptation, we approximate the source latent feature distribution via an
appropriate surrogate distribution, in this case a Gassian mixture model (GMM).
We evaluate our approach on well established semantic segmentation datasets and
demonstrate it compares favorably against state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA semantic
segmentation methods.

the former prevents a comprehensive correctness evaluation, the latter makes
those methods irrelevant in practice. In this work, we propose an axiomatic
semantics based approach for testing compilers, called PTE. The idea is to
incrementally develop a set of ``axioms'' capturing anecdotes of the language
semantics in the form of \emph{(\textbf{p}recondition, \textbf{t}ransformation,
\textbf{e}xpectation) triples, which allows us to test the compiler
automatically.} Such axioms are written in the same language whose compiler is
under test, and can be developed either based on the language specification, or
by generalizing the bug reports. PTE has been applied to a newly developed
compiler (i.e., Cangjie) and a mature compiler (i.e., Java), and successfully
identified 42 implementation bugs and 9 potential language design issues.

<p class="mathjax">The remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), primarily driven
by deep neural networks, have significantly impacted various aspects of our
lives. However, the current challenges surrounding unsustainable computational
trajectories, limited robustness, and a lack of explainability call for the
development of next-generation AI systems. Neuro-symbolic AI (NSAI) emerges as
a promising paradigm, fusing neural, symbolic, and probabilistic approaches to
enhance interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness while facilitating
learning from much less data. Recent NSAI systems have demonstrated great
potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive
capabilities. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent progress
in NSAI and analyze the performance characteristics and computational operators
of NSAI models. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and potential future
directions of NSAI from both system and architectural perspectives.

<p class="mathjax">Event-based cameras provide accurate and high temporal resolution
measurements for performing computer vision tasks in challenging scenarios,
such as high-dynamic range environments and fast-motion maneuvers. Despite
their advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a
significant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the
relatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this
limitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained
with conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on
unsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for
adapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to
generalize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates
uncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial
learning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By
applying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the
representations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data,
thereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of
uncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively
distinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability
to classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and
evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches
designed for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of
our solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data
from frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based
vision domain.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) have
significantly propelled the field of AIGC. Text-to-Audio (TTA), a burgeoning
AIGC application designed to generate audio from natural language prompts, is
attracting increasing attention. However, existing TTA studies often struggle
with generation quality and text-audio alignment, especially for complex
textual inputs. Drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art Text-to-Image (T2I)
diffusion models, we introduce Auffusion, a TTA system adapting T2I model
frameworks to TTA task, by effectively leveraging their inherent generative
strengths and precise cross-modal alignment. Our objective and subjective
evaluations demonstrate that Auffusion surpasses previous TTA approaches using
limited data and computational resource. Furthermore, previous studies in T2I
recognizes the significant impact of encoder choice on cross-modal alignment,
like fine-grained details and object bindings, while similar evaluation is
lacking in prior TTA works. Through comprehensive ablation studies and
innovative cross-attention map visualizations, we provide insightful
assessments of text-audio alignment in TTA. Our findings reveal Auffusion's
superior capability in generating audios that accurately match textual
descriptions, which further demonstrated in several related tasks, such as
audio style transfer, inpainting and other manipulations. Our implementation
and demos are available at https://auffusion.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the power iteration algorithm for the tensor PCA model
introduced in Richard and Montanari (2014). Previous work studying the
properties of tensor power iteration is either limited to a constant number of
iterations, or requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization. In this
paper, we move beyond these limitations and analyze the dynamics of randomly
initialized tensor power iteration up to polynomially many steps. Our
contributions are threefold: First, we establish sharp bounds on the number of
iterations required for power method to converge to the planted signal, for a
broad range of the signal-to-noise ratios. Second, our analysis reveals that
the actual algorithmic threshold for power iteration is smaller than the one
conjectured in literature by a polylog(n) factor, where n is the ambient
dimension. Finally, we propose a simple and effective stopping criterion for
power iteration, which provably outputs a solution that is highly correlated
with the true signal. Extensive numerical experiments verify our theoretical
results.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a series of new results for domain adaptation in the
multi-view learning setting. The incorporation of multiple views in the domain
adaptation was paid little attention in the previous studies. In this way, we
propose an analysis of generalization bounds with Pac-Bayesian theory to
consolidate the two paradigms, which are currently treated separately. Firstly,
building on previous work by Germain et al., we adapt the distance between
distribution proposed by Germain et al. for domain adaptation with the concept
of multi-view learning. Thus, we introduce a novel distance that is tailored
for the multi-view domain adaptation setting. Then, we give Pac-Bayesian bounds
for estimating the introduced divergence. Finally, we compare the different new
bounds with the previous studies.

<p class="mathjax">Low-resource African languages pose unique challenges for natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, including natural language generation (NLG). In this
paper, we develop Cheetah, a massively multilingual NLG language model for
African languages. Cheetah supports 517 African languages and language
varieties, allowing us to address the scarcity of NLG resources and provide a
solution to foster linguistic diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
Cheetah through comprehensive evaluations across seven generation downstream
tasks. In five of the seven tasks, Cheetah significantly outperforms other
models, showcasing its remarkable performance for generating coherent and
contextually appropriate text in a wide range of African languages. We
additionally conduct a detailed human evaluation to delve deeper into the
linguistic capabilities of Cheetah. The introduction of Cheetah has
far-reaching benefits for linguistic diversity. By leveraging pretrained models
and adapting them to specific languages, our approach facilitates the
development of practical NLG applications for African communities. The findings
of this study contribute to advancing NLP research in low-resource settings,
enabling greater accessibility and inclusion for African languages in a rapidly
expanding digital landscape. We will publicly release our models for research.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of Continual Learning (CL) is to continuously learn from new data
streams and accomplish the corresponding tasks. Previously studied CL assumes
that data are given in sequence nose-to-tail for different tasks, thus indeed
belonging to Serial Continual Learning (SCL). This paper studies the novel
paradigm of Parallel Continual Learning (PCL) in dynamic multi-task scenarios,
where a diverse set of tasks is encountered at different time points. PCL
presents challenges due to the training of an unspecified number of tasks with
varying learning progress, leading to the difficulty of guaranteeing effective
model updates for all encountered tasks. In our previous conference work, we
focused on measuring and reducing the discrepancy among gradients in a
multi-objective optimization problem, which, however, may still contain
negative transfers in every model update. To address this issue, in the dynamic
multi-objective optimization problem, we introduce task-specific elastic
factors to adjust the descent direction towards the Pareto front. The proposed
method, called Elastic Multi-Gradient Descent (EMGD), ensures that each update
follows an appropriate Pareto descent direction, minimizing any negative impact
on previously learned tasks. To balance the training between old and new tasks,
we also propose a memory editing mechanism guided by the gradient computed
using EMGD. This editing process updates the stored data points, reducing
interference in the Pareto descent direction from previous tasks. Experiments
on public datasets validate the effectiveness of our EMGD in the PCL setting.

<p class="mathjax">In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large
language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable
proficiency across a range of complex tasks. However, many mainstream LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their
performance in other non-English languages. In this paper, we focus on how to
effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following
instructions to a non-English language. To answer this question, we conduct an
extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU
hours. We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension,
further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. To accurately assess
the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing
benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench. Furthermore, a
comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted,
considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical
coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting
instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories. Our evaluation results
demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can
be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of
knowledge alignment and response quality. Furthermore, the experimental
outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar
trends. We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid
the community in developing non-English LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained code models have recently achieved substantial improvements in
many code intelligence tasks. These models are first pre-trained on large-scale
unlabeled datasets in a task-agnostic manner using self-supervised learning,
and then fine-tuned on labeled datasets in downstream tasks. However, the
labeled datasets are usually limited in size (i.e., human intensive efforts),
which may hinder the performance of pre-trained code models in specific tasks.
To mitigate this, one possible solution is to leverage the large-scale
unlabeled data in the tuning stage by pseudo-labeling. However, directly
employing the pseudo-labeled data can bring a large amount of noise, i.e.,
incorrect labels, leading to suboptimal performance. How to effectively
leverage the noisy pseudo-labeled data is a challenging yet under-explored
problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach named HINT to improve
pre-trained code models with large-scale unlabeled datasets by better utilizing
the pseudo-labeled data. HINT includes two main modules: HybrId pseudo-labeled
data selection and Noise-tolerant Training. In the hybrid pseudo-data selection
module, considering the robustness issue, apart from directly measuring the
quality of pseudo labels through training loss, we further propose to employ a
retrieval-based method to filter low-quality pseudo-labeled data. The
noise-tolerant training module aims to further mitigate the influence of errors
in pseudo labels by training the model with a noise-tolerant loss function and
by regularizing the consistency of model predictions.The experimental results
show that HINT can better leverage those unlabeled data in a task-specific way
and provide complementary benefits for pre-trained models, e.g., improving the
best baseline model by 15.33%, 16.50%, and 8.98% on code summarization, defect
detection, and assertion generation, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development on large language models makes automatically
constructing small programs possible. It thus has the potential to free
software engineers from low-level coding and allow us to focus on the perhaps
more interesting parts of software development, such as requirement engineering
and system testing. In this project, we develop a prototype named AISD
(AI-aided Software Development), which is capable of taking high-level
(potentially vague) user requirements as inputs, generates detailed use cases,
prototype system designs, and subsequently system implementation. Different
from existing attempts, AISD is designed to keep the user in the loop, i.e., by
repeatedly taking user feedback on use cases, high-level system designs, and
prototype implementations through system testing. AISD has been evaluated with
a novel benchmark of non-trivial software projects. The experimental results
suggest that it might be possible to imagine a future where software
engineering is reduced to requirement engineering and system testing only.

<p class="mathjax">The demand for the retrieval of complex scene data in autonomous driving is
increasing, especially as passenger vehicles have been equipped with the
ability to navigate urban settings, with the imperative to address long-tail
scenarios. Meanwhile, under the pre-existing two dimensional image retrieval
method, some problems may arise with scene retrieval, such as lack of global
feature representation and subpar text retrieval ability. To address these
issues, we have proposed \textbf{BEV-CLIP}, the first multimodal Bird's-Eye
View(BEV) retrieval methodology that utilizes descriptive text as an input to
retrieve corresponding scenes. This methodology applies the semantic feature
extraction abilities of a large language model (LLM) to facilitate zero-shot
retrieval of extensive text descriptions, and incorporates semi-structured
information from a knowledge graph to improve the semantic richness and variety
of the language embedding. Our experiments result in 87.66% accuracy on
NuScenes dataset in text-to-BEV feature retrieval. The demonstrated cases in
our paper support that our retrieval method is also indicated to be effective
in identifying certain long-tail corner scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime
conditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception
systems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to
semantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to
target nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA,
where a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a
confirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer
from a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To
mitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally
considering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a
one-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth
knowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a
novel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In
addition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge
the knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the
student model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to
enhance their performance. For example, the Cityscapes to ACDC night task
yielded 53.8 mIoU (\%), which corresponds to an improvement of +5\% over the
previous state-of-the-art. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We propose and evaluate an automated pipeline for discovering significant
topics from legal decision texts by passing features synthesized with topic
models through penalised regressions and post-selection significance tests. The
method identifies case topics significantly correlated with outcomes,
topic-word distributions which can be manually-interpreted to gain insights
about significant topics, and case-topic weights which can be used to identify
representative cases for each topic. We demonstrate the method on a new dataset
of domain name disputes and a canonical dataset of European Court of Human
Rights violation cases. Topic models based on latent semantic analysis as well
as language model embeddings are evaluated. We show that topics derived by the
pipeline are consistent with legal doctrines in both areas and can be useful in
other related legal analysis tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose an iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM)
based on prediction-correction for solving the topology optimization problem in
steady-state heat transfer equations. The problem is formulated as a
constrained minimization problem of the complementary energy, incorporating a
perimeter/surface-area regularization term, while satisfying a steady-state
heat transfer equation. The decision variables of the optimization problem
represent the domains of different materials and are represented by indicator
functions. The perimeter/surface-area term of the domain is approximated using
Gaussian kernel convolution with indicator functions. In each iteration, the
indicator function is updated using a prediction-correction approach. The
prediction step is based on the variation of the objective functional by
imposing the constraints, while the correction step ensures the monotonically
decreasing behavior of the objective functional. Numerical results demonstrate
the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method, particularly when
compared to classical approaches based on the ICTM.

<p class="mathjax">In robust optimization problems, the magnitude of perturbations is relatively
small. Consequently, solutions within certain regions are less likely to
represent the robust optima when perturbations are introduced. Hence, a more
efficient search process would benefit from increased opportunities to explore
promising regions where global optima or good local optima are situated. In
this paper, we introduce a novel robust evolutionary algorithm named the
dual-stage robust evolutionary algorithm (DREA) aimed at discovering robust
solutions. DREA operates in two stages: the peak-detection stage and the robust
solution-searching stage. The primary objective of the peak-detection stage is
to identify peaks in the fitness landscape of the original optimization
problem. Conversely, the robust solution-searching stage focuses on swiftly
identifying the robust optimal solution using information obtained from the
peaks discovered in the initial stage. These two stages collectively enable the
proposed DREA to efficiently obtain the robust optimal solution for the
optimization problem. This approach achieves a balance between solution
optimality and robustness by separating the search processes for optimal and
robust optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DREA
significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms across 18 test
problems characterized by diverse complexities. Moreover, when evaluated on
higher-dimensional robust optimization problems (100-$D$ and 200-$D$), DREA
also demonstrates superior performance compared to all five counterpart
algorithms.

multi-modal and provide complementary perspectives of a subject. A

effectively fuse such multi-modal data is a challenging task and attracts a lot

multi-modal medical data. Specifically, we convert images and unstructured and
structured texts into vision and language tokens, and use intramodal and
intermodal attention mechanisms to learn holistic representations of all
imaging and non-imaging data for classification. We apply Alifuse to classify
Alzheimer's disease and obtain state-of-the-art performance on five public
datasets, by outperforming eight baselines. The source code will be available

<p class="mathjax">Monocular 3D object detection poses a significant challenge due to the lack
of depth information in RGB images. Many existing methods strive to enhance the
object depth estimation performance by allocating additional parameters for
object depth estimation, utilizing extra modules or data. In contrast, we
introduce a novel metric learning scheme that encourages the model to extract
depth-discriminative features regardless of the visual attributes without
increasing inference time and model size. Our method employs the
distance-preserving function to organize the feature space manifold in relation
to ground-truth object depth. The proposed (K, B, eps)-quasi-isometric loss
leverages predetermined pairwise distance restriction as guidance for adjusting
the distance among object descriptors without disrupting the non-linearity of
the natural feature manifold. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary head for
object-wise depth estimation, which enhances depth quality while maintaining
the inference time. The broad applicability of our method is demonstrated
through experiments that show improvements in overall performance when
integrated into various baselines. The results show that our method
consistently improves the performance of various baselines by 23.51% and 5.78%
on average across KITTI and Waymo, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, substantial advancements in pre-trained vision-language models have
greatly enhanced the capabilities of multi-modal dialog systems. These models
have demonstrated significant improvements by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
However, the existing pre-trained models primarily focus on effectively
capturing the alignment between vision and language modalities, often ignoring
the intricate nature of dialog context. In this paper, we propose a
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning method named DialCLIP for multi-modal dialog
retrieval. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-modal context prompt
generator to learn context features which are subsequently distilled into
prompts within the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Besides, we
introduce domain prompt to mitigate the disc repancy from the downstream dialog
data. To facilitate various types of retrieval, we also design multiple experts
to learn mappings from CLIP outputs to multi-modal representation space, with
each expert being responsible to one specific retrieval type. Extensive
experiments show that DialCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely recognized benchmark datasets (i.e., PhotoChat and MMDialog) by tuning a
mere 0.04% of the total parameters. These results highlight the efficacy and
efficiency of our proposed approach, underscoring its potential to advance the
field of multi-modal dialog retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">We consider an online two-stage stochastic optimization with long-term
constraints over a finite horizon of $T$ periods. At each period, we take the
first-stage action, observe a model parameter realization and then take the
second-stage action from a feasible set that depends both on the first-stage
decision and the model parameter. We aim to minimize the cumulative objective
value while guaranteeing that the long-term average second-stage decision
belongs to a set. We develop online algorithms for the online two-stage problem
from adversarial learning algorithms. Also, the regret bound of our algorithm
can be reduced to the regret bound of embedded adversarial learning algorithms.
Based on this framework, we obtain new results under various settings. When the
model parameters are drawn from unknown non-stationary distributions and we are
given machine-learned predictions of the distributions, we develop a new
algorithm from our framework with a regret $O(W_T+\sqrt{T})$, where $W_T$
measures the total inaccuracy of the machine-learned predictions. We then
develop another algorithm that works when no machine-learned predictions are

<p class="mathjax">Visual-inertial SLAM is essential in various fields, such as AR/VR, uncrewed
aerial vehicles, industrial robots, and autonomous driving. The fusion of a
camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) can make up for the shortcomings of
a signal sensor, which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of
localization in challenging environments. Robust tracking and accurate inertial
parameter estimation are the basis for the stable operation of the system. This
article presents PLE-SLAM, an entirely precise and real-time visual-inertial
SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and efficient IMU initialization.
First, we introduce line features in a point-based visual-inertial SLAM system.
We use parallel computing methods to extract features and compute descriptors
to ensure real-time performance. Second, the proposed system estimates
gyroscope bias with rotation pre-integration and point and line observations.
Accelerometer bias and gravity direction are solved by an analytical method.
After initialization, all inertial parameters are refined through maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimation. Moreover, we open a dynamic feature elimination
thread to improve the adaptability to dynamic environments and use CNN,
bag-of-words and GNN to detect loops and match features. Excellent wide
baseline matching capability of DNN-based matching method and illumination
robustness significantly improve loop detection recall and loop inter-frame
pose estimation. The front-end and back-end are designed for hardware
acceleration. The experiments are performed on public datasets, and the results
show that the proposed system is one of the state-of-the-art methods in complex
scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Aircraft landing time (ALT) prediction is crucial for air traffic management,
especially for arrival aircraft sequencing on the runway. In this study, a
trajectory image-based deep learning method is proposed to predict ALTs for the
aircraft entering the research airspace that covers the Terminal Maneuvering
Area (TMA). Specifically, the trajectories of all airborne arrival aircraft
within the temporal capture window are used to generate an image with the
target aircraft trajectory labeled as red and all background aircraft
trajectory labeled as blue. The trajectory images contain various information,
including the aircraft position, speed, heading, relative distances, and
arrival traffic flows. It enables us to use state-of-the-art deep convolution
neural networks for ALT modeling. We also use real-time runway usage obtained
from the trajectory data and the external information such as aircraft types
and weather conditions as additional inputs. Moreover, a convolution neural
network (CNN) based module is designed for automatic holding-related
featurizing, which takes the trajectory images, the leading aircraft holding
status, and their time and speed gap at the research airspace boundary as its
inputs. Its output is further fed into the final end-to-end ALT prediction. The
proposed ALT prediction approach is applied to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO
Code: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
data from November 1 to November 30, 2022. Experimental results show that by
integrating the holding featurization, we can reduce the mean absolute error
(MAE) from 82.23 seconds to 43.96 seconds, and achieve an average accuracy of
96.1\%, with 79.4\% of the predictions errors being less than 60 seconds.

<p class="mathjax">Natural policy gradient (NPG) and its variants are widely-used policy search
methods in reinforcement learning. Inspired by prior work, a new NPG variant
coined NPG-HM is developed in this paper, which utilizes the Hessian-aided
momentum technique for variance reduction, while the sub-problem is solved via
the stochastic gradient descent method. It is shown that NPG-HM can achieve the
global last iterate $\epsilon$-optimality with a sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, which is the best known result for natural policy
gradient type methods under the generic Fisher non-degenerate policy
parameterizations. The convergence analysis is built upon a relaxed weak
gradient dominance property tailored for NPG under the compatible function
approximation framework, as well as a neat way to decompose the error when
handling the sub-problem. Moreover, numerical experiments on Mujoco-based
environments demonstrate the superior performance of NPG-HM over other
state-of-the-art policy gradient methods.

<p class="mathjax">Revolutionized by the transformer architecture, natural language processing
(NLP) has received unprecedented attention. While advancements in NLP models
have led to extensive research into their backdoor vulnerabilities, the
potential for these advancements to introduce new backdoor threats remains
unexplored. This paper proposes Imperio, which harnesses the language
understanding capabilities of NLP models to enrich backdoor attacks. Imperio
provides a new model control experience. It empowers the adversary to control
the victim model with arbitrary output through language-guided instructions.
This is achieved using a language model to fuel a conditional trigger
generator, with optimizations designed to extend its language understanding
capabilities to backdoor instruction interpretation and execution. Our
experiments across three datasets, five attacks, and nine defenses confirm
Imperio's effectiveness. It can produce contextually adaptive triggers from
text descriptions and control the victim model with desired outputs, even in
scenarios not encountered during training. The attack maintains a high success
rate across complex datasets without compromising the accuracy of clean inputs
and also exhibits resilience against representative defenses. The source code

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided
multi-antenna wireless powered communications in a multi-link interference
channel, where multiple IRSs are deployed to enhance the downlink/uplink
communications between each pair of hybrid access point (HAP) and wireless
device. Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing
the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and
meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission
schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division
multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For
the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general
algorithmic framework capable of addressing all of them. Numerical results show
that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts
without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy
consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme
consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is
more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and
limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low
cross-link interference scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to localize pixel points whose
spectral features differ from the background. HAD is essential in scenarios of
unknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop
growth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of
targets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect
and distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost
effortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human
visual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze
hyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer
the solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first
time. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which
introduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual
perception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also
reduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target
filter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being
applied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional
network knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial
features of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the
HAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set.
Our method provides a new solution space for HAD that is closer to human visual
perception with high confidence. Sufficient experiments on real HSI with
multiple method comparisons demonstrate the excellent performance and unique
potential of the proposed method. The code is available at
https://github.com/majitao-xd/STAD-HAD.

<p class="mathjax">Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has achieved near-atomic level resolution
of biomolecules by reconstructing 2D micrographs. However, the resolution and
accuracy of the reconstructed particles are significantly reduced due to the
extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and complex noise structure of
cryo-EM images. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion model with
post-processing framework to effectively denoise and restore single particle
cryo-EM images. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising
methods by effectively removing structural noise that has not been addressed
before. Additionally, more accurate and high-resolution three-dimensional
reconstruction structures can be obtained from denoised cryo-EM images.

<p class="mathjax">As a pivotal approach in machine learning and data science, manifold learning
aims to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional structure within complex
nonlinear manifolds in high-dimensional space. By exploiting the manifold
hypothesis, various techniques for nonlinear dimension reduction have been
developed to facilitate visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining
key insights. Although existing manifold learning methods have achieved
remarkable successes, they still suffer from extensive distortions incurred in
the global structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns.
Scalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale
data. Here, we propose a scalable manifold learning (scML) method that can
manipulate large-scale and high-dimensional data in an efficient manner. It
starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton
of the entire data and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the landmark
space based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically
validated the effectiveness of scML on synthetic datasets and real-world
benchmarks of different types, and applied it to analyze the single-cell
transcriptomics and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. scML
scales well with increasing data sizes and exhibits promising performance in
preserving the global structure. The experiments demonstrate notable robustness
in embedding quality as the sample rate decreases.

<p class="mathjax">Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to
different presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly
critical concern. Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well
in intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To
address this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to
extract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder
and the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and
converge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to
mitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input
images, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain
alignment. Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks
cannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and
generative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that
utilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors.
Specifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to
transfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models
are not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative
tasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data. By combining both DAA
and dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge
distillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing. The
advantage of our proposed method has been verified through extensive ablation
studies and comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets across
multiple protocols.

\emph{$\alpha$-approximate vertex fault-tolerant distance sensitivity oracle}
(\emph{$\alpha$-VSDO}) answers an $\alpha$-approximate distance from $s$ to $t$
in $G-x$ for any query $(x, t)$. It is a data structure version of the
so-called single-source replacement path problem (SSRP). In this paper, we
present a new \emph{nearly linear time} algorithm of constructing the $(1 +
\epsilon)$-VSDO for any weighted directed graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges
with integer weights in range $[1, W]$, and any positive constant $\epsilon \in
(0, 1]$. More precisely, the presented oracle attains $\tilde{O}(m / \epsilon +
n /\epsilon^2)$ construction time, $\tilde{O}(n/ \epsilon)$ size, and
$\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ query time for any polynomially-bounded $W$. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial result for SSRP/VSDO
beating the trivial $\tilde{O}(mn)$ computation time for directed graphs with
polynomially-bounded edge weights. Such a result has been unknown so far even
for the setting of $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation. It also implies that the
known barrier of $\Omega(m\sqrt{n})$ time for the exact SSRP by Chechik and
Magen~[ICALP2020] does not apply to the case of approximation.

<p class="mathjax">Urban transformations have profound societal impact on both individuals and
communities at large. Accurately assessing these shifts is essential for
understanding their underlying causes and ensuring sustainable urban planning.
Traditional measurements often encounter constraints in spatial and temporal
granularity, failing to capture real-time physical changes. While street view
imagery, capturing the heartbeat of urban spaces from a pedestrian point of
view, can add as a high-definition, up-to-date, and on-the-ground visual proxy
of urban change. We curate the largest street view time series dataset to date,
and propose an end-to-end change detection model to effectively capture
physical alterations in the built environment at scale. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method by benchmark comparisons with previous
literature and implementing it at the city-wide level. Our approach has the
potential to supplement existing dataset and serve as a fine-grained and
accurate assessment of urban change.

<p class="mathjax">We establish the unique ergodicity of the Markov chain generated by the
stochastic theta method (STM) with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ for monotone SODEs,
without growth restriction on the coefficients, driven by nondegenerate
multiplicative noise. The main ingredient of the arguments lies in the
construction of new Lyapunov functions, involving the coefficients, the
stepsize, and $\theta$, and the irreducibility and the strong Feller property
for the STM. We also generalize the arguments to the STM and its Galerkin-based
full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by
infinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise. Applying
these results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that its
drift-implicit Euler scheme is uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness,
which gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed in (J. Cui, J. Hong,
and L. Sun, Stochastic Process. Appl. (2021): 55--93). Numerical experiments
verify our theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Rust relies on its unique ownership mechanism to ensure thread and memory
safety. However, numerous potential security vulnerabilities persist in
practical applications. New language features in Rust pose new challenges for
vulnerability detection. This paper proposes a static deadlock detection method
tailored for Rust programs, aiming to identify various deadlock types,
including double lock, conflict lock, and deadlock associated with conditional
variables. With due consideration for Rust's ownership and lifetimes, we first
complete the pointer analysis. Then, based on the obtained points-to
information, we analyze dependencies among variables to identify potential
deadlocks. We develop a tool and conduct experiments based on the proposed
method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing deadlock detection methods in precision.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid evolution of the Text-to-Image (T2I) model in recent years,
their unsatisfactory generation result has become a challenge. However,
uniformly refining AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) of different qualities not only
limited optimization capabilities for low-quality AIGIs but also brought
negative optimization to high-quality AIGIs. To address this issue, a
quality-award refiner named Q-Refine is proposed. Based on the preference of
the Human Visual System (HVS), Q-Refine uses the Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
metric to guide the refining process for the first time, and modify images of
different qualities through three adaptive pipelines. Experimental shows that
for mainstream T2I models, Q-Refine can perform effective optimization to AIGIs
of different qualities. It can be a general refiner to optimize AIGIs from both
fidelity and aesthetic quality levels, thus expanding the application of the
T2I generation models.

<p class="mathjax">The prediction of rolling bearing lifespan is of significant importance in
industrial production. However, the scarcity of high-quality, full lifecycle
data has been a major constraint in achieving precise predictions. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces the CVGAN model, a novel framework
capable of generating one-dimensional vibration signals in both horizontal and
vertical directions, conditioned on historical vibration data and remaining
useful life. In addition, we propose an autoregressive generation method that
can iteratively utilize previously generated vibration information to guide the
generation of current signals. The effectiveness of the CVGAN model is
validated through experiments conducted on the PHM 2012 dataset. Our findings
demonstrate that the CVGAN model, in terms of both MMD and FID metrics,
outperforms many advanced methods in both autoregressive and non-autoregressive
generation modes. Notably, training using the full lifecycle data generated by
the CVGAN model significantly improves the performance of the predictive model.
This result highlights the effectiveness of the data generated by CVGans in
enhancing the predictive power of these models.

<p class="mathjax">Discovering the symbols and rules that can be used in long-horizon planning
from a robot's unsupervised exploration of its environment and continuous
sensorimotor experience is a challenging task. The previous studies proposed
learning symbols from single or paired object interactions and planning with
these symbols. In this work, we propose a system that learns rules with
discovered object and relational symbols that encode an arbitrary number of
objects and the relations between them, converts those rules to Planning Domain
Description Language (PDDL), and generates plans that involve affordances of
the arbitrary number of objects to achieve tasks. We validated our system with
box-shaped objects in different sizes and showed that the system can develop a
symbolic knowledge of pick-up, carry, and place operations, taking into account
object compounds in different configurations, such as boxes would be carried
together with a larger box that they are placed on. We also compared our method
with the state-of-the-art methods and showed that planning with the operators
defined over relational symbols gives better planning performance compared to
the baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks,
including time series forecasting. They are increasingly in demand and widely
accepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability.
However, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their
application in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more
severe in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are
incrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may
keep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the
online selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method
in the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of
different tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with
a coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based
forecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this
framework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following
drift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on
three levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output
explanation. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets
demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison
to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and
coverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems
towards embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type
communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).
This paper will discuss the possible evolution of these two types of
connectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. The paper consists of
three parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of
devices. While mMTC research in 5G was predominantly focused on the problem of
uncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic
patterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive
connectivity. One of the drivers for this is distributed learning/inference.
The second part of the paper will discuss the evolution of wireless
connectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly
coupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety critical control
applications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the
emergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value.
Additionally, ensuring ultra-high reliability for safety critical control
applications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the
wireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent
requirements calls for the development of novel AI-based techniques,
incorporating optimization theory, explainable AI, generative AI and digital
twins. The third part will analyze the coexistence of massive connectivity and
critical services. We will consider scenarios in which a massive number of
devices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This will be
followed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by
services with different criticality.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has undergone significant
advancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM)
and their enhancement in Large Vision Models (LVM), greatly enhancing the
instruction-following capabilities of traditional T2I models. Nevertheless,
previous methods focus on improving generation quality but introduce unsafe
factors into prompts. We explore that appending specific camera descriptions to
prompts can enhance safety performance. Consequently, we propose a simple and
safe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve image generation quality by
providing optimal camera descriptions. Specifically, we create a dataset from
multi-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an
optimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original
prompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to
original prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation.
Experiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of
16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present a novel generative task: joint scene graph - image
generation. While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on
scene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves
generating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling
efficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is
challenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with
heterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among
objects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and
relation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that
jointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge
attributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data,
relaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the
denoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a
continuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean
scene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the
empirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in
scene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on
standard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem
complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in
two downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion
tasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training
samples generated from DiffuseSG.

<p class="mathjax">Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) offers a promising solution for large-scale
solar energy utilization as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) enables electricity
generation independently of daily solar fluctuations, shifting to high-priced
electricity intervals. The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory
to account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity
price forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the
Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit
within a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by
different Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the
potential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is
estimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits
robust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus,
three heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic
optimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate
dispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on
all profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for
a 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a
limited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher
profit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather
conditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and
Heuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a
limited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming
computationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical
alternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time
(saving about 7 hours in computing time).

<p class="mathjax">Linear codes are widely studied in coding theory as they have nice
applications in distributed storage, combinatorics, lattices, cryptography and
so on. Constructing linear codes with desirable properties is an interesting
research topic. In this paper, based on the augmentation technique, we present
two families of linear codes from some functions over finite fields. The first
family of linear codes is constructed from monomial functions over finite
fields. The locality of them is determined and the weight distributions of two
subfamilies of the codes are also given. An infinite family of almost optimal
recoverable codes and some optimal recoverable codes are obtained from the
linear codes. In particular, the two subfamilies of the codes are proved to be
both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal. The second
family of linear codes is constructed from weakly regular bent functions over
finite fields and their weight distribution is determined. This family of codes
is proved to have locality 3 for some cases and is conjectured to have locality
2 for other cases. Particularly, two families of optimal locally recoverable
codes are derived from the linear codes. Besides, this family of codes is also
proved to be both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the amalgamation of satellite communications and aerial
platforms into space-air-ground integrated network (SAGINs) has emerged as an
indispensable area of research for future communications due to the global
coverage capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the flexible
Deployment of aerial platforms. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based approach for the joint optimization of offloading and
resource allocation in hybrid cloud and multi-access edge computing (MEC)
scenarios within SAGINs. The proposed system considers the presence of multiple
satellites, clouds and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The multiple tasks from
ground users are modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). With the goal of
reducing energy consumption and latency in MEC, we propose a novel multi-agent
algorithm based on DRL that optimizes both the offloading strategy and the
allocation of resources in the MEC infrastructure within SAGIN. A hybrid action
algorithm is utilized to address the challenge of hybrid continuous and
discrete action space in the proposed problems, and a decision-assisted DRL
method is adopted to reduce the impact of unavailable actions in the training
process of DRL. Through extensive simulations, the results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed learning-based scheme, the proposed approach
consistently outperforms benchmark schemes, highlighting its superior
performance and potential for practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Including Artificial Neural Networks in embedded systems at the edge allows
applications to exploit Artificial Intelligence capabilities directly within
devices operating at the network periphery. This paper introduces Spiker+, a
comprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area
customized Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) accelerators on FPGA for inference at
the edge. Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN, a library
of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the
development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python
code. Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking
Heidelberg Digits (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance
compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of
resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs
(BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining
only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is
comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img. To the
authors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD. In
this case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an
overall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete
inference on input data. This underscores the significance of Spiker+ in the
hardware-accelerated SNN landscape, making it an excellent solution to deploy
configurable and tunable SNN architectures in resource and power-constrained
edge applications.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a novel semantic transmission framework in wireless
networks, leveraging the joint processing technique. Our framework enables
multiple cooperating base stations to efficiently transmit semantic information
to multiple users simultaneously. To enhance the semantic communication
efficiency of the transmission framework, we formulate an optimization problem
with the objective of maximizing the semantic spectral efficiency of the
framework and propose a lowcomplexity dynamic semantic mapping and resource
allocation algorithm. This algorithm, based on deep reinforcement learning and
alternative optimization, achieves near-optimal performance while reducing
computational complexity. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm, bridging the research gap and facilitating the practical

<p class="mathjax">In the age of personal voice assistants, the question of privacy arises.
These digital companions often lack memory of past interactions, while relying
heavily on the internet for speech processing, raising privacy concerns. Modern
smartphones now enable on-device speech processing, making cloud-based
solutions unnecessary. Personal assistants for the elderly should excel at
memory recall, especially in medical examinations. The e-ViTA project developed
a versatile conversational application with local processing and speaker
recognition. This paper highlights the importance of speaker diarization
enriched with sensor data fusion for contextualized conversation preservation.
The use cases applied to the e-VITA project have shown that truly personalized
dialogue is pivotal for individual voice assistants. Secure local processing
and sensor data fusion ensure virtual companions meet individual user needs
without compromising privacy or data security.

<p class="mathjax">We study search games between a mobile Searcher and an immobile Hider in
which the Searcher aims to minimize some payoff, which is either the time to
find the Hider (the search time), or a normalized search time. We consider a
new setting in which the Searcher has some potentially erroneous information,
or prediction on the Hider's position. Specifically, we study tradeoffs between
the consistency of a search strategy (i.e., its worst case expected payoff
assuming the prediction is correct) and the robustness (i.e., the worst case
expected payoff assuming that the prediction is adversarially generated). We
show how to apply this framework in search games over both discrete and
continuous, as well as bounded and unbounded spaces. Specifically, we prove
optimal consistency/robustness tradeoffs for three fundamental search games,
namely searching in a number of discrete locations, expanding search in a tree
network, and searching in the infinite line. Our study is the first to address
the full power of mixed (randomized) strategies; previous work focused only on
deterministic strategies, or relied on stochastic assumptions that do not
guarantee worst-case robustness in adversarial situations.

<p class="mathjax">The growing trend towards specialization has led to a proliferation of
accelerators and alternative processing devices. When embedded in conventional
computer architectures, the PCIe link connecting the CPU to these devices
becomes a bottleneck. Several proposals for alternative designs have been put
forward, with these efforts having now converged into the Compute Express Link
(CXL) specification. CXL is an interconnect protocol on top of PCIe with a more
modern and powerful interface. While still on version 1.0 in terms of
commercial availability, the potential of CXL to radically change the
underlying architecture has already attracted considerable attention. This
attention has been focused mainly on the possibility of using CXL to build a
shared memory system among the machines in a rack. We argue, however, that such
benefits are just the beginning of more significant changes that will have a
major impact on database engines and data processing systems. In a nutshell,
while the cloud favored scale-out approaches, CXL brings back scale-up
architectures. In the paper we describe how CXL enables such architectures, and
the research challenges associated with the emerging scale-up, heterogeneous
hardware platforms.

<p class="mathjax">One unique feature of nonlinear dynamical systems is the existence of
superharmonic and subharmonic resonances in addition to primary resonances. In
this study, an effective vibration testing methodology is introduced for the
experimental identification of these secondary resonances. The proposed method
relies on phase-locked loop control combined with adaptive filters for online
Fourier decomposition. To this end, the concept of a resonant phase lag is
exploited to define the target phase lag to be followed during the experimental
continuation process. The method is demonstrated using two systems featuring
cubic nonlinearities, namely a numerical Duffing oscillator and a physical
experiment comprising a clamped-clamped thin beam. The obtained results
highlight that the control scheme can accurately characterize secondary
resonances as well as track their backbone curves. A particularly salient
feature of the developed algorithm is that, starting from the rest position, it
facilitates an automatic and smooth dynamic state transfer toward one point of
a subharmonic isolated branch, hence, inducing branch switching.

<p class="mathjax">Context: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements
specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities. However, we
still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether
their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. Objective:
We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality
defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this
requirement. Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25
participants from industry and university generate domain models from four
natural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate
the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.
Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive
voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of
ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the
resulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect
associations in domain models. Conclusion: Despite being equally advised
against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows
that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on
software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of
attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to
improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.

<p class="mathjax">Marker code is an effective coding scheme to protect data from insertions and
deletions. It has potential applications in future storage systems, such as DNA
storage and racetrack memory. When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state
information (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to
detect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to
obtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to
develop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect
CSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker
code based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning
method, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker
code. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights
can be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which
is an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit
network. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed
methods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm
with CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits
better error performances than other methods for unknown channel models.

<p class="mathjax">Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance
over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression
has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the
substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices.
Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational
demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity
presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding
standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node
cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an
innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts
stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates
the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net,
the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality,
thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both
computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which
is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied
after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality
of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed
model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed
at low bit rates.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-class colorectal tissue classification is a challenging problem that is
typically addressed in a setting, where it is assumed that ample amounts of
training data is available. However, manual annotation of fine-grained
colorectal tissue samples of multiple classes, especially the rare ones like
stromal tumor and anal cancer is laborious and expensive. To address this, we
propose a knowledge distillation-based approach, named KD-CTCNet, that
effectively captures local texture information from few tissue samples, through
a distillation loss, to improve the standard CNN features. The resulting
enriched feature representation achieves improved classification performance
specifically in low data regimes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets
of colorectal tissues reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, with a
consistent gain achieved over different approaches across low data settings.
The code and models are publicly available on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">The electromagnetic inverse problem has long been a research hotspot. This
study aims to reverse radar view angles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
images given a target model. Nonetheless, the scarcity of SAR data, combined
with the intricate background interference and imaging mechanisms, limit the
applications of existing learning-based approaches. To address these
challenges, we propose an interactive deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
framework, where an electromagnetic simulator named differentiable SAR render
(DSR) is embedded to facilitate the interaction between the agent and the
environment, simulating a human-like process of angle prediction. Specifically,
DSR generates SAR images at arbitrary view angles in real-time. And the
differences in sequential and semantic aspects between the view
angle-corresponding images are leveraged to construct the state space in DRL,
which effectively suppress the complex background interference, enhance the
sensitivity to temporal variations, and improve the capability to capture
fine-grained information. Additionally, in order to maintain the stability and
convergence of our method, a series of reward mechanisms, such as memory
difference, smoothing and boundary penalty, are utilized to form the final
reward function. Extensive experiments performed on both simulated and real
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.
When utilized in the cross-domain area, the proposed method greatly mitigates
inconsistency between simulated and real domains, outperforming reference
methods significantly.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a
global model without disclosing their respective local labels. A crucial step
of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many
similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular. In that
context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks,
can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth
1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules. In this
paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic
voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based
elections. Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful
mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant
strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple
real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against
poisoning attacks. It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting
``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits
even further. Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with
Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness
against both poisoning and privacy attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and
operational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine
vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their
health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled
environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational
speeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion
of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing
faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate
the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their
non-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also
elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their
effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with
different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency
convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in
rolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the
superior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques.
They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary
features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to
noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise
ratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial
accuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.

<p class="mathjax">We present En3D, an enhanced generative scheme for sculpting high-quality 3D
human avatars. Unlike previous works that rely on scarce 3D datasets or limited
2D collections with imbalanced viewing angles and imprecise pose priors, our
approach aims to develop a zero-shot 3D generative scheme capable of producing
visually realistic, geometrically accurate and content-wise diverse 3D humans
without relying on pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. To address this challenge, we
introduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical
modeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data.
During inference, we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between
realistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically, En3D comprises three
modules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with
realistic appearance from synthesized balanced, diverse, and structured human
images; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal
constraints for intricate human anatomy; and a texturing module that
disentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability, leveraging
semantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms prior works in terms
of image quality, geometry accuracy and content diversity. We also showcase the
applicability of our generated avatars for animation and editing, as well as
the scalability of our approach for content-style free adaptation.

<p class="mathjax">Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex
scenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge. The
development of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its
reversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity
of SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target
parameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper
proposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers
both Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented
by the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution
function (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the
perturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic
combination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore,
a differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed
for CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image
simulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the
rapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of
this approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real
SAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial
enhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation
conditions have been demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the fundamental limit of semantic communications over the
discrete memoryless channel. We consider the scenario to send a semantic source
consisting of an observation state and its corresponding semantic state, both
of which are recovered at the receiver. To derive the performance limitation,
we adopt the semantic rate-distortion function (SRDF) to study the relationship
among the minimum compression rate, observation distortion, semantic
distortion, and channel capacity. For the case with unknown semantic source
distribution, while only a set of the source samples is available, we propose a
neural-network-based method by leveraging the generative networks to learn the
semantic source distribution. Furthermore, for a special case where the
semantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a
cascade neural network to estimate the SRDF. For the case with perfectly known
semantic source distribution, we propose a general Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to
effectively compute the SRDF. Finally, experimental results validate our
proposed algorithms for the scenarios with ideal Gaussian semantic source and
some practical datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation techniques for extracting building footprints from
high-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used in many fields such
as urban planning. However, large-scale building extraction demands higher
diversity in training samples. In this paper, we construct a Global Building
Semantic Segmentation (GBSS) dataset (The dataset will be released), which
comprises 116.9k pairs of samples (about 742k buildings) from six continents.
There are significant variations of building samples in terms of size and
style, so the dataset can be a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the
generalization and robustness of building semantic segmentation models. We
validated through quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different
datasets, and further confirmed the potential application in the field of
transfer learning by conducting experiments on subsets.

<p class="mathjax">Modern healthcare often utilises radiographic images alongside textual
reports for diagnostics, encouraging the use of Vision-Language Self-Supervised
Learning (VL-SSL) with large pre-trained models to learn versatile medical
vision representations. However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained
end-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information
embedded in pre-trained encoders. To address both issues, we introduce the
backbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in
pre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a
lightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning. Experiments on medical
image classification and segmentation tasks across three datasets reveal that
our framework delivers competitive performance while cutting trainable
parameters by over 90% compared to current pre-training approaches. Notably,
when fine-tuned with just 1% of data, Adaptor outperforms several
Transformer-based methods trained on full datasets in medical image
segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Deforestation, a major contributor to climate change, poses detrimental
consequences such as agricultural sector disruption, global warming, flash
floods, and landslides. Conventional approaches to urban street tree inventory
suffer from inaccuracies and necessitate specialised equipment. To overcome
these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method that leverages deep
learning techniques and mobile phone imaging for urban street tree inventory.
Our approach utilises a pair of images captured by smartphone cameras to
accurately segment tree trunks and compute the diameter at breast height (DBH).
Compared to traditional methods, our approach exhibits several advantages,
including superior accuracy, reduced dependency on specialised equipment, and
applicability in hard-to-reach areas. We evaluated our method on a
comprehensive dataset of 400 trees and achieved a DBH estimation accuracy with
an error rate of less than 2.5%. Our method holds significant potential for
substantially improving forest management practices. By enhancing the accuracy
and efficiency of tree inventory, our model empowers urban management to
mitigate the adverse effects of deforestation and climate change.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying labels that did not appear during training, known as multi-label
zero-shot learning, is a non-trivial task in computer vision. To this end,
recent studies have attempted to explore the multi-modal knowledge of
vision-language pre-training (VLP) models by knowledge distillation, allowing
to recognize unseen labels in an open-vocabulary manner. However, experimental
evidence shows that knowledge distillation is suboptimal and provides limited
performance gain in unseen label prediction. In this paper, a novel query-based
knowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge
from the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification.
Specifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to
extract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared
across all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues
for recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label
embedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of
classification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which
both significantly benefit label recognition. Experimental results show that
our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot
task by 5.9% and 4.5% in mAP on the NUS-WIDE and Open Images, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Data-to-text (D2T) generation aims to transform structured data into natural
language text. Data-to-text pre-training has proved to be powerful in enhancing
D2T generation and yields impressive performances. However, previous
pre-training methods either oversimplified structured data into a sequence
without considering input structures or designed training objectives tailored
for a specific data structure (e.g., table or knowledge graph). In this paper,
we unify different types of structured data (i.e., table, key-value data,
knowledge graph) into the graph format and cast different data-to-text
generation tasks as graph-to-text generation. To effectively exploit the
structural information of the input graph, we propose a structure-enhanced
pre-training method for D2T generation by designing a structure-enhanced
Transformer. Concretely, we devise a position matrix for the Transformer,
encoding relative positional information of connected nodes in the input graph.
In addition, we propose a new attention matrix to incorporate graph structures
into the original Transformer by taking the available explicit connectivity
structure into account. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show
the effectiveness of our model. Our source codes are available at

<p class="mathjax">In first-price and all-pay auctions under the standard symmetric independent
private-values model, we show that the unique Bayesian Coarse Correlated
Equilibrium with symmetric, differentiable and strictly increasing bidding
strategies is the unique strict Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. Interestingly, this
result does not require assumptions on the prior distribution. The proof is
based on a dual bound of the infinite-dimensional linear program. Numerical
experiments without restrictions on bidding strategies show that for
first-price auctions and discretisations up to 21 of the type and bid space,
increasing discretisation sizes actually increase the concentration of Bayesian
Coarse Correlated Equilibrium over the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, so long as
the prior c.d.f. is concave. Such a concentration is also observed for all-pay
auctions, independent of the prior distribution. Overall, our results imply
that the equilibria of these important class of auctions are indeed learnable.

<p class="mathjax">Neural implicit representations have been explored to enhance visual SLAM
algorithms, especially in providing high-fidelity dense map. Existing methods
operate robustly in static scenes but struggle with the disruption caused by
moving objects. In this paper we present NID-SLAM, which significantly improves
the performance of neural SLAM in dynamic environments. We propose a new
approach to enhance inaccurate regions in semantic masks, particularly in
marginal areas. Utilizing the geometric information present in depth images,
this method enables accurate removal of dynamic objects, thereby reducing the
probability of camera drift. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe selection
strategy for dynamic scenes, which enhances camera tracking robustness against
large-scale objects and improves the efficiency of mapping. Experiments on
publicly available RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
competitive neural SLAM approaches in tracking accuracy and mapping quality in
dynamic environments.

<p class="mathjax">In many recent works, the potential of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)
features to numerically characterize, in particular, single-objective
continuous optimization problems has been demonstrated. These numerical
features provide the input for all kinds of machine learning tasks on
continuous optimization problems, ranging, i.a., from High-level Property
Prediction to Automated Algorithm Selection and Automated Algorithm
Configuration. Without ELA features, analyzing and understanding the
characteristics of single-objective continuous optimization problems would be
impossible.
<br />Yet, despite their undisputed usefulness, ELA features suffer from several
drawbacks. These include, in particular, (1.) a strong correlation between
multiple features, as well as (2.) its very limited applicability to
multi-objective continuous optimization problems. As a remedy, recent works
proposed deep learning-based approaches as alternatives to ELA. In these works,
e.g., point-cloud transformers were used to characterize an optimization
problem's fitness landscape. However, these approaches require a large amount
of labeled training data.
<br />Within this work, we propose a hybrid approach, Deep-ELA, which combines (the
benefits of) deep learning and ELA features. Specifically, we pre-trained four
transformers on millions of randomly generated optimization problems to learn
deep representations of the landscapes of continuous single- and
multi-objective optimization problems. Our proposed framework can either be
used out-of-the-box for analyzing single- and multi-objective continuous
optimization problems, or subsequently fine-tuned to various tasks focussing on
algorithm behavior and problem understanding.

<p class="mathjax">Buffer-aided cooperative networks (BACNs) have garnered significant attention
due to their potential applications in beyond fifth generation (B5G) or sixth
generation (6G) critical scenarios. This article explores various typical
application scenarios of buffer-aided relaying in B5G/6G networks to emphasize
the importance of incorporating BACN. Additionally, we delve into the crucial
technical challenges in BACN, including stringent delay constraints, high
reliability, imperfect channel state information (CSI), transmission security,
and integrated network architecture. To address the challenges, we propose
leveraging deep learning-based methods for the design and operation of B5G/6G
networks with BACN, deviating from conventional buffer-aided relay selection
approaches. In particular, we present two case studies to demonstrate the
efficacy of centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and decentralized DRL
in buffer-aided non-terrestrial networks. Finally, we outline future research
directions in B5G/6G that pertain to the utilization of BACN.

<p class="mathjax">Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and
distorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been
shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling
statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess
ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a
new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to
categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New
dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information.
We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing
context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated
questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification
performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may
provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.

<p class="mathjax">Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples
against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on
increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on
one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general,
theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a
Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the
effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of
the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting
the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a
Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an
optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem
originally introduced by Szegedy et al. \cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The
experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which
is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes.
Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification
scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the
labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a
capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a
further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus
resulting more efficient than existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Skin lesions are classified in benign or malignant. Among the malignant,
melanoma is a very aggressive cancer and the major cause of deaths. So, early
diagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a
growing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and
clinical data of the lesion. These sources of information present limitations
due to their inability to provide information of the molecular structure of the
lesion. NIR spectroscopy may provide an alternative source of information to
automated CAD of skin lesions. The most commonly used techniques and
classification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support
Vector Machines (SVM). Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in applying the
modern techniques of machine and deep learning (MDL) to spectroscopy. One of
the main limitations to apply MDL to spectroscopy is the lack of public
datasets. Since there is no public dataset of NIR spectral data to skin
lesions, as far as we know, an effort has been made and a new dataset named
NIR-SC-UFES, has been collected, annotated and analyzed generating the
gold-standard for classification of NIR spectral data to skin cancer. Next, the
machine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-convolutional
neural network (1D-CNN) were investigated to classify cancer and non-cancer
skin lesions. Experimental results indicate the best performance obtained by
LightGBM with pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV), feature
extraction providing values of 0.839 for balanced accuracy, 0.851 for recall,
0.852 for precision, and 0.850 for F-score. The obtained results indicate the
first steps in CAD of skin lesions aiming the automated triage of patients with
skin lesions in vivo using NIR spectral data.

<p class="mathjax">The current approach to fetal anomaly screening is based on biometric
measurements derived from individually selected ultrasound images. In this
paper, we introduce a paradigm shift that attains human-level performance in
biometric measurement by aggregating automatically extracted biometrics from
every frame across an entire scan, with no need for operator intervention. We
use a convolutional neural network to classify each frame of an ultrasound
video recording. We then measure fetal biometrics in every frame where
appropriate anatomy is visible. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the true
value of each biometric from a large number of measurements and
probabilistically reject outliers. We performed a retrospective experiment on
1457 recordings (comprising 48 million frames) of 20-week ultrasound scans,
estimated fetal biometrics in those scans and compared our estimates to the
measurements sonographers took during the scan. Our method achieves human-level
performance in estimating fetal biometrics and estimates well-calibrated
credible intervals in which the true biometric value is expected to lie.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of machine learning and growing concerns about
data privacy, federated learning has become an increasingly prominent focus.
However, challenges such as attacks on model parameters and the lack of
incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning. Therefore,
we propose a Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model
(PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and promote the active
participation of nodes in model training. Blockchain ensures that model
parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) remain unaltered. A
novel adaptive differential privacy addition algorithm is simultaneously
applied to local and global models, preserving the privacy of local models and
preventing a decrease in the security of the global model due to the presence
of numerous local models in federated learning. Additionally, we introduce a
new mix transactions mechanism to better protect the identity privacy of local
training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that
PPBFL outperforms baseline methods in both model performance and security.

<p class="mathjax">In human-centric content generation, the pre-trained text-to-image models
struggle to produce user-wanted portrait images, which retain the identity of
individuals while exhibiting diverse expressions. This paper introduces our
efforts towards personalized face generation. To this end, we propose a novel
multi-modal face generation framework, capable of simultaneous
identity-expression control and more fine-grained expression synthesis. Our
expression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the
fine-grained emotional vocabulary. We devise a novel diffusion model that can
undertake the task of simultaneously face swapping and reenactment. Due to the
entanglement of identity and expression, it's nontrivial to separately and
precisely control them in one framework, thus has not been explored yet. To
overcome this, we propose several innovative designs in the conditional
diffusion model, including balancing identity and expression encoder, improved
midpoint sampling, and explicitly background conditioning. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated the controllability and scalability of the
proposed framework, in comparison with state-of-the-art text-to-image, face
swapping, and face reenactment methods.

<p class="mathjax">Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical
applications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual
localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from
estimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density
images.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called
Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating
density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that
represent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion
module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature
maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to
both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted
point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence
level for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet
establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points
by employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust
loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of
annotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd
counting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
FGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its
superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively,
FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\_CC\_50 dataset with an
astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.

<p class="mathjax">Traditional manual detection for solder joint defect is no longer applied
during industrial production due to low efficiency, inconsistent evaluation,
high cost and lack of real-time data. A new approach has been proposed to
address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rates and
computational cost of solder joint defect detection in surface mount technology
of industrial scenarios. The proposed solution is a hybrid attention mechanism
designed specifically for the solder joint defect detection algorithm to
improve quality control in the manufacturing process by increasing the accuracy
while reducing the computational cost. The hybrid attention mechanism comprises
a proposed enhanced multi-head self-attention and coordinate attention
mechanisms increase the ability of attention networks to perceive contextual
information and enhances the utilization range of network features. The
coordinate attention mechanism enhances the connection between different
channels and reduces location information loss. The hybrid attention mechanism
enhances the capability of the network to perceive long-distance position
information and learn local features. The improved algorithm model has good
detection ability for solder joint defect detection, with mAP reaching 91.5%,
4.3% higher than the You Only Look Once version 5 algorithm and better than
other comparative algorithms. Compared to other versions, mean Average
Precision, Precision, Recall, and Frame per Seconds indicators have also
improved. The improvement of detection accuracy can be achieved while meeting
real-time detection requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been proposed as an innovative 3D
representation method. While attracting lots of attention, NeRF faces critical
issues such as information confidentiality and security. Steganography is a
technique used to embed information in another object as a means of protecting
information security. Currently, there are few related studies on NeRF
steganography, facing challenges in low steganography quality, model weight
damage, and a limited amount of steganographic information. This paper proposes
a novel NeRF steganography method based on trainable noise: Noise-NeRF.
Furthermore, we propose the Adaptive Pixel Selection strategy and Pixel
Perturbation strategy to improve the steganography quality and efficiency. The
extensive experiments on open-source datasets show that Noise-NeRF provides
state-of-the-art performances in both steganography quality and rendering
quality, as well as effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography.

<p class="mathjax">As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative
mode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the
edge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose
coupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge,
workflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the
difficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management.
To address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme
named KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge
cloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine
for KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and
vertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge
workflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and
cloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to
maximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task
delay. A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the
cloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve
cloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional
roles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming
among the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges
for workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application
collaboration. Through a customized IoT application workflow instance,
experimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total
workflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the
capabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the
domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the
dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation
performance. Experimental result shows that LLMs are prone to exhibit position
bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or
specific positional cues within the input. Existing works on mitigating
position bias require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples,
which is unpractical in reality. In this work, we propose a zero-shot position
debiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. ZOE leverages
unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing, thus without any
external knowledge or datasets. To improve the quality of unsupervised
responses, we propose a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to prune these
responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that ZOE
consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating four types of position
biases. Besides, ZOE achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on
biased samples, which is simple and effective.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are
learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter
transfer. To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated
data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input
sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks. However, collecting such
annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from
datasets available for individual tasks. In this work, we challenge this setup
and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or
non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of
labeled data per task. We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and
co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled
between the tasks via distribution matching. To demonstrate the general
applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains
of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping
item classification using nine datasets. Our large-scale study of affective
tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection
illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance
improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all
studied databases. In all case studies, we show that co-training via
task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs
when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task
model).

<p class="mathjax">Multiscale dynamical systems, modeled by high-dimensional stiff ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) with wide-ranging characteristic timescales,
arise across diverse fields of science and engineering, but their numerical
solvers often encounter severe efficiency bottlenecks. This paper introduces a
novel DeePODE method, which consists of a global multiscale sampling method and
a fitting by deep neural networks to handle multiscale systems. DeePODE's
primary contribution is to address the multiscale challenge of efficiently
uncovering representative training sets by combining the Monte Carlo method and
the ODE system's intrinsic evolution without suffering from the ``curse of
dimensionality''. The DeePODE method is validated in multiscale systems from
diverse areas, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a
battery electrolyte auto-ignition, and turbulent flames. Our methods exhibit
strong generalization capabilities to unseen conditions, highlighting the power
of deep learning in modeling intricate multiscale dynamical processes across
science and engineering domains.

and terahertz (THz) communications are considered in the wireless community.
This paper aims to design a beam-based multiple-access strategy for this new
paradigm. Its key idea is to make use of multiple sub-arrays over a hybrid
digital-analog array to form independent beams, each of which is steered
towards the desired direction to mitigate inter-user interference and suppress
unwanted signal reflection. The proposed scheme combines the advantages of both
orthogonal multiple access (i.e., no inter-user interference) and
non-orthogonal multiple access (i.e., full time-frequency resource use).
Consequently, it can substantially boost the system capacity, as verified by
Monte-Carlo simulations.

<p class="mathjax">The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the
development of the computer vision field. Nowadays, there's always a need to
develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an
efficient, meaningful way. In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a
multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition
with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face
shape, and emotion. We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16
inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. This
unification allows for simpler integration across modalities. It makes it
easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good
indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and
potential connection. For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test
accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected
from the FERET database[1]. We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the
public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem. We were also able to
achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the
celebrity face-shape dataset[3]. Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy
of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy
compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4].

<p class="mathjax">Graphs are typical non-Euclidean data of complex structures. In recent years,
Riemannian graph representation learning has emerged as an exciting alternative
to Euclidean ones. However, Riemannian methods are still in an early stage:
most of them present a single curvature (radius) regardless of structural
complexity, suffer from numerical instability due to the
exponential/logarithmic map, and lack the ability to capture motif regularity.
In light of the issues above, we propose the problem of \emph{Motif-aware
Riemannian Graph Representation Learning}, seeking a numerically stable encoder
to capture motif regularity in a diverse-curvature manifold without labels. To
this end, we present a novel Motif-aware Riemannian model with
Generative-Contrastive learning (MotifRGC), which conducts a minmax game in
Riemannian manifold in a self-supervised manner. First, we propose a new type
of Riemannian GCN (D-GCN), in which we construct a diverse-curvature manifold
by a product layer with the diversified factor, and replace the
exponential/logarithmic map by a stable kernel layer. Second, we introduce a
motif-aware Riemannian generative-contrastive learning to capture motif
regularity in the constructed manifold and learn motif-aware node
representation without external labels. Empirical results show the superiority
of MofitRGC.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied across various domains, yet
they perform poorly in deep layers. Existing research typically attributes this
problem to node over-smoothing, where node representations become
indistinguishable after multiple rounds of propagation. In this paper, we delve
into the neighborhood propagation mechanism of GNNs and discover that the real
root cause of GNNs' performance degradation in deep layers lies in ineffective
neighborhood feature propagation. This propagation leads to an exponential
growth of a node's current representation at every propagation step, making it
extremely challenging to capture valuable dependencies between long-distance
nodes. To address this issue, we introduce Graph Elimination Networks (GENs),
which employ a specific algorithm to eliminate redundancies during neighborhood
propagation. We demonstrate that GENs can enhance nodes' perception of distant
neighborhoods and extend the depth of network propagation. Extensive
experiments show that GENs outperform the state-of-the-art methods on various
graph-level and node-level datasets.

connected in the local networks, which are structured as rooted trees. A recent

<p class="mathjax">The sequential interaction network usually find itself in a variety of
applications, e.g., recommender system. Herein, inferring future interaction is
of fundamental importance, and previous efforts are mainly focused on the
dynamics in the classic zero-curvature Euclidean space. Despite the promising
results achieved by previous methods, a range of significant issues still
largely remains open: On the bipartite nature, is it appropriate to place user
and item nodes in one identical space regardless of their inherent difference?
On the network dynamics, instead of a fixed curvature space, will the
representation spaces evolve when new interactions arrive continuously? On the
learning paradigm, can we get rid of the label information costly to acquire?
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Contrastive model for
Sequential Interaction Network learning on Co-Evolving RiEmannian spaces,
CSINCERE. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a couple
of co-evolving representation spaces, rather than a single or static space, and
propose a co-contrastive learning for the sequential interaction network. In
CSINCERE, we formulate a Cross-Space Aggregation for message-passing across
representation spaces of different Riemannian geometries, and design a Neural
Curvature Estimator based on Ricci curvatures for modeling the space evolvement
over time. Thereafter, we present a Reweighed Co-Contrast between the temporal
views of the sequential network, so that the couple of Riemannian spaces
interact with each other for the interaction prediction without labels.
Empirical results on 5 public datasets show the superiority of CSINCERE over
the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics,
surveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully
explore the spatial information between the template and the search region and
locate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT
trackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either
ignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and
training. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the
latter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To
alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking
framework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure
and captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the
two-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and
cross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template
respectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal
information and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition,
we design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two
branches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales.
Extensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed.

<p class="mathjax">The early identification of diseases in cocoa pods is an important task to
guarantee the production of high-quality cocoa. The use of artificial
intelligence techniques such as machine learning, computer vision and deep
learning are promising solutions to help identify and classify diseases in
cocoa pods. In this paper we introduce the development and evaluation of a deep
learning computational model applied to the identification of diseases in cocoa
pods, focusing on "monilia" and "black pod" diseases. An exhaustive review of
state-of-the-art of computational models was carried out, based on scientific
articles related to the identification of plant diseases using computer vision
and deep learning techniques. As a result of the search, EfficientDet-Lite4, an
efficient and lightweight model for object detection, was selected. A dataset,
including images of both healthy and diseased cocoa pods, has been utilized to
train the model to detect and pinpoint disease manifestations with considerable
accuracy. Significant enhancements in the model training and evaluation
demonstrate the capability of recognizing and classifying diseases through
image analysis. Furthermore, the functionalities of the model were integrated
into an Android native mobile with an user-friendly interface, allowing to
younger or inexperienced farmers a fast and accuracy identification of health
status of cocoa pods

<p class="mathjax">From politicians to podcast hosts, online platforms have systematically
banned (``deplatformed'') influential users for breaking platform guidelines.
Previous inquiries on the effectiveness of this intervention are inconclusive
because 1) they consider only few deplatforming events; 2) they consider only
overt engagement traces (e.g., likes and posts) but not passive engagement
(e.g., views); 3) they do not consider all the potential places users impacted
by the deplatforming event might migrate to. We address these limitations in a
longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at
101 influencers. We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then
manually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of
deplatforming events. Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia
page views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the
general public's interest in specific influencers. Through a
difference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online
attention toward influencers. After 12 months, we estimate that online
attention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by -63% (95% CI
[-75%,-46%]) on Google and by -43% (95% CI [-57%,-24%]) on Wikipedia. Further,
as we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases
deplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the
intervention. Notably, we find that both permanent and temporary deplatforming
reduce online attention toward influencers; Overall, this work contributes to
the ongoing effort to map the effectiveness of content moderation
interventions, driving platform governance away from speculation.

<p class="mathjax">The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have
significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for
the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with
only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate
multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely
manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance
of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, namely VideoDrafter, for content-consistent multi-scene video
generation. Technically, VideoDrafter leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to
convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits
from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a
prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as
camera movement. VideoDrafter identifies the common entities throughout the
script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is
then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each
entity. Finally, VideoDrafter outputs a multi-scene video by generating each
scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the
descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion
model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to
strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VideoDrafter outperforms the SOTA video generation models in
terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.

<p class="mathjax">This paper documents a year-long experiment to "profile" the process of
learning a programming language: gathering data to understand what makes a
language hard to learn, and using that data to improve the learning process. We
added interactive quizzes to The Rust Programming Language, the official
textbook for learning Rust. Over 13 months, 62,526 readers answered questions
1,140,202 times. First, we analyze the trajectories of readers. We find that
many readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language
concepts like Rust's ownership types. Second, we use classical test theory and
item response theory to analyze the characteristics of quiz questions. We find
that better questions are more conceptual in nature, such as asking why a
program does not compile vs. whether a program compiles. Third, we performed 12
interventions into the book to help readers with difficult questions. We find
that on average, interventions improved quiz scores on the targeted questions
by +20%. Fourth, we show that our technique can likely generalize to languages
with smaller user bases by simulating our statistical inferences on small N.
These results demonstrate that quizzes are a simple and useful technique for
understanding language learning at all scales.

<p class="mathjax">Concept-based learning improves a deep learning model's interpretability by
explaining its predictions via human-understandable concepts. Deep learning
models trained under this paradigm heavily rely on the assumption that neural
networks can learn to predict the presence or absence of a given concept
independently of other concepts. Recent work, however, strongly suggests that
this assumption may fail to hold in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a
quintessential family of concept-based interpretable architectures. In this
paper, we investigate whether CBMs correctly capture the degree of conditional
independence across concepts when such concepts are localised both spatially,
by having their values entirely defined by a fixed subset of features, and
semantically, by having their values correlated with only a fixed subset of
predefined concepts. To understand locality, we analyse how changes to features
outside of a concept's spatial or semantic locality impact concept predictions.
Our results suggest that even in well-defined scenarios where the presence of a
concept is localised to a fixed feature subspace, or whose semantics are
correlated to a small subset of other concepts, CBMs fail to learn this
locality. These results cast doubt upon the quality of concept representations
learnt by CBMs and strongly suggest that concept-based explanations may be
fragile to changes outside their localities.

<p class="mathjax">Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an important role in our daily lives,
particularly due to the enormous progress of Large Language Models (LLM).
However, NLP has many fairness-critical use cases, e.g., as an expert system in
recruitment or as an LLM-based tutor in education. Since NLP is based on human
language, potentially harmful biases can diffuse into NLP systems and produce
unfair results, discriminate against minorities or generate legal issues.
Hence, it is important to develop a fairness certification for NLP approaches.
We follow a qualitative research approach towards a fairness certification for
NLP. In particular, we have reviewed a large body of literature on algorithmic
fairness, and we have conducted semi-structured expert interviews with a wide
range of experts from that area. We have systematically devised six fairness
criteria for NLP, which can be further refined into 18 sub-categories. Our
criteria offer a foundation for operationalizing and testing processes to
certify fairness, both from the perspective of the auditor and the audited
organization.

<p class="mathjax">When identifying electrical, mechanical, or biological systems, parametric
continuous-time identification methods can lead to interpretable and
parsimonious models when the model structure aligns with the physical
properties of the system. Traditional linear system identification may not
consider the most parsimonious model when relying solely on unfactored transfer
functions, which typically result from standard direct approaches. This paper
presents a novel identification method that delivers additive models for both
open and closed-loop setups. The estimators that are derived are shown to be
generically consistent, and can admit the identification of marginally stable
additive systems. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed
approach, and its performance in identifying a modal representation of a
flexible beam is verified using experimental data.

<p class="mathjax">In deep learning, classification tasks are formalized as optimization
problems solved via the minimization of the cross-entropy. However, recent
advancements in the design of objective functions allow the $f$-divergence
measure to generalize the formulation of the optimization problem for
classification. With this goal in mind, we adopt a Bayesian perspective and
formulate the classification task as a maximum a posteriori probability
problem. We propose a class of objective functions based on the variational
representation of the $f$-divergence, from which we extract a list of five
posterior probability estimators leveraging well-known $f$-divergences. In
addition, driven by the challenge of improving the state-of-the-art approach,
we propose a bottom-up method that leads us to the formulation of a new
objective function (and posterior probability estimator) corresponding to a
novel $f$-divergence referred to as shifted log (SL). First, we theoretically
prove the convergence property of the posterior probability estimators. Then,
we numerically test the set of proposed objective functions in three
application scenarios: toy examples, image data sets, and signal
detection/decoding problems. The analyzed tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed estimators and that the SL divergence achieves the highest
classification accuracy in almost all the scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the continued research and progress in building secure systems,
Android applications continue to be ridden with vulnerabilities, necessitating
effective detection methods. Current strategies involving static and dynamic
analysis tools come with limitations like overwhelming number of false
positives and limited scope of analysis which make either difficult to adopt.
Over the past years, machine learning based approaches have been extensively
explored for vulnerability detection, but its real-world applicability is
constrained by data requirements and feature engineering challenges. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their vast parameters, have shown tremendous
potential in understanding semnatics in human as well as programming languages.
We dive into the efficacy of LLMs for detecting vulnerabilities in the context
of Android security. We focus on building an AI-driven workflow to assist
developers in identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities. Our experiments show
that LLMs outperform our expectations in finding issues within applications
correctly flagging insecure apps in 91.67% of cases in the Ghera benchmark. We
use inferences from our experiments towards building a robust and actionable
vulnerability detection system and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our
experiments also shed light on how different various simple configurations can
affect the True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) rates.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the studies of neural networks (e.g.,the neural tangent kernel
theory), we perform a study on the large-dimensional behavior of kernel ridge
regression (KRR) where the sample size $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma &gt;
0$. Given an RKHS $\mathcal{H}$ associated with an inner product kernel defined
on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we suppose that the true function $f_{\rho}^{*}
\in [\mathcal{H}]^{s}$, the interpolation space of $\mathcal{H}$ with source
condition $s&gt;0$. We first determined the exact order (both upper and lower
bound) of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression for the optimally
chosen regularization parameter $\lambda$. We then further showed that when
$0&lt;s\le1$, KRR is minimax optimal; and when $s&gt;1$, KRR is not minimax optimal
(a.k.a. he saturation effect). Our results illustrate that the curves of rate
varying along $\gamma$ exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the multiple
descent behavior and show how the curves evolve with $s&gt;0$. Interestingly, our
work provides a unified viewpoint of several recent works on kernel regression
in the large-dimensional setting, which correspond to $s=0$ and $s=1$
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Vector quantization-based image semantic communication systems have
successfully boosted transmission efficiency, but face a challenge with
conflicting requirements between codebook design and digital constellation
modulation. Traditional codebooks need a wide index range, while modulation
favors few discrete states. To address this, we propose a multilevel generative
semantic communication system with a two-stage training framework. In the first
stage, we train a high-quality codebook, using a multi-head octonary codebook
(MOC) to compress the index range. We also integrate a residual vector
quantization (RVQ) mechanism for effective multilevel communication. In the
second stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is
introduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving
as a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature
restoration. Experimental results highlight MOC-RVQ's superior performance over
methods like BPG or JPEG, even without channel error correction coding.

<p class="mathjax">Agricultural management, with a particular focus on fertilization strategies,
holds a central role in shaping crop yield, economic profitability, and
environmental sustainability. While conventional guidelines offer valuable
insights, their efficacy diminishes when confronted with extreme weather
conditions, such as heatwaves and droughts. In this study, we introduce an
innovative framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Leveraging the Gym-DSSAT simulator, we train
an intelligent agent to master optimal nitrogen fertilization management.
Through a series of simulation experiments conducted on corn crops in Iowa, we
compare Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models with Markov
Decision Process (MDP) models. Our research underscores the advantages of
utilizing sequential observations in developing more efficient nitrogen input
policies. Additionally, we explore the impact of climate variability,
particularly during extreme weather events, on agricultural outcomes and
management. Our findings demonstrate the adaptability of fertilization policies
to varying climate conditions. Notably, a fixed policy exhibits resilience in
the face of minor climate fluctuations, leading to commendable corn yields,
cost-effectiveness, and environmental conservation. However, our study
illuminates the need for agent retraining to acquire new optimal policies under
extreme weather events. This research charts a promising course toward
adaptable fertilization strategies that can seamlessly align with dynamic
climate scenarios, ultimately contributing to the optimization of crop
management practices.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
generative agents. Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs)
attract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage
users. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in
this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark
for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality
dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues,
encompassing 23,020 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese
novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial
dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control,
and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike.
CharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen
targeted metrics on four dimensions. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval
demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in
Chinese role-playing conversation. Source code, data source and reward model
will be publicly accessible at https://github.com/morecry/CharacterEval.

<p class="mathjax">Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern
data-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions. These
engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data
on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping
computations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for
efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time.
Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this
computational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale
analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully
automated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be
detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the
ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).
Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.
<br />In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing
GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for
efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO
introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out
nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback
loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.
Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can
transfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive
empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields
significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and
finds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence
detection approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic machine translation metrics often use human translations to
determine the quality system translations. Common wisdom in the field dictates
that the human references should be of very high quality. However, there are no
cost-benefit analyses that could be used to guide practitioners who plan to
collect references for machine translation evaluation. We find that
higher-quality references lead to better metric correlations with humans at the
segment-level. Having up to 7 references per segment and taking their average
helps all metrics. Interestingly, the references from vendors of different
qualities can be mixed together and improve metric success. Higher quality
references, however, cost more to create and we frame this as an optimization
problem: given a specific budget, what references should be collected to
maximize metric success. These findings can be used by evaluators of shared
tasks when references need to be created under a certain budget.

<p class="mathjax">Given the potential for technology to inflict harm and injustice on society,
it is imperative that we cultivate a sense of social responsibility among our
students as they progress through the Computer Science (CS) curriculum. Our
students need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology
development and use are situated. Also, aligning students' personal goals and
their ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for
promoting motivation and a sense of belonging. Promoting communal goals while
learning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups
who have been historically marginalized in computing. Keeping these
considerations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in
which activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible
considerations were integrated across modules. Rather than adding social on top
of the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together.
The data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the
social context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed
greater agency in realizing social change. We share our approach to designing
this new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students'
reflections. We also highlight seven considerations for educators seeking to
incorporate socially responsible computing.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in
understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.
However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands
during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge
is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating
frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new
knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many
applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address
deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in
efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,
recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for
LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains
while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we
first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive
review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and
cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that
classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external
knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.
Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.
Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can
provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within
LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,
outlining its broad and impactful implications.

<p class="mathjax">Channel modeling is fundamental in advancing wireless systems and has thus
attracted considerable research focus. Recent trends have seen a growing
reliance on data-driven techniques to facilitate the modeling process and yield
accurate channel predictions. In this work, we first provide a concise overview
of data-driven channel modeling methods, highlighting their limitations.
Subsequently, we introduce the concept and advantages of physics-informed
neural network (PINN)-based modeling and a summary of recent contributions in
this area. Our findings demonstrate that PINN-based approaches in channel
modeling exhibit promising attributes such as generalizability,
interpretability, and robustness. We offer a comprehensive architecture for
PINN methodology, designed to inform and inspire future model development. A
case-study of our recent work on precise indoor channel prediction with
semantic segmentation and deep learning is presented. The study concludes by
addressing the challenges faced and suggesting potential research directions in
this field.

<p class="mathjax">We study a variant of the searching problem where the environment consists of
a known terrain and the goal is to obtain visibility of an unknown target point
on the surface of the terrain. The searcher starts on the surface of the
terrain and is allowed to fly above the terrain. The goal is to devise a
searching strategy that minimizes the competitive ratio, that is, the
worst-case ratio between the distance traveled by the searching strategy and
the minimum travel distance needed to detect the target. For $1.5$D terrains we
show that any searching strategy has a competitive ratio of at least
$\sqrt{82}$ and we present a nearly-optimal searching strategy that achieves a
competitive ratio of $3\sqrt{19/2} \approx \sqrt{82} + 0.19$. This strategy
extends directly to the case where the searcher has no knowledge of the terrain
beforehand. For $2.5$D terrains we show that the optimal competitive ratio
depends on the maximum slope $\lambda$ of the terrain, and is hence unbounded
in general. Specifically, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\lambda})$. Finally, we complement the lower bound with a
searching strategy based on the maximum slope of the known terrain, which
achieves a competitive ratio of $O(\sqrt{\lambda})$.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are
delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.
Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology
that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially
anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work. But to what
extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector? Our survey of 938
public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social
work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of
generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of
generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a
generative AI system. Public sector professionals were positive about both
current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and
reduce bureaucratic workload in the future. For example, those working in the
NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if
generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an
enormous potential impact). Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%)
around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%). While
respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the
UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%),
and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on
generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that
generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is
happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK's public
sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage
of the technology.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform the practice of
law, but this potential is threatened by the presence of legal hallucinations
-- responses from these models that are not consistent with legal facts. We
investigate the extent of these hallucinations using an original suite of legal
queries, comparing LLMs' responses to structured legal metadata and examining
their consistency. Our work makes four key contributions: (1) We develop a
typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future
research in this area. (2) We find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly
prevalent, occurring between 69% of the time with ChatGPT 3.5 and 88% with
Llama 2, when these models are asked specific, verifiable questions about
random federal court cases. (3) We illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a
user's incorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. (4) We
provide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when
they are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, these findings caution
against the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal
tasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and
the risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro
se litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework
for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS
receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection
framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing
the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two
consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this
purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the
accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term
memory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest
supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing
between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.
In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong
turn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection
attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives
injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to
detect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised
throughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection
framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road
structures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various
sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting
attacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy
of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding
AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.

<p class="mathjax">As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write
human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate
generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of
hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these
powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.
The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily
relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI
systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of
online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive
language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information
from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or
modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes
hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive
applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,
etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed
to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),
CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we
introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various
parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and
retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches
specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we
analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing
a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related
phenomena within the realm of LLMs.

decision tables from the closed class is not bounded from above by a constant.
We divide the set of such closed classes into two families. In one family, only
standard lower bounds $\Omega (\log $ ${\rm cl}(T))$ on the minimum cardinality
of reducts for decision tables hold, where ${\rm cl}(T)$ is the number of
decision classes in the table $T$. In another family, these bounds can be
essentially tightened up to $\Omega ({\rm cl}(T)^{1/q})$ for some natural $q$.

<p class="mathjax">This work elicits LLMs' inherent ability to handle long contexts without
fine-tuning. The limited length of the training sequence during training may
limit the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long input sequences
for inference. In this work, we argue that existing LLMs themselves have
inherent capabilities for handling long contexts. Based on this argument, we
suggest extending LLMs' context window by themselves to fully utilize the
inherent ability.We propose Self-Extend to stimulate LLMs' long context
handling potential. The basic idea is to construct bi-level attention
information: the group level and the neighbor level. The two levels are
computed by the original model's self-attention, which means the proposed does
not require any training. With only four lines of code modification, the
proposed method can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without
any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the results show that
the proposed method can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window's
length.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint entity and relation
extraction from unstructured text by framing it as a conditional sequence
generation problem. In contrast to conventional generative information
extraction models that are left-to-right token-level generators, our approach
is \textit{span-based}. It generates a linearized graph where nodes represent
text spans and edges represent relation triplets. Our method employs a
transformer encoder-decoder architecture with pointing mechanism on a dynamic
vocabulary of spans and relation types. Our model can capture the structural
characteristics and boundaries of entities and relations through span
representations while simultaneously grounding the generated output in the
original text thanks to the pointing mechanism. Evaluation on benchmark
datasets validates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating competitive
results. Code is available at https://github.com/urchade/ATG.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational Information Seeking stands as a pivotal research area with
significant contributions from previous works. The TREC Interactive Knowledge
Assistance Track (iKAT) builds on the foundational work of the TREC
Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT). However, iKAT distinctively emphasizes
the creation and research of conversational search agents that adapt responses
based on user's prior interactions and present context. The challenge lies in
enabling Conversational Search Agents (CSA) to incorporate this personalized
context to efficiency and effectively guide users through the relevant
information to them. iKAT also emphasizes decisional search tasks, where users
sift through data and information to weigh up options in order to reach a
conclusion or perform an action. These tasks, prevalent in everyday
information-seeking decisions -- be it related to travel, health, or shopping
-- often revolve around a subset of high-level information operators where
queries or questions about the information space include: finding options,
comparing options, identifying the pros and cons of options, etc. Given the
different personas and their information need (expressed through the sequence
of questions), diverse conversation trajectories will arise -- because the
answers to these similar queries will be very different. In this paper, we
report on the first year of TREC iKAT, describing the task, topics, data
collection, and evaluation framework. We further review the submissions and
summarize the findings.

<p class="mathjax">Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the
need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new
fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a
supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism,
where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.
More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous
iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses
from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively
elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full
potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we
prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method
is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the
HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our
results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a
variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct
preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data.
This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of
human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes
from monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked
vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of
dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow
training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision
in tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene
representation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic
urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic
logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or
the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each
object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a
dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit
representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which
in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS
(1066$\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed
method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and
Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Furthermore, the
proposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using
precise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf
tracker. The code is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/street_gaussians/.

<p class="mathjax">The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that
network. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics
have focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation
and changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these
developments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other
spatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric
networks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric
networks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that
include both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest --
such as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave
-- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between
nodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of
techniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the
interplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by
considering a time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. We then use both
finite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave
equations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE
problems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for
degenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric
networks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges. A key
contribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on
metric networks. Software that implements our numerical approaches is available
at https://gitlab.com/ComputationalScience/metric-networks.

<p class="mathjax">The metaverse is expected to provide immersive entertainment, education, and
business applications. However, virtual reality (VR) transmission over wireless
networks is data- and computation-intensive, making it critical to introduce
novel solutions that meet stringent quality-of-service requirements. With
recent advances in edge intelligence and deep learning, we have developed a
novel multi-view synthesizing framework that can efficiently provide
computation, storage, and communication resources for wireless content delivery
in the metaverse. We propose a three-dimensional (3D)-aware generative model
that uses collections of single-view images. These single-view images are
transmitted to a group of users with overlapping fields of view, which avoids
massive content transmission compared to transmitting tiles or whole 3D models.
We then present a federated learning approach to guarantee an efficient
learning process. The training performance can be improved by characterizing
the vertical and horizontal data samples with a large latent feature space,
while low-latency communication can be achieved with a reduced number of
transmitted parameters during federated learning. We also propose a federated
transfer learning framework to enable fast domain adaptation to different
target domains. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
proposed federated multi-view synthesizing framework for VR content delivery.

<p class="mathjax">The generative priors of pre-trained latent diffusion models have
demonstrated great potential to enhance the perceptual quality of image
super-resolution (SR) results. Unfortunately, the existing diffusion
prior-based SR methods encounter a common problem, i.e., they tend to generate
rather different outputs for the same low-resolution image with different noise
samples. Such stochasticity is desired for text-to-image generation tasks but
problematic for SR tasks, where the image contents are expected to be well
preserved. To improve the stability of diffusion prior-based SR, we propose to
employ the diffusion models to refine image structures, while employing the
generative adversarial training to enhance image fine details. Specifically, we
propose a non-uniform timestep learning strategy to train a compact diffusion
network, which has high efficiency and stability to reproduce the image main
structures, and finetune the pre-trained decoder of variational auto-encoder
(VAE) by adversarial training for detail enhancement. Extensive experiments
show that our proposed method, namely content consistent super-resolution
(CCSR), can significantly reduce the stochasticity of diffusion prior-based SR,
improving the content consistency of SR outputs and speeding up the image
generation process. Codes and models can be found at
{https://github.com/csslc/CCSR}.

<p class="mathjax">Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) navigate underwater with a series of
impulsive, click-like sounds known as echolocation clicks. These clicks are
characterized by a multipulse structure (MPS) that serves as a distinctive
pattern. In this work, we use the stability of the MPS as a detection metric
for recognizing and classifying the presence of clicks in noisy environments.
To distinguish between noise transients and to handle simultaneous emissions
from multiple sperm whales, our approach clusters a time series of MPS measures
while removing potential clicks that do not fulfil the limits of inter-click
interval, duration and spectrum. As a result, our approach can handle high
noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our
detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings
from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several
days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing
approximately 40,000 clicks from multiple sperm whales; and a dataset from the
Bahamas containing 1,203 labelled clicks from a single sperm whale. Comparing
with the results of two benchmark detectors, a better trade-off between
precision and recall is observed as well as a significant reduction in false
detection rates, especially in noisy environments. To ensure reproducibility,
we provide our database of labelled clicks along with our implementation code.

<p class="mathjax">Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, ranging
from climate predictions and weather forecasts to trajectory planning for
autonomous vehicles. A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter
(EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble
of forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep
learning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning
framework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios
remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that
utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or
partial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on
demonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's
objective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations
and corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a
correction strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state
observations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte
Carlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to
generate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the
developed RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF.
Additionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian
data, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.

<p class="mathjax">The importance of the information in the direct sound to human perception of
spatial sound sources is an ongoing research topic. The classification between
direct sound and diffuse or reverberant sound forms the basis of numerous
studies in the field of spatial audio. In particular, parametric spatial audio
representation methods use this classification and employ signal processing in
order to enhance the audio quality at reproduction. However, current literature
does not provide information concerning the impact of ideal direct sound
representation on externalization, in the context of Ambisonics. This paper
aims to assess the importance of the spatial information in the direct sound in
the externalization of a sound field when using binaural reproduction. This is
done in the spherical harmonics (SH) domain, where an ideal direct sound
representation within an otherwise Ambisonics signal is simulated, and its
perceived externalization is evaluated in a formal listening test. This
investigation leads to the conclusion that externalization of a first order
Ambisonics signal may be significantly improved by enhancing the direct sound
component, up to a level similar to a third order Ambisonics signal.

<p class="mathjax">We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal
transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a cost function of form $\mathsf{c}(x,
y) = \mathsf{u}(x^{\mathfrak{t}}y)$, where $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function
with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}y$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of
vectors $x, y$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. The condition
that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a
fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form
$\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant
coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert}
and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The
square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of
these solutions. The optimal map for the family is also explicit. For cost
functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and
unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in
derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new
families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families
of {\it power function costs}. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost,
providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions and divergence.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless
communication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous
success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies,
and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes.
Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to
classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to
their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle
to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures
of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the
self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in
signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal
dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel
characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation
strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness
to modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits
significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our proposed framework serves as
a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets. We have
verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the
generalization of the models, particularly in few-shot scenarios. Code is
available at \url{https://github.com/AMR-Master/TLDNN}.

<p class="mathjax">We present a fast and high-quality codec language model for parallel audio
generation. While SoundStorm, a state-of-the-art parallel audio generation
model, accelerates inference speed compared to autoregressive models, it still
suffers from slow inference due to iterative sampling. To resolve this problem,
we propose Group-Masked Language Modeling~(G-MLM) and Group Iterative Parallel
Decoding~(G-IPD) for efficient parallel audio generation. Both the training and
sampling schemes enable the model to synthesize high-quality audio with a small
number of iterations by effectively modeling the group-wise conditional
dependencies. In addition, our model employs a cross-attention-based
architecture to capture the speaker style of the prompt voice and improves
computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
model outperforms the baselines in prompt-based audio generation.

groups and Riemannian homogeneous spaces. We derive the reduced equations of
motion in the case of Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant metric, and on
Lie groups that admits a bi-invariant metric. We repeated this analysis for
Riemannian homogeneous spaces, where we derive the reduced equations by
considering an alternative variational problem written in terms of a connection
on the horizontal bundle of the underlying Lie group. We study also the case
that the underlying Lie group admits a bi-invariant metric, and consider the
special case that the homogeneous space is in fact a Riemannian symmetric
space. These ideas are applied to geodesics for a rigid body on $SO(3)$ to
derive geodesic equations on the dual of its Lie algebra (a vector space), the
heavy-top in $SE(3)$ to derive reduced equations of motion on the unit sphere
$S^2$, geodesics on $S^2$ as a Riemannian symmetric space endowed with a

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces HAAQI-Net, a non-intrusive deep learning model for
music quality assessment tailored to hearing aid users. In contrast to
traditional methods like the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI), HAAQI-Net
utilizes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) with attention. It
takes an assessed music sample and a hearing loss pattern as input, generating
a predicted HAAQI score. The model employs the pre-trained Bidirectional
Encoder representation from Audio Transformers (BEATs) for acoustic feature
extraction. Comparing predicted scores with ground truth, HAAQI-Net achieves a
Longitudinal Concordance Correlation (LCC) of 0.9257, Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9394, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
0.0080. Notably, this high performance comes with a substantial reduction in
inference time: from 62.52 seconds (by HAAQI) to 2.71 seconds (by HAAQI-Net),
serving as an efficient music quality assessment model for hearing aid users.

<p class="mathjax">We present a new high-probability PAC-Bayes oracle bound for unbounded
losses. This result can be understood as a PAC-Bayes version of the Chernoff
bound. The proof technique relies on uniformly bounding the tail of certain
random variable based on the Cram\'er transform of the loss. We highlight two
applications of our main result. First, we show that our bound solves the open
problem of optimizing the free parameter on many PAC-Bayes bounds. Finally, we
show that our approach allows working with flexible assumptions on the loss
function, resulting in novel bounds that generalize previous ones and can be
minimized to obtain Gibbs-like posteriors.

<p class="mathjax">We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using
Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional
machine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the
whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a
distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the
various components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of
TDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning
methods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the
homology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of
information that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In
particular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for
large annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable
framework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to
segmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the
algorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We
carefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a
sphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a
cylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are
circles. We compare our method to state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the convergence of the mirror descent algorithm for finite
horizon stochastic control problems with measure-valued control processes. The
control objective involves a convex regularisation function, denoted as $h$,
with regularisation strength determined by the weight $\tau\ge 0$. The setting
covers regularised relaxed control problems. Under suitable conditions, we
establish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with
respect to the Bregman divergence of $h$, and prove linear convergence of the
algorithm for $\tau=0$ and exponential convergence for $\tau&gt;0$. The results
apply to common regularisers including relative entropy, $\chi^2$-divergence,
and entropic Wasserstein costs. This validates recent reinforcement learning
heuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient
methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic
differential equations in the bounded mean oscillation norm.

<p class="mathjax">Given the success of model-free methods for control design in many problem
settings, it is natural to ask how things will change if realistic
communication channels are utilized for the transmission of gradients or
policies. While the resulting problem has analogies with the formulations
studied under the rubric of networked control systems, the rich literature in
that area has typically assumed that the model of the system is known. As a
step towards bridging the fields of model-free control design and networked
control systems, we ask: \textit{Is it possible to solve basic control problems
- such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem - in a model-free manner
over a rate-limited channel?} Toward answering this question, we study a
setting where a worker agent transmits quantized policy gradients (of the LQR
cost) to a server over a noiseless channel with a finite bit-rate. We propose a
new algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (\texttt{AQGD}), and
prove that above a certain finite threshold bit-rate, \texttt{AQGD} guarantees
exponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with \textit{no
deterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting}. More
generally, our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in
preserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent
interest to the literature on compressed optimization.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms have
attracted increasing attention because of their important applications in many
scientific fields. However, in the literature, most privacy-preserving
algorithms demand learning objectives to be strongly convex and Lipschitz
smooth, which thus cannot cover a wide class of robust loss functions (e.g.,
quantile/least absolute loss). In this work, we aim to develop a fast
privacy-preserving learning solution for a sparse robust regression problem.
Our learning loss consists of a robust least absolute loss and an $\ell_1$
sparse penalty term. To fast solve the non-smooth loss under a given privacy
budget, we develop a Fast Robust And Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE)
algorithm for least absolute deviation regression. Our algorithm achieves a
fast estimation by reformulating the sparse LAD problem as a penalized least
square estimation problem and adopts a three-stage noise injection to guarantee
the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. We show that our algorithm can
achieve better privacy and statistical accuracy trade-off compared with the
state-of-the-art privacy-preserving regression algorithms. In the end, we
conduct experiments to verify the efficiency of our proposed FRAPPE algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is
time-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent
years, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation
of brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical
images have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its'
variants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the
tumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for
accurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed
work, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a
derivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground
truth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground
truths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with
and without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground
truth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark
dataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and
Hausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole
tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the
baseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the
tumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and
validation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on
baseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline
state-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target
trained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for
treatment planning. Additionally, for further explainability of the results,
the activation map generated by the hybrid MR-U-Net has been studied.

<p class="mathjax">In this work we present deep learning implementations of two popular
theoretical constrained optimization algorithms in infinite dimensional Hilbert
spaces, namely, the penalty and the augmented Lagrangian methods. We test these
algorithms on some toy problems originating in either calculus of variations or
physics. We demonstrate that both methods are able to produce decent
approximations for the test problems and are comparable in terms of different
errors. Leveraging the common occurrence of the Lagrange multiplier update rule
being computationally less expensive than solving subproblems in the penalty
method, we achieve significant speedups in cases when the output of the
constraint function is itself a function.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing is finding promising applications in optimization, machine
learning and physics, leading to the development of various models for
representing quantum information. Because these representations are often
studied in different contexts (many-body physics, machine learning, formal
verification, simulation), little is known about fundamental trade-offs between
their succinctness and the runtime of operations to update them. We therefore
analytically investigate three widely-used quantum state representations:
matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams (DDs), and restricted Boltzmann
machines (RBMs). We map the relative succinctness of these data structures and
provide the complexity for relevant query and manipulation operations. Further,
to chart the balance between succinctness and operation efficiency, we extend
the concept of rapidity with support for the non-canonical data structures
studied in this work, showing in particular that MPS is at least as rapid as
some DDs.
<br />By providing a knowledge compilation map for quantum state representations,
this paper contributes to the understanding of the inherent time and space
efficiency trade-offs in this area.

<p class="mathjax">The quasi-optical propagation of millimeter-wave signals enables
high-accuracy localization algorithms that employ geometric approaches or
machine learning models. However, most algorithms require information on the
indoor environment, may entail the collection of large training datasets, or
bear an infeasible computational burden for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
devices. In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn
the relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and
locations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data
collection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping
the training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a
state-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave
measurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process
the measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding
angles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show
that the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74\% of the cases, thus
performing as good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with
significantly lower computational complexity.
