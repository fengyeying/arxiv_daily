<p class="mathjax">. This paper explores consumer behavior towards food delivery apps, focusing
on attributes like restaurant variety, food packaging quality, and application
design and user interface. The study reveals that a diverse range of
restaurants positively influences consumer satisfaction, leading to increased
app usage. Conversely, the quality of food packaging does not significantly
impact overall satisfaction. However, the study underscores the crucial role of
application design and user interface in shaping consumer behavior. Both
factors significantly influence overall satisfaction, with user-friendly
interfaces attracting more users and promoting frequent app usage. The findings
emphasize the importance of businesses addressing these attributes to enhance
customer satisfaction, boost app engagement, and foster long-term customer
loyalty. Understanding and catering to consumer preferences in these areas can
contribute to the success of food delivery apps in the competitive market.

<p class="mathjax">Discrepancies between the true Martian atmospheric density and the onboard
density model can significantly impair the performance of spacecraft entry
navigation filters. This work introduces a new approach to online filtering for
Martian entry by using a neural network to estimate atmospheric density and
employing a consider analysis to account for the uncertainty in the estimate.
The network is trained on an exponential atmospheric density model, and its
parameters are dynamically adapted in real time to account for any mismatches
between the true and estimated densities. The adaptation of the network is
formulated as a maximum likelihood problem, leveraging the measurement
innovations of the filter to identify optimal network parameters. The
incorporation of a neural network enables the use of stochastic optimizers
known for their efficiency in the machine learning domain within the context of
the maximum likelihood approach. Performance comparisons against previous
approaches are conducted in various realistic Mars entry navigation scenarios,
resulting in superior estimation accuracy and precise alignment of the
estimated density with a broad selection of realistic Martian atmospheres
sampled from perturbed Mars-GRAM data.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have emerged as an effective approach to tackling
real-world problems. However, like human-written software, DNNs are susceptible
to bugs and attacks. This has generated significant interests in developing
effective and scalable DNN verification techniques and tools. In this paper, we
present VeriStable, a novel extension of recently proposed DPLL-based
constraint DNN verification approach. VeriStable leverages the insight that
while neuron behavior may be non-linear across the entire DNN input space, at
intermediate states computed during verification many neurons may be
constrained to have linear behavior - these neurons are stable. Efficiently
detecting stable neurons reduces combinatorial complexity without compromising
the precision of abstractions. Moreover, the structure of clauses arising in
DNN verification problems shares important characteristics with industrial SAT
benchmarks. We adapt and incorporate multi-threading and restart optimizations
targeting those characteristics to further optimize DPLL-based DNN
verification. We evaluate the effectiveness of VeriStable across a range of
challenging benchmarks including fully-connected feedforward networks (FNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks (ResNets) applied to
the standard MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Preliminary results show that VeriStable
is competitive and outperforms state-of-the-art DNN verification tools,
including $\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN and MN-BaB, the first and second performers of
the VNN-COMP, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">This systematic review focuses on analyzing the use of machine learning
techniques for identifying and quantifying analytes in various electrochemical
applications, presenting the available applications in the literature. Machine
learning is a tool that can facilitate the analysis and enhance the
understanding of processes involving various analytes. In electrochemical
biosensors, it increases the precision of medical diagnostics, improving the
identification of biomarkers and pathogens with high reliability. It can be
effectively used for the classification of complex chemical products; in
environmental monitoring, using low-cost sensors; in portable devices and
wearable systems; among others. Currently, the analysis of some analytes is
still performed manually, requiring the expertise of a specialist in the field
and thus hindering the generalization of results. In light of the advancements
in artificial intelligence today, this work proposes to carry out a systematic
review of the literature on the applications of artificial intelligence
techniques. A set of articles has been identified that address electrochemical
problems using machine learning techniques, more specifically, supervised
learning.

<p class="mathjax">Pattern recognition systems implemented using deep neural networks achieve
better results than linear models. However, their drawback is the black box
property. This property means that one with no experience utilising nonlinear
systems may need help understanding the outcome of the decision. Such a
solution is unacceptable to the user responsible for the final decision. He
must not only believe in the decision but also understand it. Therefore,
recognisers must have an architecture that allows interpreters to interpret the
findings. The idea of post-hoc explainable classifiers is to design an
interpretable classifier parallel to the black box classifier, giving the same
decisions as the black box classifier. This paper shows that the explainable
classifier completes matching classification decisions with the black box
classifier on the MNIST and FashionMNIST databases if Zadeh`s fuzzy logic
function forms the classifier and DeconvNet importance gives the truth values.
Since the other tested significance measures achieved lower performance than
DeconvNet, it is the optimal transformation of the feature values to their
truth values as inputs to the fuzzy logic function for the databases and
recogniser architecture used.

<p class="mathjax">Web 3.0 is the third generation of the World Wide Web (WWW), concentrating on
the critical concepts of decentralization, availability, and increasing client
usability. Although Web 3.0 is undoubtedly an essential component of the future
Internet, it currently faces critical challenges, including decentralized data
collection and management. To overcome these challenges, blockchain has emerged
as one of the core technologies for the future development of Web 3.0. In this
paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based information management framework,
namely Smart Blockchain-based Web, to manage information in Web 3.0
effectively, enhance the security and privacy of users data, bring additional
profits, and incentivize users to contribute information to the websites.
Particularly, SBW utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage
the decentralized data collection process for Web 3.0 effectively. Moreover, in
this framework, we develop an effective consensus mechanism based on
Proof-of-Stake to reward the user's information contribution and conduct game
theoretical analysis to analyze the users behavior in the considered system.
Additionally, we conduct simulations to assess the performance of SBW and
investigate the impact of critical parameters on information contribution. The
findings confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our proposed
consensus mechanism can incentivize the nodes and users to contribute more
information to our systems.

<p class="mathjax">Research in developing data-driven models for Air Traffic Management (ATM)
has gained a tremendous interest in recent years. However, data-driven models
are known to have long training time and require large datasets to achieve good
performance. To address the two issues, this paper proposes a Multi-Agent
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (MA-BERT) model that
fully considers the multi-agent characteristic of the ATM system and learns air
traffic controllers' decisions, and a pre-training and fine-tuning transfer
learning framework. By pre-training the MA-BERT on a large dataset from a major
airport and then fine-tuning it to other airports and specific air traffic
applications, a large amount of the total training time can be saved. In
addition, for newly adopted procedures and constructed airports where no
historical data is available, this paper shows that the pre-trained MA-BERT can
achieve high performance by updating regularly with little data. The proposed
transfer learning framework and MA-BERT are tested with the automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast data recorded in 3 airports in South Korea in 2019.

<p class="mathjax">The prediction of solar power generation is a challenging task due to its
dependence on climatic characteristics that exhibit spatial and temporal
variability. The performance of a prediction model may vary across different
places due to changes in data distribution, resulting in a model that works
well in one region but not in others. Furthermore, as a consequence of global
warming, there is a notable acceleration in the alteration of weather patterns
on an annual basis. This phenomenon introduces the potential for diminished
efficacy of existing models, even within the same geographical region, as time
progresses. In this paper, a domain adaptive deep learning-based framework is
proposed to estimate solar power generation using weather features that can
solve the aforementioned challenges. A feed-forward deep convolutional network
model is trained for a known location dataset in a supervised manner and
utilized to predict the solar power of an unknown location later. This adaptive
data-driven approach exhibits notable advantages in terms of computing speed,
storage efficiency, and its ability to improve outcomes in scenarios where
state-of-the-art non-adaptive methods fail. Our method has shown an improvement
of $10.47 \%$, $7.44 \%$, $5.11\%$ in solar power prediction accuracy compared
to best performing non-adaptive method for California (CA), Florida (FL) and
New York (NY), respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Finding a concise and interpretable mathematical formula that accurately
describes the relationship between each variable and the predicted value in the
data is a crucial task in scientific research, as well as a significant
challenge in artificial intelligence. This problem is referred to as symbolic
regression, which is an NP-hard problem. Last year, a symbolic regression
method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was proposed and sota was
obtained on multiple datasets. While this algorithm has shown considerable
improvement in recovering target expressions compared to previous methods, the
lack of guidance during the MCTS process severely hampers its search
efficiency. Recently, some algorithms have added a pre-trained policy network
to guide the search of MCTS, but the pre-trained policy network generalizes
poorly. To balance efficiency and generality, we propose SR-GPT combining ideas
from AlphaZero. SR-GPT is a new symbolic regression algorithm that combines
MCTS with a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). By using GPT to guide the
MCTS process, the search efficiency of MCTS is significantly improved. Next, we
utilize the MCTS results to further refine the GPT, enhancing its capabilities
and providing more accurate guidance for the MCTS process. MCTS and GPT are
coupled together and optimize each other until the target expression is
successfully determined. We conducted extensive evaluations of SR-GPT using 222
expressions sourced from over 10 different symbolic regression datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that SR-GPT outperforms existing
state-of-the-art algorithms in accurately recovering symbolic expressions both
with and without added noise.

<p class="mathjax">Image generation using generative AI is rapidly becoming a major new source
of visual media, with billions of AI generated images created using diffusion
models such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney over the last few years. In this
paper we collect and analyse over 3 million prompts and the images they
generate. Using natural language processing, topic analysis and visualisation
methods we aim to understand collectively how people are using text prompts,
the impact of these systems on artists, and more broadly on the visual cultures
they promote. Our study shows that prompting focuses largely on surface
aesthetics, reinforcing cultural norms, popular conventional representations
and imagery. We also find that many users focus on popular topics (such as
making colouring books, fantasy art, or Christmas cards), suggesting that the
dominant use for the systems analysed is recreational rather than artistic.

<p class="mathjax">Uplift modeling is a technique used to predict the effect of a treatment
(e.g., discounts) on an individual's response. Although several methods have
been proposed for multi-valued treatment, they are extended from binary
treatment methods. There are still some limitations. Firstly, existing methods
calculate uplift based on predicted responses, which may not guarantee a
consistent uplift distribution between treatment and control groups. Moreover,
this may cause cumulative errors for multi-valued treatment. Secondly, the
model parameters become numerous with many prediction heads, leading to reduced
efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel \underline{M}ulti-gate
\underline{M}ixture-of-Experts based \underline{M}ulti-valued
\underline{T}reatment \underline{N}etwork (M$^3$TN). M$^3$TN consists of two
components: 1) a feature representation module with Multi-gate
Mixture-of-Experts to improve the efficiency; 2) a reparameterization module by
modeling uplift explicitly to improve the effectiveness. We also conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
M$^3$TN.

<p class="mathjax">The learnware paradigm proposed by Zhou [2016] aims to enable users to reuse
numerous existing well-trained models instead of building machine learning
models from scratch, with the hope of solving new user tasks even beyond
models' original purposes. In this paradigm, developers worldwide can submit
their high-performing models spontaneously to the learnware dock system
(formerly known as learnware market) without revealing their training data.
Once the dock system accepts the model, it assigns a specification and
accommodates the model. This specification allows the model to be adequately
identified and assembled to reuse according to future users' needs, even if
they have no prior knowledge of the model. This paradigm greatly differs from
the current big model direction and it is expected that a learnware dock system
housing millions or more high-performing models could offer excellent
capabilities for both planned tasks where big models are applicable; and
unplanned, specialized, data-sensitive scenarios where big models are not
present or applicable.
<br />This paper describes Beimingwu, the first open-source learnware dock system
providing foundational support for future research of learnware paradigm.The
system significantly streamlines the model development for new user tasks,
thanks to its integrated architecture and engine design, extensive engineering
implementations and optimizations, and the integration of various algorithms
for learnware identification and reuse. Notably, this is possible even for
users with limited data and minimal expertise in machine learning, without
compromising the raw data's security. Beimingwu supports the entire process of
learnware paradigm. The system lays the foundation for future research in
learnware-related algorithms and systems, and prepares the ground for hosting a
vast array of learnwares and establishing a learnware ecosystem.

efficiently in terms of time and energy presents a formidable challenge.
Conventional computing systems and accelerators are continually being pushed to
their limits to stay competitive. In this context, computing near-memory (CNM)
and computing-in-memory (CIM) have emerged as potentially game-changing
paradigms. This survey introduces the basics of CNM and CIM architectures,
including their underlying technologies and working principles. We focus
particularly on CIM and CNM architectures that have either been prototyped or

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces A2C, a multi-stage collaborative decision framework
designed to enable robust decision-making within human-AI teams. Drawing
inspiration from concepts such as rejection learning and learning to defer, A2C
incorporates AI systems trained to recognise uncertainty in their decisions and
defer to human experts when needed. Moreover, A2C caters to scenarios where
even human experts encounter limitations, such as in incident detection and
response in cyber Security Operations Centres (SOC). In such scenarios, A2C
facilitates collaborative explorations, enabling collective resolution of
complex challenges. With support for three distinct decision-making modes in
human-AI teams: Automated, Augmented, and Collaborative, A2C offers a flexible
platform for developing effective strategies for human-AI collaboration. By
harnessing the strengths of both humans and AI, it significantly improves the
efficiency and effectiveness of complex decision-making in dynamic and evolving
environments. To validate A2C's capabilities, we conducted extensive simulative
experiments using benchmark datasets. The results clearly demonstrate that all
three modes of decision-making can be effectively supported by A2C. Most
notably, collaborative exploration by (simulated) human experts and AI achieves
superior performance compared to AI in isolation, underscoring the framework's
potential to enhance decision-making within human-AI teams.

<p class="mathjax">The explication of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) through xAI techniques
often poses challenges in interpretation. The inherent complexity of input
features, notably pixels extracted from images, engenders complex correlations.
Gradient-based methodologies, exemplified by Integrated Gradients (IG),
effectively demonstrate the significance of these features. Nevertheless, the
conversion of these explanations into images frequently yields considerable
noise. Presently, we introduce GAD (Gradient Artificial Distancing) as a
supportive framework for gradient-based techniques. Its primary objective is to
accentuate influential regions by establishing distinctions between classes.
The essence of GAD is to limit the scope of analysis during visualization and,
consequently reduce image noise. Empirical investigations involving occluded
images have demonstrated that the identified regions through this methodology
indeed play a pivotal role in facilitating class differentiation.

environment where humans and unmanned vehicles cooperate. We address the
inclusion of emotions inside a trust model in a coherent way to the practical
approaches to the current psychology theories. The most innovative contribution
is how privacy issues play a role in the cooperation decisions of the emotional
trust model. Both, emotions and trust have been cognitively modeled and managed
with the Beliefs, Desires and Intentions (BDI) paradigm into autonomous agents
implemented in GAML (the programming language of GAMA agent platform) that
communicates using the IEEE FIPA standard. The trusting behaviour of these
emotional agents is tested in a cooperative logistics problem where: agents
have to move objects to destinations and some of the objects and places have
privacy issues. The execution of simulations of this logistic problem shows how
emotions and trust contribute to improve the performance of agents in terms of
both, time savings and privacy protection

<p class="mathjax">Algorithmic fairness focuses on the distribution of predictions at the time
of training, rather than the distribution of social goods that arises after
deploying the algorithm in a concrete social context. However, requiring a
"fair" distribution of predictions may undermine efforts at establishing a fair
distribution of social goods. Our first contribution is conceptual: we argue
that addressing the fundamental question that motivates algorithmic fairness
requires a notion of prospective fairness that anticipates the change in the
distribution of social goods after deployment. Our second contribution is
theoretical: we provide conditions under which this change is identified from
pre-deployment data. That requires distinguishing between, and accounting for,
different kinds of performative effects. In particular, we focus on the way
predictions change policy decisions and, therefore, the distribution of social
goods. Throughout, we are guided by an application from public administration:
the use of algorithms to (1) predict who among the recently unemployed will
remain unemployed in the long term and (2) target them with labor market
programs. Our final contribution is empirical: using administrative data from
the Swiss public employment service, we simulate how such policies would affect
gender inequalities in long-term unemployment. When risk predictions are
required to be "fair", targeting decisions are less effective, undermining
efforts to lower overall levels of long-term unemployment and to close the
gender gap in long-term unemployment.

<p class="mathjax">Modern data mining applications require to perform incremental clustering
over dynamic datasets by tracing temporal changes over the resulting clusters.
In this paper, we propose A-Posteriori affinity Propagation (APP), an
incremental extension of Affinity Propagation (AP) based on cluster
consolidation and cluster stratification to achieve faithfulness and
forgetfulness. APP enforces incremental clustering where i) new arriving
objects are dynamically consolidated into previous clusters without the need to
re-execute clustering over the entire dataset of objects, and ii) a faithful
sequence of clustering results is produced and maintained over time, while
allowing to forget obsolete clusters with decremental learning functionalities.
Four popular labeled datasets are used to test the performance of APP with
respect to benchmark clustering performances obtained by conventional AP and
Incremental Affinity Propagation based on Nearest neighbor Assignment (IAPNA)
algorithms. Experimental results show that APP achieves comparable clustering
performance while enforcing scalability at the same time.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies of the emergent capabilities of transformer-based Natural
Language Understanding (NLU) models have indicated that they have an
understanding of lexical and compositional semantics. We provide evidence that
suggests these claims should be taken with a grain of salt: we find that
state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI) models are sensitive towards
minor semantics preserving surface-form variations, which lead to sizable
inconsistent model decisions during inference. Notably, this behaviour differs
from valid and in-depth comprehension of compositional semantics, however does
neither emerge when evaluating model accuracy on standard benchmarks nor when
probing for syntactic, monotonic, and logically robust reasoning. We propose a
novel framework to measure the extent of semantic sensitivity. To this end, we
evaluate NLI models on adversarially generated examples containing minor
semantics-preserving surface-form input noise. This is achieved using
conditional text generation, with the explicit condition that the NLI model
predicts the relationship between the original and adversarial inputs as a
symmetric equivalence entailment. We systematically study the effects of the
phenomenon across NLI models for \emph{in-} and \emph{out-of} domain settings.
Our experiments show that semantic sensitivity causes performance degradations
of $12.92\%$ and $23.71\%$ average over \emph{in-} and \emph{out-of-} domain
settings, respectively. We further perform ablation studies, analysing this
phenomenon across models, datasets, and variations in inference and show that
semantic sensitivity can lead to major inconsistency within model predictions.

<p class="mathjax">External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as a key mechanism
for AI governance. The effectiveness of an audit, however, depends on the
degree of system access granted to auditors. Recent audits of state-of-the-art
AI systems have primarily relied on black-box access, in which auditors can
only query the system and observe its outputs. However, white-box access to the
system's inner workings (e.g., weights, activations, gradients) allows an
auditor to perform stronger attacks, more thoroughly interpret models, and
conduct fine-tuning. Meanwhile, outside-the-box access to its training and
deployment information (e.g., methodology, code, documentation,
hyperparameters, data, deployment details, findings from internal evaluations)
allows for auditors to scrutinize the development process and design more
targeted evaluations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of black-box
audits and the advantages of white- and outside-the-box audits. We also discuss
technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with
minimal security risks. Given that different forms of access can lead to very
different levels of evaluation, we conclude that (1) transparency regarding the
access and methods used by auditors is necessary to properly interpret audit
results, and (2) white- and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more
scrutiny than black-box access alone.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) require well-crafted prompts for effective use.
Prompt engineering, the process of designing prompts, is challenging,
particularly for non-experts who are less familiar with AI technologies. While
researchers have proposed techniques and tools to assist LLM users in prompt
design, these works primarily target AI application developers rather than
non-experts. To address this research gap, we propose social prompt
engineering, a novel paradigm that leverages social computing techniques to
facilitate collaborative prompt design. To investigate social prompt
engineering, we introduce Wordflow, an open-source and social text editor that
enables everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover LLM prompts.
Additionally, by leveraging modern web technologies, Wordflow allows users to
run LLMs locally and privately in their browsers. Two usage scenarios highlight
how social prompt engineering and our tool can enhance laypeople's interaction
with LLMs. Wordflow is publicly accessible at
https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most concrete measures to take towards meaningful AI
accountability is to consequentially assess and report the systems' performance
and impact. However, the practical nature of the "AI audit" ecosystem is
muddled and imprecise, making it difficult to work through various concepts and
map out the stakeholders involved in the practice. First, we taxonomize current
AI audit practices as completed by regulators, law firms, civil society,
journalism, academia, consulting agencies. Next, we assess the impact of audits
done by stakeholders within each domain. We find that only a subset of AI audit
studies translate to desired accountability outcomes. We thus assess and
isolate practices necessary for effective AI audit results, articulating the
observed connections between AI audit design, methodology and institutional
context on its effectiveness as a meaningful mechanism for accountability.

<p class="mathjax">Smartphone-based measurement platforms can collect data on human sensory
function in an accessible manner. We developed a smartphone app that measures
vibration perception thresholds by commanding vibrations with varying
amplitudes and recording user responses via (1) a staircase method that adjusts
a variable stimulus, and (2) a decay method that measures the time a user feels
a decaying stimulus. We conducted two studies with healthy adults to assess the
reliability and usability of the app when the smartphone was applied to the
hand and foot. The staircase mode had good reliability for repeated
measurements, both with and without the support of an in-person experimenter.
The app has the potential to be used at home in unguided scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in depthwise-separable convolutional neural networks
(DS-CNNs) have led to novel architectures, that surpass the performance of
classical CNNs, by a considerable scalability and accuracy margin. This paper
reveals another striking property of DS-CNN architectures: discernible and
explainable patterns emerge in their trained depthwise convolutional kernels in
all layers. Through an extensive analysis of millions of trained filters, with
different sizes and from various models, we employed unsupervised clustering
with autoencoders, to categorize these filters. Astonishingly, the patterns
converged into a few main clusters, each resembling the difference of Gaussian
(DoG) functions, and their first and second-order derivatives. Notably, we were
able to classify over 95\% and 90\% of the filters from state-of-the-art
ConvNextV2 and ConvNeXt models, respectively. This finding is not merely a
technological curiosity; it echoes the foundational models neuroscientists have
long proposed for the vision systems of mammals. Our results thus deepen our
understanding of the emergent properties of trained DS-CNNs and provide a
bridge between artificial and biological visual processing systems. More
broadly, they pave the way for more interpretable and biologically-inspired
neural network designs in the future.

<p class="mathjax">As robotic products become more integrated into daily life, there is a
greater need to understand authentic and real-world human-robot interactions to
inform product design. Across many domestic, educational, and public settings,
robots interact with not only individuals and groups of users, but also
families, including children, parents, relatives, and even pets. However,
products developed to date and research in human-robot and child-robot
interactions have focused on the interaction with their primary users,
neglecting the complex and multifaceted interactions between family members and
with the robot. There is a significant gap in knowledge, methods, and theories
for how to design robots to support these interactions. To inform the design of
robots that can support and enhance family life, this paper provides (1) a
narrative review exemplifying the research gap and opportunities for
family-robot interactions and (2) an actionable family-centered framework for
research and practices in human-robot and child-robot interaction.

<p class="mathjax">Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with
applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum
field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian
random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the
metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of
the Gaussian curvature in each point of the manifold that represents the space
of all possible parameter values that define such mathematical model. A key
result in the dynamics of these random fields concerns the curvature effect, a
series of variations in the curvature that happens in the parametric space when
there are significant increase/decrease in the inverse temperature parameter.
In this paper, we propose a numerical algorithm for the computation of geodesic
curves in the Gaussian random fields manifold by deriving the 27 Christoffel
symbols of the metric required for the definition of the Euler-Lagrange
equations. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied to solve the
Euler-Lagrange equations using an iterative approach based in Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulation. Our results reveal that, when the system undergoes
phase trasitions, the geodesic dispersion phenomenon emerges: the geodesic
curve obtained by reversing the system of differential equations in time,
diverges from the original geodesic curve, as we move from zero curvature
configurations (Euclidean geometry) to negative curvature configurations
(hyperbolic-like geometry), and vice-versa. This phenomenon suggest that, time
irreversibility in random field dynamics can be a direct consequence of the
geometry of the underlying parametric space.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning is about forecasting. Forecasts, however, obtain their
usefulness only through their evaluation. Machine learning has traditionally
focused on types of losses and their corresponding regret. Currently, the
machine learning community regained interest in calibration. In this work, we
show the conceptual equivalence of calibration and regret in evaluating
forecasts. We frame the evaluation problem as a game between a forecaster, a
gambler and nature. Putting intuitive restrictions on gambler and forecaster,
calibration and regret naturally fall out of the framework. In addition, this
game links evaluation of forecasts to randomness of outcomes. Random outcomes
with respect to forecasts are equivalent to good forecasts with respect to
outcomes. We call those dual aspects, calibration and regret, predictiveness
and randomness, the four facets of forecast felicity.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI applications present unique design challenges. As generative AI
technologies are increasingly being incorporated into mainstream applications,
there is an urgent need for guidance on how to design user experiences that
foster effective and safe use. We present six principles for the design of
generative AI applications that address unique characteristics of generative AI
UX and offer new interpretations and extensions of known issues in the design
of AI applications. Each principle is coupled with a set of design strategies
for implementing that principle via UX capabilities or through the design
process. The principles and strategies were developed through an iterative
process involving literature review, feedback from design practitioners,
validation against real-world generative AI applications, and incorporation
into the design process of two generative AI applications. We anticipate the
principles to usefully inform the design of generative AI applications by
driving actionable design recommendations.

<p class="mathjax">Clouds play a significant role in global temperature regulation through their
effect on planetary albedo. Anthropogenic emissions of aerosols can alter the
albedo of clouds, but the extent of this effect, and its consequent impact on
temperature change, remains uncertain. Human-induced clouds caused by ship
aerosol emissions, commonly referred to as ship tracks, provide visible
manifestations of this effect distinct from adjacent cloud regions and
therefore serve as a useful sandbox to study human-induced clouds. However, the
lack of large-scale ship track data makes it difficult to deduce their general
effects on cloud formation. Towards developing automated approaches to localize
ship tracks at scale, we present CloudTracks, a dataset containing 3,560
satellite images labeled with more than 12,000 ship track instance annotations.
We train semantic segmentation and instance segmentation model baselines on our
dataset and find that our best model substantially outperforms previous
state-of-the-art for ship track localization (61.29 vs. 48.65 IoU). We also
find that the best instance segmentation model is able to identify the number
of ship tracks in each image more accurately than the previous state-of-the-art
(1.64 vs. 4.99 MAE). However, we identify cases where the best model struggles
to accurately localize and count ship tracks, so we believe CloudTracks will
stimulate novel machine learning approaches to better detect elongated and
overlapping features in satellite images. We release our dataset openly at
{zenodo.org/records/10042922}.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring reliable confidence scores from deep neural networks is of paramount
significance in critical decision-making systems, particularly in real-world
domains such as healthcare. Recent literature on calibrating deep segmentation
networks has resulted in substantial progress. Nevertheless, these approaches
are strongly inspired by the advancements in classification tasks, and thus
their uncertainty is usually modeled by leveraging the information of
individual pixels, disregarding the local structure of the object of interest.
Indeed, only the recent Spatially Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS) approach
considers pixel spatial relationships across classes, by softening the pixel
label assignments with a discrete spatial Gaussian kernel. In this work, we
first present a constrained optimization perspective of SVLS and demonstrate
that it enforces an implicit constraint on soft class proportions of
surrounding pixels. Furthermore, our analysis shows that SVLS lacks a mechanism
to balance the contribution of the constraint with the primary objective,
potentially hindering the optimization process. Based on these observations, we
propose NACL (Neighbor Aware CaLibration), a principled and simple solution
based on equality constraints on the logit values, which enables to control
explicitly both the enforced constraint and the weight of the penalty, offering
more flexibility. Comprehensive experiments on a wide variety of well-known
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the superior calibration performance of the
proposed approach, without affecting its discriminative power. Furthermore,
ablation studies empirically show the model agnostic nature of our approach,
which can be used to train a wide span of deep segmentation networks.

<p class="mathjax">One problem with researching cognitive modeling and reinforcement learning
(RL) is that researchers spend too much time on setting up an appropriate
computational framework for their experiments. Many open source implementations
of current RL algorithms exist, but there is a lack of a modular suite of tools
combining different robotic simulators and platforms, data visualization,
hyperparameter optimization, and baseline experiments. To address this problem,
we present Scilab-RL, a software framework for efficient research in cognitive
modeling and reinforcement learning for robotic agents. The framework focuses
on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning using Stable Baselines 3 and the
OpenAI gym interface. It enables native possibilities for experiment
visualizations and hyperparameter optimization. We describe how these features
enable researchers to conduct experiments with minimal time effort, thus
maximizing research output.

<p class="mathjax">While GPUs are responsible for training the vast majority of state-of-the-art
deep learning models, the implications of their architecture are often
overlooked when designing new deep learning (DL) models. As a consequence,
modifying a DL model to be more amenable to the target hardware can
significantly improve the runtime performance of DL training and inference. In
this paper, we provide a set of guidelines for users to maximize the runtime
performance of their transformer models. These guidelines have been created by
carefully considering the impact of various model hyperparameters controlling
model shape on the efficiency of the underlying computation kernels executed on
the GPU. We find the throughput of models with efficient model shapes is up to
39\% higher while preserving accuracy compared to models with a similar number
of parameters but with unoptimized shapes.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer
potential benefits in healthcare, particularly in processing extensive patient
records. However, existing benchmarks do not fully assess LLMs' capability in
handling real-world, lengthy clinical data.
<br />Methods: We present the LongHealth benchmark, comprising 20 detailed
fictional patient cases across various diseases, with each case containing
5,090 to 6,754 words. The benchmark challenges LLMs with 400 multiple-choice
questions in three categories: information extraction, negation, and sorting,
challenging LLMs to extract and interpret information from large clinical
documents.
<br />Results: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs with a minimum of 16,000 tokens
and also included OpenAI's proprietary and cost-efficient GPT-3.5 Turbo for
comparison. The highest accuracy was observed for Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1,
particularly in tasks focused on information retrieval from single and multiple
patient documents. However, all models struggled significantly in tasks
requiring the identification of missing information, highlighting a critical
area for improvement in clinical data interpretation.
<br />Conclusion: While LLMs show considerable potential for processing long
clinical documents, their current accuracy levels are insufficient for reliable
clinical use, especially in scenarios requiring the identification of missing
information. The LongHealth benchmark provides a more realistic assessment of
LLMs in a healthcare setting and highlights the need for further model
refinement for safe and effective clinical application.
<br />We make the benchmark and evaluation code publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring the accuracy of responses provided by large language models (LLMs)
is crucial, particularly in clinical settings where incorrect information may
directly impact patient health. To address this challenge, we construct K-QA, a
dataset containing 1,212 patient questions originating from real-world
conversations held on K Health (an AI-driven clinical platform). We employ a
panel of in-house physicians to answer and manually decompose a subset of K-QA
into self-contained statements. Additionally, we formulate two NLI-based
evaluation metrics approximating recall and precision: (1) comprehensiveness,
measuring the percentage of essential clinical information in the generated
answer and (2) hallucination rate, measuring the number of statements from the
physician-curated response contradicted by the LLM answer. Finally, we use K-QA
along with these metrics to evaluate several state-of-the-art models, as well
as the effect of in-context learning and medically-oriented augmented retrieval
schemes developed by the authors. Our findings indicate that in-context
learning improves the comprehensiveness of the models, and augmented retrieval
is effective in reducing hallucinations. We make K-QA available to to the
community to spur research into medically accurate NLP applications.

<p class="mathjax">The remarkable progress of deep learning in dermatological tasks has brought
us closer to achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to those of human
experts. However, while large datasets play a crucial role in the development
of reliable deep neural network models, the quality of data therein and their
correct usage are of paramount importance. Several factors can impact data
quality, such as the presence of duplicates, data leakage across train-test
partitions, mislabeled images, and the absence of a well-defined test
partition. In this paper, we conduct meticulous analyses of two popular
dermatological image datasets: DermaMNIST and Fitzpatrick17k, uncovering these
data quality issues, measure the effects of these problems on the benchmark
results, and propose corrections to the datasets. Besides ensuring the
reproducibility of our analysis, by making our analysis pipeline and the
accompanying code publicly available, we aim to encourage similar explorations
and to facilitate the identification and addressing of potential data quality
issues in other large datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Maritime transport is a pivotal logistics mode for the long-distance and bulk
transportation of goods. However, the intricate planning involved in this mode
is often hindered by uncertainties, including weather conditions, cargo
diversity, and port dynamics, leading to increased costs. Consequently,
accurately estimating vessel total (stay) time at port and potential delays
becomes imperative for effective planning and scheduling in port operations.
This study aims to develop a port operation solution with competitive
prediction and classification capabilities for estimating vessel Total and
Delay times. This research addresses a significant gap in port analysis models
for vessel Stay and Delay times, offering a valuable contribution to the field
of maritime logistics. The proposed solution is designed to assist
decision-making in port environments and predict service delays. This is
demonstrated through a case study on Brazil ports. Additionally, feature
analysis is used to understand the key factors impacting maritime logistics,
enhancing the overall understanding of the complexities involved in port
operations.

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging sensing modalities across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions
can improve performance of robotic manipulation tasks. Multi-spatial resolution
sensing provides hierarchical information captured at different spatial scales
and enables both coarse and precise motions. Simultaneously multi-temporal
resolution sensing enables the agent to exhibit high reactivity and real-time
control. In this work, we propose a framework, MResT (Multi-Resolution
Transformer), for learning generalizable language-conditioned multi-task
policies that utilize sensing at different spatial and temporal resolutions
using networks of varying capacities to effectively perform real time control
of precise and reactive tasks. We leverage off-the-shelf pretrained
vision-language models to operate on low-frequency global features along with
small non-pretrained models to adapt to high frequency local feedback. Through
extensive experiments in 3 domains (coarse, precise and dynamic manipulation
tasks), we show that our approach significantly improves (2X on average) over
recent multi-task baselines. Further, our approach generalizes well to visual
and geometric variations in target objects and to varying interaction forces.

<p class="mathjax">Collecting traffic data is crucial for transportation systems and urban
planning, and is often more desirable through easy-to-deploy but
power-constrained devices, due to the unavailability or high cost of power and
network infrastructure. The limited power means an inevitable trade-off between
data collection duration and accuracy/resolution. We introduce a novel
learning-based framework that strategically decides observation timings for
battery-powered devices and reconstructs the full data stream from sparsely
sampled observations, resulting in minimal performance loss and a significantly
prolonged system lifetime. Our framework comprises a predictor, a controller,
and an estimator. The predictor utilizes historical data to forecast future
trends within a fixed time horizon. The controller uses the forecasts to
determine the next optimal timing for data collection. Finally, the estimator
reconstructs the complete data profile from the sampled observations. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed method on PeMS data by an RNN
(Recurrent Neural Network) predictor and estimator, and a DRQN (Deep Recurrent
Q-Network) controller, and compare it against the baseline that uses Kalman
filter and uniform sampling. The results indicate that our method outperforms
the baseline, primarily due to the inclusion of more representative data points
in the profile, resulting in an overall 10\% improvement in estimation
accuracy. Source code will be publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">This work proposes an interval observer design for nonlinear discrete-time
systems based on the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) paradigm. Our design
extends to generic nonlinear systems without any assumption on the structure of
its dynamics and output maps. Relying on a transformation putting the system
into a target LTI form where an interval observer can be directly designed, we
then propose a method to reconstruct the bounds in the original coordinates
using the bounds in the target coordinates, thanks to the Lipschitz injectivity
of this transformation achieved under Lipschitz distinguishability when the
target dynamics have a high enough dimension and are pushed sufficiently fast.
An academic example serves to illustrate our methods.

<p class="mathjax">A wide range of physical phenomena exhibit auxiliary admissibility criteria,
such as conservation of entropy or various energies, which arise implicitly
under the exact solution of their governing PDEs. However, standard temporal
schemes, such as classical Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, do not enforce these
constraints, leading to a loss of accuracy and stability. Previously, the
Incremental Directional Technique RK (IDT-RK) and Relaxation Runge-Kutta (R-RK)
approaches have been proposed to address this. However, these lead to a loss of
accuracy in the case of IDT-RK, or a loss of step size control in the case of
R-RK. In the current work we propose Relaxation-Free Runge- Kutta (RF-RK)
schemes, which conserve energy, maintain order of accuracy, and maintain a
constant step size, alleviating many of the limitations of the aforementioned
techniques. Importantly, they do so with minimal additional computational cost
compared to the base RK scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that these
properties are observed in practice for a range of applications. Therefore, the
proposed RF-RK framework is a promising approach for energy conservative time
integration of systems of PDEs.

<p class="mathjax">Augmented Reality (AR) applications necessitates methods of inserting needed
objects into scenes captured by cameras in a way that is coherent with the
surroundings. Common AR applications require the insertion of predefined 3D
objects with known properties and shape. This simplifies the problem since it
is reduced to extracting an illumination model for the object in that scene by
understanding the surrounding light sources. However, it is often not the case
that we have information about the properties of an object, especially when we
depart from a single source image. Our method renders such source fragments in
a coherent way with the target surroundings using only these two images. Our
pipeline uses a Deep Image Prior (DIP) network based on a U-Net architecture as
the main renderer, alongside robust-feature extracting networks that are used
to apply needed losses. Our method does not require any pair-labeled data, and
no extensive training on a dataset. We compare our method using qualitative
metrics to the baseline methods such as Cut and Paste, Cut And Paste Neural
Rendering, and Image Harmonization

<p class="mathjax">Automated legal reasoning and its application in smart contracts and
automated decisions are increasingly attracting interest. In this context,
ethical and legal concerns make it necessary for automated reasoners to justify
in human-understandable terms the advice given. Logic Programming, specially
Answer Set Programming, has a rich semantics and has been used to very
concisely express complex knowledge. However, modelling discretionality to act
and other vague concepts such as ambiguity cannot be expressed in top-down
execution models based on Prolog, and in bottom-up execution models based on
ASP the justifications are incomplete and/or not scalable. We propose to use
s(CASP), a top-down execution model for predicate ASP, to model vague concepts
following a set of patterns. We have implemented a framework, called s(LAW), to
model, reason, and justify the applicable legislation and validate it by
translating (and benchmarking) a representative use case, the criteria for the
admission of students in the "Comunidad de Madrid".

<p class="mathjax">Misdirection can be defined as the intentional action of causing some
misrepresentation in an agent, or in a group of agents. Those
misrepresentations may result from verbal actions, as in linguistic deception,
or from visual actions, as in visual misdirection. Examples of visual
misdirection abound (e.g. in nature, in the military), with magic tricks
providing a vivid illustration. So far, various types of verbal misdirection
have been investigated from a formal perspective (e.g. lying, bluffing) but
little attention has been paid to the particular case of visual misdirection.
In this paper, we introduce a dynamic epistemic logic to represent not only
verbal misdirection on agents' beliefs but also visual misdirection on agents'
observations. We illustrate the dynamics of the logic by modelling a classic
magic trick known as the French Drop. We also provide a sound and complete
axiom system for the logic, and discuss the strengths of the setting in terms
of expressivity and scope.

<p class="mathjax">In a recent breakthrough [BGM23, GZ23, AGL23], it was shown that Reed-Solomon
codes, defined over random evaluation points, are list decodable with
\emph{optimal} list size with high probability, i.e., they attain the
\emph{Singleton bound for list decoding} [ST20, Rot22, GST22]. We extend this
result to a large subclass of \emph{polynomial ideal codes}, which includes
several well-studied families of error-correcting codes such as Reed-Solomon
codes, folded Reed-Solomon codes, and multiplicity codes. Our results imply
that a large subclass of polynomial ideal codes with random evaluation points
over exponentially large fields achieve the Singleton bound for list-decoding
exactly; while such codes over quadratically-sized fields approximately achieve
it.
<br />Combining this with the {efficient} list-decoding algorithms for polynomial
ideal codes of [BHKS21], our result implies as a corollary that a large
subclass of polynomial ideal codes (over random evaluation points) is
\emph{efficiently} list decodable with {optimal} list size. To the best of our
knowledge, this gives the first family of codes that can be {efficiently} list
decoded with {optimal} list size (for all list sizes), as well as the first
family of {linear} codes of rate $R$ that can be {efficiently} list decoded up
to a radius of $1 -R-\epsilon$ with list size that is {polynomial} (and even
linear) in $1/\epsilon$. Moreover, the result applies to natural families of
codes with algebraic structure such as folded Reed-Solomon or multiplicity
codes (over random evaluation points).
<br />Our proof follows the general framework of [BGM23, GZ23], where the main new
ingredients are a \emph{duality theorem} for polynomial ideal codes, as well as
a new \emph{algebraic folded GM-MDS theorem} (extending the algebraic GM-MDS
theorem of [YH19, Lov21]), which may be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the applicability of machine learning technologies to the
development of parsimonious, interpretable, catchment-scale hydrologic models
using directed-graph architectures based on the mass-conserving perceptron
(MCP) as the fundamental computational unit. Here, we focus on architectural
complexity (depth) at a single location, rather than universal applicability
(breadth) across large samples of catchments. The goal is to discover a minimal
representation (numbers of cell-states and flow paths) that represents the
dominant processes that can explain the input-state-output behaviors of a given
catchment, with particular emphasis given to simulating the full range (high,
medium, and low) of flow dynamics. We find that a HyMod-like architecture with
three cell-states and two major flow pathways achieves such a representation at
our study location, but that the additional incorporation of an input-bypass
mechanism significantly improves the timing and shape of the hydrograph, while
the inclusion of bi-directional groundwater mass exchanges significantly
enhances the simulation of baseflow. Overall, our results demonstrate the
importance of using multiple diagnostic metrics for model evaluation, while
highlighting the need for designing training metrics that are better suited to
extracting information across the full range of flow dynamics. Further, they
set the stage for interpretable regional-scale MCP-based hydrological modeling
(using large sample data) by using neural architecture search to determine
appropriate minimal representations for catchments in different hydroclimatic
regimes.

<p class="mathjax">Learning accurate, data-driven predictive models for multiple interacting
agents following unknown dynamics is crucial in many real-world physical and
social systems. In many scenarios, dynamics prediction must be performed under
incomplete observations, i.e., only a subset of agents are known and observable
from a larger topological system while the behaviors of the unobserved agents
and their interactions with the observed agents are not known. When only
incomplete observations of a dynamical system are available, so that some
states remain hidden, it is generally not possible to learn a closed-form model
in these variables using either analytic or data-driven techniques. In this
work, we propose STEMFold, a spatiotemporal attention-based generative model,
to learn a stochastic manifold to predict the underlying unmeasured dynamics of
the multi-agent system from observations of only visible agents. Our analytical
results motivate STEMFold design using a spatiotemporal graph with time anchors
to effectively map the observations of visible agents to a stochastic manifold
with no prior information about interaction graph topology. We empirically
evaluated our method on two simulations and two real-world datasets, where it
outperformed existing networks in predicting complex multiagent interactions,
even with many unobserved agents.

<p class="mathjax">Advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs) have led some
researchers to propose the emergence of theory of mind (ToM) in artificial
intelligence (AI). LLMs can attribute beliefs, desires, intentions, and
emotions, and they will improve in their accuracy. Rather than employing the
characteristically human method of empathy, they learn to attribute mental
states by recognizing linguistic patterns in a dataset that typically do not
include that individual. We ask whether LLMs' inability to empathize precludes
them from honoring an individual's right to be an exception, that is, from
making assessments of character and predictions of behavior that reflect
appropriate sensitivity to a person's individuality. Can LLMs seriously
consider an individual's claim that their case is different based on internal
mental states like beliefs, desires, and intentions, or are they limited to
judging that case based on its similarities to others? We propose that the
method of empathy has special significance for honoring the right to be an
exception that is distinct from the value of predictive accuracy, at which LLMs
excel. We conclude by considering whether using empathy to consider exceptional
cases has intrinsic or merely practical value and we introduce conceptual and
empirical avenues for advancing this investigation.

universal linguistic phenomenon, across multiple languages. We train a
multilingual transformer model (XLM-RoBERTa) to disambiguate potentially
euphemistic terms (PETs) in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. In line
with current trends, we demonstrate that zero-shot learning across languages
takes place. We also show cases where multilingual models perform better on the
task compared to monolingual models by a statistically significant margin,
indicating that multilingual data presents additional opportunities for models
to learn about cross-lingual, computational properties of euphemisms. In a
follow-up analysis, we focus on universal euphemistic "categories" such as
death and bodily functions among others. We test to see whether cross-lingual
data of the same domain is more important than within-language data of other

<p class="mathjax">With the increasing adoption of decentralized information systems based on a
variety of permissionless blockchain networks, the choice of consensus
mechanism is at the core of many controversial discussions. Ethereum's recent
transition from (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS)-based consensus has further
fueled the debate on which mechanism is more favorable. While the aspects of
energy consumption and degree of (de-)centralization are often emphasized in
the public discourse, seminal research has also shed light on the formal
security aspects of both approaches individually. However, related work has not
yet comprehensively structured the knowledge about the security properties of
PoW and PoS. Rather, it has focused on in-depth analyses of specific protocols
or high-level comparative reviews covering a broad range of consensus
mechanisms. To fill this gap and unravel the commonalities and discrepancies
between the formal security properties of PoW- and PoS-based consensus, we
conduct a systematic literature review over 26 research articles. Our findings
indicate that PoW-based consensus with the longest chain rule provides the
strongest formal security guarantees. Nonetheless, PoS can achieve similar
guarantees when addressing its more pronounced tradeoff between safety and
liveness through hybrid approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Studies of reinforcement learning in humans and animals have demonstrated a
preference for options that yielded relatively better outcomes in the past,
even when those options are associated with lower absolute reward. The present
study tested whether large language models would exhibit a similar bias. We had
gpt-4-1106-preview (GPT-4 Turbo) and Llama-2-70B make repeated choices between
pairs of options with the goal of maximizing payoffs. A complete record of
previous outcomes was included in each prompt. Both models exhibited relative
value decision biases similar to those observed in humans and animals. Making
relative comparisons among outcomes more explicit magnified the bias, whereas
prompting the models to estimate expected outcomes caused the bias to
disappear. These results have implications for the potential mechanisms that
contribute to context-dependent choice in human agents.

<p class="mathjax">As a general purpose technology without a concrete pre-defined purpose,
personal chatbots can be used for a whole range of objectives, depending on the
personal needs, contexts, and tasks of an individual, and so potentially impact
a variety of values, people, and social contexts. Traditional methods of risk
assessment are confronted with several challenges: the lack of a clearly
defined technology purpose, the lack of a clearly defined values to orient on,
the heterogeneity of uses, and the difficulty of actively engaging citizens
themselves in anticipating impacts from the perspective of their individual
lived realities. In this article, we leverage scenario writing at scale as a
method for anticipating AI impact that is responsive to these challenges. The
advantages of the scenario method are its ability to engage individual users
and stimulate them to consider how chatbots are likely to affect their reality
and so collect different impact scenarios depending on the cultural and
societal embedding of a heterogeneous citizenship. Empirically, we tasked 106
US-citizens to write short fictional stories about the future impact (whether
desirable or undesirable) of AI-based personal chatbots on individuals and
society and, in addition, ask respondents to explain why these impacts are
important and how they relate to their values. In the analysis process, we map
those impacts and analyze them in relation to socio-demographic as well as
AI-related attitudes of the scenario writers. We show that our method is
effective in (1) identifying and mapping desirable and undesirable impacts of
AI-based personal chatbots, (2) setting these impacts in relation to values
that are important for individuals, and (3) detecting socio-demographic and
AI-attitude related differences of impact anticipation.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying the underlying time-delayed latent causal processes in sequential
data is vital for grasping temporal dynamics and making downstream reasoning.
While some recent methods can robustly identify these latent causal variables,
they rely on strict assumptions about the invertible generation process from
latent variables to observed data. However, these assumptions are often hard to
satisfy in real-world applications containing information loss. For instance,
the visual perception process translates a 3D space into 2D images, or the
phenomenon of persistence of vision incorporates historical data into current
perceptions. To address this challenge, we establish an identifiability theory
that allows for the recovery of independent latent components even when they
come from a nonlinear and non-invertible mix. Using this theory as a
foundation, we propose a principled approach, CaRiNG, to learn the CAusal
RepresentatIon of Non-invertible Generative temporal data with identifiability
guarantees. Specifically, we utilize temporal context to recover lost latent
information and apply the conditions in our theory to guide the training
process. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, we validate that
our CaRiNG method reliably identifies the causal process, even when the
generation process is non-invertible. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
approach considerably improves temporal understanding and reasoning in
practical applications.

<p class="mathjax">Typical pipelines for model geometry generation in computational biomedicine
stem from images, which are usually considered to be at rest, despite the
object being in mechanical equilibrium under several forces. We refer to the
stress-free geometry computation as the reference configuration problem, and in
this work we extend such a formulation to the theory of fully nonlinear
poroelastic media. The main steps are (i) writing the equations in terms of the
reference porosity and (ii) defining a time dependent problem whose steady
state solution is the reference porosity. This problem can be computationally
challenging as it can require several hundreds of iterations to converge, so we
propose the use of Anderson acceleration to speed up this procedure. Our
evidence shows that this strategy can reduce the number of iterations up to
80\%. In addition, we note that a primal formulation of the nonlinear mass
conservation equations is not consistent due to the presence of second order
derivatives of the displacement, which we alleviate through adequate mixed
formulations. All claims are validated through numerical simulations in both
idealized and realistic scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Previous work has highlighted that existing post-hoc explanation methods
exhibit disparities in explanation fidelity (across 'race' and 'gender' as
sensitive attributes), and while a large body of work focuses on mitigating
these issues at the explanation metric level, the role of the data generating
process and black box model in relation to explanation disparities remains
largely unexplored. Accordingly, through both simulations as well as
experiments on a real-world dataset, we specifically assess challenges to
explanation disparities that originate from properties of the data: limited
sample size, covariate shift, concept shift, omitted variable bias, and
challenges based on model properties: inclusion of the sensitive attribute and
appropriate functional form. Through controlled simulation analyses, our study
demonstrates that increased covariate shift, concept shift, and omission of
covariates increase explanation disparities, with the effect pronounced higher
for neural network models that are better able to capture the underlying
functional form in comparison to linear models. We also observe consistent
findings regarding the effect of concept shift and omitted variable bias on
explanation disparities in the Adult income dataset. Overall, results indicate
that disparities in model explanations can also depend on data and model
properties. Based on this systematic investigation, we provide recommendations
for the design of explanation methods that mitigate undesirable disparities.

<p class="mathjax">Every artist has a creative process that draws inspiration from previous
artists and their works. Today, "inspiration" has been automated by generative
music models. The black box nature of these models obscures the identity of the
works that influence their creative output. As a result, users may
inadvertently appropriate, misuse, or copy existing artists' works. We
establish a replicable methodology to systematically identify similar pieces of
music audio in a manner that is useful for understanding training data
attribution. A key aspect of our approach is to harness an effective music
audio similarity measure. We compare the effect of applying CLMR and CLAP
embeddings to similarity measurement in a set of 5 million audio clips used to
train VampNet, a recent open source generative music model. We validate this
approach with a human listening study. We also explore the effect that
modifications of an audio example (e.g., pitch shifting, time stretching,
background noise) have on similarity measurements. This work is foundational to
incorporating automated influence attribution into generative modeling, which
promises to let model creators and users move from ignorant appropriation to
informed creation. Audio samples that accompany this paper are available at

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian optimization (BO) has established itself as a leading strategy for
efficiently optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions. Existing BO methods
mostly rely on Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models and are not applicable to
(doubly-stochastic) Gaussian Cox processes, where the observation process is
modulated by a latent intensity function modeled as a GP. In this paper, we
propose a novel maximum a posteriori inference of Gaussian Cox processes. It
leverages the Laplace approximation and change of kernel technique to transform
the problem into a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where it becomes more
tractable computationally. It enables us to obtain both a functional posterior
of the latent intensity function and the covariance of the posterior, thus
extending existing works that often focus on specific link functions or
estimating the posterior mean. Using the result, we propose a BO framework
based on the Gaussian Cox process model and further develop a Nystr\"om
approximation for efficient computation. Extensive evaluations on various
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvement over
state-of-the-art inference solutions for Gaussian Cox processes, as well as
effective BO with a wide range of acquisition functions designed through the
underlying Gaussian Cox process model.

<p class="mathjax">Open-source benchmark datasets have been a critical component for advancing
machine learning for robot perception in terrestrial applications. Benchmark
datasets enable the widespread development of state-of-the-art machine learning
methods, which require large datasets for training, validation, and thorough
comparison to competing approaches. Underwater environments impose several
operational challenges that hinder efforts to collect large benchmark datasets
for marine robot perception. Furthermore, a low abundance of targets of
interest relative to the size of the search space leads to increased time and
cost required to collect useful datasets for a specific task. As a result,
there is limited availability of labeled benchmark datasets for underwater
applications. We present the AI4Shipwrecks dataset, which consists of 24
distinct shipwreck sites totaling 286 high-resolution labeled side scan sonar
images to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous sonar image understanding.
We leverage the unique abundance of targets in Thunder Bay National Marine
Sanctuary in Lake Huron, MI, to collect and compile a sonar imagery benchmark
dataset through surveys with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We
consulted with expert marine archaeologists for the labeling of robotically
gathered data. We then leverage this dataset to perform benchmark experiments
for comparison of state-of-the-art supervised segmentation methods, and we
present insights on opportunities and open challenges for the field. The
dataset and benchmarking tools will be released as an open-source benchmark
dataset to spur innovation in machine learning for Great Lakes and ocean
exploration. The dataset and accompanying software are available at

<p class="mathjax">Distributed, scalable, and safe control of large-scale multi-agent systems
(MAS) is a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a distributed
framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with
obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using
only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class
of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based
on the well-established control barrier function (CBF) theory for safety
guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable
distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove
the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new
training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to parameterize
a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is
distributed and is capable of directly taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead
of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate
the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a
swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on
a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical
experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of
obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with
nonlinear agents (e.g., Crazyflie drones) GCBF+ outperforms the handcrafted
CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively
small-scale MAS for up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL)
methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method
does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for
achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation vision or vision-language models are trained on large unlabeled or
noisy data and learn robust representations that can achieve impressive zero-
or few-shot performance on diverse tasks. Given these properties, they are a
natural fit for active learning (AL), which aims to maximize labeling
efficiency, but the full potential of foundation models has not been explored
in the context of AL, specifically in the low-budget regime. In this work, we
evaluate how foundation models influence three critical components of effective
AL, namely, 1) initial labeled pool selection, 2) ensuring diverse sampling,
and 3) the trade-off between representative and uncertainty sampling. We
systematically study how the robust representations of foundation models
(DINOv2, OpenCLIP) challenge existing findings in active learning. Our
observations inform the principled construction of a new simple and elegant AL
strategy that balances uncertainty estimated via dropout with sample diversity.
We extensively test our strategy on many challenging image classification
benchmarks, including natural images as well as out-of-domain biomedical images
that are relatively understudied in the AL literature. Source code will be made
available.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained language models based on masked language modeling (MLM) objective
excel in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While fine-tuned MLM-based
encoders consistently outperform causal language modeling decoders of
comparable size, a recent trend of scaling decoder models to multiple billion
parameters resulted in large language models (LLMs), making them competitive
with MLM-based encoders. Although scale amplifies their prowess in NLU tasks,
LLMs fall short of SOTA results in information extraction (IE) tasks, many
framed as sequence labeling (SL). However, whether this is an intrinsic
limitation of LLMs or whether their SL performance can be improved remains
unclear. To address this, we explore strategies to enhance the SL performance
of "open" LLMs (Llama2 and Mistral) on IE tasks. We investigate bidirectional
information flow within groups of decoder blocks, applying layer-wise removal
or enforcement of the causal mask (CM) during LLM fine-tuning. This approach
yields performance gains competitive with SOTA SL models, matching or
outperforming the results of CM removal from all blocks. Our findings hold for
diverse SL tasks, proving that "open" LLMs with layer-dependent CM removal
outperform strong MLM-based encoders and instruction-tuned LLMs. However, we
observe no effect from CM removal on a small scale when maintaining an
equivalent model size, pre-training steps, and pre-training and fine-tuning
data.

<p class="mathjax">Reservoir Computing (RC) has become popular in recent years due to its fast
and efficient computational capabilities. Standard RC has been shown to be
equivalent in the asymptotic limit to Recurrent Kernels, which helps in
analyzing its expressive power. However, many well-established RC paradigms,
such as Leaky RC, Sparse RC, and Deep RC, are yet to be analyzed in such a way.
This study aims to fill this gap by providing an empirical analysis of the
equivalence of specific RC architectures with their corresponding Recurrent
Kernel formulation. We conduct a convergence study by varying the activation
function implemented in each architecture. Our study also sheds light on the
role of sparse connections in RC architectures and propose an optimal sparsity
level that depends on the reservoir size. Furthermore, our systematic analysis
shows that in Deep RC models, convergence is better achieved with successive
reservoirs of decreasing sizes.

<p class="mathjax">Consistency is a key requirement of high-quality translation. It is
especially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to
corrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)
has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,
in-domain data scarcity is common in translation settings, due to the lack of
specialised datasets and terminology, or inconsistency and inaccuracy of
available in-domain translations. In such scenarios where there is insufficient
in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are
consistent with the relevant context is challenging. While real-time adaptation
can make use of smaller amounts of in-domain data to improve the translation on
the fly, it remains challenging due to supported context limitations and
efficiency constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown
interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they learn to replicate
certain input-output text generation patterns, without further fine-tuning.
Such capabilities have opened new horizons for domain-specific data
augmentation and real-time adaptive MT. This work attempts to address two main
relevant questions: 1) in scenarios involving human interaction and continuous
feedback, can we employ language models to improve the quality of adaptive MT
at inference time? and 2) in the absence of sufficient in-domain data, can we
use pre-trained large-scale language models to improve the process of MT domain
adaptation?

<p class="mathjax">Despite the technological advancements in the transportation sector, the
industry continues to grapple with increasing energy consumption and vehicular
emissions, which intensify environmental degradation and climate change. The
inefficient management of traffic flow, the underutilization of transport
network interconnectivity, and the limited implementation of artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven predictive models pose significant challenges to
achieving energy efficiency and emission reduction. Thus, there is a timely and
critical need for an integrated, sophisticated approach that leverages
intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and AI for energy conservation and
emission reduction. In this paper, we explore the role of ITSs and AI in future
enhanced energy and emission reduction (EER). More specifically, we discuss the
impact of sensors at different levels of ITS on improving EER. We also
investigate the potential networking connections in ITSs and provide an
illustration of how they improve EER. Finally, we discuss potential AI services
for improved EER in the future. The findings discussed in this paper will
contribute to the ongoing discussion about the vital role of ITSs and AI
applications in addressing the challenges associated with achieving energy
savings and emission reductions in the transportation sector. Additionally, it
will provide insights for policymakers and industry professionals to enable
them to develop policies and implementation plans for the integration of ITSs
and AI technologies in the transportation sector.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in implicit function-based approaches have shown promising
results in 3D human reconstruction from a single RGB image. However, these
methods are not sufficient to extend to more general cases, often generating
dragged or disconnected body parts, particularly for animated characters. We
argue that these limitations stem from the use of the existing point-level 3D
shape representation, which lacks holistic 3D context understanding.
Voxel-based reconstruction methods are more suitable for capturing the entire
3D space at once, however, these methods are not practical for high-resolution
reconstructions due to their excessive memory usage. To address these
challenges, we introduce Tri-directional Implicit Function (TIFu), which is a
vector-level representation that increases global 3D consistencies while
significantly reducing memory usage compared to voxel representations. We also
introduce a new algorithm in 3D reconstruction at an arbitrary resolution by
aggregating vectors along three orthogonal axes, resolving inherent problems
with regressing fixed dimension of vectors. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both our self-curated character dataset and
the benchmark 3D human dataset. We provide both quantitative and qualitative
analyses to support our findings.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the current state of
in-vehicle human-computer interaction (HCI) in the context of self-driving
vehicles, with a specific focus on inclusion and accessibility. This study's
aim is to examine the user-centered design principles for inclusive HCI in
self-driving vehicles, evaluate existing HCI systems, and identify emerging
technologies that have the potential to enhance the passenger experience. The
paper begins by providing an overview of the current state of self-driving
vehicle technology, followed by an examination of the importance of HCI in this
context. Next, the paper reviews the existing literature on inclusive HCI
design principles and evaluates the effectiveness of current HCI systems in
self-driving vehicles. The paper also identifies emerging technologies that
have the potential to enhance the passenger experience, such as voice-activated
interfaces, haptic feedback systems, and augmented reality displays. Finally,
the paper proposes an end-to-end design framework for the development of an
inclusive in-vehicle experience, which takes into consideration the needs of
all passengers, including those with disabilities, or other accessibility
requirements. This literature review highlights the importance of user-centered
design principles in the development of HCI systems for self-driving vehicles
and emphasizes the need for inclusive design to ensure that all passengers can
safely and comfortably use these vehicles. The proposed end-to-end design
framework provides a practical approach to achieving this goal and can serve as
a valuable resource for designers, researchers, and policymakers in this field.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to handle a large volume of data generated by scientific
applications is crucial. We have seen an increase in the heterogeneity of
storage technologies available to scientific applications, such as burst
buffers, local temporary block storage, managed cloud parallel file systems
(PFS), and non-POSIX object stores. However, scientific applications designed
for traditional HPC systems can not easily exploit those storage systems due to
cost, throughput, and programming model challenges. We present iFast, a new
library-level approach to transparently accelerating scientific applications
based on MPI-IO. It decouples application I/O, data caching, and data storage
to support heterogeneous storage models. Design decisions of iFast are based on
a strong emphasis on deployability. It is highly general with only MPI as a
core dependency, allowing users to run unmodified MPI-based applications with
unmodified MPI implementations - even proprietary ones like IntelMPI and Cray
MPICH. Our approach supports a wide range of networked storage, including
traditional PFS, ordinary NFS, and S3-based cloud storage. Unlike previous
approaches, iFast ensures crash consistency even across compute nodes. We
demonstrate iFast in cloud HPC platform, small local cluster, and hybrid of
both to show its generality. Our results show that iFast reduces end-to-end
execution time by 13-26% for three popular scientific applications on the
cloud. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art system, SymphonyFS, a
filesystem-based approach for similar goals but without crash consistency, by
12-23%.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the decision-making process of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is
crucial to their interpretability. Most existing methods for explaining GNNs
typically rely on training auxiliary models, resulting in the explanations
remain black-boxed. This paper introduces Graph Output Attribution (GOAt), a
novel method to attribute graph outputs to input graph features, creating GNN
explanations that are faithful, discriminative, as well as stable across
similar samples. By expanding the GNN as a sum of scalar products involving
node features, edge features and activation patterns, we propose an efficient
analytical method to compute contribution of each node or edge feature to each
scalar product and aggregate the contributions from all scalar products in the
expansion form to derive the importance of each node and edge. Through
extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our method
not only outperforms various state-ofthe-art GNN explainers in terms of the
commonly used fidelity metric, but also exhibits stronger discriminability, and
stability by a remarkable margin.

<p class="mathjax">Recognizing food images presents unique challenges due to the variable
spatial layout and shape changes of ingredients with different cooking and
cutting methods. This study introduces an advanced approach for recognizing
ingredients segmented from food images. The method localizes the candidate
regions of the ingredients using the locating and sliding window techniques.
Then, these regions are assigned into ingredient classes using a CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network)-based single-ingredient classification model
trained on a dataset of single-ingredient images. To address the challenge of
processing speed in multi-ingredient recognition, a novel model pruning method
is proposed that enhances the efficiency of the classification model.
Subsequently, the multi-ingredient identification is achieved through a
decision-making scheme, incorporating two novel algorithms. The
single-ingredient image dataset, designed in accordance with the book entitled
"New Food Ingredients List FOODS 2021", encompasses 9982 images across 110
diverse categories, emphasizing variety in ingredient shapes. In addition, a
multi-ingredient image dataset is developed to rigorously evaluate the
performance of our approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of
our method, particularly highlighting its improved capability in recognizing
multiple ingredients. This marks a significant advancement in the field of food
image analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Physics-informed Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable performance
in learning through graph-structured data by mitigating common GNN challenges
such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and heterophily adaption. Despite these
advancements, the development of a simple yet effective paradigm that
appropriately integrates previous methods for handling all these challenges is
still underway. In this paper, we draw an analogy between the propagation of
GNNs and particle systems in physics, proposing a model-agnostic enhancement
framework. This framework enriches the graph structure by introducing
additional nodes and rewiring connections with both positive and negative
weights, guided by node labeling information. We theoretically verify that GNNs
enhanced through our approach can effectively circumvent the over-smoothing
issue and exhibit robustness against over-squashing. Moreover, we conduct a
spectral analysis on the rewired graph to demonstrate that the corresponding
GNNs can fit both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Empirical validations on
benchmarks for homophilic, heterophilic graphs, and long-term graph datasets
show that GNNs enhanced by our method significantly outperform their original
counterparts.

<p class="mathjax">Unequal technology access for Black and Latine communities has been a
persistent economic, social justice, and human rights issue despite increased
technology accessibility due to advancements in consumer electronics like
phones, tablets, and computers. We contextualize socio-technical access
inequalities for Black and Latine urban communities and find that many students
are hesitant to engage with available technologies due to a lack of engaging
support systems. We present a holistic student-led STEM engagement model
through AVELA - A Vision for Engineering Literacy and Access leveraging
culturally responsive lessons, mentor embodied community representation, and
service learning. To evaluate the model's impact after 4 years of mentoring
200+ university student instructors in teaching to 2,500+ secondary school
students in 100+ classrooms, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with
college AnonymizedOrganization members. We identify access barriers and provide
principled recommendations for designing future STEM education programs.

<p class="mathjax">As an indispensable personalized service within Location-Based Social
Networks (LBSNs), the Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to assist
individuals in discovering attractive and engaging places. However, the
accurate recommendation capability relies on the powerful server collecting a
vast amount of users' historical check-in data, posing significant risks of
privacy breaches. Although several collaborative learning (CL) frameworks for
POI recommendation enhance recommendation resilience and allow users to keep
personal data on-device, they still share personal knowledge to improve
recommendation performance, thus leaving vulnerabilities for potential
attackers. Given this, we design a new Physical Trajectory Inference Attack
(PTIA) to expose users' historical trajectories. Specifically, for each user,
we identify the set of interacted POIs by analyzing the aggregated information
from the target POIs and their correlated POIs. We evaluate the effectiveness
of PTIA on two real-world datasets across two types of decentralized CL
frameworks for POI recommendation. Empirical results demonstrate that PTIA
poses a significant threat to users' historical trajectories. Furthermore,
Local Differential Privacy (LDP), the traditional privacy-preserving method for
CL frameworks, has also been proven ineffective against PTIA. In light of this,
we propose a novel defense mechanism (AGD) against PTIA based on an adversarial
game to eliminate sensitive POIs and their information in correlated POIs.
After conducting intensive experiments, AGD has been proven precise and
practical, with minimal impact on recommendation performance.

<p class="mathjax">The optimistic gradient method is useful in addressing minimax optimization
problems. Motivated by the observation that the conventional stochastic version
suffers from the need for a large batch size on the order of
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an $\varepsilon$-stationary
solution, we introduce and analyze a new formulation termed Diffusion
Stochastic Same-Sample Optimistic Gradient (DSS-OG). We prove its convergence
and resolve the large batch issue by establishing a tighter upper bound, under
the more general setting of nonconvex Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) risk functions.
We also extend the applicability of the proposed method to the distributed
scenario, where agents communicate with their neighbors via a left-stochastic
protocol. To implement DSS-OG, we can query the stochastic gradient oracles in
parallel with some extra memory overhead, resulting in a complexity comparable
to its conventional counterpart. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm, we conduct tests by training generative adversarial networks.

<p class="mathjax">A domain shift occurs when training (source) and test (target) data diverge
in their distribution. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses the domain shift
problem, aiming to adopt a trained model on the source domain to the target
domain in a scenario where only a well-trained source model and unlabeled
target data are available. In this scenario, handling false labels in the
target domain is crucial because they negatively impact the model performance.
To deal with this problem, we propose to utilize cluster structure (i.e.,
{`Clean'} and {`Noisy'} regions within each cluster) in the target domain
formulated by the source model. Given an initial clustering of target samples,
we first partition clusters into {`Clean'} and {`Noisy'} regions defined based
on cluster prototype (i.e., centroid of each cluster). As these regions have
totally different distributions of the true pseudo-labels, we adopt distinct
training strategies for the clean and noisy regions: we selectively train the
target with clean pseudo-labels in the clean region, whereas we introduce mixup
inputs representing intermediate features between clean and noisy regions to
increase the compactness of the cluster. We conducted extensive experiments on
multiple datasets in online/offline TTA settings, whose results demonstrate
that our method, {CNA-TTA}, achieves state-of-the-art for most cases.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Cognitive biases in clinical decision-making significantly
contribute to errors in diagnosis and suboptimal patient outcomes. Addressing
these biases presents a formidable challenge in the medical field. This study
explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in mitigating these biases
through the utilization of a multi-agent framework. We simulate the clinical
decision-making processes through multi-agent conversation and evaluate its
efficacy in improving diagnostic accuracy. Methods: A total of 16 published and
unpublished case reports where cognitive biases have resulted in misdiagnoses
were identified from the literature. In the multi-agent system, we leveraged
GPT-4 Turbo to facilitate interactions among four simulated agents to replicate
clinical team dynamics. Each agent has a distinct role: 1) To make the initial
and final diagnosis after considering the discussions, 2) The devil's advocate
and correct confirmation and anchoring bias, 3) The tutor and facilitator of
the discussion to reduce premature closure bias, and 4) To record and summarize
the findings. A total of 80 simulations were evaluated for the accuracy of
initial diagnosis, top differential diagnosis and final two differential
diagnoses. Findings: In a total of 80 responses evaluating both initial and
final diagnoses, the initial diagnosis had an accuracy of 0% (0/80), but
following multi-agent discussions, the accuracy for the top differential
diagnosis increased to 71.3% (57/80), and for the final two differential
diagnoses, to 80.0% (64/80). The system demonstrated an ability to reevaluate
and correct misconceptions, even in scenarios with misleading initial
investigations. Interpretation: The LLM-driven multi-agent conversation system
shows promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diagnostically challenging
medical scenarios.

dynamics in time, notably partial differential equations (PDEs), in which the
manifold latent space evolves according to Ricci flow. This can be accomplished
by simulating Ricci flow in a physics-informed setting, and manifold quantities
can be matched so that Ricci flow is empirically achieved. With our
methodology, the manifold is learned as part of the training procedure, so
ideal geometries may be discerned, while the evolution simultaneously induces a
more accommodating latent representation over static methods. We present our
method on a range of numerical experiments consisting of PDEs that encompass
desirable characteristics such as periodicity and randomness, remarking error
on in-distribution and extrapolation scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel coding scheme for DNA-based storage systems, called the
shift-interleave (SI) coding, designed to correct insertion, deletion, and
substitution (IDS) errors, as well as sequence losses. The SI coding scheme
employs multiple codewords from two binary low-density parity-check codes.
These codewords are processed to form DNA base sequences through shifting,
bit-to-base mapping, and interleaving. At the receiver side, an efficient
non-iterative detection and decoding scheme is employed to sequentially
estimate codewords. The numerical results demonstrate the excellent performance
of the SI coding scheme in correcting both IDS errors and sequence losses.

<p class="mathjax">Social relations are leveraged to tackle the sparsity issue of user-item
interaction data in recommendation under the assumption of social homophily.
However, social recommendation paradigms predominantly focus on homophily based
on user preferences. While social information can enhance recommendations, its
alignment with user preferences is not guaranteed, thereby posing the risk of
introducing informational redundancy. We empirically discover that social
graphs in real recommendation data exhibit low preference-aware homophily,
which limits the effect of social recommendation models. To comprehensively
extract preference-aware homophily information latent in the social graph, we
propose Social Heterophily-alleviating Rewiring (SHaRe), a data-centric
framework for enhancing existing graph-based social recommendation models. We
adopt Graph Rewiring technique to capture and add highly homophilic social
relations, and cut low homophilic (or heterophilic) relations. To better refine
the user representations from reliable social relations, we integrate a
contrastive learning method into the training of SHaRe, aiming to calibrate the
user representations for enhancing the result of Graph Rewiring. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that the proposed framework not only exhibits enhanced
performances across varying homophily ratios but also improves the performance
of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) social recommendation models.

<p class="mathjax">Bots have been in the spotlight for many social media studies, for they have
been observed to be participating in the manipulation of information and
opinions on social media. These studies analyzed the activity and influence of
bots in a variety of contexts: elections, protests, health communication and so
forth. Prior to this analyses is the identification of bot accounts to
segregate the class of social media users. In this work, we propose an ensemble
method for bot detection, designing a multi-platform bot detection architecture
to handle several problems along the bot detection pipeline: incomplete data
input, minimal feature engineering, optimized classifiers for each data field,
and also eliminate the need for a threshold value for classification
determination. With these design decisions, we generalize our bot detection
framework across Twitter, Reddit and Instagram. We also perform feature
importance analysis, observing that the entropy of names and number of
interactions (retweets/shares) are important factors in bot determination.
Finally, we apply our multi-platform bot detector to the US 2020 presidential
elections to identify and analyze bot activity across multiple social media
platforms, showcasing the difference in online discourse of bots from different
platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Engaging with diverse political views is important for reaching better
collective decisions, however, users online tend to remain confined within
ideologically homogeneous spaces. In this work, we study users who are members
of these spaces but who also show a willingness to engage with diverse views,
as they have the potential to introduce more informational diversity into their
communities. Across four Reddit communities (r/Conservative, r/The_Donald,
r/ChapoTrapHouse, r/SandersForPresident), we find that these users tend to use
less hostile and more advanced and personable language, but receive fewer
social rewards from their peers compared to others. We also find that social
sanctions on the discussion community r/changemyview are insufficient to drive
them out in the short term, though they may play a role over the longer term.

<p class="mathjax">Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly employed to model complex
industrial systems characterized by multivariable dependence. Existing
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) excel in solving PDEs in a homogeneous
medium. However, their feasibility is diminished when PDE parameters are
unknown due to a lack of physical attributions and time-varying interface is
unavailable arising from heterogeneous media. To this end, we propose a
data-physics-hybrid method, physically informed synchronic-adaptive learning
(PISAL), to solve PDEs for industrial systems modeling in heterogeneous media.
First, Net1, Net2, and NetI, are constructed to approximate the solutions
satisfying PDEs and the interface. Net1 and Net2 are utilized to synchronously
learn each solution satisfying PDEs with diverse parameters, while NetI is
employed to adaptively learn the unavailable time-varying interface. Then, a
criterion combined with NetI is introduced to adaptively distinguish the
attributions of measurements and collocation points. Furthermore, NetI is
integrated into a data-physics-hybrid loss function. Accordingly, a
synchronic-adaptive learning (SAL) strategy is proposed to decompose and
optimize each subdomain. Besides, we theoretically prove the approximation
capability of PISAL. Extensive experimental results verify that the proposed
PISAL can be used for industrial systems modeling in heterogeneous media, which
faces the challenges of lack of physical attributions and unavailable
time-varying interface.

activity state (AS) temporal correlation of the user equipments (UEs) in the
time domain under the uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access
(GF-NOMA) system. The Bernoulli Gaussian-Markov chain (BG-MC) probability model
is used for exploiting both the sparsity and slow change characteristic of the

is proposed to improve the detector performance, which can utilize the
bidirectional message passing between the neighboring time slots to fully

the BG-MC model can be updated adaptively during the estimation procedure with

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explore the multiplayer General Lotto Blotto game over a
single battlefield, a notable variant of the Colonel Blotto game. In this
version, each player employs a probability distribution for resource
allocation, ensuring that the expected expenditure does not surpass their
budget. We first establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium for a modified
version of this game, in which there is a common threshold that no player's bid
can exceed. We next extend our findings to demonstrate the existence of a Nash
equilibrium in the original game, which does not incorporate this threshold.
Moreover, we provide detailed characterizations of the Nash equilibrium for
both the original game and its modified version. In the Nash equilibrium of the
unmodified game, we observe that the upper endpoints of the supports of
players' equilibrium strategies coincide, and the minimum value of a player's
support above zero inversely correlates with their budget. Specifically, we
present closed-form solutions for the Nash equilibrium with threshold for two
players.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the concept of "Alternative Speech" as a new way to directly
combat hate speech and complement the limitations of counter-narrative. An
alternative speech provides practical alternatives to hate speech in real-world
scenarios by offering speech-level corrections to speakers while considering
the surrounding context and promoting speakers to reform. Further, an
alternative speech can combat hate speech alongside counter-narratives,
offering a useful tool to address social issues such as racial discrimination
and gender inequality. We propose the new concept and provide detailed
guidelines for constructing the necessary dataset. Through discussion, we
demonstrate that combining alternative speech and counter-narrative can be a
more effective strategy for combating hate speech by complementing specificity
and guiding capacity of counter-narrative. This paper presents another
perspective for dealing with hate speech, offering viable remedies to
complement the constraints of current approaches to mitigating harmful bias.

<p class="mathjax">The remarkable achievements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms,
particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have fueled their
extensive deployment across multiple sectors, including Software Engineering
(SE). However, due to their black-box nature, these promising AI-driven SE
models are still far from being deployed in practice. This lack of
explainability poses unwanted risks for their applications in critical tasks,
such as vulnerability detection, where decision-making transparency is of
paramount importance. This paper endeavors to elucidate this interdisciplinary
domain by presenting a systematic literature review of approaches that aim to
improve the explainability of AI models within the context of SE. The review
canvasses work appearing in the most prominent SE &amp; AI conferences and
journals, and spans 63 papers across 21 unique SE tasks. Based on three key
Research Questions (RQs), we aim to (1) summarize the SE tasks where XAI
techniques have shown success to date; (2) classify and analyze different XAI
techniques; and (3) investigate existing evaluation approaches. Based on our
findings, we identified a set of challenges remaining to be addressed in
existing studies, together with a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities
we deemed appropriate and important for future work.

<p class="mathjax">Test-time domain adaptation effectively adjusts the source domain model to
accommodate unseen domain shifts in a target domain during inference. However,
the model performance can be significantly impaired by continuous distribution
changes in the target domain and non-independent and identically distributed
(non-i.i.d.) test samples often encountered in practical scenarios. While
existing memory bank methodologies use memory to store samples and mitigate
non-i.i.d. effects, they do not inherently prevent potential model degradation.
To address this issue, we propose a resilient practical test-time adaptation
(ResiTTA) method focused on parameter resilience and data quality.
Specifically, we develop a resilient batch normalization with estimation on
normalization statistics and soft alignments to mitigate overfitting and model
degradation. We use an entropy-driven memory bank that accounts for timeliness,
the persistence of over-confident samples, and sample uncertainty for
high-quality data in adaptation. Our framework periodically adapts the source
domain model using a teacher-student model through a self-training loss on the
memory samples, incorporating soft alignment losses on batch normalization. We
empirically validate ResiTTA across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

<p class="mathjax">Terahertz (THz) communication is considered a viable approach to augmenting
the communication capacity of prospective Internet-of-Things (IoT) resulting in
enhanced spectral efficiency. This study first provides an outline of the
design challenges encountered in developing THz transceivers. This paper
introduces advanced approaches and a unique methodology known as Modified
Pulse-width Modulation (MPWM) to address the issues in the THz domain. In this
situation involving a transceiver that handles complex modulation schemes, the
presence of a mixed signal through a high-resolution digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) in the transmitter greatly contributes to the limitation in
maintaining linearity at high frequencies. The utilization of Pulse-width
Modulation-based Digital-to-Analog Converters (PWM-DACs) has garnered
significant attention among scholars due to its efficiency and affordability.
However, the converters' performance is restricted by insufficient conversion
speed and precision, especially in the context of high-resolution, high-order
modulation schemes for THz wireless communications. The MPWM framework offers a
multitude of adjustable options, rendering the final MPWM-DAC highly adaptable
for a diverse array of application scenarios. Comparative performance
assessments indicate that MPWM-DACs have enhanced conversion speed compared to
standard PWM-DACs, and they also provide greater accuracy in comparison to
Pulse-count Modulation DACs (PCM-DACs). The study presents a comprehensive
examination of the core principles, spectrum characteristics, and evaluation
metrics, as well as the development and experimental validation of the MPWM
method. Furthermore, we present a RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) that incorporates
an MPWM-DAC, offering a highly favorable resolution for THz IoT communications.

controlled by a related analytic or algebraic matrix parameter, e.g., rank,
sign-rank, discrepancy, etc. The forward direction is typically easy as the
structural implications of small complexity often imply a bound on some matrix
parameter. The challenge lies in establishing the reverse direction, which

<p class="mathjax">Large language models have demonstrated remarkable potential in various
tasks, however, there remains a significant scarcity of open-source models and
data for specific domains. Previous works have primarily focused on manually
specifying resources and collecting high-quality data on specific domains,
which significantly consume time and effort. To address this limitation, we
propose an efficient data collection method~\textit{Query of CC} based on large
language models. This method bootstraps seed information through a large
language model and retrieves related data from public corpora. It not only
collects knowledge-related data for specific domains but unearths the data with
potential reasoning procedures. Through the application of this method, we have
curated a high-quality dataset called~\textsc{Knowledge Pile}, encompassing

<p class="mathjax">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) outcomes serve as input for downstream
tasks, substantially impacting the satisfaction level of end-users. Hence, the
diagnosis and enhancement of the vulnerabilities present in the ASR model bear
significant importance. However, traditional evaluation methodologies of ASR
systems generate a singular, composite quantitative metric, which fails to
provide comprehensive insight into specific vulnerabilities. This lack of
detail extends to the post-processing stage, resulting in further obfuscation
of potential weaknesses. Despite an ASR model's ability to recognize utterances
accurately, subpar readability can negatively affect user satisfaction, giving
rise to a trade-off between recognition accuracy and user-friendliness. To
effectively address this, it is imperative to consider both the speech-level,
crucial for recognition accuracy, and the text-level, critical for
user-friendliness. Consequently, we propose the development of an Error
Explainable Benchmark (EEB) dataset. This dataset, while considering both
speech- and text-level, enables a granular understanding of the model's
shortcomings. Our proposition provides a structured pathway for a more
`real-world-centric' evaluation, a marked shift away from abstracted,
traditional methods, allowing for the detection and rectification of nuanced
system weaknesses, ultimately aiming for an improved user experience.

<p class="mathjax">Scene graph generation (SGG) endeavors to predict visual relationships
between pairs of objects within an image. Prevailing SGG methods traditionally
assume a one-off learning process for SGG. This conventional paradigm may
necessitate repetitive training on all previously observed samples whenever new
relationships emerge, mitigating the risk of forgetting previously acquired
knowledge. This work seeks to address this pitfall inherent in a suite of prior
relationship predictions. Motivated by the achievements of in-context learning
in pretrained language models, our approach imbues the model with the
capability to predict relationships and continuously acquire novel knowledge
without succumbing to catastrophic forgetting. To achieve this goal, we
introduce a novel and pragmatic framework for scene graph generation, namely
Lifelong Scene Graph Generation (LSGG), where tasks, such as predicates, unfold
in a streaming fashion. In this framework, the model is constrained to
exclusive training on the present task, devoid of access to previously
encountered training data, except for a limited number of exemplars, but the
model is tasked with inferring all predicates it has encountered thus far.
Rigorous experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
state-of-the-art SGG models in the context of LSGG across a diverse array of
metrics. Besides, extensive experiments on the two mainstream benchmark
datasets, VG and Open-Image(v6), show the superiority of our proposed model to
a number of competitive SGG models in terms of continuous learning and
conventional settings. Moreover, comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component in our model.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning models are trained with certain assumptions about the data
during the development stage and then used for prediction in the deployment
stage. It is important to reason about the trustworthiness of the model's
predictions with unseen data during deployment. Existing methods for specifying
and verifying traditional software are insufficient for this task, as they
cannot handle the complexity of DNN model architecture and expected outcomes.
In this work, we propose a novel technique that uses rules derived from neural
network computations to infer data preconditions for a DNN model to determine
the trustworthiness of its predictions. Our approach, DeepInfer involves
introducing a novel abstraction for a trained DNN model that enables weakest
precondition reasoning using Dijkstra's Predicate Transformer Semantics. By
deriving rules over the inductive type of neural network abstract
representation, we can overcome the matrix dimensionality issues that arise
from the backward non-linear computation from the output layer to the input
layer. We utilize the weakest precondition computation using rules of each kind
of activation function to compute layer-wise precondition from the given
postcondition on the final output of a deep neural network. We extensively
evaluated DeepInfer on 29 real-world DNN models using four different datasets
collected from five different sources and demonstrated the utility,
effectiveness, and performance improvement over closely related work. DeepInfer
efficiently detects correct and incorrect predictions of high-accuracy models
with high recall (0.98) and high F-1 score (0.84) and has significantly
improved over prior technique, SelfChecker. The average runtime overhead of
DeepInfer is low, 0.22 sec for all unseen datasets. We also compared runtime
overhead using the same hardware settings and found that DeepInfer is 3.27
times faster than SelfChecker.

<p class="mathjax">Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) is a meaningful task in the area of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) which aims at detecting spelling errors in Chinese
texts and then correcting these errors. However, CSC models are based on
pretrained language models, which are trained on a general corpus.
Consequently, their performance may drop when confronted with downstream tasks
involving domain-specific terms. In this paper, we conduct a thorough
evaluation about the domain adaption ability of various typical CSC models by
building three new datasets encompassing rich domain-specific terms from the
financial, medical, and legal domains. Then we conduct empirical investigations
in the corresponding domain-specific test datasets to ascertain the
cross-domain adaptation ability of several typical CSC models. We also test the
performance of the popular large language model ChatGPT. As shown in our
experiments, the performances of the CSC models drop significantly in the new
domains.

<p class="mathjax">Recent semantic communication methods explore effective ways to expand the
communication paradigm and improve the system performance of the communication
systems. Nonetheless, the common problem of these methods is that the essence
of semantics is not explicitly pointed out and directly utilized. A new
epistemology suggests that synonymy, which is revealed as the fundamental
feature of semantics, guides the establishment of the semantic information
theory from a novel viewpoint. Building on this theoretical basis, this paper
proposes a semantic arithmetic coding (SAC) method for semantic lossless
compression using intuitive semantic synonymy. By constructing reasonable
synonymous mappings and performing arithmetic coding procedures over synonymous
sets, SAC can achieve higher compression efficiency for meaning-contained
source sequences at the semantic level and thereby approximate the semantic
entropy limits. Experimental results on edge texture map compression show an
evident improvement in coding efficiency using SAC without semantic losses,
compared to traditional arithmetic coding, which demonstrates its
effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic communication stands out as a highly promising avenue for future
developments in communications. Theoretically, source compression coding based
on semantics can achieve lower rates than Shannon entropy. This paper
introduces a semantic Huffman coding built upon semantic information theory. By
incorporating synonymous mapping and synonymous sets, semantic Huffman coding
can achieve shorter average code lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
semantic Huffman coding theoretically have the capability to approximate
semantic entropy. Experimental results indicate that, under the condition of
semantic lossless, semantic Huffman coding exhibits clear advantages in
compression efficiency over classical Huffman coding.

<p class="mathjax">Many software applications incorporate open-source third-party packages
distributed by third-party package registries. Guaranteeing authorship along
this supply chain is a challenge. Package maintainers can guarantee package
authorship through software signing. However, it is unclear how common this
practice is, and whether the resulting signatures are created properly. Prior
work has provided raw data on signing practices, but measured single platforms,
did not consider time, and did not provide insight on factors that may
influence signing. We lack a comprehensive, multi-platform understanding of
signing adoption and relevant factors.
<br />This study addresses this gap. We provide measurements across three kinds of
package registries: traditional software (Maven, PyPi), container images
(DockerHub), and machine learning models (HuggingFace). For each registry, we
describe the nature of the signed artifacts as well as the current quantity and
quality of signatures. Then, we examine longitudinal trends in signing
practices. Finally, we use a quasi-experiment to estimate the effect that
various events had on software signing practices. To summarize our findings:
(1) mandating signature adoption improves the quantity of signatures; (2)
providing dedicated tooling improves the quality of signing; (3) getting
started is the hard part -- once a maintainer begins to sign, they tend to
continue doing so; and (4) although many supply chain attacks are mitigable via
signing, signing adoption is primarily affected by registry policy rather than
by public knowledge of attacks, new engineering standards, etc. These findings
highlight the importance of software package registry managers and signing
infrastructure.

<p class="mathjax">Current methods for solving Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) find
states' costs-to-go by applying Bellman backups, where state-of-the-art methods
employ heuristics to select states to back up and prune. A fundamental
limitation of these algorithms is their need to compute the cost-to-go for
every applicable action during each state backup, leading to unnecessary
computation for actions identified as sub-optimal. We present new connections
between planning and operations research and, using this framework, we address
this issue of unnecessary computation by introducing an efficient version of
constraint generation for SSPs. This technique allows algorithms to ignore
sub-optimal actions and avoid computing their costs-to-go. We also apply our
novel technique to iLAO* resulting in a new algorithm, CG-iLAO*. Our
experiments show that CG-iLAO* ignores up to 57% of iLAO*'s actions and it
solves problems up to 8x and 3x faster than LRTDP and iLAO*.

<p class="mathjax">As a fundamental task in computational chemistry, retrosynthesis prediction
aims to identify a set of reactants to synthesize a target molecule. Existing
template-free approaches only consider the graph structures of the target
molecule, which often cannot generalize well to rare reaction types and large
molecules. Here, we propose T-Rex, a text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction
approach that exploits pre-trained text language models, such as ChatGPT, to
assist the generation of reactants. T-Rex first exploits ChatGPT to generate a
description for the target molecule and rank candidate reaction centers based
both the description and the molecular graph. It then re-ranks these candidates
by querying the descriptions for each reactants and examines which group of
reactants can best synthesize the target molecule. We observed that T-Rex
substantially outperformed graph-based state-of-the-art approaches on two
datasets, indicating the effectiveness of considering text information. We
further found that T-Rex outperformed the variant that only use ChatGPT-based
description without the re-ranking step, demonstrate how our framework
outperformed a straightforward integration of ChatGPT and graph information.
Collectively, we show that text generated by pre-trained language models can
substantially improve retrosynthesis prediction, opening up new avenues for
exploiting ChatGPT to advance computational chemistry. And the codes can be
found at https://github.com/lauyikfung/T-Rex.

<p class="mathjax">The attribution of question answering is to provide citations for supporting
generated statements, and has attracted wide research attention. The current
methods for automatically evaluating the attribution, which are often based on
Large Language Models (LLMs), are still inadequate, particularly in recognizing
subtle differences between attributions, and complex relationships between
citations and statements. To compare these attribution evaluation methods and
develop new ones, we introduce a set of fine-grained categories (i.e.,
supportive, insufficient, contradictory and irrelevant) for measuring the
attribution, and develop a Complex Attributed Question Answering (CAQA)
benchmark by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) for automatically generating

<p class="mathjax">Video quality can suffer from limited internet speed while being streamed by
users. Compression artifacts start to appear when the bitrate decreases to
match the available bandwidth. Existing algorithms either focus on removing the
compression artifacts at the same video resolution, or on upscaling the video
resolution but not removing the artifacts. Super resolution-only approaches
will amplify the artifacts along with the details by default. We propose a
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm which
simultaneously performs artifacts reduction and super resolution (ARSR) by
enhancing the feature extraction layers and designing a custom training
dataset. The output of this neural network is evaluated for test streams
compressed at low bitrates using variable bitrate (VBR) encoding. The output
video quality shows a 4-6 increase in video multi-method assessment fusion
(VMAF) score compared to traditional interpolation upscaling approaches such as
Lanczos or Bicubic.

<p class="mathjax">Consider the supervised learning setting where the goal is to learn to
predict labels $\mathbf y$ given points $\mathbf x$ from a distribution. An
\textit{omnipredictor} for a class $\mathcal L$ of loss functions and a class
$\mathcal C$ of hypotheses is a predictor whose predictions incur less expected
loss than the best hypothesis in $\mathcal C$ for every loss in $\mathcal L$.
Since the work of [GKR+21] that introduced the notion, there has been a large
body of work in the setting of binary labels where $\mathbf y \in \{0, 1\}$,
but much less is known about the regression setting where $\mathbf y \in [0,1]$
can be continuous. Our main conceptual contribution is the notion of
\textit{sufficient statistics} for loss minimization over a family of loss
functions: these are a set of statistics about a distribution such that knowing
them allows one to take actions that minimize the expected loss for any loss in
the family. The notion of sufficient statistics relates directly to the
approximate rank of the family of loss functions.
<br />Our key technical contribution is a bound of $O(1/\varepsilon^{2/3})$ on the
$\epsilon$-approximate rank of convex, Lipschitz functions on the interval
$[0,1]$, which we show is tight up to a factor of $\mathrm{polylog}
(1/\epsilon)$. This yields improved runtimes for learning omnipredictors for
the class of all convex, Lipschitz loss functions under weak learnability
assumptions about the class $\mathcal C$. We also give efficient omnipredictors
when the loss families have low-degree polynomial approximations, or arise from
generalized linear models (GLMs). This translation from sufficient statistics
to faster omnipredictors is made possible by lifting the technique of loss
outcome indistinguishability introduced by [GKH+23] for Boolean labels to the
regression setting.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic the information-processing mechanisms of
the human brain and are highly energy-efficient, making them well-suited for
low-power edge devices. However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies
leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints
of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose
a new approach named LitESNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal
compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a
novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to
support pruning and mixed-precision quantization while utilizing the shared
weights and pruning mask to reduce the computation. Temporally, we are the
first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number
of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate
a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and
spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while
minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitESNNs
can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model
sizes and fewer computation costs. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness
of our LitESNN on the trade-off between accuracy and resource cost and show the
superiority of our joint optimization. Additionally, we conduct energy analysis
to further confirm the energy efficiency of LitESNN

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a Korean legal judgment prediction (LJP) dataset for
insurance disputes. Successful LJP models on insurance disputes can benefit
insurance companies and their customers. It can save both sides' time and money
by allowing them to predict how the result would come out if they proceed to
the dispute mediation process. As is often the case with low-resource
languages, there is a limitation on the amount of data available for this
specific task. To mitigate this issue, we investigate how one can achieve a
good performance despite the limitation in data. In our experiment, we
demonstrate that Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning (SetFit, Tunstall et al.,
2022) is a good alternative to standard fine-tuning when training data are
limited. The models fine-tuned with the SetFit approach on our data show
similar performance to the Korean LJP benchmark models (Hwang et al., 2022)
despite the much smaller data size.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative power in
enhancing natural language comprehension, representing a significant stride
toward artificial general intelligence. The application of LLMs extends beyond
conventional linguistic boundaries, encompassing specialized linguistic systems
developed within various scientific disciplines. This growing interest has led
to the advent of scientific LLMs, a novel subclass specifically engineered for
facilitating scientific discovery. As a burgeoning area in the community of AI
for Science, scientific LLMs warrant comprehensive exploration. However, a
systematic and up-to-date survey introducing them is currently lacking. In this
paper, we endeavor to methodically delineate the concept of "scientific
language", whilst providing a thorough review of the latest advancements in
scientific LLMs. Given the expansive realm of scientific disciplines, our
analysis adopts a focused lens, concentrating on the biological and chemical
domains. This includes an in-depth examination of LLMs for textual knowledge,
small molecules, macromolecular proteins, genomic sequences, and their
combinations, analyzing them in terms of model architectures, capabilities,
datasets, and evaluation. Finally, we critically examine the prevailing
challenges and point out promising research directions along with the advances
of LLMs. By offering a comprehensive overview of technical developments in this
field, this survey aspires to be an invaluable resource for researchers
navigating the intricate landscape of scientific LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">The demand for accurate object detection in aerial imagery has surged with
the widespread use of drones and satellite technology. Traditional object
detection models, trained on datasets biased towards large objects, struggle to
perform optimally in aerial scenarios where small, densely clustered objects
are prevalent. To address this challenge, we present an innovative approach
that combines super-resolution and an adapted lightweight YOLOv5 architecture.
We employ a range of datasets, including VisDrone-2023, SeaDroneSee, VEDAI, and
NWPU VHR-10, to evaluate our model's performance. Our Super Resolved YOLOv5
architecture features Transformer encoder blocks, allowing the model to capture
global context and context information, leading to improved detection results,
especially in high-density, occluded conditions. This lightweight model not
only delivers improved accuracy but also ensures efficient resource
utilization, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Our experimental
results demonstrate the model's superior performance in detecting small and
densely clustered objects, underlining the significance of dataset choice and
architectural adaptation for this specific task. In particular, the method
achieves 52.5% mAP on VisDrone, exceeding top prior works. This approach
promises to significantly advance object detection in aerial imagery,
contributing to more accurate and reliable results in a variety of real-world
applications.

<p class="mathjax">BCH codes form an important subclass of cyclic codes, and are widely used in
compact discs, digital audio tapes and other data storage systems to improve
data reliability. As far as we know, there are few results on $q$-ary BCH codes
of length $n=\frac{q^{m}+1}{q+1}$. This is because it is harder to deal with
BCH codes of such length. In this paper, we study $q$-ary BCH codes with
lengths $n=\frac{q^{m}+1}{q+1}$ and $n=q^m+1$. These two classes of BCH codes
are always LCD codes. For $n=\frac{q^{m}+1}{q+1}$, the dimensions of
narrow-sense BCH codes of length $n$ with designed distance $\delta=\ell
q^{\frac{m-1}{2}}+1$ are determined, where $q&gt;2$ and $2\leq \ell \leq q-1$.
Moreover, the largest coset leader is given for $m=3$ and the first two largest
coset leaders are given for $q=2$. The parameters of BCH codes related to the
first few largest coset leaders are investigated. Some binary BCH codes of
length $n=\frac{2^m+1}{3}$ have optimal parameters. For ternary narrow-sense
BCH codes of length $n=3^m+1$, a lower bound on the minimum distance of their
dual codes is developed, which is good in some cases.

<p class="mathjax">Dysarthric speech reconstruction (DSR) systems aim to automatically convert
dysarthric speech into normal-sounding speech. The technology eases
communication with speakers affected by the neuromotor disorder and enhances
their social inclusion. NED-based (Neural Encoder-Decoder) systems have
significantly improved the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech as
compared with GAN-based (Generative Adversarial Network) approaches, but the
approach is still limited by training inefficiency caused by the cascaded
pipeline and auxiliary tasks of the content encoder, which may in turn affect
the quality of reconstruction. Inspired by self-supervised speech
representation learning and discrete speech units, we propose a Unit-DSR
system, which harnesses the powerful domain-adaptation capacity of HuBERT for
training efficiency improvement and utilizes speech units to constrain the
dysarthric content restoration in a discrete linguistic space. Compared with
NED approaches, the Unit-DSR system only consists of a speech unit normalizer
and a Unit HiFi-GAN vocoder, which is considerably simpler without cascaded
sub-modules or auxiliary tasks. Results on the UASpeech corpus indicate that
Unit-DSR outperforms competitive baselines in terms of content restoration,
reaching a 28.2% relative average word error rate reduction when compared to
original dysarthric speech, and shows robustness against speed perturbation and
noise.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the spectrum sharing between a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) secure communication system and a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar system in the presence of one suspicious
eavesdropper. We jointly design the radar waveform and communication
beamforming vector at the two systems, such that the interference between the
base station (BS) and radar is reduced, and the detrimental radar interference
to the communication system is enhanced to jam the eavesdropper, thereby
increasing secure information transmission performance. In particular, by
considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the user and
eavesdropper, we maximize the worst-case secrecy rate at the user, while
ensuring the detection performance of radar system. To tackle this challenging
problem, we propose a two-layer robust cooperative algorithm based on the
S-lemma and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm achieves significant secrecy rate gains over the
non-robust scheme. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between secrecy
rate and detection probability.

we continue to analyze approximation and recovery properties with respect to
systems satisfying universal sampling discretization property and a special
unconditionality property. In addition we assume that the subspace spanned by
our system satisfies some Nikol'skii-type inequalities. We concentrate on
recovery with the error measured in the $L_p$ norm for $2\le p&lt;\infty$. We
apply a powerful nonlinear approximation method -- the Weak Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (WOMP) also known under the name Weak Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm
(WOGA). We establish that the WOMP based on good points for the $L_2$-universal
discretization provides good recovery in the $L_p$ norm for $2\le p&lt;\infty$.
For our recovery algorithms we obtain both the Lebesgue-type inequalities for
individual functions and the error bounds for special classes of multivariate
functions.
<br />We combine here two deep and powerful techniques -- Lebesgue-type
inequalities for the WOMP and theory of the universal sampling dicretization --
in order to obtain new results in sampling recovery.

<p class="mathjax">Cyclic BCH codes and negacyclic BCH codes form important subclasses of cyclic
codes and negacyclic codes, respectively, and can produce optimal linear codes
in many cases. To the best of our knowledge, there are few results on the dual
codes of cyclic and negacyclic BCH codes. In this paper, we study the dual
codes of narrow-sense cyclic BCH codes of length $q^m+1$ over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power, and the dual codes of
narrow-sense negacyclic BCH codes of length $\frac{q^{m}+1}{2}$ over
$\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power satisfying $q\equiv 3~({\rm
mod}~4)$. Some lower bounds on the minimum distances of the dual codes are
established, which are very close to the true minimum distances of the dual
codes in many cases. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the even-like
subcodes of narrow-sense cyclic BCH codes of length $q^{m}+1$ being cyclic
dually-BCH codes are given in terms of designed distances, where $q$ is odd and
$m$ is odd or $m\equiv 2~({\rm mod~}4)$. The concept of negacyclic dually-BCH
codes is proposed, and sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of designed
distances are presented to ensure that narrow-sense negacyclic BCH codes of
length $\frac{q^{m}+1}{2}$ are dually-BCH codes, where $q\equiv 3~({\rm
mod}~4)$.

<p class="mathjax">People employ expressive behaviors to effectively communicate and coordinate
their actions with others, such as nodding to acknowledge a person glancing at
them or saying "excuse me" to pass people in a busy corridor. We would like
robots to also demonstrate expressive behaviors in human-robot interaction.
Prior work proposes rule-based methods that struggle to scale to new
communication modalities or social situations, while data-driven methods
require specialized datasets for each social situation the robot is used in. We
propose to leverage the rich social context available from large language
models (LLMs) and their ability to generate motion based on instructions or
user preferences, to generate expressive robot motion that is adaptable and
composable, building upon each other. Our approach utilizes few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting to translate human language instructions into
parametrized control code using the robot's available and learned skills.
Through user studies and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our
approach produces behaviors that users found to be competent and easy to
understand. Supplementary material can be found at

<p class="mathjax">Cross-domain Recommendation (CDR) as one of the effective techniques in
alleviating the data sparsity issues has been widely studied in recent years.
However, previous works may cause domain privacy leakage since they necessitate
the aggregation of diverse domain data into a centralized server during the
training process. Though several studies have conducted privacy preserving CDR
via Federated Learning (FL), they still have the following limitations: 1) They
need to upload users' personal information to the central server, posing the
risk of leaking user privacy. 2) Existing federated methods mainly rely on
atomic item IDs to represent items, which prevents them from modeling items in
a unified feature space, increasing the challenge of knowledge transfer among
domains. 3) They are all based on the premise of knowing overlapped users
between domains, which proves impractical in real-world applications. To
address the above limitations, we focus on Privacy-preserving Cross-domain
Recommendation (PCDR) and propose PFCR as our solution. For Limitation 1, we
develop a FL schema by exclusively utilizing users' interactions with local
clients and devising an encryption method for gradient encryption. For
Limitation 2, we model items in a universal feature space by their description
texts. For Limitation 3, we initially learn federated content representations,
harnessing the generality of natural language to establish bridges between
domains. Subsequently, we craft two prompt fine-tuning strategies to tailor the
pre-trained model to the target domain. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PFCR method compared to the SOTA
approaches.

<p class="mathjax">The rise of self-driving cars (SDCs) presents important safety challenges to
address in dynamic environments. While field testing is essential, current
methods lack diversity in assessing critical SDC scenarios. Prior research
introduced simulation-based testing for SDCs, with Frenetic, a test generation
approach based on Frenet space encoding, achieving a relatively high percentage
of valid tests (approximately 50%) characterized by naturally smooth curves.
The "minimal out-of-bound distance" is often taken as a fitness function, which
we argue to be a sub-optimal metric. Instead, we show that the likelihood of
leading to an out-of-bound condition can be learned by the deep-learning
vanilla transformer model. We combine this "inherently learned metric" with a
genetic algorithm, which has been shown to produce a high diversity of tests.
To validate our approach, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation on a
dataset comprising over 1,174 simulated test cases created to challenge the
SDCs behavior. Our investigation revealed that our approach demonstrates a
substantial reduction in generating non-valid test cases, increased diversity,
and high accuracy in identifying safety violations during SDC test execution.

<p class="mathjax">We introduced SSR, which utilizes SAM (segment-anything) as a strong
regularizer during training, to greatly enhance the robustness of the image
encoder for handling various domains. Specifically, given the fact that SAM is
pre-trained with a large number of images over the internet, which cover a
diverse variety of domains, the feature encoding extracted by the SAM is
obviously less dependent on specific domains when compared to the traditional
ImageNet pre-trained image encoder. Meanwhile, the ImageNet pre-trained image
encoder is still a mature choice of backbone for the semantic segmentation
task, especially when the SAM is category-irrelevant. As a result, our SSR
provides a simple yet highly effective design. It uses the ImageNet pre-trained
image encoder as the backbone, and the intermediate feature of each stage (ie
there are 4 stages in MiT-B5) is regularized by SAM during training. After
extensive experimentation on GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, our SSR significantly
improved performance over the baseline without introducing any extra inference
overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in text-to-image models have significantly enhanced image
generation capabilities, yet a notable gap of open-source models persists in
bilingual or Chinese language support. To address this need, we present
Taiyi-Diffusion-XL, a new Chinese and English bilingual text-to-image model
which is developed by extending the capabilities of CLIP and
Stable-Diffusion-XL through a process of bilingual continuous pre-training.
This approach includes the efficient expansion of vocabulary by integrating the
most frequently used Chinese characters into CLIP's tokenizer and embedding
layers, coupled with an absolute position encoding expansion. Additionally, we
enrich text prompts by large vision-language model, leading to better images
captions and possess higher visual quality. These enhancements are subsequently
applied to downstream text-to-image models. Our empirical results indicate that
the developed CLIP model excels in bilingual image-text retrieval.Furthermore,
the bilingual image generation capabilities of Taiyi-Diffusion-XL surpass
previous models. This research leads to the development and open-sourcing of
the Taiyi-Diffusion-XL model, representing a notable advancement in the field
of image generation, particularly for Chinese language applications. This
contribution is a step forward in addressing the need for more diverse language
support in multimodal research. The model and demonstration are made publicly

<p class="mathjax">Motivation: Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent a comprehensive
resource of a patient's medical history. EHR are essential for utilizing
advanced technologies such as deep learning (DL), enabling healthcare providers
to analyze extensive data, extract valuable insights, and make precise and
data-driven clinical decisions. DL methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN) have been utilized to analyze EHR to model disease progression and
predict diagnosis. However, these methods do not address some inherent
irregularities in EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical
visits. Furthermore, most DL models are not interpretable. In this study, we
propose two interpretable DL architectures based on RNN, namely Time-Aware RNN
(TA-RNN) and TA-RNN-Autoencoder (TA-RNN-AE) to predict patient's clinical
outcome in EHR at next visit and multiple visits ahead, respectively. To
mitigate the impact of irregular time intervals, we propose incorporating time
embedding of the elapsed times between visits. For interpretability, we propose
employing a dual-level attention mechanism that operates between visits and
features within each visit.
<br />Results: The results of the experiments conducted on Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center
(NACC) datasets indicated superior performance of proposed models for
predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to state-of-the-art and baseline
approaches based on F2 and sensitivity. Additionally, TA-RNN showed superior
performance on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset
for mortality prediction. In our ablation study, we observed enhanced
predictive performance by incorporating time embedding and attention

<p class="mathjax">As a crucial technique for developing a smart city, traffic forecasting has
become a popular research focus in academic and industrial communities for
decades. This task is highly challenging due to complex and dynamic
spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic networks. Existing works ignore
continuous temporal dependencies and spatial dependencies evolving over time.
In this paper, we propose Continuously Evolving Graph Neural Controlled
Differential Equations (CEGNCDE) to capture continuous temporal dependencies
and spatial dependencies over time simultaneously. Specifically, a continuously
evolving graph generator (CEGG) based on NCDE is introduced to generate the
spatial dependencies graph that continuously evolves over time from discrete
historical observations. Then, a graph neural controlled differential equations
(GNCDE) framework is introduced to capture continuous temporal dependencies and
spatial dependencies over time simultaneously. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CEGNCDE outperforms the SOTA methods by average 2.34% relative
MAE reduction, 0.97% relative RMSE reduction, and 3.17% relative MAPE
reduction.

<p class="mathjax">In the feature space, the collapse between features invokes critical problems
in representation learning by remaining the features undistinguished.
Interpolation-based augmentation methods such as mixup have shown their
effectiveness in relieving the collapse problem between different classes,
called inter-class collapse. However, intra-class collapse raised in
coarse-to-fine transfer learning has not been discussed in the augmentation
approach. To address them, we propose a better feature augmentation method,
asymptotic midpoint mixup. The method generates augmented features by
interpolation but gradually moves them toward the midpoint of inter-class
feature pairs. As a result, the method induces two effects: 1) balancing the
margin for all classes and 2) only moderately broadening the margin until it
holds maximal confidence. We empirically analyze the collapse effects by
measuring alignment and uniformity with visualizing representations. Then, we
validate the intra-class collapse effects in coarse-to-fine transfer learning
and the inter-class collapse effects in imbalanced learning on long-tailed
datasets. In both tasks, our method shows better performance than other
augmentation methods.

<p class="mathjax">This work delves into the expanding role of large language models (LLMs) in
generating artificial data. LLMs are increasingly employed to create a variety
of outputs, including annotations, preferences, instruction prompts, simulated
dialogues, and free text. As these forms of LLM-generated data often intersect
in their application, they exert mutual influence on each other and raise
significant concerns about the quality and diversity of the artificial data
incorporated into training cycles, leading to an artificial data ecosystem. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to aggregate various types
of LLM-generated text data, from more tightly constrained data like "task
labels" to more lightly constrained "free-form text". We then stress test the
quality and implications of LLM-generated artificial data, comparing it with
human data across various existing benchmarks. Despite artificial data's
capability to match human performance, this paper reveals significant hidden
disparities, especially in complex tasks where LLMs often miss the nuanced
understanding of intrinsic human-generated content. This study critically
examines diverse LLM-generated data and emphasizes the need for ethical
practices in data creation and when using LLMs. It highlights the LLMs'
shortcomings in replicating human traits and behaviors, underscoring the
importance of addressing biases and artifacts produced in LLM-generated content
for future research and development. All data and code are available on our
project page.

<p class="mathjax">Fairness in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) becomes a more and
more important concern as GCNs are adopted in many crucial applications.
Societal biases against sensitive groups may exist in many real world graphs.
GCNs trained on those graphs may be vulnerable to being affected by such
biases. In this paper, we adopt the well-known fairness notion of demographic
parity and tackle the challenge of training fair and accurate GCNs efficiently.
We present an in-depth analysis on how graph structure bias, node attribute
bias, and model parameters may affect the demographic parity of GCNs. Our
insights lead to FairSample, a framework that jointly mitigates the three types
of biases. We employ two intuitive strategies to rectify graph structures.
First, we inject edges across nodes that are in different sensitive groups but
similar in node features. Second, to enhance model fairness and retain model
quality, we develop a learnable neighbor sampling policy using reinforcement
learning. To address the bias in node features and model parameters, FairSample
is complemented by a regularization objective to optimize fairness.

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Adversarial
fine-tuning methods aim to enhance adversarial robustness through fine-tuning
the naturally pre-trained model in an adversarial training manner. However, we
identify that some latent features of adversarial samples are confused by
adversarial perturbation and lead to an unexpectedly increasing gap between
features in the last hidden layer of natural and adversarial samples. To
address this issue, we propose a disentanglement-based approach to explicitly
model and further remove the latent features that cause the feature gap.
Specifically, we introduce a feature disentangler to separate out the latent
features from the features of the adversarial samples, thereby boosting
robustness by eliminating the latent features. Besides, we align features in
the pre-trained model with features of adversarial samples in the fine-tuned
model, to further benefit from the features from natural samples without
confusion. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach surpasses existing adversarial fine-tuning methods and adversarial
training baselines.

<p class="mathjax">It has been known for a long time that the mutual information between the
input sequence and output of a binary symmetric channel (BSC) is upper bounded
by the mutual information between the same input sequence and the output of a
binary erasure channel (BEC) with the same capacity. Recently, Samorodintsky
discovered that one may also lower bound the BSC mutual information in terms of
the mutual information between the same input sequence and a more capable BEC.
In this paper, we strengthen Samordnitsky's bound for the special case where
the input to the channel is distributed uniformly over a linear code.
Furthermore, for a general (not necessarily binary) input distribution $P_X$
and channel $W_{Y|X}$, we derive a new lower bound on the mutual information
$I(X;Y^n)$ for $n$ transmissions of $X\sim P_X$ through the channel $W_{Y|X}$.

<p class="mathjax">Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of
renewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for
non-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and
vulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper
comprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island
systems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing
the role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent
electricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the
implementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration
rates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and
renewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage
services and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst
the available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for
further investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and
storage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates
indivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,
remuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the
literature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are
acknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on
wind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based
hybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion
technology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily
on battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island
grid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient
remunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be
financially secure.

of the growing digital landscape. With a surge in the use of digital technology
among children, there has been an increase in online safety harms, risks and
criminal incidents despite existing data protection and online privacy
protection regulations. Most general security and privacy assessment
approaches/standards focus mainly on protecting businesses from financial loss,
but there remains a notable gap in methodologies specifically designed to cater
to the unique challenges faced by children in the online space. To fill this
gap, we propose a safety risk assessment approach that focuses specifically on
children's online safety. The key novelty of our approach is providing an
explainable and systematic evaluation of potential safety weaknesses of online
services and applications based on precise automated mathematical reasoning.
This framework has the potential to assist online service and app designers
during the system design phase enabling them to proactively ensure
Safety-by-Design, as well as auditors and users to understand the risks posed
by existing services/apps, promoting further research on designing

<p class="mathjax">Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue, and detecting and
monitoring plastic litter is crucial to mitigate its impact. This paper
presents the methodology of mapping street-level litter, focusing primarily on
plastic waste and the location of trash bins. Our methodology involves
employing a deep learning technique to identify litter and trash bins from
street-level imagery taken by a camera mounted on a vehicle. Subsequently, we
utilized heat maps to visually represent the distribution of litter and trash
bins throughout cities. Additionally, we provide details about the creation of
an open-source dataset ("pLitterStreet") which was developed and utilized in
our approach. The dataset contains more than 13,000 fully annotated images
collected from vehicle-mounted cameras and includes bounding box labels. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our dataset, we tested four well known
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, YOLOv3,
and YOLOv5), achieving an average precision (AP) above 40%. While the results

<p class="mathjax">Symmetric multilevel diversity coding (SMDC) is a source coding problem where
the independent sources are ordered according to their importance. It was shown
that separately encoding independent sources (referred to as
``\textit{superposition coding}") is optimal. In this paper, we consider an
$(L,s)$ \textit{sliding secure} SMDC problem with security priority, where each
source $X_{\alpha}~(s\leq \alpha\leq L)$ is kept perfectly secure if no more
than $\alpha-s$ encoders are accessible. The reconstruction requirements of the
$L$ sources are the same as classical SMDC. A special case of an $(L,s)$
sliding secure SMDC problem that the first $s-1$ sources are constants is
called the $(L,s)$ \textit{multilevel secret sharing} problem. For $s=1$, the
two problems coincide, and we show that superposition coding is optimal. The
rate regions for the $(3,2)$ problems are characterized. It is shown that
superposition coding is suboptimal for both problems. The main idea that joint
encoding can reduce coding rates is that we can use the previous source
$X_{\alpha-1}$ as the secret key of $X_{\alpha}$. Based on this idea, we
propose a coding scheme that achieves the minimum sum rate of the general
$(L,s)$ multilevel secret sharing problem. Moreover, superposition coding of
the $s$ sets of sources $X_1$, $X_2$, $\cdots$, $X_{s-1}$, $(X_s, X_{s+1},
\cdots, X_L)$ achieves the minimum sum rate of the general sliding secure SMDC
problem.

<p class="mathjax">Simultaneously achieving 3D reconstruction and new view synthesis for indoor
environments has widespread applications but is technically very challenging.
State-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural functions can achieve
excellent 3D reconstruction results, but their performances on new view
synthesis can be unsatisfactory. The exciting development of neural radiance
field (NeRF) has revolutionized new view synthesis, however, NeRF-based models
can fail to reconstruct clean geometric surfaces. We have developed a dual
neural radiance field (Du-NeRF) to simultaneously achieve high-quality geometry
reconstruction and view rendering. Du-NeRF contains two geometric fields, one
derived from the SDF field to facilitate geometric reconstruction and the other
derived from the density field to boost new view synthesis. One of the
innovative features of Du-NeRF is that it decouples a view-independent
component from the density field and uses it as a label to supervise the
learning process of the SDF field. This reduces shape-radiance ambiguity and
enables geometry and color to benefit from each other during the learning
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Du-NeRF can significantly
improve the performance of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction for
indoor environments and it is particularly effective in constructing areas
containing fine geometries that do not obey multi-view color consistency.

<p class="mathjax">Code summarization aims to generate natural language descriptions of source
code, facilitating programmers to understand and maintain it rapidly. While
previous code summarization efforts have predominantly focused on method-level,
this paper studies file-level code summarization, which can assist programmers
in understanding and maintaining large source code projects. Unlike
method-level code summarization,file-level code summarization typically
involves long source code within a single file, which makes it challenging for
Transformer-based models to understand the code semantics for the maximum input
length of these models is difficult to set to a large number that can handle
long code input well, due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity
with the input sequence length. To address this challenge, we propose
SparseCoder, an identifier-aware sparse transformer for effectively handling
long code sequences. Specifically, the SparseCoder employs a sliding window
mechanism for self-attention to model short-term dependencies and leverages the
structure message of code to capture long-term dependencies among source code
identifiers by introducing two types of sparse attention patterns named global
and identifier attention. To evaluate the performance of SparseCoder, we
construct a new dataset FILE-CS for file-level code summarization in Python.
Experimental results show that our SparseCoder model achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared with other pre-trained models, including full
self-attention and sparse models. Additionally, our model has low memory
overhead and achieves comparable performance with models using full
self-attention mechanism.

<p class="mathjax">Lane detection is to determine the precise location and shape of lanes on the
road. Despite efforts made by current methods, it remains a challenging task
due to the complexity of real-world scenarios. Existing approaches, whether
proposal-based or keypoint-based, suffer from depicting lanes effectively and
efficiently. Proposal-based methods detect lanes by distinguishing and
regressing a collection of proposals in a streamlined top-down way, yet lack
sufficient flexibility in lane representation. Keypoint-based methods, on the
other hand, construct lanes flexibly from local descriptors, which typically
entail complicated post-processing. In this paper, we present a
"Sketch-and-Refine" paradigm that utilizes the merits of both keypoint-based
and proposal-based methods. The motivation is that local directions of lanes
are semantically simple and clear. At the "Sketch" stage, local directions of
keypoints can be easily estimated by fast convolutional layers. Then we can
build a set of lane proposals accordingly with moderate accuracy. At the
"Refine" stage, we further optimize these proposals via a novel Lane Segment
Association Module (LSAM), which allows adaptive lane segment adjustment. Last
but not least, we propose multi-level feature integration to enrich lane
feature representations more efficiently. Based on the proposed "Sketch and
Refine" paradigm, we propose a fast yet effective lane detector dubbed
"SRLane". Experiments show that our SRLane can run at a fast speed (i.e., 278
FPS) while yielding an F1 score of 78.9\%. The source code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Vector quantization is a fundamental operation for data compression and
vector search. To obtain high accuracy, multi-codebook methods increase the
rate by representing each vector using codewords across multiple codebooks.
Residual quantization (RQ) is one such method, which increases accuracy by
iteratively quantizing the error of the previous step. The error distribution
is dependent on previously selected codewords. This dependency is, however, not
accounted for in conventional RQ as it uses a generic codebook per quantization
step. In this paper, we propose QINCo, a neural RQ variant which predicts
specialized codebooks per vector using a neural network that is conditioned on
the approximation of the vector from previous steps. Experiments show that
QINCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several
datasets and code sizes. For example, QINCo achieves better nearest-neighbor
search accuracy using 12 bytes codes than other methods using 16 bytes on the
BigANN and Deep1B dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The successful portrayal of personality in digital characters improves
communication and immersion. Current research focuses on expressing personality
through modifying animations using heuristic rules or data-driven models. While
studies suggest motion style highly influences the apparent personality, the
role of appearance can be similarly essential. This work analyzes the influence
of movement and appearance on the perceived personality of short videos altered
by motion transfer networks. We label the personalities in conference video
clips with a user study to determine the samples that best represent the
Five-Factor model's high, neutral, and low traits. We alter these videos using
the Thin-Plate Spline Motion Model, utilizing the selected samples as the
source and driving inputs. We follow five different cases to study the
influence of motion and appearance on personality perception. Our comparative
study reveals that motion and appearance influence different factors: motion
strongly affects perceived extraversion, and appearance helps convey
agreeableness and neuroticism.

<p class="mathjax">Software metrics such as coverage and mutation scores have been extensively
explored for the automated quality assessment of test suites. While traditional
tools rely on such quantifiable software metrics, the field of self-driving
cars (SDCs) has primarily focused on simulation-based test case generation
using quality metrics such as the out-of-bound (OOB) parameter to determine if
a test case fails or passes. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
quality metric aligns with the human perception of the safety and realism of
SDCs, which are critical aspects in assessing SDC behavior. To address this
gap, we conducted an empirical study involving 50 participants to investigate
the factors that determine how humans perceive SDC test cases as safe, unsafe,
realistic, or unrealistic. To this aim, we developed a framework leveraging
virtual reality (VR) technologies, called SDC-Alabaster, to immerse the study
participants into the virtual environment of SDC simulators. Our findings
indicate that the human assessment of the safety and realism of failing and
passing test cases can vary based on different factors, such as the test's
complexity and the possibility of interacting with the SDC. Especially for the
assessment of realism, the participants' age as a confounding factor leads to a
different perception. This study highlights the need for more research on SDC
simulation testing quality metrics and the importance of human perception in
evaluating SDC behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Advances in natural language processing and understanding have led to a rapid
growth in the popularity of conversational user interfaces (CUIs). While CUIs
introduce novel benefits, they also yield risks that may exploit people's
trust. Although research looking at unethical design deployed through graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) established a thorough understanding of so-called dark
patterns, there is a need to continue this discourse within the CUI community
to understand potentially problematic interactions. Addressing this gap, we
interviewed 27 participants from three cohorts: researchers, practitioners, and
frequent users of CUIs. Applying thematic analysis, we construct five themes
reflecting each cohort's insights about ethical design challenges and introduce
the CUI Expectation Cycle, bridging system capabilities and user expectations
while considering each theme's ethical caveats. This research aims to inform
future development of CUIs to consider ethical constraints while adopting a
human-centred approach.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a method for achieving equilibrium in the ISING
Hamiltonian when confronted with unevenly distributed charges on an irregular
grid. Employing (Multi-Edge) QC-LDPC codes and the Boltzmann machine, our
approach involves dimensionally expanding the system, substituting charges with
circulants, and representing distances through circulant shifts. This results
in a systematic mapping of the charge system onto a space, transforming the
irregular grid into a uniform configuration, applicable to Torical and Circular
Hyperboloid Topologies. The paper covers fundamental definitions and notations
related to QC-LDPC Codes, Multi-Edge QC-LDPC codes, and the Boltzmann machine.
It explores the marginalization problem in code on the graph probabilistic
models for evaluating the partition function, encompassing exact and
approximate estimation techniques. Rigorous proof is provided for the
attainability of equilibrium states for the Boltzmann machine under Torical and
Circular Hyperboloid, paving the way for the application of our methodology.
Practical applications of our approach are investigated in Finite Geometry
QC-LDPC Codes, specifically in Material Science. The paper further explores its
effectiveness in the realm of Natural Language Processing Transformer Deep
Neural Networks, examining Generalized Repeat Accumulate Codes,
Spatially-Coupled and Cage-Graph QC-LDPC Codes. The versatile and impactful
nature of our topology-aware hardware-efficient quasi-cycle codes equilibrium
method is showcased across diverse scientific domains without the use of
specific section delineations.

<p class="mathjax">By designing the decentralized time-regularized (Zeno-free) event-triggered
strategies for the state-feedback control law, this paper considers the
stochastic stabilization of a class of networked control systems, where two
sources of randomness exist in multiple decentralized networks that operate
asynchronously and independently: the communication channels are constrained by
the stochastic network delays and also by Poisson pulsing denial-of-service
(Pp-DoS) attacks. The time delay in the network denotes the length from a
transmission instant to the corresponding update instant, and is supposed to be
a continuous random variable subject to certain continuous probability
distribution; while the attacks' cardinal number is a discrete random variable
supposed to be subject to Poisson distribution, so the inter-attack time, i.e.,
the time between two consecutive attack instants, is subject to exponential
distribution. The considered system is modeled as a stochastic hybrid
formalism, where the randomness enters through the jump map into the reset
value (the inter-attack time directly related) of each triggered strategy. By
only sampling/transmitting state measurements when needed and simultaneously by
taking the specific medium access protocols into account, the designed
event-triggered strategies are synthesized in a state-based and decentralized
form, which are robust (tolerable well) to stochastic network delays, under
different tradeoff-conditions between the minimum inter-event times, maximum
allowable delays (i.e., potentially tolerable delays) and the frequencies of
attacks. Using stochastic hybrid tools to combine attack-active parts with
attack-over parts, the designed triggered strategies, if designed well
according to the actual system needs, can tolerate (be resilient to) the Pp-DoS
attacks and stochastic network delays without jeopardizing the stability and
Zeno-freeness.

<p class="mathjax">Video restoration task aims to recover high-quality videos from low-quality
observations. This contains various important sub-tasks, such as video
denoising, deblurring and low-light enhancement, since video often faces
different types of degradation, such as blur, low light, and noise. Even worse,
these kinds of degradation could happen simultaneously when taking videos in
extreme environments. This poses significant challenges if one wants to remove
these artifacts at the same time. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to propose an efficient end-to-end video transformer approach
for the joint task of video deblurring, low-light enhancement, and denoising.
This work builds a novel multi-tier transformer where each tier uses a
different level of degraded video as a target to learn the features of video
effectively. Moreover, we carefully design a new tier-to-tier feature fusion
scheme to learn video features incrementally and accelerate the training
process with a suitable adaptive weighting scheme. We also provide a new
Multiscene-Lowlight-Blur-Noise (MLBN) dataset, which is generated according to
the characteristics of the joint task based on the RealBlur dataset and YouTube
videos to simulate realistic scenes as far as possible. We have conducted
extensive experiments, compared with many previous state-of-the-art methods, to
show the effectiveness of our approach clearly.

<p class="mathjax">Primal-dual safe RL methods commonly perform iterations between the primal
update of the policy and the dual update of the Lagrange Multiplier. Such a
training paradigm is highly susceptible to the error in cumulative cost
estimation since this estimation serves as the key bond connecting the primal
and dual update processes. We show that this problem causes significant
underestimation of cost when using off-policy methods, leading to the failure
to satisfy the safety constraint. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{conservative policy optimization}, which learns a policy in a
constraint-satisfying area by considering the uncertainty in cost estimation.
This improves constraint satisfaction but also potentially hinders reward
maximization. We then introduce \textit{local policy convexification} to help
eliminate such suboptimality by gradually reducing the estimation uncertainty.
We provide theoretical interpretations of the joint coupling effect of these
two ingredients and further verify them by extensive experiments. Results on
benchmark tasks show that our method not only achieves an asymptotic
performance comparable to state-of-the-art on-policy methods while using much
fewer samples, but also significantly reduces constraint violation during
training. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZifanWu/CAL.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral Imaging comprises excessive data consequently leading to
significant challenges for data processing, storage and transmission.
Compressive Sensing has been used in the field of Hyperspectral Imaging as a
technique to compress the large amount of data. This work addresses the
recovery of hyperspectral images 2.5x compressed. A comparative study in terms
of the accuracy and the performance of the convex FISTA/ADMM in addition to the
greedy gOMP/BIHT/CoSaMP recovery algorithms is presented. The results indicate
that the algorithms recover successfully the compressed data, yet the gOMP
algorithm achieves superior accuracy and faster recovery in comparison to the
other algorithms at the expense of high dependence on unknown sparsity level of
the data to recover.

<p class="mathjax">Session types are a typed approach to message-passing concurrency, where
types describe sequences of intended exchanges over channels. Session type
systems have been given strong logical foundations via Curry-Howard
correspondences with linear logic, a resource-aware logic that naturally
captures structured interactions. These logical foundations provide an elegant
framework to specify and (statically) verify message-passing processes.
<br />In this paper, we rigorously compare different type systems for concurrency
derived from the Curry-Howard correspondence between linear logic and session
types. We address the main divide between these type systems: the classical and
intuitionistic presentations of linear logic. Along the years, these
presentations have given rise to separate research strands on logical
foundations for concurrency; the differences between their derived type systems
have only been addressed informally.
<br />To formally assess these differences, we develop $\pi\mathsf{ULL}$, a session
type system that encompasses type systems derived from classical and
intuitionistic interpretations of linear logic. Based on a fragment of Girard's
Logic of Unity, $\pi\mathsf{ULL}$ provides a basic reference framework: we
compare existing session type systems by characterizing fragments of
$\pi\mathsf{ULL}$ that coincide with classical and intuitionistic formulations.
We analyze the significance of our characterizations by considering the
locality principle (enforced by intuitionistic interpretations but not by
classical ones) and forms of process composition induced by the
interpretations.

<p class="mathjax">Spatial transcriptomics (ST) captures gene expression within distinct regions
(i.e., windows) of a tissue slide. Traditional supervised learning frameworks
applied to model ST are constrained to predicting expression from slide image
windows for gene types seen during training, failing to generalize to unseen
gene types. To overcome this limitation, we propose a semantic guided network
(SGN), a pioneering zero-shot framework for predicting gene expression from
slide image windows. Considering a gene type can be described by functionality
and phenotype, we dynamically embed a gene type to a vector per its
functionality and phenotype, and employ this vector to project slide image
windows to gene expression in feature space, unleashing zero-shot expression
prediction for unseen gene types. The gene type functionality and phenotype are
queried with a carefully designed prompt from a pre-trained large language

zero-shot performance compared to past state-of-the-art supervised learning

<p class="mathjax">Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained relevance within
financial institutions by providing highly valuable insights into companies and
markets' financial documents. However, the landscape of the financial domain
presents extra challenges for NLP, due to the complexity of the texts and the
use of specific terminology. Generalist language models tend to fall short in
tasks specifically tailored for finance, even when using large language models
(LLMs) with great natural language understanding and generative capabilities.
This paper presents a study on LLM adaptation methods targeted at the financial
domain and with high emphasis on financial sentiment analysis. To this purpose,
two foundation models with less than 1.5B parameters have been adapted using a
wide range of strategies. We show that through careful fine-tuning on both
financial documents and instructions, these foundation models can be adapted to
the target domain. Moreover, we observe that small LLMs have comparable
performance to larger scale models, while being more efficient in terms of
parameters and data. In addition to the models, we show how to generate
artificial instructions through LLMs to augment the number of samples of the
instruction dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The Internet of Things (IoT) and massive IoT systems are key to
sixth-generation (6G) networks due to dense connectivity, ultra-reliability,
low latency, and high throughput. Artificial intelligence, including deep
learning and machine learning, offers solutions for optimizing and deploying
cutting-edge technologies for future radio communications. However, these
techniques are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to degraded
performance and erroneous predictions, outcomes unacceptable for ubiquitous
networks. This survey extensively addresses adversarial attacks and defense
methods in 6G network-assisted IoT systems. The theoretical background and
up-to-date research on adversarial attacks and defenses are discussed.
Furthermore, we provide Monte Carlo simulations to validate the effectiveness
of adversarial attacks compared to jamming attacks. Additionally, we examine
the vulnerability of 6G IoT systems by demonstrating attack strategies
applicable to key technologies, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces,
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)/cell-free massive MIMO,
satellites, the metaverse, and semantic communications. Finally, we outline the
challenges and future developments associated with adversarial attacks and
defenses in 6G IoT systems.

<p class="mathjax">Our work addresses the problem of egocentric human pose estimation from
downwards-facing cameras on head-mounted devices (HMD). This presents a
challenging scenario, as parts of the body often fall outside of the image or
are occluded. Previous solutions minimize this problem by using fish-eye camera
lenses to capture a wider view, but these can present hardware design issues.
They also predict 2D heat-maps per joint and lift them to 3D space to deal with
self-occlusions, but this requires large network architectures which are
impractical to deploy on resource-constrained HMDs. We predict pose from images
captured with conventional rectilinear camera lenses. This resolves hardware
design issues, but means body parts are often out of frame. As such, we
directly regress probabilistic joint rotations represented as matrix Fisher
distributions for a parameterized body model. This allows us to quantify pose
uncertainties and explain out-of-frame or occluded joints. This also removes
the need to compute 2D heat-maps and allows for simplified DNN architectures
which require less compute. Given the lack of egocentric datasets using
rectilinear camera lenses, we introduce the SynthEgo dataset, a synthetic
dataset with 60K stereo images containing high diversity of pose, shape,
clothing and skin tone. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for this
challenging configuration, reducing mean per-joint position error by 23%
overall and 58% for the lower body. Our architecture also has eight times fewer
parameters and runs twice as fast as the current state-of-the-art. Experiments
show that training on our synthetic dataset leads to good generalization to
real world images without fine-tuning.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is used in a wide range of applications such as
remote sensing, yet the transmission of the HS images by communication data
links becomes challenging due to the large number of spectral bands that the HS
images contain together with the limited data bandwidth available in real
applications. Compressive Sensing reduces the images by randomly subsampling
the spectral bands of each spatial pixel and then it performs the image
reconstruction of all the bands using recovery algorithms which impose sparsity
in a certain transform domain. Since the image pixels are not strictly sparse,
this work studies a data sparsification pre-processing stage prior to
compression to ensure the sparsity of the pixels. The sparsified images are
compressed $2.5\times$ and then recovered using the Generalized Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit algorithm (gOMP) characterized by high accuracy, low
computational requirements and fast convergence. The experiments are performed
in five conventional hyperspectral images where the effect of different
sparsification levels in the quality of the uncompressed as well as the
recovered images is studied. It is concluded that the gOMP algorithm
reconstructs the hyperspectral images with higher accuracy as well as faster
convergence when the pixels are highly sparsified and hence at the expense of
reducing the quality of the recovered images with respect to the original

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we harness the information-theoretic Privacy Funnel (PF) model
to develop a method for privacy-preserving representation learning using an
end-to-end training framework. We rigorously address the trade-off between
obfuscation and utility. Both are quantified through the logarithmic loss, a
measure also recognized as self-information loss. This exploration deepens the
interplay between information-theoretic privacy and representation learning,
offering substantive insights into data protection mechanisms for both
discriminative and generative models. Importantly, we apply our model to
state-of-the-art face recognition systems. The model demonstrates adaptability
across diverse inputs, from raw facial images to both derived or refined
embeddings, and is competent in tasks such as classification, reconstruction,
and generation.

its dimension, which allows us to give a partial classification of these codes.

providing the exact amount of nonequivalent such codes. We also prove the
existence of several families of infinite such nonlinear

equivalent to any other constructed

<p class="mathjax">Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to enable deep neural
networks to learn new tasks incrementally from a small number of labeled
samples without forgetting previously learned tasks, closely mimicking human
learning patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Prompt
Learning for FSCIL (PL-FSCIL), which harnesses the power of prompts in
conjunction with a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model to address the
challenges of FSCIL effectively. Our work pioneers the use of visual prompts in
FSCIL, which is characterized by its notable simplicity. PL-FSCIL consists of
two distinct prompts: the Domain Prompt and the FSCIL Prompt. Both are vectors
that augment the model by embedding themselves into the attention layer of the
ViT model. Specifically, the Domain Prompt assists the ViT model in adapting to
new data domains. The task-specific FSCIL Prompt, coupled with a prototype
classifier, amplifies the model's ability to effectively handle FSCIL tasks. We
validate the efficacy of PL-FSCIL on widely used benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-100 and CUB-200. The results showcase competitive performance,
underscoring its promising potential for real-world applications where
high-quality data is often scarce. The source code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we study the expressivity of scalar, Markovian reward
functions in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and identify several limitations to
what they can express. Specifically, we look at three classes of RL tasks;
multi-objective RL, risk-sensitive RL, and modal RL. For each class, we derive
necessary and sufficient conditions that describe when a problem in this class
can be expressed using a scalar, Markovian reward. Moreover, we find that
scalar, Markovian rewards are unable to express most of the instances in each
of these three classes. We thereby contribute to a more complete understanding
of what standard reward functions can and cannot express. In addition to this,
we also call attention to modal problems as a new class of problems, since they
have so far not been given any systematic treatment in the RL literature. We
also briefly outline some approaches for solving some of the problems we
discuss, by means of bespoke RL algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Previous work has shown that one can often greatly speed up static analysis
by computing data flows not for every edge in the program's control-flow graph
but instead only along definition-use chains. This yields a so-called sparse
static analysis. Recent work on SparseDroid has shown that specifically taint
analysis can be "sparsified" with extraordinary effectiveness because the taint
state of one variable does not depend on those of others. This allows one to
soundly omit more flow-function computations than in the general case.
<br />In this work, we now assess whether this result carries over to the more
generic setting of so-called Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE)
problems. Opposed to taint analysis, IDE comprises distributive problems with
large or even infinitely broad domains, such as typestate analysis or linear
constant propagation. Specifically, this paper presents Sparse IDE, a framework
that realizes sparsification for any static analysis that fits the IDE
framework.
<br />We implement Sparse IDE in SparseHeros, as an extension to the popular Heros
IDE solver, and evaluate its performance on real-world Java libraries by
comparing it to the baseline IDE algorithm. To this end, we design, implement
and evaluate a linear constant propagation analysis client on top of
SparseHeros. Our experiments show that, although IDE analyses can only be
sparsified with respect to symbols and not (numeric) values, Sparse IDE can
nonetheless yield significantly lower runtimes and often also memory
consumptions compared to the original IDE.

<p class="mathjax">The Fr\'echet distance is a popular distance measure for curves. Computing
the Fr\'echet distance between two polygonal curves of $n$ vertices takes
roughly quadratic time, and conditional lower bounds suggest that even
approximating to within a factor $3$ cannot be done in strongly-subquadratic
time, even in one dimension. The current best approximation algorithms present
trade-offs between approximation quality and running time. Recently, van der
Horst $\textit{et al.}$ (SODA, 2023) presented an $O((n^2 / \alpha) \log^3 n)$
time $\alpha$-approximate algorithm for curves in arbitrary dimensions, for any
$\alpha \in [1, n]$. Our main contribution is an approximation algorithm for
curves in one dimension, with a significantly faster running time of $O(n
\log^3 n + (n^2 / \alpha^3) \log^2 n \log \log n)$. Additionally, we give an
algorithm for curves in arbitrary dimensions that improves upon the
state-of-the-art running time by a logarithmic factor, to $O((n^2 / \alpha)
\log^2 n)$. Both of our algorithms rely on a linear-time simplification
procedure that in one dimension reduces the complexity of the reachable free
space to $O(n^2 / \alpha)$ without making sacrifices in the asymptotic
approximation factor.

<p class="mathjax">In the context of journalism, the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented
challenges, necessitating rapid adaptations in newsrooms. Data journalism
emerged as a pivotal approach for effectively conveying complex information to
the public. Here, we show the profound impact of COVID-19 on data journalism,
revealing a surge in data-driven publications and heightened collaboration
between data and science journalists. Employing a quantitative methodology,
including negative binomial regression and Relational hyperevent models (RHEM),
on byline data of articles co-authored by data journalists, we comprehensively
analyze data journalism outputs, authorship trends, and collaboration networks
to address five key research questions.
<br />The findings reveal a significant increase in data journalistic pieces during
and after the pandemic, in particular with a rise in publications within
scientific departments. Collaborative efforts among data and science
journalists intensified, evident through increased authorship and co-authorship
trends. Prior common authorship experiences somewhat influenced the likelihood
of future co-authorships, underscoring the importance of building collaborative
communities of practice.
<br />These quantitative insights provide an understanding of the transformational
role of data journalism during COVID-19, contributing to the growing body of
literature in computational communication science and journalism practice.

<p class="mathjax">We present a numerical discretisation of the coupled moment systems,
previously introduced in Dahm and Helzel, which approximate the kinetic
multi-scale model by Helzel and Tzavaras for sedimentation in suspensions of
rod-like particles for a two-dimensional flow problem and a shear flow problem.
We use a splitting ansatz which, during each time step, separately computes the
update of the macroscopic flow equation and of the moment system. The proof of
the hyperbolicity of the moment systems in \cite{Dahm} suggests solving the
moment systems with standard numerical methods for hyperbolic problems, like
LeVeque's Wave Propagation Algorithm \cite{LeV}. The number of moment equations
used in the hyperbolic moment system can be adapted to locally varying flow
features. An error analysis is proposed, which compares the approximation with
$2N+1$ moment equations to an approximation with $2N+3$ moment equations. This
analysis suggests an error indicator which can be computed from the numerical
approximation of the moment system with $2N+1$ moment equations.
<br />In order to use moment approximations with a different number of
<br />moment equations in different parts of the computational domain, we consider
an interface coupling of moment systems with different resolution. Finally, we
derive a conservative high-resolution Wave Propagation Algorithm for solving
moment systems with different numbers of moment equations.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have established great success in the general
domain of natural language processing. Their emerging task generalization and
free-form dialogue capabilities can greatly help to design Chemical General
Intelligence (CGI) to assist real-world research in chemistry. However, the
existence of specialized language and knowledge in the field of chemistry, such
as the highly informative SMILES notation, hinders the performance of
general-domain LLMs in chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, the first
LLM towards CGI. ChemDFM-13B is trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature,
textbooks, and instructions as well as various data from the general domain.
Therefore, it can store, understand, and reason over chemical knowledge and
languages while still possessing advanced free-form language comprehension
capabilities. Extensive quantitative evaluation shows that ChemDFM can
significantly outperform the representative open-sourced LLMs. Moreover,
ChemDFM can also surpass GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite
the significant size difference. Further qualitative evaluations demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of ChemDFM in real-world research scenarios.
We will open-source the ChemDFM model soon.

<p class="mathjax">Due to an ever-increasing number of participants and new areas of
application, the demands on mobile communications systems are continually
increasing. In order to deliver higher data rates, enable mobility and
guarantee QoS requirements of subscribers, these systems and the protocols used
are becoming more complex. By using higher frequency spectrums, cells become
smaller and more base stations have to be deployed. This leads to an increased
number of handovers of user equipments between base stations in order to enable
mobility, resulting in potentially more frequent radio link failures and rate
reduction. The persistent switching between the same base stations, commonly
referred to as "ping-pong", leads to a consistent reduction of data rates. In
this work, we propose a method for handover optimization by using proximal
policy optimization in mobile communications to learn an adaptive handover
protocol. The resulting agent is highly flexible regarding different travelling
speeds of user equipments, while outperforming the standard 5G NR handover
protocol by 3GPP in terms of average data rate and number of radio link
failures. Furthermore, the design of the proposed environment demonstrates
remarkable accuracy, ensuring a fair comparison with the standard 3GPP
protocol.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of allocating indivisible resources under the
connectivity constraints of a graph $G$. This model, initially introduced by
Bouveret et al. (published in IJCAI, 2017), effectively encompasses a diverse
array of scenarios characterized by spatial or temporal limitations, including
the division of land plots and the allocation of time plots. In this paper, we
introduce a novel fairness concept that integrates local comparisons within the
social network formed by a connected allocation of the item graph. Our
particular focus is to achieve pairwise-maximin fair share (PMMS) among the
"neighbors" within this network. For any underlying graph structure, we show
that a connected allocation that maximizes Nash welfare guarantees a
$(1/2)$-PMMS fairness. Moreover, for two agents, we establish that a
$(3/4)$-PMMS allocation can be efficiently computed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that for three agents and the items aligned on a path, a PMMS
allocation is always attainable and can be computed in polynomial time. Lastly,
when agents have identical additive utilities, we present a
pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for a $(3/4)$-PMMS allocation, irrespective of
the underlying graph $G$. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm
for obtaining a PMMS allocation when $G$ is a tree.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores a specific sub-task of cross-modal music retrieval. We
consider the delicate task of retrieving a performance or rendition of a
musical piece based on a description of its style, expressive character, or
emotion from a set of different performances of the same piece. We observe that
a general purpose cross-modal system trained to learn a common text-audio
embedding space does not yield optimal results for this task. By introducing
two changes -- one each to the text encoder and the audio encoder -- we
demonstrate improved performance on a dataset of piano performances and
associated free-text descriptions. On the text side, we use emotion-enriched
word embeddings (EWE) and on the audio side, we extract mid-level perceptual
features instead of generic audio embeddings. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of mid-level perceptual features learnt from music and emotion
enriched word embeddings learnt from emotion-labelled text in capturing musical
expression in a cross-modal setting. Additionally, our interpretable mid-level
features provide a route for introducing explainability in the retrieval and
downstream recommendation processes.

<p class="mathjax">Text-driven 3D scene editing has gained significant attention owing to its
convenience and user-friendliness. However, existing methods still lack
accurate control of the specified appearance and location of the editing result
due to the inherent limitations of the text description. To this end, we
propose a 3D scene editing framework, TIPEditor, that accepts both text and
image prompts and a 3D bounding box to specify the editing region. With the
image prompt, users can conveniently specify the detailed appearance/style of
the target content in complement to the text description, enabling accurate
control of the appearance. Specifically, TIP-Editor employs a stepwise 2D
personalization strategy to better learn the representation of the existing
scene and the reference image, in which a localization loss is proposed to
encourage correct object placement as specified by the bounding box.
Additionally, TIPEditor utilizes explicit and flexible 3D Gaussian splatting as
the 3D representation to facilitate local editing while keeping the background
unchanged. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that TIP-Editor conducts
accurate editing following the text and image prompts in the specified bounding
box region, consistently outperforming the baselines in editing quality, and
the alignment to the prompts, qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Are we heading for an iceberg with the current testing of machine vision?
This work delves into the landscape of Machine Vision (MV) testing, which is
heavily required in Highly Automated Driving (HAD) systems. Utilizing the
metaphorical notion of navigating towards an iceberg, we discuss the potential
shortcomings concealed within current testing strategies. We emphasize the
urgent need for a deeper understanding of how to deal with the opaque functions
of MV in development processes. As overlooked considerations can cost lives.
Our main contribution is the hierarchical level model, which we call
Granularity Grades. The model encourages a refined exploration of the
multi-scaled depths of understanding about the circumstances of environments in
which MV is intended to operate. This model aims to provide a holistic overview
of all entities that may impact MV functions, ranging from relations of
individual entities like object attributes to entire environmental scenes. The
application of our model delivers a structured exploration of entities in a
specific domain, their relationships and assigning results of a MV-under-test
to construct an entity-relationship graph. Through clustering patterns of
relations in the graph general MV deficits are arguable. In Summary, our work
contributes to a more nuanced and systematized identification of deficits of a
MV test object in correlation to holistic circumstances in HAD operating
domains.

<p class="mathjax">Real-world text can be damaged by corrosion issues caused by environmental or
human factors, which hinder the preservation of the complete styles of texts,
e.g., texture and structure. These corrosion issues, such as graffiti signs and
incomplete signatures, bring difficulties in understanding the texts, thereby
posing significant challenges to downstream applications, e.g., scene text
recognition and signature identification. Notably, current inpainting
techniques often fail to adequately address this problem and have difficulties
restoring accurate text images along with reasonable and consistent styles.
Formulating this as an open problem of text image inpainting, this paper aims
to build a benchmark to facilitate its study. In doing so, we establish two
specific text inpainting datasets which contain scene text images and
handwritten text images, respectively. Each of them includes images revamped by
real-life and synthetic datasets, featuring pairs of original images, corrupted
images, and other assistant information. On top of the datasets, we further
develop a novel neural framework, Global Structure-guided Diffusion Model
(GSDM), as a potential solution. Leveraging the global structure of the text as
a prior, the proposed GSDM develops an efficient diffusion model to recover
clean texts. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by thorough empirical
study, including a substantial boost in both recognition accuracy and image
quality. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of our method but
also underscore its potential to enhance the broader field of text image
understanding and processing. Code and datasets are available at:

settings of coherent differentiation introduced recently, which shows that the
basic ideas of differential linear logic and of the differential
lambda-calculus are compatible with determinism. Indeed, due to the Leibniz
rule of the differential calculus, differential linear logic and the
differential lambda-calculus feature an operation of addition of proofs or
terms operationally interpreted as a strong form of nondeterminism. The main
idea of coherent differentiation is that these sums can be controlled and kept
in the realm of determinism by means of a notion of summability, upon enforcing
summability restrictions on the derivatives which can be written in the models

<p class="mathjax">Driver Action Recognition (DAR) is crucial in vehicle cabin monitoring
systems. In real-world applications, it is common for vehicle cabins to be
equipped with cameras featuring different modalities. However, multi-modality
fusion strategies for the DAR task within car cabins have rarely been studied.
In this paper, we propose a novel yet efficient multi-modality driver action
recognition method based on dual feature shift, named DFS. DFS first integrates
complementary features across modalities by performing modality feature
interaction. Meanwhile, DFS achieves the neighbour feature propagation within
single modalities, by feature shifting among temporal frames. To learn common
patterns and improve model efficiency, DFS shares feature extracting stages
among multiple modalities. Extensive experiments have been carried out to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed DFS model on the Drive\&amp;Act dataset.
The results demonstrate that DFS achieves good performance and improves the
efficiency of multi-modality driver action recognition.

<p class="mathjax">Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as one of data science's most
transformative and influential domains. However, the widespread adoption of ML
introduces privacy-related concerns owing to the increasing number of malicious
attacks targeting ML models. To address these concerns, Privacy-Preserving
Machine Learning (PPML) methods have been introduced to safeguard the privacy
and security of ML models. One such approach is the use of Homomorphic
Encryption (HE). However, the significant drawbacks and inefficiencies of
traditional HE render it impractical for highly scalable scenarios.
Fortunately, a modern cryptographic scheme, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption
(HHE), has recently emerged, combining the strengths of symmetric cryptography
and HE to surmount these challenges. Our work seeks to introduce HHE to ML by
designing a PPML scheme tailored for end devices. We leverage HHE as the
fundamental building block to enable secure learning of classification outcomes
over encrypted data, all while preserving the privacy of the input data and ML
model. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our construction by
developing and evaluating an HHE-based PPML application for classifying heart
disease based on sensitive ECG data. Notably, our evaluations revealed a slight
reduction in accuracy compared to inference on plaintext data. Additionally,
both the analyst and end devices experience minimal communication and
computation costs, underscoring the practical viability of our approach. The
successful integration of HHE into PPML provides a glimpse into a more secure
and privacy-conscious future for machine learning on relatively constrained end
devices.

<p class="mathjax">The recent surge in 3D data acquisition has spurred the development of
geometric deep learning models for point cloud processing, boosted by the
remarkable success of transformers in natural language processing. While point
cloud transformers (PTs) have achieved impressive results recently, their
quadratic scaling with respect to the point cloud size poses a significant
scalability challenge for real-world applications. To address this issue, we
propose the Adaptive Point Cloud Transformer (AdaPT), a standard PT model
augmented by an adaptive token selection mechanism. AdaPT dynamically reduces
the number of tokens during inference, enabling efficient processing of large
point clouds. Furthermore, we introduce a budget mechanism to flexibly adjust
the computational cost of the model at inference time without the need for
retraining or fine-tuning separate models. Our extensive experimental
evaluation on point cloud classification tasks demonstrates that AdaPT
significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining competitive
accuracy compared to standard PTs. The code for AdaPT is made publicly
available.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the rapid development of machine learning algorithms for domain
generalization (DG), there is no clear empirical evidence that the existing DG
algorithms outperform the classic empirical risk minimization (ERM) across
standard benchmarks. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate
whether there are benefits of DG algorithms over ERM through the lens of label
noise. Specifically, our finite-sample analysis reveals that label noise
exacerbates the effect of spurious correlations for ERM, undermining
generalization. Conversely, we illustrate that DG algorithms exhibit implicit
label-noise robustness during finite-sample training even when spurious
correlation is present. Such desirable property helps mitigate spurious
correlations and improve generalization in synthetic experiments. However,
additional comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets indicate
that label-noise robustness does not necessarily translate to better
performance compared to ERM. We conjecture that the failure mode of ERM arising
from spurious correlations may be less pronounced in practice.

<p class="mathjax">Organizations execute decisions within business processes on a daily basis
whilst having to take into account multiple stakeholders who might require
multiple point of views of the same process. Moreover, the complexity of the
information systems running these business processes is generally high as they
are linked to databases storing all the relevant data and aspects of the
processes. Given the presence of multiple objects within an information system
which support the processes in their enactment, decisions are naturally
influenced by both these perspectives, logged in object-centric process logs.
However, the discovery of such decisions from object-centric process logs is
not straightforward as it requires to correctly link the involved objects
whilst considering the sequential constraints that business processes impose as
well as correctly discovering what a decision actually does. This paper
proposes the first object-centric decision-mining algorithm called Integrated
Object-centric Decision Discovery Algorithm (IODDA). IODDA is able to discover
how a decision is structured as well as how a decision is made. Moreover, IODDA
is able to discover which activities and object types are involved in the
decision-making process. Next, IODDA is demonstrated with the first artificial
knowledge-intensive process logs whose log generators are provided to the
research community.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate a low-order robust numerical method for the
linear elasticity problem. The method is based on a Bernardi--Raugel-like
$\boldsymbol{H}(\mathrm{div})$-conforming method proposed first for the Stokes
flows in [Li and Rui, IMA J. Numer. Anal. {42} (2022) 3711--3734].Therein the
lowest-order $\boldsymbol{H}(\mathrm{div})$-conforming Raviart--Thomas space
($\boldsymbol{RT}_0$) was added to the classical conforming
$\boldsymbol{P}_1\times P_0$ pair to meet the inf-sup condition, while
preserving the divergence constraint and some important features of conforming
methods. Due to the inf-sup stability of {the} $\boldsymbol{P}_1\oplus
\boldsymbol{RT}_0\times P_0$ pair, a locking-free elasticity discretization
{with respect to} {the Lam\'{e} constant $\lambda$} can be naturally obtained.
Moreover, our scheme is gradient-robust for the pure and homogeneous
displacement boundary problem, that is, the discrete $\boldsymbol{H}^1$-norm of
the displacement is $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1})$ when the external body force is
a gradient field. We also consider the mixed displacement and stress boundary
problem, whose $\boldsymbol{P}_1\oplus \boldsymbol{RT}_0$ discretization should
be carefully designed due to a consistency error arising from the
$\boldsymbol{RT}_0$ part. We propose both symmetric and nonsymmetric schemes to
approximate the mixed boundary case. The optimal error estimates are derived
for the energy norm and/or $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our schemes.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMM) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The
growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this contex, we
propose a novel prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy inspired by human
memory strategy, namely Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction (MITP). Our
proposed method involves in two stages as in human memory strategy: the
acquiring stage, and the consolidation and activation stage. We utilize
temporal prompts on intermediate layers to imitate the acquiring stage,
leverage similarity-based prompt interaction to imitate memory consolidation,
and employ prompt generation strategy to imitate memory activation. The main
strength of our paper is that we interact the prompt vectors on intermediate
layers to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities, with
compressed trainable parameters and memory usage. We achieve competitive
results on several datasets with relatively small memory usage and 2.0M of
trainable parameters (about 1% of the pre-trained foundation model).

multi-modal sensor fused mapping system that builds on the differentiable
surface splatting to improve the mapping fidelity, quality, and structural
accuracy. Notably, this is also a novel form of tightly coupled map for
LiDAR-visual-inertial sensor fusion.
<br />This system leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and visual
data to capture the geometric structures of large-scale 3D scenes and restore
their visual surface information with high fidelity. The initial poses for
surface Gaussian scenes are obtained using a LiDAR-inertial system with
size-adaptive voxels. Then, we optimized and refined the Gaussians by
visual-derived photometric gradients to optimize the quality and density of
LiDAR measurements.
<br />Our method is compatible with various types of LiDAR, including solid-state
and mechanical LiDAR, supporting both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning
modes. bolstering structure construction through LiDAR and facilitating
real-time generation of photorealistic renderings across diverse LIV datasets.
It showcases notable resilience and versatility in generating real-time
photorealistic scenes potentially for digital twins and virtual reality while
also holding potential applicability in real-time SLAM and robotics domains.

<p class="mathjax">Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has proven effective in learning control
policies using robotic grippers, but much less practical for solving the
problem of grasping with dexterous hands -- especially on real robotic
platforms -- due to the high dimensionality of the problem. In this work, we
focus on the multi-fingered grasping task with the anthropomorphic hand of the
iCub humanoid. We propose the RESidual learning with PREtrained CriTics
(RESPRECT) method that, starting from a policy pre-trained on a large set of
objects, can learn a residual policy to grasp a novel object in a fraction
($\sim 5 \times$ faster) of the timesteps required to train a policy from
scratch, without requiring any task demonstration. To our knowledge, this is
the first Residual Reinforcement Learning (RRL) approach that learns a residual
policy on top of another policy pre-trained with DRL. We exploit some
components of the pre-trained policy during residual learning that further
speed-up the training. We benchmark our results in the iCub simulated
environment, and we show that RESPRECT can be effectively used to learn a
multi-fingered grasping policy on the real iCub robot. The code to reproduce
the experiments is released together with the paper with an open source
license.

<p class="mathjax">Active soft bodies can affect their shape through an internal actuation
mechanism that induces a deformation. Similar to recent work, this paper
utilizes a differentiable, quasi-static, and physics-based simulation layer to
optimize for actuation signals parameterized by neural networks. Our key
contribution is a general and implicit formulation to control active soft
bodies by defining a function that enables a continuous mapping from a spatial
point in the material space to the actuation value. This property allows us to
capture the signal's dominant frequencies, making the method discretization
agnostic and widely applicable. We extend our implicit model to mandible
kinematics for the particular case of facial animation and show that we can
reliably reproduce facial expressions captured with high-quality capture
systems. We apply the method to volumetric soft bodies, human poses, and facial
expressions, demonstrating artist-friendly properties, such as simple control
over the latent space and resolution invariance at test time.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) garner significant attention for their
unprecedented performance, leading to an increasing number of researches
evaluating LLMs. However, these evaluation benchmarks are limited to assessing
the instruction-following capabilities, overlooking the fundamental abilities
that emerge during the pre-training stage. Previous subjective evaluation
methods mainly reply on scoring by API models. However, in the absence of
references, large models have shown limited ability to discern subtle
differences. To bridge the gap, we propose F-Eval, a bilingual evaluation
benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities, including expression,
commonsense and logic. The tasks in F-Eval include multi-choice objective
tasks, open-ended objective tasks, reference-based subjective tasks and
reference-free subjective tasks. For reference-free subjective tasks, we devise
new evaluation methods, serving as alternatives to scoring by API models. We
conduct evaluations on 13 advanced LLMs. Results show that our evaluation
methods show higher correlation coefficients and larger distinction than other
evaluators. Additionally, we discuss the influence of different model sizes,
dimensions, and normalization methods. We anticipate that F-Eval will
facilitate the study of LLMs' fundamental abilities.

<p class="mathjax">The vanilla Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) uses a low-pass filter to
extract low-frequency signals from graph topology, which may lead to the
over-smoothing problem when GCN goes deep. To this end, various methods have
been proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter
(e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these
methods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute
space, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs,
especially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a
cross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency
information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces.
Specifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that
can be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel
ridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a
Mercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for
combining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency
information. Finally, we derive the cross-space filter via an effective
multiple-kernel learning strategy, which unifies the attribute-based high-pass
filter and the topology-based low-pass filter. This helps to address the
over-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CSF not only successfully alleviates the over-smoothing
problem but also promotes the effectiveness of the node classification task.

<p class="mathjax">Motion prediction for intelligent vehicles typically focuses on estimating
the most probable future evolutions of a traffic scenario. Estimating the gap
acceptance, i.e., whether a vehicle merges or crosses before another vehicle
with the right of way, is often handled implicitly in the prediction. However,
an infrastructure-based maneuver planning can assign artificial priorities
between cooperative vehicles, so it needs to evaluate many more potential
scenarios. Additionally, the prediction horizon has to be long enough to assess
the impact of a maneuver. We, therefore, present a novel long-term prediction
approach handling the gap acceptance estimation and the velocity prediction in
two separate stages. Thereby, the behavior of regular vehicles as well as
priority assignments of cooperative vehicles can be considered. We train both
stages on real-world traffic observations to achieve realistic prediction
results. Our method has a competitive accuracy and is fast enough to predict a
multitude of scenarios in a short time, making it suitable to be used in a
maneuver planning framework.

<p class="mathjax">We study the discrete bin covering problem where a multiset of items from a
fixed set $S \subseteq (0,1]$ must be split into disjoint subsets while
maximizing the number of subsets whose contents sum to at least $1$. We study
the online discrete variant, where $S$ is finite, and items arrive
sequentially. In the purely online setting, we show that the competitive ratios
of best deterministic (and randomized) algorithms converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ for
large $S$, similar to the continuous setting. Therefore, we consider the
problem under the prediction setting, where algorithms may access a vector of
frequencies predicting the frequency of items of each size in the instance. In
this setting, we introduce a family of online algorithms that perform
near-optimally when the predictions are correct. Further, we introduce a second
family of more robust algorithms that presents a tradeoff between the
performance guarantees when the predictions are perfect and when predictions
are adversarial. Finally, we consider a stochastic setting where items are
drawn independently from any fixed but unknown distribution of $S$. Using
results from the PAC-learnability of probabilities in discrete distributions,
we also introduce a purely online algorithm whose average-case performance is
near-optimal with high probability for all finite sets $S$ and all
distributions of $S$.

<p class="mathjax">Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor that is used to communicate the
consequences of poor software development practices to non-technical
stakeholders. In recent years, it has gained significant attention in agile
software development (ASD). The purpose of this study is to analyze and
synthesize the state of the art of TD, and its causes, consequences, and
management strategies in the context of ASD. Using a systematic literature
review (SLR), 38 primary studies, out of 346 studies, were identified and
analyzed. We found five research areas of interest related to the literature of
TD in ASD. Among those areas, managing TD in ASD received the highest
attention, followed by architecture in ASD and its relationship with TD. In
addition, eight categories regarding the causes and five categories regarding
the consequences of incurring TD in ASD were identified. Focus on quick
delivery and architectural and design issues were the most popular causes of
incurring TD in ASD. Reduced productivity, system degradation and increased
maintenance cost were identified as significant consequences of incurring TD in
ASD. Additionally, we found 12 strategies for managing TD in the context of
ASD, out of which refactoring and enhancing the visibility of TD were the most
significant. The results of this study provide a structured synthesis of TD and
its management in the context of ASD as well as potential research areas for
further investigation.

<p class="mathjax">Applications in robotics or other size-, weight- and power-constrained
autonomous systems at the edge often require real-time and low-energy solutions
to large optimization problems. Event-based and memory-integrated neuromorphic
architectures promise to solve such optimization problems with superior energy
efficiency and performance compared to conventional von Neumann architectures.
Here, we present a method to solve convex continuous optimization problems with
quadratic cost functions and linear constraints on Intel's scalable
neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. When applied to model predictive control
(MPC) problems for the quadruped robotic platform ANYmal, this method achieves
over two orders of magnitude reduction in combined energy-delay product
compared to the state-of-the-art solver, OSQP, on (edge) CPUs and GPUs with
solution times under ten milliseconds for various problem sizes. These results
demonstrate the benefit of non-von-Neumann architectures for robotic control
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based vulnerability detection systems
have achieved remarkable success. However, the lack of explainability poses a
critical challenge to deploy black-box models in security-related domains. For
this reason, several approaches have been proposed to explain the decision
logic of the detection model by providing a set of crucial statements
positively contributing to its predictions. Unfortunately, due to the
weakly-robust detection models and suboptimal explanation strategy, they have
the danger of revealing spurious correlations and redundancy issue.
<br />In this paper, we propose Coca, a general framework aiming to 1) enhance the
robustness of existing GNN-based vulnerability detection models to avoid
spurious explanations; and 2) provide both concise and effective explanations
to reason about the detected vulnerabilities. \sysname consists of two core
parts referred to as Trainer and Explainer. The former aims to train a
detection model which is robust to random perturbation based on combinatorial
contrastive learning, while the latter builds an explainer to derive crucial
code statements that are most decisive to the detected vulnerability via
dual-view causal inference as explanations. We apply Coca over three typical
GNN-based vulnerability detectors. Experimental results show that Coca can
effectively mitigate the spurious correlation issue, and provide more useful
high-quality explanations.

<p class="mathjax">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems represent a significant
advancement over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG systems enhance
their generation ability by incorporating external data retrieved through an
Information Retrieval (IR) phase, overcoming the limitations of standard LLMs,
which are restricted to their pre-trained knowledge and limited context window.
Most research in this area has predominantly concentrated on the generative
aspect of LLMs within RAG systems. Our study fills this gap by thoroughly and
critically analyzing the influence of IR components on RAG systems. This paper
analyzes which characteristics a retriever should possess for an effective
RAG's prompt formulation, focusing on the type of documents that should be
retrieved. We evaluate various elements, such as the relevance of the documents
to the prompt, their position, and the number included in the context. Our
findings reveal, among other insights, that including irrelevant documents can
unexpectedly enhance performance by more than 30% in accuracy, contradicting
our initial assumption of diminished quality. These findings call for
developing specialized approaches tailored to the specific demands of
integrating retrieval with language generation models and pave the way for
future research. These results underscore the need for developing specialized
strategies to integrate retrieval with language generation models, thereby
laying the groundwork for future research in this field.

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technology that has garnered attention to overcome
the drawbacks of conventional CMOS-based technologies. However, such
technologies must be evaluated before deployment under real workloads and
architecture. But there is a lack of available open-source STT-RAM-based system
evaluation framework, which hampers research and experimentation and impacts
the adoption of STT- RAM in a system. This paper proposes a novel, extendable
STT-RAM memory controller design integrated inside the gem5 simulator. Our
framework enables understanding various aspects of STT-RAM, i.e., power, delay,
clock cycles, energy, and system throughput. We will open-source our HOPE
framework, which will fuel research and aid in accelerating the development of
future system architectures based on STT-RAM. It will also facilitate the user
for further tool enhancement.

<p class="mathjax">Disaggregated evaluation is a central task in AI fairness assessment, with
the goal to measure an AI system's performance across different subgroups
defined by combinations of demographic or other sensitive attributes. The
standard approach is to stratify the evaluation data across subgroups and
compute performance metrics separately for each group. However, even for
moderately-sized evaluation datasets, sample sizes quickly get small once
considering intersectional subgroups, which greatly limits the extent to which
intersectional groups are considered in many disaggregated evaluations. In this
work, we introduce a structured regression approach to disaggregated evaluation
that we demonstrate can yield reliable system performance estimates even for
very small subgroups. We also provide corresponding inference strategies for
constructing confidence intervals and explore how goodness-of-fit testing can
yield insight into the structure of fairness-related harms experienced by
intersectional groups. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available
datasets, and several variants of semi-synthetic data. The results show that
our method is considerably more accurate than the standard approach, especially
for small subgroups, and goodness-of-fit testing helps identify the key factors
that drive differences in performance.

domain alongside finite element approximations in the spatial domain, and
adaptivity is driven by recently proposed parametric and spatial a posteriori

estimates to zero. Thus, our analysis covers problems with affine and nonaffine

<p class="mathjax">While vision transformers (ViTs) have shown great potential in computer
vision tasks, their intense computation and memory requirements pose challenges
for practical applications. Existing post-training quantization methods
leverage value redistribution or specialized quantizers to address the
non-normal distribution in ViTs. However, without considering the asymmetry in
activations and relying on hand-crafted settings, these methods often struggle
to maintain performance under low-bit quantization. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce SmoothQuant with bias term (SQ-b) to alleviate the
asymmetry issue and reduce the clamping loss. We also introduce optimal scaling
factor ratio search (OPT-m) to determine quantization parameters by a
data-dependent mechanism automatically. To further enhance the compressibility,
we incorporate the above-mentioned techniques and propose a mixed-precision
post-training quantization framework for vision transformers (MPTQ-ViT). We
develop greedy mixed-precision quantization (Greedy MP) to allocate layer-wise
bit-width considering both model performance and compressibility. Our
experiments on ViT, DeiT, and Swin demonstrate significant accuracy
improvements compared with SOTA on the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our
proposed methods achieve accuracy improvements ranging from 0.90% to 23.35% on
4-bit ViTs with single-precision and from 3.82% to 78.14% on 5-bit fully
quantized ViTs with mixed-precision.

approach may not fully encompass other significant aspects of a company. We
propose the utilization of a hybrid dataset that combines financial statements
with information about corporate restructuring behavior in order to construct
diverse machine learning models to predict bankruptcy. Utilizing a hybrid data
set provides a more comprehensive and holistic perspective on a company's
financial position and the dynamics of its business operations. The experiments
were carried out using publicly available records of all the files submitted by
small and medium-sized enterprises to Luxembourg Business Registers. We conduct
a comparative analysis of bankruptcy prediction using six machine learning
models. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the hybrid dataset. In
addition to the conventional testing set, we deliberately chose the timeframe
encompassing the years of the Covid-19 pandemic as an additional testing set in
order to evaluate the robustness of the models. The experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid data set can improve the performance of the model
by 4%-13% compared to a single source data set. We also identify suitable
models for predicting bankruptcy.

<p class="mathjax">The beverage industry is a typical food processing industry, accounts for
significant energy consumption, and has flexible demands. However, the
deployment of energy flexibility in the beverage industry is complex and
challenging. Furthermore, activation of energy flexibility from the whole
brewery industry is necessary to ensure grid stability. Therefore, this paper
assesses the energy flexibility potential of Denmark's brewery sector based on
a multi-agent-based simulation. 239 individual brewery facilities are
simulated, and each facility, as an agent, can interact with the energy system
market and make decisions based on its underlying parameters and operational
restrictions. The results show that the Danish breweries could save 1.56 % of
electricity costs annually while maintaining operational security and reducing
approximately 1745 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, medium-size breweries
could obtain higher relative benefits by providing energy flexibility,
especially those producing lager and ale. The result also shows that the
breweries' relative saving potential is electricity market-dependent.

<p class="mathjax">Isocontouring is one of the most widely used visualization techniques.
However, many popular contouring algorithms were created prior to the advent of
ubiquitous parallel approaches, such as multi-core, shared memory computing
systems. With increasing data sizes and computational loads, it is essential to
reimagine such algorithms to leverage the increased computing capabilities
available today. To this end we have redesigned the SurfaceNets algorithm, a
powerful technique which is often employed to isocontour non-continuous,
discrete, volumetric scalar fields such as segmentation label maps. Label maps
are ubiquitous to medical computing and biological analysis, used in
applications ranging from anatomical atlas creation to brain connectomics. This
novel Parallel SurfaceNets algorithm has been redesigned using concepts from
the high-performance Flying Edges continuous isocontouring algorrithm. It
consists of two basic steps, surface extraction followed by constrained
smoothing, parallelized over volume edges and employing a double-buffering
smoothing approach to guarantee determinism. The algorithm can extract and
smooth multiple segmented objects in a single execution, producing a polygonal
(triangular/quadrilateral) mesh with points and polygons fully shared between
neighboring objects. Performance is typically one to two orders of magnitude
faster than the current sequential algorithms for discrete isosurface
extraction on small core-count commodity CPU hardware. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm on five different datasets including human torso
and brain atlases, mouse brain segmentation, and electron microscopy
connectomics. The software is currently available under a permissive, open
source license in the VTK visualization system.

<p class="mathjax">Hybrid dynamical systems are ubiquitous as practical robotic applications
often involve both continuous states and discrete switchings. Safety is a
primary concern for hybrid robotic systems. Existing safety-critical control
approaches for hybrid systems are either computationally inefficient,
detrimental to system performance, or limited to small-scale systems. To amend
these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a learningenabled approach to
construct local Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee the safety of a
wide class of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems. The end result is a safe
neural CBFbased switching controller. Our approach is computationally
efficient, minimally invasive to any reference controller, and applicable to
large-scale systems. We empirically evaluate our framework and demonstrate its
efficacy and flexibility through two robotic examples including a
high-dimensional autonomous racing case, against other CBF-based approaches and
model predictive control.

<p class="mathjax">An increasing number of regulations propose the notion of AI audits as an
enforcement mechanism for achieving transparency and accountability for AI
systems. Despite some converging norms around various forms of AI auditing,
auditing for the purpose of compliance and assurance currently have little to
no agreed upon practices, procedures, taxonomies, and standards. We propose the
criterion audit as an operationalizable compliance and assurance external audit
framework. We model elements of this approach after financial auditing
practices, and argue that AI audits should similarly provide assurance to their
stakeholders about AI organizations' ability to govern their algorithms in ways
that mitigate harms and uphold human values. We discuss the necessary
conditions for the criterion audit, and provide a procedural blueprint for
performing an audit engagement in practice. We illustrate how this framework
can be adapted to current regulations by deriving the criteria on which bias
audits for hiring algorithms can be performed, as required by the recently
effective New York City Local Law 144 of 2021. We conclude by offering critical
discussion on the benefits, inherent limitations, and implementation challenges
of applying practices of the more mature financial auditing industry to AI
auditing where robust guardrails against quality assurance issues are only
starting to emerge. Our discussion as informed by experiences in performing
these audits in practice highlights the critical role that an audit ecosystem
plays in ensuring the effectiveness of such methodology.

at generating automatic patches for vulnerable programs. While numerous
techniques have been proposed for repairing classical programs, the realm of
quantum programming lacks a comparable automated repair technique. In this
initial exploration, we investigate the use of ChatGPT for quantum program
repair and evaluate its performance on Bugs4Q, a benchmark suite of quantum
program bugs. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of employing ChatGPT for
quantum program repair. Specifically, we assess ChatGPT's ability to address
bugs within the Bugs4Q benchmark, revealing its success in repairing 29 out of
38 bugs. This research represents a promising step towards automating the

presents new challenges for assessing their learning outcomes in project-based
learning (PBL). This paper introduces a co-design study to explore the
potential of students' AI usage data as a novel material for PBL assessment. We
conducted workshops with 18 college students, encouraging them to speculate an
alternative world where they could freely employ AI in PBL while needing to
report this process to assess their skills and contributions. Our workshops
yielded various scenarios of students' use of AI in PBL and ways of analyzing
these uses grounded by students' vision of education goal transformation. We
also found students with different attitudes toward AI exhibited distinct
preferences in how to analyze and understand the use of AI. Based on these
findings, we discuss future research opportunities on student-AI interactions
and understanding AI-enhanced learning.

<p class="mathjax">We present a real-time method for robust estimation of multiple instances of
geometric models from noisy data. Geometric models such as vanishing points,
planar homographies or fundamental matrices are essential for 3D scene
analysis. Previous approaches discover distinct model instances in an iterative
manner, thus limiting their potential for speedup via parallel computation. In
contrast, our method detects all model instances independently and in parallel.
A neural network segments the input data into clusters representing potential
model instances by predicting multiple sets of sample and inlier weights. Using
the predicted weights, we determine the model parameters for each potential
instance separately in a RANSAC-like fashion. We train the neural network via
task-specific loss functions, i.e. we do not require a ground-truth
segmentation of the input data. As suitable training data for homography and
fundamental matrix fitting is scarce, we additionally present two new synthetic
datasets. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on these as well as
multiple established datasets, with inference times as small as five
milliseconds per image.

worker tasks. However, only a few studies have explored the effects of
prolonged use of VR such as a study observing 16 participant working in VR and
a physical environment for one work-week each and reporting mainly on
subjective feedback. As a nuanced understanding of participants' behavior in VR
and how it evolves over time is still missing, we report on the results from an
analysis of 559 hours of video material obtained in this prior study. Among
other findings, we report that (1) the frequency of actions related to
adjusting the headset reduced by 46% and the frequency of actions related to
supporting the headset reduced by 42% over the five days; (2) the HMD was
removed 31% less frequently over the five days but for 41% longer periods; (3)
wearing an HMD is disruptive to normal patterns of eating and drinking, but not
to social interactions, such as talking. The combined findings in this work
demonstrate the value of long-term studies of deployed VR systems and can be

<p class="mathjax">Many important behavior changes are frictionful; they require individuals to
expend effort over a long period with little immediate gratification. Here, an
artificial intelligence (AI) agent can provide personalized interventions to
help individuals stick to their goals. In these settings, the AI agent must
personalize rapidly (before the individual disengages) and interpretably, to
help us understand the behavioral interventions. In this paper, we introduce
Behavior Model Reinforcement Learning (BMRL), a framework in which an AI agent
intervenes on the parameters of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) belonging to a
boundedly rational human agent. Our formulation of the human decision-maker as
a planning agent allows us to attribute undesirable human policies (ones that
do not lead to the goal) to their maladapted MDP parameters, such as an
extremely low discount factor. Furthermore, we propose a class of tractable
human models that captures fundamental behaviors in frictionful tasks.
Introducing a notion of MDP equivalence specific to BMRL, we theoretically and
empirically show that AI planning with our human models can lead to helpful
policies on a wide range of more complex, ground-truth humans.

mentions and retweets on Twitter, compared to men. While both professions are
dominated by many men and a high share of men-authored tweets, women are
mentioning and retweeting other women to a more extensive degree than their
male colleagues. Women data journalists also leveraged different sources than
men. In addition, we have found data journalists to be more inclusive towards
non-member sources in their network compared to political journalists.

<p class="mathjax">The classical Hertzian contact model establishes a monotonic correlation
between contact force and area. Here, we showed that the interplay between
local friction and structural instability can deliberately lead to
unconventional contact behavior when a soft elastic shell comes into contact
with a flat surface. The deviation from Hertzian contact first arises from
bending within the contact area, followed by the second transition induced by
buckling, resulting in a notable decrease in the contact area despite increased
contact force. Friction delays both transitions and introduces hysteresis
during unloading. However, a high amount of friction suppresses both buckling
and dissipation. Different contact regimes are discussed in terms of rolling
and sliding mechanisms, providing insights for tailoring contact behaviors in
soft shells.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized automated text
understanding and generation. The performance of these models relies on the
high number of parameters of the underlying neural architectures, which allows
LLMs to memorize part of the vast quantity of data seen during the training.
This paper investigates whether and to what extent general-purpose pre-trained
LLMs have memorized information from known ontologies. Our results show that
LLMs partially know ontologies: they can, and do indeed, memorize concepts from
ontologies mentioned in the text, but the level of memorization of their
concepts seems to vary proportionally to their popularity on the Web, the
primary source of their training material. We additionally propose new metrics
to estimate the degree of memorization of ontological information in LLMs by
measuring the consistency of the output produced across different prompt
repetitions, query languages, and degrees of determinism.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Single-Subject Design is used in several areas such as education
and biomedicine. However, no suited formal vocabulary exists for annotating the
detailed configuration and the results of this type of research studies with
the appropriate granularity for looking for information about them. Therefore,
the search for those study designs relies heavily on a syntactical search on
the abstract, keywords or full text of the publications about the study, which
entails some limitations. Objective: To present SSDOnt, a specific purpose
ontology for describing and annotating single-subject design studies, so that
complex questions can be asked about them afterwards. Methods: The ontology was
developed following the NeOn methodology. Once the requirements of the ontology
were defined, a formal model was described in a Description Logic and later
implemented in the ontology language OWL 2 DL. Results: We show how the
ontology provides a reference model with a suitable terminology for the
annotation and searching of single-subject design studies and their main
components, such as the phases, the intervention types, the outcomes and the
results. Some mappings with terms of related ontologies have been established.
We show as proof-of-concept that classes in the ontology can be easily extended
to annotate more precise information about specific interventions and outcomes
such as those related to autism. Moreover, we provide examples of some types of
queries that can be posed to the ontology. Conclusions: SSDOnt has achieved the
purpose of covering the descriptions of the domain of single-subject research
studies.

<p class="mathjax">Robotic coaches have been recently investigated to promote mental well-being
in various contexts such as workplaces and homes. With the widespread use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), HRI researchers are called to consider language
appropriateness when using such generated language for robotic mental
well-being coaches in the real world. Therefore, this paper presents the first
work that investigated the language appropriateness of robot mental well-being
coach in the workplace. To this end, we conducted an empirical study that
involved 17 employees who interacted over 4 weeks with a robotic mental
well-being coach equipped with LLM-based capabilities. After the study, we
individually interviewed them and we conducted a focus group of 1.5 hours with
11 of them. The focus group consisted of: i) an ice-breaking activity, ii)
evaluation of robotic coach language appropriateness in various scenarios, and
iii) listing shoulds and shouldn'ts for designing appropriate robotic coach
language for mental well-being. From our qualitative evaluation, we found that
a language-appropriate robotic coach should (1) ask deep questions which
explore feelings of the coachees, rather than superficial questions, (2)
express and show emotional and empathic understanding of the context, and (3)
not make any assumptions without clarifying with follow-up questions to avoid
bias and stereotyping. These results can inform the design of
language-appropriate robotic coach to promote mental well-being in real-world
contexts.

<p class="mathjax">To ensure that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively support user
productivity, they need to be adjusted. Existing Code Readability (CR) models
can guide this alignment. However, there are concerns about their relevance in
modern software engineering since they often miss the developers' notion of
readability and rely on outdated code. This research assesses existing Java CR
models for LLM adjustments, measuring the correlation between their and
developers' evaluations of AI-generated Java code. Using the Repertory Grid
Technique with 15 developers, we identified 12 key code aspects influencing CR
that were consequently assessed by 390 programmers when labeling 120
AI-generated snippets. Our findings indicate that when AI generates concise and
executable code, it is often considered readable by CR models and developers.
However, a limited correlation between these evaluations underscores the
importance of future research on learning objectives for adjusting LLMs and on
the aspects influencing CR evaluations included in predictive models.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the performance of point cloud models has been rapidly
improved. However, due to the limited amount of relevant explainability
studies, the unreliability and opacity of these black-box models may lead to
potential risks in applications where human lives are at stake, e.g. autonomous
driving or healthcare. This work proposes a DDPM-based point cloud global
explainability method (DAM) that leverages Point Diffusion Transformer (PDT), a
novel point-wise symmetric model, with dual-classifier guidance to generate
high-quality global explanations. In addition, an adapted path gradient
integration method for DAM is proposed, which not only provides a global
overview of the saliency maps for point cloud categories, but also sheds light
on how the attributions of the explanations vary during the generation process.
Extensive experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing ones in
terms of perceptibility, representativeness, and diversity, with a significant
reduction in generation time. Our code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">Predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) in billion-scale recommender systems
poses a long-standing challenge for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) due to the
overwhelming computational complexity involved in aggregating billions of
neighbors. To tackle this, GNN-based CTR models usually sample hundreds of
neighbors out of the billions to facilitate efficient online recommendations.
However, sampling only a small portion of neighbors results in a severe
sampling bias and the failure to encompass the full spectrum of user or item
behavioral patterns. To address this challenge, we name the conventional
user-item recommendation graph as "micro recommendation graph" and introduce a
more suitable MAcro Recommendation Graph (MAG) for billion-scale
recommendations. MAG resolves the computational complexity problems in the
infrastructure by reducing the node count from billions to hundreds.
Specifically, MAG groups micro nodes (users and items) with similar behavior
patterns to form macro nodes. Subsequently, we introduce tailored Macro Graph
Neural Networks (MacGNN) to aggregate information on a macro level and revise
the embeddings of macro nodes. MacGNN has already served Taobao's homepage feed
for two months, providing recommendations for over one billion users. Extensive
offline experiments on three public benchmark datasets and an industrial
dataset present that MacGNN significantly outperforms twelve CTR baselines
while remaining computationally efficient. Besides, online A/B tests confirm
MacGNN's superiority in billion-scale recommender systems.

<p class="mathjax">Macroeconomic factors have a critical impact on banking credit risk, which
cannot be directly controlled by banks, and therefore, there is a need for an
early credit risk warning system based on the macroeconomy. By comparing
different predictive models (traditional statistical and machine learning
algorithms), this study aims to examine the macroeconomic determinants impact
on the UK banking credit risk and assess the most accurate credit risk estimate
using predictive analytics. This study found that the variance-based
multi-split decision tree algorithm is the most precise predictive model with
interpretable, reliable, and robust results. Our model performance achieved 95%
accuracy and evidenced that unemployment and inflation rate are significant
credit risk predictors in the UK banking context. Our findings provided
valuable insights such as a positive association between credit risk and
inflation, the unemployment rate, and national savings, as well as a negative
relationship between credit risk and national debt, total trade deficit, and
national income. In addition, we empirically showed the relationship between
national savings and non-performing loans, thus proving the paradox of thrift.
These findings benefit the credit risk management team in monitoring the
macroeconomic factors thresholds and implementing critical reforms to mitigate
credit risk.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial training improves the robustness of neural networks against
adversarial attacks, albeit at the expense of the trade-off between standard
and robust generalization. To unveil the underlying factors driving this
phenomenon, we examine the layer-wise learning capabilities of neural networks
during the transition from a standard to an adversarial setting. Our empirical
findings demonstrate that selectively updating specific layers while preserving
others can substantially enhance the network's learning capacity. We therefore
propose CURE, a novel training framework that leverages a gradient prominence
criterion to perform selective conservation, updating, and revision of weights.
Importantly, CURE is designed to be dataset- and architecture-agnostic,
ensuring its applicability across various scenarios. It effectively tackles
both memorization and overfitting issues, thus enhancing the trade-off between
robustness and generalization and additionally, this training approach also
aids in mitigating "robust overfitting". Furthermore, our study provides
valuable insights into the mechanisms of selective adversarial training and
offers a promising avenue for future research.

<p class="mathjax">A method for generating unsupervised conditional mapping rules for
multi-inter-corridor transfer limits and their integration into unit commitment
through banding-switching is proposed in this paper. The method starts by using
Ant colony clustering(ACC) to identify different operating modes with renewable
energy penetration. For each sub-pattern, coupling inter-corridors are
determined using correlation coefficients. An algorithm for constructing
coupled inter-corridors' limits boundaries, employing grid partitioning, is
proposed to establish conditional mappings from sub-patterns to
multi-inter-corridor limits. Additionally, a banding matching model is
proposed, incorporating distance criteria and the Big-M method. It also
includes a limit-switching method based on Lagrange multipliers. Case studies
on the IEEE 39-node system illustrate the effectiveness of this method in
increasing consumption of renewable energy and reducing operational costs while
adhering to stability verification requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful approach to train neural networks to
learn new tasks quickly from limited data. Broad exposure to different tasks
leads to versatile representations enabling general problem solving. But, what
are the limits of meta-learning? In this work, we explore the potential of
amortizing the most powerful universal predictor, namely Solomonoff Induction
(SI), into neural networks via leveraging meta-learning to its limits. We use
Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) to generate training data used to expose
networks to a broad range of patterns. We provide theoretical analysis of the
UTM data generation processes and meta-training protocols. We conduct
comprehensive experiments with neural architectures (e.g. LSTMs, Transformers)
and algorithmic data generators of varying complexity and universality. Our
results suggest that UTM data is a valuable resource for meta-learning, and
that it can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal
prediction strategies.

<p class="mathjax">In automated complexity analysis, noninterference-based type systems
statically guarantee, via soundness, the property that well-typed programs
compute functions of a given complexity class, e.g., the class FP of functions
computable in polynomial time. These characterizations are also extensionally
complete -- they capture all functions -- but are not intensionally complete as
some polytime algorithms are rejected. This impact on expressive power is an
unavoidable cost of achieving a tractable characterization. To overcome this
issue, an avenue arising from security applications is to find a relaxation of
noninterference based on a declassification mechanism that allows critical data
to be released in a safe and controlled manner. Following this path, we present
a new and intuitive declassification policy preserving FP-soundness and
capturing strictly more programs than existing noninterference-based systems.
We show the versatility of the approach: it also provides a new
characterization of the class BFF of second-order polynomial time computable
functions in a second-order imperative language, with first-order procedure
calls. Type inference is tractable: it can be done in polynomial time.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., small input
perturbations can result in substantially different outputs of a neural
network. Safety-critical environments require neural networks that are robust
against input perturbations. However, training and formally verifying robust
neural networks is challenging. We address this challenge by employing, for the
first time, a end-to-end set-based training procedure that trains robust neural
networks for formal verification. Our training procedure drastically simplifies
the subsequent formal robustness verification of the trained neural network.
While previous research has predominantly focused on augmenting neural network
training with adversarial attacks, our approach leverages set-based computing
to train neural networks with entire sets of perturbed inputs. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our set-based training procedure effectively trains robust
neural networks, which are easier to verify. In many cases, set-based trained
neural networks outperform neural networks trained with state-of-the-art
adversarial attacks.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies a joint data and semantics lossy compression problem in
the finite blocklength regime, where the data and semantic sources are
correlated, and only the data source can be observed by the encoder. We first
introduce an information-theoretic nonasymptotic analysis framework to
investigate the nonasymptotic fundamental limits of our studied problem. Within
this framework, general nonasymptotic achievability bounds valid for general
sources and distortion measures are derived. Moreover, we provide a
second-order achievability bound in the standard block coding setting by
applying the two-dimensional Berry-Esseen theorem to our nonasymptotic bounds.
Compared with first-order asymptotic bounds, our results have the potential to
provide unique insights for the design of practical semantic communication
systems.

<p class="mathjax">We revisit the oblivious transfer (OT) capacities of noisy channels against
the passive adversary, which have been identified only for a limited class of
channels. In the literature, the general construction of oblivious transfer has
been known only for generalized erasure channels (GECs); for other channels, we
first convert a given channel to a GEC via alphabet extension and erasure
emulation, and then apply the general construction for GEC. In this paper, we
derive an improved lower bound on the OT capacity of the binary symmetric
channel (BSC) and binary symmetric erasure channel (BSEC) by proposing a new
protocol; by using interactive communication between the sender and the
receiver, our protocol emulates erasure events recursively in multiple rounds.
We also discuss a potential necessity of multiple rounds interactive
communication to attain the OT capacity.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we observe that the model, which is trained on vast general
images using masking strategy, has been naturally embedded with the
distribution knowledge regarding natural images, and thus spontaneously attains
the underlying potential for strong image denoising. Based on this observation,
we propose a novel zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., Masked Pre-train then
Iterative fill (MPI). MPI pre-trains a model with masking and fine-tunes it for
denoising of a single image with unseen noise degradation. Concretely, the
proposed MPI comprises two key procedures: 1) Masked Pre-training involves
training a model on multiple natural images with random masks to gather
generalizable representations, allowing for practical applications in varying
noise degradation and even in distinct image types. 2) Iterative filling is
devised to efficiently fuse pre-trained knowledge for denoising. Similar to but
distinct from pre-training, random masking is retained to bridge the gap, but
only the predicted parts covered by masks are assembled for efficiency, which
enables high-quality denoising within a limited number of iterations.
Comprehensive experiments across various noisy scenarios underscore the notable
advances of proposed MPI over previous approaches with a marked reduction in
inference time. Code is available at https://github.com/krennic999/MPI.git.

<p class="mathjax">The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown significantly in popularity,
accompanied by increased capacity and lower cost of communications, and
overwhelming development of technologies. At the same time, big data and
real-time data analysis have taken on great importance and have been
accompanied by unprecedented interest in sharing data among citizens, public
administrations and other organisms, giving rise to what is known as the
Collaborative Internet of Things. This growth in data and infrastructure must
be accompanied by a software architecture that allows its exploitation.
Although there are various proposals focused on the exploitation of the IoT at
edge, fog and/or cloud levels, it is not easy to find a software solution that
exploits the three tiers together, taking maximum advantage not only of the
analysis of contextual and situational data at each tier, but also of two-way
communications between adjacent ones. In this paper, we propose an architecture
that solves these deficiencies by proposing novel technologies which are
appropriate for managing the resources of each tier: edge, fog and cloud. In
addition, the fact that two-way communications along the three tiers of the
architecture is allowed considerably enriches the contextual and situational
information in each layer, and substantially assists decision making in real
time. The paper illustrates the proposed software architecture through a case
study of respiratory disease surveillance in hospitals. As a result, the
proposed architecture permits efficient communications between the different
tiers responding to the needs of these types of IoT scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Poorly managed postoperative acute pain can have long-lasting negative
impacts and pose a major healthcare issue. There is limited investigation to
understand and address the unique needs of patients experiencing acute pain. In
this paper, we tackle this gap through an interview study with 14 patients who
recently underwent postoperative acute pain to understand their challenges in
pain self-management and their need for supportive tools. Our analysis
identified various factors associated with the major aspects of acute pain
self-management. Together, our findings indicated that tools for supporting
these patients need to carefully consider information and support delivery to
adapt to rapid changes in pain experiences, offer personalized and dynamic
assistance that adapts to individual situations in context, and monitor emotion
when promoting motivation. Overall, our work provided valuable knowledge to
address the less-investigated but highly-needed problem of designing technology
for the self-management of acute pain and similar health conditions.

<p class="mathjax">While speech interaction finds widespread utility within the Extended Reality
(XR) domain, conventional vocal speech keyword spotting systems continue to
grapple with formidable challenges, including suboptimal performance in noisy
environments, impracticality in situations requiring silence, and
susceptibility to inadvertent activations when others speak nearby. These
challenges, however, can potentially be surmounted through the cost-effective
fusion of voice and lip movement information. Consequently, we propose a novel
vocal-echoic dual-modal keyword spotting system designed for XR headsets. We
devise two different modal fusion approches and conduct experiments to test the
system's performance across diverse scenarios. The results show that our
dual-modal system not only consistently outperforms its single-modal
counterparts, demonstrating higher precision in both typical and noisy
environments, but also excels in accurately identifying silent utterances.
Furthermore, we have successfully applied the system in real-time
demonstrations, achieving promising results. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">dCache (https://dcache.org) is a highly scalable storage system providing
location-independent access to data. The data are stored across multiple data
servers as complete files presented to the end-user via a single-rooted
namespace. From its inception, dCache has been designed as a caching disk
buffer to a tertiary tape storage system with the assumption that the latter
has virtually unlimited capacity. dCache can also be configured as a disk-only
storage system with no tape backend. Owing to the idea that a tape resource is
infinite, or purely physically limited by budget considerations, the system has
never provided for any restrictions on how much data can be stored on tape.
Likewise, in the disk-only configuration, the capacity of the system is only
limited by the aggregate disk capacity of the data servers. In a multi-user
environment, however, this has become problematic. This presentation will
describe the design and implementation of a user- and group-based quota system,
that allows to manage tape and disk space allocations, as part of dCache
namespace.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes an algebraic observer-based modulating function approach
for linear time-variant systems and a class of nonlinear systems with discrete
measurements. The underlying idea lies in constructing an observability
transformation that infers some properties of the modulating function approach
for designing such algebraic observers. First, we investigate the algebraic
observer design for linear time-variant systems under an observable canonical
form for continuous-time measurements. Then, we provide the convergence of the
observation error in an L2-gain stability sense. Next, we develop an
exponentially stable sampled-data observer which relies on the design of the
algebraic observer and an output predictor to achieve state estimation from
available measurements and under small inter-sampling periods. Using a
trajectory-based approach, we prove the convergence of the observation error
within a convergence rate that can be adjusted through the fixed time-horizon
length of the modulating function and the upper bound of the sampling period.
Furthermore, robustness of the sampled-data algebraic observer, which yields
input-to-state stability, is inherited by the modulating kernel and the
closed-loop output predictor design. Finally, we discuss the implementation
procedure of the MF-based observer realization, demonstrate the applicability
of the algebraic observer, and illustrate its performance through two examples
given by linear time-invariant and linear time-variant systems with nonlinear
input-output injection terms.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel approach to nonlinear functional regression, called the
Mapping-to-Parameter function model, which addresses complex and nonlinear
functional regression problems in parameter space by employing any supervised
learning technique. Central to this model is the mapping of function data from
an infinite-dimensional function space to a finite-dimensional parameter space.
This is accomplished by concurrently approximating multiple functions with a
common set of B-spline basis functions by any chosen order, with their knot
distribution determined by the Iterative Local Placement Algorithm, a newly
proposed free knot placement algorithm. In contrast to the conventional
equidistant knot placement strategy that uniformly distributes knot locations
based on a predefined number of knots, our proposed algorithms determine knot
location according to the local complexity of the input or output functions.
The performance of our knot placement algorithms is shown to be robust in both
single-function approximation and multiple-function approximation contexts.
Furthermore, the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed prediction model
in handling both function-on-scalar regression and function-on-function
regression problems are demonstrated through several real data applications, in
comparison with four groups of state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Cluster repair methods aim to determine errors in clusters and modify them so
that each cluster consists of records representing the same entity. Current
cluster repair methodologies primarily assume duplicate-free data sources,
where each record from one source corresponds to a unique record from another.
However, real-world data often deviates from this assumption due to quality
issues. Recent approaches apply clustering methods in combination with link
categorization methods so they can be applied to data sources with duplicates.
Nevertheless, the results do not show a clear picture since the quality highly
varies depending on the configuration and dataset. In this study, we introduce
a novel approach for cluster repair that utilizes graph metrics derived from
the underlying similarity graphs. These metrics are pivotal in constructing a
classification model to distinguish between correct and incorrect edges. To
address the challenge of limited training data, we integrate an active learning
mechanism tailored to cluster-specific attributes. The evaluation shows that
the method outperforms existing cluster repair methods without distinguishing
between duplicate-free or dirty data sources. Notably, our modified active
learning strategy exhibits enhanced performance when dealing with datasets
containing duplicates, showcasing its effectiveness in such scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Modern SAT or QBF solvers are expected to produce correctness certificates.
However, certificates have worst-case exponential size (unless
$\textsf{NP}=\textsf{coNP}$), and at recent SAT competitions the largest
certificates of unsatisfiability are starting to reach terabyte size.
<br />Recently, Couillard, Czerner, Esparza, and Majumdar have suggested to replace
certificates with interactive proof systems based on the
$\textsf{IP}=\textsf{PSPACE}$ theorem. They have presented an interactive
protocol between a prover and a verifier for an extension of QBF. The overall
running time of the protocol is linear in the time needed by a standard
BDD-based algorithm, and the time invested by the verifier is polynomial in the
size of the formula. (So, in particular, the verifier never has to read or
process exponentially long certificates). We call such an interactive protocol
competitive with the BDD algorithm for solving QBF.
<br />While BDD-algorithms are state-of-the-art for certain classes of QBF
instances, no modern (UN)SAT solver is based on BDDs. For this reason, we
initiate the study of interactive certification for more practical SAT
algorithms. In particular, we address the question whether interactive
protocols can be competitive with some variant of resolution. We present two
contributions. First, we prove a theorem that reduces the problem of finding
competitive interactive protocols to finding an arithmetisation of formulas
satisfying certain commutativity properties. (Arithmetisation is the
fundamental technique underlying the $\textsf{IP}=\textsf{PSPACE}$ theorem.)
Then, we apply the theorem to give the first interactive protocol for the
Davis-Putnam resolution procedure.

<p class="mathjax">As an emerging and vital topic for studying deep neural networks'
vulnerability (DNNs), backdoor learning has attracted increasing interest in
recent years, and many seminal backdoor attack and defense algorithms are being
developed successively or concurrently, in the status of a rapid arms race.
However, mainly due to the diverse settings, and the difficulties of
implementation and reproducibility of existing works, there is a lack of a
unified and standardized benchmark of backdoor learning, causing unfair
comparisons, and unreliable conclusions (e.g., misleading, biased or even false
conclusions). Consequently, it is difficult to evaluate the current progress
and design the future development roadmap of this literature. To alleviate this
dilemma, we build a comprehensive benchmark of backdoor learning called
BackdoorBench. Our benchmark makes three valuable contributions to the research
community. 1) We provide an integrated implementation of state-of-the-art
(SOTA) backdoor learning algorithms (currently including 16 attack and 27
defense algorithms), based on an extensible modular-based codebase. 2) We
conduct comprehensive evaluations of 12 attacks against 16 defenses, with 5
poisoning ratios, based on 4 models and 4 datasets, thus 11,492 pairs of
evaluations in total. 3) Based on above evaluations, we present abundant
analysis from 8 perspectives via 18 useful analysis tools, and provide several
inspiring insights about backdoor learning. We hope that our efforts could
build a solid foundation of backdoor learning to facilitate researchers to
investigate existing algorithms, develop more innovative algorithms, and
explore the intrinsic mechanism of backdoor learning. Finally, we have created
a user-friendly website at <a href="http://backdoorbench.com">this http URL</a>, which collects all
important information of BackdoorBench, including codebase, docs, leaderboard,
and model Zoo.

Hindi. Airavata was created by fine-tuning OpenHathi with diverse,
instruction-tuning Hindi datasets to make it better suited for assistive tasks.
Along with the model, we also share the IndicInstruct dataset, which is a
collection of diverse instruction-tuning datasets to enable further research

<p class="mathjax">The problem of relay selection is pivotal in the realm of cooperative
communication. However, this issue has not been thoroughly examined,
particularly when the background noise is assumed to possess an impulsive
characteristic with consistent memory as observed in smart grid communications
and some other wireless communication scenarios. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of this specific type of noise on the performance of cooperative
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with the Decode and Forward (DF) relaying
scheme, considering Symbol-Error-Rate (SER) and battery power consumption
fairness across all nodes as the performance metrics. We introduce two
innovative relay selection methods that depend on noise state detection and the
residual battery power of each relay. The first method encompasses the
adaptation of the Max-Min criterion to this specific context, whereas the
second employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to surmount this challenge. Our
empirical outcomes demonstrate that the impacts of bursty impulsive noise on
the SER performance can be effectively mitigated and that a balance in battery
power consumption among all nodes can be established using the proposed
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language
processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and
memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these
resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be
sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they
need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current
hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification
scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix,
reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive
experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model
parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models
while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense
model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without
any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total
compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB
A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance
in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and
enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained
models. Code is available at:

<p class="mathjax">RoboCup represents an International testbed for advancing research in AI and
robotics, focusing on a definite goal: developing a robot team that can win
against the human world soccer champion team by the year 2050. To achieve this
goal, autonomous humanoid robots' coordination is crucial. This paper explores
novel solutions within the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL), where a
reduction in WiFi communication is imperative, leading to the development of
new coordination paradigms. The SPL has experienced a substantial decrease in
network packet rate, compelling the need for advanced coordination
architectures to maintain optimal team functionality in dynamic environments.
Inspired by market-based task assignment, we introduce a novel distributed
coordination system to orchestrate autonomous robots' actions efficiently in
low communication scenarios. This approach has been tested with NAO robots
during official RoboCup competitions and in the SimRobot simulator,
demonstrating a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication
settings.

<p class="mathjax">This work leverages neural radiance fields and remote sensing for forestry
applications. Here, we show neural radiance fields offer a wide range of
possibilities to improve upon existing remote sensing methods in forest
monitoring. We present experiments that demonstrate their potential to: (1)
express fine features of forest 3D structure, (2) fuse available remote sensing
modalities and (3), improve upon 3D structure derived forest metrics.
Altogether, these properties make neural fields an attractive computational
tool with great potential to further advance the scalability and accuracy of
forest monitoring programs.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of the Transformer has led to the development of large language
models (LLM), which appear to demonstrate human-like capabilities. To assess
the generality of this class of models and a variety of other base neural
network architectures to multimodal domains, we evaluated and compared their
capacity for multimodal generalization. We introduce a multimodal
question-answer benchmark to evaluate three specific types of
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance: distractor generalization
(generalization in the presence of distractors), systematic compositional
generalization (generalization to new task permutations), and productive
compositional generalization (generalization to more complex tasks structures).
We found that across model architectures (e.g., RNNs, Transformers, Perceivers,
etc.), models with multiple attention layers, or models that leveraged
cross-attention mechanisms between input domains, fared better. Our positive
results demonstrate that for multimodal distractor and systematic
generalization, either cross-modal attention or models with deeper attention
layers are key architectural features required to integrate multimodal inputs.
On the other hand, neither of these architectural features led to productive
generalization, suggesting fundamental limitations of existing architectures
for specific types of multimodal generalization. These results demonstrate the
strengths and limitations of specific architectural components underlying
modern neural models for multimodal reasoning. Finally, we provide Generic COG
(gCOG), a configurable benchmark with several multimodal generalization splits,
for future studies to explore.

<p class="mathjax">Quantitative data is frequently represented using color, yet designing
effective color mappings is a challenging task, requiring one to balance
perceptual standards with personal color preference. Current design tools
either overwhelm novices with complexity or offer limited customization
options. We present ColorMaker, a mixed-initiative approach for creating
colormaps. ColorMaker combines fluid user interaction with real-time
optimization to generate smooth, continuous color ramps. Users specify their
loose color preferences while leaving the algorithm to generate precise color
sequences, meeting both designer needs and established guidelines. ColorMaker
can create new colormaps, including designs accessible for people with
color-vision deficiencies, starting from scratch or with only partial input,
thus supporting ideation and iterative refinement. We show that our approach
can generate designs with similar or superior perceptual characteristics to
standard colormaps. A user study demonstrates how designers of varying skill
levels can use this tool to create custom, high-quality colormaps. ColorMaker
is available at https://colormaker.org

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit family of subcodes of
Reed-Solomon (RS) codes that efficiently achieve list decoding capacity with a
constant output list size. Our approach builds upon the idea of large linear
subcodes of RS codes evaluated on a subfield, similar to the method employed by
Guruswami and Xing (STOC 2013). However, our approach diverges by leveraging
the idea of {\it permuted product codes}, thereby simplifying the construction
by avoiding the need of {\it subspace designs}.
<br />Specifically, the codes are constructed by initially forming the tensor
product of two RS codes with carefully selected evaluation sets, followed by
specific cyclic shifts to the codeword rows. This process results in each
codeword column being treated as an individual coordinate, reminiscent of prior
capacity-achieving codes, such as folded RS codes and univariate multiplicity
codes. This construction is easily shown to be a subcode of an interleaved RS
code, equivalently, an RS code evaluated on a subfield.
<br />Alternatively, the codes can be constructed by the evaluation of bivariate
polynomials over orbits generated by \emph{two} affine transformations with
coprime orders, extending the earlier use of a single affine transformation in
folded RS codes and the recent affine folded RS codes introduced by Bhandari
{\it et al.} (IEEE T-IT, Feb.~2024). While our codes require large, yet
constant characteristic, the two affine transformations facilitate achieving
code length equal to the field size, without the restriction of the field being
prime, contrasting with univariate multiplicity codes.

i.e., the types of the form $\mathbb{S}^n = \mathbb{S}^n$. The case of the
circle has a slick answer: the symmetries of the circle form two copies of the
circle. For higher-dimensional spheres, the type of symmetries has again two
connected components, namely the components of the maps of degree plus or minus
one. Each of the two components has $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ as fundamental
group. For the latter result, we develop an EHP long exact sequence.

<p class="mathjax">Industrial Ethernet is a technology widely spread in factory floors and
critical infrastructures where a high amount of data need to be collected and
transported. Fiber optic networks at gigabit rates fit well with that type of
environments where speed, system performance and reliability are critical. In
this work a new encryption method for high speed optical communications
suitable for such kind of networks is proposed. This new encryption method
consists of a symmetric streaming encryption of the 8b/10b data flow at PCS
(Physical Coding Sublayer) level. It is carried out thanks to an FPE (Format
Preserving Encryption) blockcipher working in CTR (Counter) mode. The overall
system has been simulated and implemented in an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate
Array). Thanks to experimental results it can be concluded that it is possible
to cipher traffic at this physical level in a secure way. In addition, no
overhead is introduced during encryption, getting minimum latency and maximum
throughput.

<p class="mathjax">In the past decades, Ethernet has become an alternative technology for the
field buses traditionally used in industrial control systems and distributed
measurement systems. Among different transmission media in Ethernet standards,
optical fiber provides the best bandwidth, excellent immunity to
electromagnetic interference, and less signal loses than other wired media. Due
to the absence of a standard that provides security at the physical layer of
optical Ethernet links, the main motivation of this paper is to propose and
implement the necessary modifications to introduce encryption in Ethernet
1000Base-X standard. This has consisted of symmetric streaming encryption of
the 8b10b symbols flow at physical coding sublayer level, thanks to a keystream
generator based on chaotic algorithm. The overall system has been implemented
and tested in an field programmable gate array and Ethernet traffic has been
encrypted and transmitted over an optical link. The experimental results show
that it is possible to cipher traffic at this level and hide the complete
Ethernet traffic pattern from passive eavesdroppers. In addition, no space
overhead is introduced in data frames during encryption, achieving the maximum
throughput.

<p class="mathjax">Universal Composability (UC) is the gold standard for cryptographic security,
but mechanizing proofs of UC is notoriously difficult. A recently-discovered
connection between UC and Robust Compilation (RC)$\unicode{x2014}$a novel
theory of secure compilation$\unicode{x2014}$provides a means to verify UC
proofs using tools that mechanize equality results. Unfortunately, the existing
methods apply only to perfect UC security, and real-world protocols relying on
cryptography are only computationally secure.
<br />This paper addresses this gap by lifting the connection between UC and RC to
the computational setting, extending techniques from the RC setting to apply to
computational UC security. Moreover, it further generalizes the
UC$\unicode{x2013}$RC connection beyond computational security to arbitrary
equalities, providing a framework to subsume the existing perfect case, and to
instantiate future theories with more complex notions of security. This
connection allows the use of tools for proofs of computational
indistinguishability to properly mechanize proofs of computational UC security.
We demonstrate this power by using CryptoVerif to mechanize a proof that parts
of the Wireguard protocol are computationally UC secure. Finally, all proofs of
the framework itself are verified in Isabelle/HOL.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in long-form
context comprehension tasks. However, their capacity to generate long contents,
such as reports and articles, remains insufficiently explored. Current
benchmarks do not adequately assess LLMs' ability to produce informative and
comprehensive content, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation approach. In
this study, we introduce \textsc{ProxyQA}, a framework for evaluating long-form
text generation, comprising in-depth human-curated \textit{meta-questions}
spanning various domains. Each meta-question contains corresponding
\textit{proxy-questions} with annotated answers. LLMs are prompted to generate
extensive content in response to these meta-questions. Utilizing an evaluator
and incorporating generated content as background context, \textsc{ProxyQA}
evaluates the quality of generated content based on the evaluator's performance
in answering the \textit{proxy-questions}. We examine multiple LLMs,
emphasizing \textsc{ProxyQA}'s demanding nature as a high-quality assessment
tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that evaluating through
\textit{proxy-questions} is a highly self-consistent and
human-criteria-correlated validation method. The dataset and leaderboard will

<p class="mathjax">Objective: The reading level of health educational materials significantly
influences information understandability and accessibility, particularly for
minoritized populations. Many patient educational resources surpass the reading
level and complexity of widely accepted standards. There is a critical need for
high-performing text simplification models in health information to enhance
dissemination and literacy. This need is particularly acute in cancer
education, where effective prevention and screening education can substantially
reduce morbidity and mortality.
<br />Methods: We introduce Simplified Digestive Cancer (SimpleDC), a parallel
corpus of cancer education materials tailored for health text simplification
research. Utilizing SimpleDC alongside the existing Med-EASi corpus, we explore
Large Language Model (LLM)-based simplification methods, including fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning (RL), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF),
domain adaptation, and prompt-based approaches. Our experimentation encompasses
Llama 2 and GPT-4. A novel RLHF reward function is introduced, featuring a
lightweight model adept at distinguishing between original and simplified
texts, thereby enhancing the model's effectiveness with unlabeled data.
<br />Results: Fine-tuned Llama 2 models demonstrated high performance across
various metrics. Our innovative RLHF reward function surpassed existing RL text
simplification reward functions in effectiveness. The results underscore that
RL/RLHF can augment fine-tuning, facilitating model training on unlabeled text
and improving performance. Additionally, these methods effectively adapt
out-of-domain text simplification models to targeted domains.

<p class="mathjax">In terms of energy efficiency and computational speed, neuromorphic
electronics based on non-volatile memory devices is expected to be one of most
promising hardware candidates for future artificial intelligence (AI). However,
catastrophic forgetting, networks rapidly overwriting previously learned
weights when learning new tasks, remains as a pivotal hurdle in either digital
or analog AI chips for unleashing the true power of brain-like computing. To
address catastrophic forgetting in the context of online memory storage, a
complex synapse model (the Benna-Fusi model) has been proposed recently[1],
whose synaptic weight and internal variables evolve following a diffusion
dynamics. In this work, by designing a proton transistor with a series of
charge-diffusion-controlled storage components, we have experimentally realized
the Benna-Fusi artificial complex synapse. The memory consolidation from
coupled storage components is revealed by both numerical simulations and
experimental observations. Different memory timescales for the complex synapse
are engineered by the diffusion length of charge carriers, the capacity and
number of coupled storage components. The advantage of the demonstrated complex
synapse in both memory capacity and memory consolidation is revealed by neural
network simulations of face familiarity detection. Our experimental realization
of the complex synapse suggests a promising approach to enhance memory capacity
and to enable continual learning.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of security applications, biometric authentication systems play
a crucial role, yet one often encounters challenges concerning privacy and
security while developing one. One of the most fundamental challenges lies in
avoiding storing biometrics directly in the storage but still achieving
decently high accuracy. Addressing this issue, we contribute to both artificial
intelligence and engineering fields. We introduce an innovative image
distortion technique that effectively renders facial images unrecognizable to
the eye while maintaining their identifiability by neural network models. From
the theoretical perspective, we explore how reliable state-of-the-art
biometrics recognition neural networks are by checking the maximal degree of
image distortion, which leaves the predicted identity unchanged. On the other
hand, applying this technique demonstrates a practical solution to the
engineering challenge of balancing security, precision, and performance in
biometric authentication systems. Through experimenting on the widely used
datasets, we assess the effectiveness of our method in preserving AI feature
representation and distorting relative to conventional metrics. We also compare
our method with previously used approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Document AI is a growing research field that focuses on the comprehension and
extraction of information from scanned and digital documents to make everyday
business operations more efficient. Numerous downstream tasks and datasets have
been introduced to facilitate the training of AI models capable of parsing and
extracting information from various document types such as receipts and scanned
forms. Despite these advancements, both existing datasets and models fail to
address critical challenges that arise in industrial contexts. Existing
datasets primarily comprise short documents consisting of a single page, while
existing models are constrained by a limited maximum length, often set at 512
tokens. Consequently, the practical application of these methods in financial
services, where documents can span multiple pages, is severely impeded. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce LongFin, a multimodal document AI model
capable of encoding up to 4K tokens. We also propose the LongForms dataset, a
comprehensive financial dataset that encapsulates several industrial challenges
in financial documents. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the LongFin model on the LongForms dataset, surpassing the
performance of existing public models while maintaining comparable results on
existing single-page benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Tracking ripening tomatoes is time consuming and labor intensive. Artificial
intelligence technologies combined with those of computer vision can help users
optimize the process of monitoring the ripening status of plants. To this end,
we have proposed a tomato ripening monitoring approach based on deep learning
in complex scenes. The objective is to detect mature tomatoes and harvest them
in a timely manner. The proposed approach is declined in two parts. Firstly,
the images of the scene are transmitted to the pre-processing layer. This
process allows the detection of areas of interest (area of the image containing
tomatoes). Then, these images are used as input to the maturity detection
layer. This layer, based on a deep neural network learning algorithm,
classifies the tomato thumbnails provided to it in one of the following five
categories: green, brittle, pink, pale red, mature red. The experiments are
based on images collected from the internet gathered through searches using
tomato state across diverse languages including English, German, French, and
Spanish. The experimental results of the maturity detection layer on a dataset
composed of images of tomatoes taken under the extreme conditions, gave a good
classification rate.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates adaptive streaming codes over a three-node relayed
network. In this setting, a source transmits a sequence of message packets
through a relay under a delay constraint of $T$ time slots per packet. The
source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links are unreliable and introduce a
maximum of $N_1$ and $N_2$ packet erasures respectively. Recent work has
proposed adaptive (time variant) and nonadaptive (time invariant) code
constructions for this setting and has shown that adaptive codes can achieve
higher rates. However, the adaptive construction deals with many possibilities,
leading to an impractical code with very large block lengths. In this work, we
propose a simplified adaptive code construction which greatly improves the
practicality of the code, with only a small cost to the achievable rates. We
analyze the construction in terms of the achievable rates and field size
requirements, and perform numerical simulations over statistical channels to
estimate packet loss probabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) comprises a broad area of research
within the field of multi-agent systems. Several recent works have focused
specifically on the study of communication approaches in MARL. While multiple
communication methods have been proposed, these might still be too complex and
not easily transferable to more practical contexts. One of the reasons for that
is due to the use of the famous parameter sharing trick. In this paper, we
investigate how independent learners in MARL that do not share parameters can
communicate. We demonstrate that this setting might incur into some problems,
to which we propose a new learning scheme as a solution. Our results show that,
despite the challenges, independent agents can still learn communication
strategies following our method. Additionally, we use this method to
investigate how communication in MARL is affected by different network
capacities, both for sharing and not sharing parameters. We observe that
communication may not always be needed and that the chosen agent network sizes
need to be considered when used together with communication in order to achieve
efficient learning.

<p class="mathjax">The computational demands of modern AI have spurred interest in optical
neural networks (ONNs) which offer the potential benefits of increased speed
and lower power consumption. However, current ONNs face various challenges,most
significantly a limited calculation precision (typically around 4 bits) and the
requirement for high-resolution signal format converters (digital-to-analogue
conversions (DACs) and analogue-to-digital conversions (ADCs)). These
challenges are inherent to their analog computing nature and pose significant
obstacles in practical implementation. Here, we propose a digital-analog hybrid
optical computing architecture for ONNs, which utilizes digital optical inputs
in the form of binary words. By introducing the logic levels and decisions
based on thresholding, the calculation precision can be significantly enhanced.
The DACs for input data can be removed and the resolution of the ADCs can be
greatly reduced. This can increase the operating speed at a high calculation
precision and facilitate the compatibility with microelectronics. To validate
our approach, we have fabricated a proof-of-concept photonic chip and built up
a hybrid optical processor (HOP) system for neural network applications. We
have demonstrated an unprecedented 16-bit calculation precision for
high-definition image processing, with a pixel error rate (PER) as low as
$1.8\times10^{-3}$ at an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 18.2 dB. We have also
implemented a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition
that shows the same accuracy as the one achieved by a desktop computer. The
concept of the digital-analog hybrid optical computing architecture offers a
methodology that could potentially be applied to various ONN implementations
and may intrigue new research into efficient and accurate domain-specific
optical computing architectures for neural networks.

<p class="mathjax">Emerging mobility systems are increasingly capable of recommending options to
mobility users, to guide them towards personalized yet sustainable system
outcomes. Even more so than the typical recommendation system, it is crucial to
minimize regret, because 1) the mobility options directly affect the lives of
the users, and 2) the system sustainability relies on sufficient user
participation. In this study, we consider accelerating user preference learning
by exploiting a low-dimensional latent space that captures the mobility
preferences of users. We introduce a hierarchical contextual bandit framework
named Expert with Clustering (EWC), which integrates clustering techniques and
prediction with expert advice. EWC efficiently utilizes hierarchical user
information and incorporates a novel Loss-guided Distance metric. This metric
is instrumental in generating more representative cluster centroids. In a
recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ options,
our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$. This bound
consists of two parts: the first term is the regret from the Hedge algorithm,
and the second term depends on the average loss from clustering. The algorithm
performs with low regret, especially when a latent hierarchical structure
exists among users. This regret bound underscores the theoretical and
experimental efficacy of EWC, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid
learning and adaptation. Experimental results highlight that EWC can
substantially reduce regret by 27.57% compared to the LinUCB baseline. Our work
offers a data-efficient approach to capturing both individual and collective
behaviors, making it highly applicable to contexts with hierarchical
structures. We expect the algorithm to be applicable to other settings with
layered nuances of user preferences and information.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive abilities in
generating reasonable responses with respect to multi-modal contents. However,
there is still a wide gap between the performance of recent MLLM-based
applications and the expectation of the broad public, even though the most
powerful OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini have been deployed. This paper
strives to enhance understanding of the gap through the lens of a qualitative
study on the generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning
capabilities of recent proprietary and open-source MLLMs across four
modalities: ie, text, code, image, and video, ultimately aiming to improve the
transparency of MLLMs. We believe these properties are several representative
factors that define the reliability of MLLMs, in supporting various downstream
applications. To be specific, we evaluate the closed-source GPT-4 and Gemini
and 6 open-source LLMs and MLLMs. Overall we evaluate 230 manually designed
cases, where the qualitative results are then summarized into 12 scores (ie, 4
modalities times 3 properties). In total, we uncover 14 empirical findings that
are useful to understand the capabilities and limitations of both proprietary
and open-source MLLMs, towards more reliable downstream multi-modal
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models have demonstrated
impressive image generation capabilities. Despite these successes, these
systems are surprisingly poor at creating images with hands. We propose a novel
training framework for generative models that substantially improves the
ability of such systems to create hand images. Our approach is to augment the
training images with three additional channels that provide annotations to
hands in the image. These annotations provide additional structure that coax
the generative model to produce higher quality hand images. We demonstrate this
approach on two different generative models: a generative adversarial network
and a diffusion model. We demonstrate our method both on a new synthetic
dataset of hand images and also on real photographs that contain hands. We
measure the improved quality of the generated hands through higher confidence
in finger joint identification using an off-the-shelf hand detector.

<p class="mathjax">Auto-regressive decoding makes the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs)
time-consuming. We propose a simple framework, EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm
for Greater Language-model Efficiency), for lossless acceleration. Unlike
traditional speculative sampling methods, EAGLE operates the drafting process
auto-regressively at the more regular (second-top-layer) feature level and
addresses the sampling uncertainty issues in the next-feature prediction
problems by integrating tokens from one time step ahead. The acceleration
provided by EAGLE is lossless: it involves no fine-tuning of the target LLM,
and the generated text maintains the same distribution as that of vanilla
auto-regressive decoding. As of the submission of this paper, EAGLE is the
fastest known framework within the speculative sampling family. On MT-bench,
EAGLE is 3x faster than vanilla decoding, 2x faster than Lookahead, and 1.6x
faster than Medusa. Using gpt-fast, EAGLE attains on average 160 tokens/s with
LLaMA2-Chat 13B on a single RTX 3090 GPU, compared to 24 tokens/s of
Huggingface's implementations.

nonsmooth functions, namely so-called tame functions. These functions appear in
a wide range of applications: training deep learning, value functions of
mixed-integer programs, or wave functions of small molecules. We show that tame
functions are approximable by piecewise polynomials on any full-dimensional

piecewise polynomial regression. Together, these can be used to estimate tame

<p class="mathjax">Brain Tumours (BT) are extremely dangerous and difficult to treat. Currently,
doctors must manually examine images and manually mark out tumour regions to
diagnose BT; this process is time-consuming and error-prone. In recent times,
experts have proposed automating approaches for detecting BT at an early stage.
The poor accuracy and highly incorrect prediction results of these methods
caused them to start the research. In this study, we suggest a fuzzy
logic-based system for categorising BT. This study used a dataset of 253
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain images that included tumour and healthy
images. The images were first pre-processed. After that, we pull out features
like tumour size and the image's global threshold value. The watershed and
region-growing approach is used to calculate the tumour size. After that, the
fuzzy system receives the two features as input. Accuracy, F1-score, precision,
and recall are used to assess the results of the fuzzy by employing both size
determination approaches. With the size input variable discovered by the region
growth method and global threshold values, the fuzzy system outperforms the
watershed method. The significance of this research lies in its potential to
revolutionize brain tumour diagnosis by offering a more accurate and efficient
automated classification system. By reducing human intervention and providing
reliable results, this approach could assist medical professionals in making
timely and precise decisions, leading to improved patient outcomes and
potentially saving lives. The advancement of such automated techniques has the
potential to pave the way for enhanced medical imaging analysis and,
ultimately, better management of brain tumour cases.

<p class="mathjax">Languages have long been described according to their perceived rhythmic
attributes. The associated typologies are of interest in psycholinguistics as
they partly predict newborns' abilities to discriminate between languages and
provide insights into how adult listeners process non-native languages. Despite
the relative success of rhythm metrics in supporting the existence of
linguistic rhythmic classes, quantitative studies have yet to capture the full
complexity of temporal regularities associated with speech rhythm. We argue
that deep learning offers a powerful pattern-recognition approach to advance
the characterization of the acoustic bases of speech rhythm. To explore this
hypothesis, we trained a medium-sized recurrent neural network on a language
identification task over a large database of speech recordings in 21 languages.
The network had access to the amplitude envelopes and a variable identifying
the voiced segments, assuming that this signal would poorly convey phonetic
information but preserve prosodic features. The network was able to identify
the language of 10-second recordings in 40% of the cases, and the language was
in the top-3 guesses in two-thirds of the cases. Visualization methods show
that representations built from the network activations are consistent with
speech rhythm typologies, although the resulting maps are more complex than two
separated clusters between stress and syllable-timed languages. We further
analyzed the model by identifying correlations between network activations and
known speech rhythm metrics. The findings illustrate the potential of deep
learning tools to advance our understanding of speech rhythm through the
identification and exploration of linguistically relevant acoustic feature
spaces.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the potential of patent data for improving the antibody
humanness prediction using a multi-stage, multi-loss training process.
Humanness serves as a proxy for the immunogenic response to antibody
therapeutics, one of the major causes of attrition in drug discovery and a
challenging obstacle for their use in clinical settings. We pose the initial
learning stage as a weakly-supervised contrastive-learning problem, where each
antibody sequence is associated with possibly multiple identifiers of function
and the objective is to learn an encoder that groups them according to their
patented properties. We then freeze a part of the contrastive encoder and
continue training it on the patent data using the cross-entropy loss to predict
the humanness score of a given antibody sequence. We illustrate the utility of
the patent data and our approach by performing inference on three different
immunogenicity datasets, unseen during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that the learned model consistently outperforms the alternative
baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art on five out of six inference
tasks, irrespective of the used metric.

<p class="mathjax">Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) serve as the cornerstone for
understanding causal effects, yet extending inferences to target populations
presents challenges due to effect heterogeneity and underrepresentation. Our
paper addresses the critical issue of identifying and characterizing
underrepresented subgroups in RCTs, proposing a novel framework for refining
target populations to improve generalizability. We introduce an
optimization-based approach, Rashomon Set of Optimal Trees (ROOT), to
characterize underrepresented groups. ROOT optimizes the target subpopulation
distribution by minimizing the variance of the target average treatment effect
estimate, ensuring more precise treatment effect estimations. Notably, ROOT
generates interpretable characteristics of the underrepresented population,
aiding researchers in effective communication. Our approach demonstrates
improved precision and interpretability compared to alternatives, as
illustrated with synthetic data experiments. We apply our methodology to extend
inferences from the Starting Treatment with Agonist Replacement Therapies
(START) trial -- investigating the effectiveness of medication for opioid use
disorder -- to the real-world population represented by the Treatment Episode
Dataset: Admissions (TEDS-A). By refining target populations using ROOT, our
framework offers a systematic approach to enhance decision-making accuracy and
inform future trials in diverse populations.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the problem of learning Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) in a
multi-task, heterogeneous, and model-free setting. We characterize the
stability and personalization guarantees of a Policy Gradient-based (PG)
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017) approach for the LQR
problem under different task-heterogeneity settings. We show that the MAML-LQR
approach produces a stabilizing controller close to each task-specific optimal
controller up to a task-heterogeneity bias for both model-based and model-free
settings. Moreover, in the model-based setting, we show that this controller is
achieved with a linear convergence rate, which improves upon sub-linear rates
presented in existing MAML-LQR work. In contrast to existing MAML-LQR results,
our theoretical guarantees demonstrate that the learned controller can
efficiently adapt to unseen LQR tasks.

<p class="mathjax">With the growth of magnitude of multi-agent networks, distributed
optimization holds considerable significance within complex systems.
Convergence, a pivotal goal in this domain, is contingent upon the analysis of
infinite products of stochastic matrices (IPSMs). In this work, convergence
properties of inhomogeneous IPSMs are investigated. The convergence rate of
inhomogeneous IPSMs towards an absolute probability sequence $\pi$ is derived.
We also show that the convergence rate is nearly exponential, which coincides
with existing results on ergodic chains. The methodology employed relies on
delineating the interrelations among Sarymsakov matrices, scrambling matrices,
and positive-column matrices. Based on the theoretical results on inhomogeneous
IPSMs, we propose a decentralized projected subgradient method for time-varying
multi-agent systems with graph-related stretches in (sub)gradient descent
directions. The convergence of the proposed method is established for convex
objective functions, and extended to non-convex objectives that satisfy
Polyak-Lojasiewicz conditions. To corroborate the theoretical findings, we
conduct numerical simulations, aligning the outcomes with the established
theoretical framework.

<p class="mathjax">Peptides offer great biomedical potential and serve as promising drug
candidates. Currently, the majority of approved peptide drugs are directly
derived from well-explored natural human peptides. It is quite necessary to
utilize advanced deep learning techniques to identify novel peptide drugs in
the vast, unexplored biochemical space. Despite various in silico methods
having been developed to accelerate peptide early drug discovery, existing
models face challenges of overfitting and lacking generalizability due to the
limited size, imbalanced distribution and inconsistent quality of experimental
data. In this study, we propose PepGB, a deep learning framework to facilitate
peptide early drug discovery by predicting peptide-protein interactions
(PepPIs). Employing graph neural networks, PepGB incorporates a fine-grained
perturbation module and a dual-view objective with contrastive learning-based
peptide pre-trained representation to predict PepPIs. Through rigorous
evaluations, we demonstrated that PepGB greatly outperforms baselines and can
accurately identify PepPIs for novel targets and peptide hits, thereby
contributing to the target identification and hit discovery processes. Next, we
derive an extended version, diPepGB, to tackle the bottleneck of modeling
highly imbalanced data prevalent in lead generation and optimization processes.
Utilizing directed edges to represent relative binding strength between two
peptide nodes, diPepGB achieves superior performance in real-world assays. In
summary, our proposed frameworks can serve as potent tools to facilitate
peptide early drug discovery.

<p class="mathjax">We use Markov categories to develop generalizations of the theory of Markov
chains and hidden Markov models in an abstract setting. This comprises
characterizations of hidden Markov models in terms of local and global
conditional independences as well as existing algorithms for Bayesian filtering
and smoothing applicable in all Markov categories with conditionals. We show
that these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter,
forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother when
instantiated in appropriate Markov categories. Under slightly stronger
assumptions, we also prove that the sequence of outputs of the Bayes filter is
itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps.
<br />There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its
generality, as it can be used in any Markov category with conditionals. In
particular, it provides a systematic unified account of hidden Markov models
and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian
probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and
others at the same time. The second feature is the intuitive visual
representation of information flow in these algorithms in terms of string
diagrams.

<p class="mathjax">In silicon quantum computers, a single electron is trapped in a
microstructure called a quantum dot, and its spin is used as a qubit. For
large-scale integration of qubits, we previously proposed an approach of
arranging the quantum dots in a two-dimensional array and sharing a control
gate in a row or column of the array. In our array, the shuttling of electrons
is a useful technique to operate the target qubit independently and avoid
crosstalk. However, since the shuttling is also conducted using shared control
gates, the movement of qubits is complexly constrained. We therefore propose a
formal model on the basis of state transition systems to describe those
constraints and operation procedures on the array. We also present an approach
to generate operation procedures under the constraints. Utilizing this
approach, we present a concrete method for our 16 $\times$ 8 quantum dot array.
By implementing the proposed method as a quantum compiler, we confirmed that it
is possible to generate operation procedures in a practical amount of time for
arbitrary quantum circuits. We also demonstrated that crosstalk can be avoided
by shuttling and that the fidelity in that case is higher than when crosstalk
is not avoided.

<p class="mathjax">The availability of training data is one of the main limitations in deep
learning applications for medical imaging. Data augmentation is a popular
approach to overcome this problem. A new approach is a Machine Learning based
augmentation, in particular usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In
this case, GANs generate images similar to the original dataset so that the
overall training data amount is bigger, which leads to better performance of
trained networks. A GAN model consists of two networks, a generator and a
discriminator interconnected in a feedback loop which creates a competitive
environment. This work is a continuation of the previous research where we
trained StyleGAN2-ADA by Nvidia on the limited COVID-19 chest X-ray image
dataset. In this paper, we study the dependence of the GAN-based augmentation
performance on dataset size with a focus on small samples. Two datasets are
considered, one with 1000 images per class (4000 images in total) and the
second with 500 images per class (2000 images in total). We train StyleGAN2-ADA
with both sets and then, after validating the quality of generated images, we
use trained GANs as one of the augmentations approaches in multi-class
classification problems. We compare the quality of the GAN-based augmentation
approach to two different approaches (classical augmentation and no
augmentation at all) by employing transfer learning-based classification of
COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The results are quantified using different
classification quality metrics and compared to the results from the literature.
The GAN-based augmentation approach is found to be comparable with classical
augmentation in the case of medium and large datasets but underperforms in the
case of smaller datasets. The correlation between the size of the original
dataset and the quality of classification is visible independently from the
augmentation approach.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately predicting the onset of specific activities within defined
timeframes holds significant importance in several applied contexts. In
particular, accurate prediction of the number of future users that will be
exposed to an intervention is an important piece of information for
experimenters running online experiments (A/B tests). In this work, we propose
a novel approach to predict the number of users that will be active in a given
time period, as well as the temporal trajectory needed to attain a desired user
participation threshold. We model user activity using a Bayesian nonparametric
approach which allows us to capture the underlying heterogeneity in user
engagement. We derive closed-form expressions for the number of new users
expected in a given period, and a simple Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the
posterior distribution of the number of days needed to attain a desired number
of users; the latter is important for experimental planning. We illustrate the
performance of our approach via several experiments on synthetic and real world
data, in which we show that our novel method outperforms existing competitors.

neutrality regulations when platforms are present and operate two-sided pricing
in their business models. This study is conducted in a scenario where users and
Content Providers (CPs) have access to the internet by means of their serving
ISPs and to a platform that intermediates and matches users and CPs, among
other service offerings. Our hypothesis is that platform two-sided pricing
interacts in a relevant manner with the access ISP, which may be allowed (an
hypothetical non-neutrality scenario) or not (the current neutrality regulation
status) to apply two-sided pricing on its service business model. We
preliminarily conclude that the platforms are extracting surplus from the CPs
under the current net neutrality regime for the ISP, and that the platforms
would not be able to do so under the counter-factual situation where the ISPs

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the relationships between protein sequence, structure and
function is a long-standing biological challenge with manifold implications
from drug design to our understanding of evolution. Recently, protein language
models have emerged as the preferred method for this challenge, thanks to their
ability to harness large sequence databases. Yet, their reliance on expansive
sequence data and parameter sets limits their flexibility and practicality in
real-world scenarios. Concurrently, the recent surge in computationally
predicted protein structures unlocks new opportunities in protein
representation learning. While promising, the computational burden carried by
such complex data still hinders widely-adopted practical applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enhances protein
language models by integrating protein structural data. Drawing from recent
advances in graph transformers, our approach refines the self-attention
mechanisms of pretrained language transformers by integrating structural
information with structure extractor modules. This refined model, termed
Protein Structure Transformer (PST), is further pretrained on a small protein
structure database, using the same masked language modeling objective as
traditional protein language models. Empirical evaluations of PST demonstrate
its superior parameter efficiency relative to protein language models, despite
being pretrained on a dataset comprising only 542K structures. Notably, PST
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation model for protein
sequences, ESM-2, setting a new benchmark in protein function prediction. Our
findings underscore the potential of integrating structural information into
protein language models, paving the way for more effective and efficient
protein modeling Code and pretrained models are available at

a toroidal domain, we consider its associated harmonic field. The latter is the
magnetic field obtained uniquely up to normalization when imposing zero normal
trace and zero electrical current inside the domain. We then study the helicity
of this field, which is a quantity of interest in magneto-hydrodynamics
corresponding to the L2 product of the field with its image by the Biot--Savart
operator. To do so, we begin by discussing the appropriate functional framework
and an equivalent PDE characterization. We then focus on shape optimization,
and we identify the shape gradient of the harmonic helicity. Finally, we study
and implement an efficient numerical scheme to compute harmonic helicity and
its shape gradient using finite elements exterior calculus.

<p class="mathjax">Direct data-driven design methods for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
mainly use offline or episodic data batches, and their online adaptation has
been acknowledged as an open problem. In this paper, we propose a direct
adaptive method to learn the LQR from online closed-loop data. First, we
propose a new policy parameterization based on the sample covariance to
formulate a direct data-driven LQR problem, which is shown to be equivalent to
the certainty-equivalence LQR with optimal non-asymptotic guarantees. Second,
we design a novel data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method to directly
update the policy, where the gradient is explicitly computed using only a batch
of persistently exciting (PE) data. Third, we establish its global convergence
via a projected gradient dominance property. Importantly, we efficiently use
DeePO to adaptively learn the LQR by performing only one-step projected
gradient descent per sample of the closed-loop system, which also leads to an
explicit recursive update of the policy. Under PE inputs and for bounded noise,
we show that the average regret of the LQR cost is upper-bounded by two terms
signifying a sublinear decrease in time $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ plus a bias
scaling inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which are independent of
the noise statistics. Finally, we perform simulations to validate the
theoretical results and demonstrate the computational and sample efficiency of
our method.

<p class="mathjax">Modern manufacturing value chains require intelligent orchestration of
processes across company borders in order to maximize profits while fostering
social and environmental sustainability. However, the implementation of
integrated, systems-level approaches for data-informed decision-making along
value chains is currently hampered by privacy concerns associated with
cross-organizational data exchange and integration. We here propose
Privacy-Preserving Partial Least Squares (P3LS) regression, a novel federated
learning technique that enables cross-organizational data integration and
process modeling with privacy guarantees. P3LS involves a singular value
decomposition (SVD) based PLS algorithm and employs removable, random masks
generated by a trusted authority in order to protect the privacy of the data
contributed by each data holder. We demonstrate the capability of P3LS to
vertically integrate process data along a hypothetical value chain consisting
of three parties and to improve the prediction performance on several
process-related key performance indicators. Furthermore, we show the numerical
equivalence of P3LS and PLS model components on simulated data and provide a
thorough privacy analysis of the former. Moreover, we propose a mechanism for
determining the relevance of the contributed data to the problem being
addressed, thus creating a basis for quantifying the contribution of
participants.

<p class="mathjax">This article presents a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for distributed
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The scheme transfers the well-known
RTI approach, a key enabler for many industrial real-time NMPC implementations,
to the setting of cooperative distributed control. At each sampling instant,
one outer iteration of a bi-level decentralized Sequential Quadratic
Programming (dSQP) method is applied to a centralized optimal control croblem.
This ensures that real-time requirements are met and it facilitates cooperation
between subsystems. Combining novel dSQP convergence results with RTI stability
guarantees, we prove local exponential stability under standard assumptions on
the MPC design with and without terminal constraints. The proposed scheme only
requires neighbor-to-neighbor communication and avoids a central coordinator. A
numerical example with coupled inverted pendulums demonstrates the efficacy of
the approach.

<p class="mathjax">We seek to model a collection of time series arising from multiple entities
interacting over the same time period. Recent work focused on modeling
individual time series is inadequate for our intended applications, where
collective system-level behavior influences the trajectories of individual
entities. To address such problems, we present a new hierarchical
switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to
simultaneously explain both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We
employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that drives latent
entity-level chains which in turn govern the dynamics of each observed time
series. Feedback from the observations to the chains at both the entity and
system levels improves flexibility via context-dependent state transitions. Our
hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical models can be learned via
closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that
scale linearly in the number of individual time series. This is asymptotically
no more costly than fitting separate models for each entity. Experiments on
synthetic and real datasets show that our model can produce better forecasts of
future entity behavior than existing methods. Moreover, the availability of
latent state chains at both the entity and system level enables interpretation
of group dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia, and BlackBerry
experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short squeeze operations that have
been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. These events showcased,
for the first time, the potential of online social networks to catalyze
financial collective action. How, when and to what extent Reddit users played a
causal role in driving up these prices, however, remains unclear. To address
these questions, we employ causal inference techniques, leveraging data
capturing activity on Reddit and Twitter, and trading volume with a high
temporal resolution. We find that Reddit discussions foreshadowed trading
volume before the GameStop short squeeze, with their predictive power being
particularly strong on hourly time scales. This effect emerged abruptly and
became prominent a few weeks before the event, but waned once the community of
investors gained widespread visibility through Twitter. As the causal link
unfolded, the collective investment of the Reddit community, quantified through
each user's financial position on GameStop, closely mirrored the market
capitalization of the stock. The evidence from our study suggests that Reddit
users fueled the GameStop short squeeze, and thereby Reddit served as a
coordination hub for a shared financial strategy. Towards the end of January,
users talking about GameStop contributed to raise the popularity of BlackBerry,
AMC and Nokia, which emerged as the most popular stocks as the community gained
global recognition. Overall, our results shed light on the dynamics behind the
first large-scale financial collective action driven by social media users.

<p class="mathjax">The development of nonlinear optimization algorithms capable of performing
reliably in the presence of noise has garnered considerable attention lately.
This paper advocates for strategies to create noise-tolerant nonlinear
optimization algorithms by adapting classical deterministic methods. These
adaptations follow certain design guidelines described here, which make use of
estimates of the noise level in the problem. The application of our methodology
is illustrated by the development of a line search gradient projection method,
which is tested on an engineering design problem. It is shown that a new
self-calibrated line search and noise-aware finite-difference techniques are
effective even in the high noise regime. Numerical experiments investigate the
resiliency of key algorithmic components. A convergence analysis of the line
search gradient projection method establishes convergence to a neighborhood of
the solution.

<p class="mathjax">Speaker Verification (SV) systems involve mainly two individual stages:
feature extraction and classification. In this paper, we explore these two
modules with the aim of improving the performance of a speaker verification
system under noisy conditions. On the one hand, the choice of the most
appropriate acoustic features is a crucial factor for performing robust speaker
verification. The acoustic parameters used in the proposed system are: Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), their first and second derivatives
(Deltas and Delta- Deltas), Bark Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (BFCC),
Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP), and Relative Spectral Transform -
Perceptual Linear Predictive (RASTA-PLP). In this paper, a complete comparison
of different combinations of the previous features is discussed. On the other
hand, the major weakness of a conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier is the use of generic traditional kernel functions to compute the
distances among data points. However, the kernel function of an SVM has great
influence on its performance. In this work, we propose the combination of two
SVM-based classifiers with different kernel functions: Linear kernel and
Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with a Logistic Regression (LR)
classifier. The combination is carried out by means of a parallel structure
approach, in which different voting rules to take the final decision are
considered. Results show that significant improvement in the performance of the
SV system is achieved by using the combined features with the combined
classifiers either with clean speech or in the presence of noise. Finally, to
enhance the system more in noisy environments, the inclusion of the multiband
noise removal technique as a preprocessing stage is proposed.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the diagnosis of gliomas has become increasingly complex.
Histological assessment of glioma tissue using modern machine learning
techniques offers new opportunities to support diagnosis and outcome
prediction. To give an overview of the current state of research, this review
examines 70 publicly available research studies on machine learning-based
analysis of stained human glioma tissue sections, covering the diagnostic tasks
of subtyping (16/70), grading (23/70), molecular marker prediction (13/70), and
survival prediction (27/70). All studies were reviewed with regard to
methodological aspects as well as clinical applicability. It was found that the
focus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained
tissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (49/70)
are based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other
datasets in isolation (10/70) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (11/70).
Current approaches mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (53/70) for
analyzing tissue at 20x magnification (30/70). A new field of research is the
integration of clinical data, omics data, or magnetic resonance imaging
(27/70). So far, machine learning-based methods have achieved promising
results, but are not yet used in real clinical settings. Future work should
focus on the independent validation of methods on larger, multi-site datasets
with high-quality and up-to-date clinical and molecular pathology annotations
to demonstrate routine applicability.

<p class="mathjax">Parametric sound field synthesis methods, such as the Spatial Decomposition
Method (SDM) and Higher-Order Spatial Impulse Response Rendering (HO-SIRR), are
widely used for the analysis and auralization of sound fields. This paper
studies the performances of various sound field synthesis methods in the
context of the auralization of a critical listening room. The influence on the
perceived spatial and timbral fidelity of the following factors is considered:
the rendering framework, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation method,
microphone array structure, and use of a dedicated center reference microphone
with SDM. Listening tests compare the synthesized sound fields to a reference
binaural rendering condition. Several acoustic parameters are measured to gain
insights into objective differences between methods. A high-quality pressure
microphone improves the SDM framework's timbral fidelity. Additionally, SDM and
HO-SIRR show similarities in spatial fidelity. Performance variation between
SDM configurations is influenced by the DOA estimation method and microphone
array construction. The binaural SDM (BSDM) presentations display temporal
artifacts impacting sound quality.

<p class="mathjax">We consider a problem of inferring contact network from nodal states observed
during an epidemiological process. In a black-box Bayesian optimisation
framework this problem reduces to a discrete likelihood optimisation over the
set of possible networks. The high dimensionality of this set, which grows
quadratically with the number of network nodes, makes this optimisation
computationally challenging. Moreover, the computation of the likelihood of a
network requires estimating probabilities of the observed data to realise
during the evolution of the epidemiological process on this network. A
stochastic simulation algorithm struggles to estimate rare events of observing
the data (corresponding to the ground truth network) during the evolution with
a significantly different network, and hence prevents optimisation of the
likelihood. We replace the stochastic simulation with solving the chemical
master equation for the probabilities of all network states. This equation also
suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the exponentially large number
of network states. We overcome this by approximating the probability of states
in the tensor-train decomposition. This enables fast and accurate computation
of small probabilities and likelihoods. Numerical simulations demonstrate
efficient black-box Bayesian inference of the network.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a new pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) based on the
logistic map has been proposed. To prevent the system to fall into short period
orbits as well as increasing the randomness of the generated sequences, the
proposed algorithm dynamically changes the parameters of the chaotic system.
This PRNG has been implemented in a Virtex 7 field-programmable gate array
(FPGA) with a 32-bit fixed point precision, using a total of 510 lookup tables
(LUTs) and 120 registers. The sequences generated by the proposed algorithm
have been subjected to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) randomness tests, passing all of them. By comparing the randomness with
the sequences generated by a raw 32-bit logistic map, it is shown that, by
using only an additional 16% of LUTs, the proposed PRNG obtains a much better
performance in terms of randomness, increasing the NIST passing rate from 0.252
to 0.989. Finally, the proposed bitwise dynamical PRNG is compared with other
chaos-based realizations previously proposed, showing great improvement in
terms of resources and randomness.
