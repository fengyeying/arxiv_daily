<p class="mathjax">The synthesis of string transformation programs from input-output examples
utilizes various techniques, all based on an inductive bias that comprises a
restricted set of basic operators to be combined. A new algorithm, Transduce,
is proposed, which is founded on the construction of abstract transduction
grammars and their generalization. We experimentally demonstrate that Transduce
can learn positional transformations efficiently from one or two positive
examples without inductive bias, achieving a success rate higher than the
current state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents RoleCraft-GLM, an innovative framework aimed at enhancing
personalized role-playing with Large Language Models (LLMs). RoleCraft-GLM
addresses the key issue of lacking personalized interactions in conversational
AI, and offers a solution with detailed and emotionally nuanced character
portrayals. We contribute a unique conversational dataset that shifts from
conventional celebrity-centric characters to diverse, non-celebrity personas,
thus enhancing the realism and complexity of language modeling interactions.
Additionally, our approach includes meticulous character development, ensuring
dialogues are both realistic and emotionally resonant. The effectiveness of
RoleCraft-GLM is validated through various case studies, highlighting its
versatility and skill in different scenarios. Our framework excels in
generating dialogues that accurately reflect characters' personality traits and
emotions, thereby boosting user engagement. In conclusion, RoleCraft-GLM marks
a significant leap in personalized AI interactions, and paves the way for more
authentic and immersive AI-assisted role-playing experiences by enabling more
nuanced and emotionally rich dialogues

problem of guidance and control of underwater vehicles. An outer-loop
path-following algorithm and an outer-loop trajectory tracking algorithm are
presented. Both outer-loop algorithms provide reference commands that enable
the generic submarine to adhere to a three-dimensional path, and both use an
inner-loop adaptive controller to determine the required actuation commands.
Further, a reduced order model of a generic submarine is presented.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results are used to create and validate a
model that includes depth dependence and the effect of waves on the craft. %The
model and the procedure to obtain its coefficients are discussed, and examples
of the data used to obtain the model coefficients are presented. An example of
operation following a complex path is presented and Results from the reduced
order model for each control strategy are compared.

dataset. VoxCeleb-ESP captures real-world scenarios, incorporating diverse
speaking styles, noises, and channel distortions. It includes 160 Spanish
celebrities spanning various categories, ensuring a representative distribution
across age groups and geographic regions in Spain. We provide two speaker trial
lists for speaker identification tasks, each of them with same-video or

<p class="mathjax">Visual question answering is a multimodal task that requires the joint
comprehension of visual and textual information. However, integrating visual
and textual semantics solely through attention layers is insufficient to
comprehensively understand and align information from both modalities.
Intuitively, object attributes can naturally serve as a bridge to unify them,
which has been overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we propose a
novel VQA approach from the perspective of utilizing object attribute, aiming
to achieve better object-level visual-language alignment and multimodal scene
understanding. Specifically, we design an attribute fusion module and a
contrastive knowledge distillation module. The attribute fusion module
constructs a multimodal graph neural network to fuse attributes and visual
features through message passing. The enhanced object-level visual features
contribute to solving fine-grained problem like counting-question. The better
object-level visual-language alignment aids in understanding multimodal scenes,
thereby improving the model's robustness. Furthermore, to augment scene
understanding and the out-of-distribution performance, the contrastive
knowledge distillation module introduces a series of implicit knowledge. We
distill knowledge into attributes through contrastive loss, which further
strengthens the representation learning of attribute features and facilitates
visual-linguistic alignment. Intensive experiments on six datasets, COCO-QA,
VQAv2, VQA-CPv2, VQA-CPv1, VQAvs and TDIUC, show the superiority of the
proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Visual defect detection plays an important role in intelligent industry.
Patch based methods consider visual images as a collection of image patches
according to positions, which have stronger discriminative ability for small
defects in products, e.g. scratches on pills. However, the nearest neighbor
search for the query image and the stored patches will occupy $O(n)$ complexity
in terms of time and space requirements, posing strict challenges for
deployment in edge environments. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach to the distance calculation of image patches via collaborative
representation models. Starting from the nearest neighbor distance with $L_0$
constraint, we relax the constraint to $L_2$ constraint and solve the distance
quickly in close-formed without actually accessing the original stored
collection of image patches. Furthermore, we point out that the main
computational burden of this close-formed solution can be pre-computed by
high-performance server before deployment. Consequently, the distance
calculation on edge devices only requires a simple matrix multiplication, which
is extremely lightweight and GPU-friendly. Performance on real industrial
scenarios demonstrates that compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods,
this distance achieves several hundred times improvement in computational
efficiency with slight performance drop, while greatly reducing memory
overhead.

<p class="mathjax">This volume contains revised versions of the papers selected for the fourth
volume of the Online Handbook of Argumentation for AI (OHAAI). Previously,
formal theories of argument and argument interaction have been proposed and
studied, and this has led to the more recent study of computational models of
argument. Argumentation, as a field within artificial intelligence (AI), is
highly relevant for researchers interested in symbolic representations of
knowledge and defeasible reasoning. The purpose of this handbook is to provide
an open access and curated anthology for the argumentation research community.
OHAAI is designed to serve as a research hub to keep track of the latest and
upcoming PhD-driven research on the theory and application of argumentation in
all areas related to AI.

observation for this work is that such functions can approximate typical test

Moreover, we show that the convergence analysis of numerical methods for
solving inverse problems with shallow generalized neural network functions
leads to more intuitive convergence conditions, than for deep affine linear

<p class="mathjax">Memes have become a distinctive and effective form of communication in the
digital era, attracting online communities and cutting across cultural
barriers. Even though memes are frequently linked with humor, they have an
amazing capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, including happiness,
sarcasm, frustration, and more. Understanding and interpreting the sentiment
underlying memes has become crucial in the age of information. Previous
research has explored text-based, image-based, and multimodal approaches,
leading to the development of models like CAPSAN and PromptHate for detecting
various meme categories. However, the study of low-resource languages like
Bengali memes remains scarce, with limited availability of publicly accessible
datasets. A recent contribution includes the introduction of the MemoSen
dataset. However, the achieved accuracy is notably low, and the dataset suffers
from imbalanced distribution. In this study, we employed a multimodal approach
using ResNet50 and BanglishBERT and achieved a satisfactory result of 0.71
weighted F1-score, performed comparison with unimodal approaches, and
interpreted behaviors of the models using explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Since the key to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is commonly believed
to be commonsense reasoning (CSR) or, roughly equivalently, discovery of a
knowledge representation method (KRM) that is particularly suitable for CSR,
the author developed a custom KRM for CSR. This novel KRM called Tumbug was
designed to be pictorial in nature because there exists increasing evidence
that the human brain uses some pictorial type of KRM, and no well-known prior
research in AGI has researched this KRM possibility. Tumbug is somewhat similar
to Roger Schank's Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory, but Tumbug is pictorial
and uses about 30 components based on fundamental concepts from the sciences
and human life, in contrast to CD theory, which is textual and uses about 17
components (= 6 Primitive Conceptual Categories + 11 Primitive Acts) based
mainly on human-oriented activities. All the Building Blocks of Tumbug were
found to generalize to only five Basic Building Blocks that exactly correspond
to the three components {O, A, V} of traditional Object-Attribute-Value
representation plus two new components {C, S}, which are Change and System.
Collectively this set of five components, called "SCOVA," seems to be a
universal foundation for all knowledge representation.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of optimal games for the solo and coop modes of the
board game Room 25 (season 1). We show that the game cannot be won in a single
turn for any starting configuration, but that it can be done in two for some
configurations. We introduce an opening that wins in two turns with enough
luck, while having a low probability of losing immediately. We then show that
the game can be won in a single turn if the game's rules are slightly modified,
although the probability of winning then becomes substantially lower than in
the two-turn strategy. At last, we show that if the players are maximally
unlucky, they will lose regardless of their strategy.

<p class="mathjax">Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) methods in pathology have
advanced substantially. However, integration into routine clinical practice has
been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory
hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and
the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA
initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's
achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the
pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry.
In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards,
recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability
methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and
successfully integrated 11 AI-based image analysis apps from 6 different
vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized
interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real
clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia.
In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders
to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial,
clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source
interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and
streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and
broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a
sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International,
has been established to continue standardization and support broad
implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.

<p class="mathjax">The aerodynamic coefficients of aircrafts are significantly impacted by its
geometry, especially when the angle of attack (AoA) is large. In the field of
aerodynamics, traditional polynomial-based parameterization uses as few
parameters as possible to describe the geometry of an airfoil. However, because
the 3D geometry of a wing is more complicated than the 2D airfoil,
polynomial-based parameterizations have difficulty in accurately representing
the entire shape of a wing in 3D space. Existing deep learning-based methods
can extract massive latent neural representations for the shape of 2D airfoils
or 2D slices of wings. Recent studies highlight that directly taking geometric
features as inputs to the neural networks can improve the accuracy of predicted
aerodynamic coefficients. Motivated by geometry theory, we propose to
incorporate Riemannian geometric features for learning Coefficient of Pressure
(CP) distributions on wing surfaces. Our method calculates geometric features
(Riemannian metric, connection, and curvature) and further inputs the geometric
features, coordinates and flight conditions into a deep learning model to
predict the CP distribution. Experimental results show that our method,
compared to state-of-the-art Deep Attention Network (DAN), reduces the
predicted mean square error (MSE) of CP by an average of 8.41% for the DLR-F11
aircraft test set.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the integration of vision and language understanding has led
to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, existing VLMs face challenges in
handling real-world applications with complex scenes and multiple objects, as
well as aligning their focus with the diverse attention patterns of human
users. In this paper, we introduce gaze information, feasibly collected by AR
or VR devices, as a proxy for human attention to guide VLMs and propose a novel
approach, Voila-A, for gaze alignment to enhance the interpretability and
effectiveness of these models in real-world applications. First, we collect
hundreds of minutes of gaze data to demonstrate that we can mimic human gaze
modalities using localized narratives. We then design an automatic data
annotation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 to generate the VOILA-COCO dataset.
Additionally, we innovate the Voila Perceiver modules to integrate gaze
information into VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge. We evaluate
Voila-A using a hold-out validation set and a newly collected VOILA-GAZE
Testset, which features real-life scenarios captured with a gaze-tracking
device. Our experimental results demonstrate that Voila-A significantly
outperforms several baseline models. By aligning model attention with human
gaze patterns, Voila-A paves the way for more intuitive, user-centric VLMs and
fosters engaging human-AI interaction across a wide range of applications.

<p class="mathjax">The integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN) system has experienced
significant growth, offering seamless communication services in remote areas
with limited terrestrial infrastructure. However, designing a routing scheme
for ISTN is exceedingly difficult, primarily due to the heightened complexity
resulting from the inclusion of additional ground stations, along with the
requirement to satisfy various constraints related to satellite service
quality. To address these challenges, we study packet routing with ground
stations and satellites working jointly to transmit packets, while prioritizing
fast communication and meeting energy efficiency and packet loss requirements.
Specifically, we formulate the problem of packet routing with constraints as a
max-min problem using the Lagrange method. Then we propose a novel constrained
Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) dynamic routing algorithm named
CMADR, which efficiently balances objective improvement and constraint
satisfaction during the updating of policy and Lagrange multipliers. Finally,
we conduct extensive experiments and an ablation study using the OneWeb and
Telesat mega-constellations. Results demonstrate that CMADR reduces the packet
delay by a minimum of 21% and 15%, while meeting stringent energy consumption
and packet loss rate constraints, outperforming several baseline algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a probabilistic model of a learner's
state of mastery corresponding to a knowledge component. It considers the
learner's state of mastery as a "hidden" or latent binary variable and updates
this state based on the observed correctness of the learner's response using
parameters that represent transition probabilities between states. BKT is often
represented as a Hidden Markov Model and the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm is used to infer these parameters. However, this algorithm can suffer
from several issues including producing multiple viable sets of parameters,
settling into a local minima, producing degenerate parameter values, and a high
computational cost during fitting. This paper takes a "from first principles"
approach to deriving constraints that can be imposed on the BKT parameter
space. Starting from the basic mathematical truths of probability and building
up to the behaviors expected of the BKT parameters in real systems, this paper
presents a mathematical derivation that results in succinct constraints that
can be imposed on the BKT parameter space. Since these constraints are
necessary conditions, they can be applied prior to fitting in order to reduce
computational cost and the likelihood of issues that can emerge from the EM
procedure. In order to see that promise through, the paper further introduces a
novel algorithm for estimating BKT parameters subject to the newly defined
constraints. While the issue of degenerate parameter values has been reported
previously, this paper is the first, to our best knowledge, to derive the
constrains from first principles while also presenting an algorithm that
respects those constraints.

<p class="mathjax">AI-Based Safety-Critical Systems (AI-SCS) are being increasingly deployed in
the real world. These can pose a risk of harm to people and the environment.
Reducing that risk is an overarching priority during development and operation.
As more AI-SCS become autonomous, a layer of risk management via human
intervention has been removed. Following an accident it will be important to
identify causal contributions and the different responsible actors behind those
to learn from mistakes and prevent similar future events. Many authors have
commented on the "responsibility gap" where it is difficult for developers and
manufacturers to be held responsible for harmful behaviour of an AI-SCS. This
is due to the complex development cycle for AI, uncertainty in AI performance,
and dynamic operating environment. A human operator can become a "liability
sink" absorbing blame for the consequences of AI-SCS outputs they weren't
responsible for creating, and may not have understanding of.
<br />This cross-disciplinary paper considers different senses of responsibility
(role, moral, legal and causal), and how they apply in the context of AI-SCS
safety. We use a core concept (Actor(A) is responsible for Occurrence(O)) to
create role responsibility models, producing a practical method to capture
responsibility relationships and provide clarity on the previously identified
responsibility issues. Our paper demonstrates the approach with two examples: a
retrospective analysis of the Tempe Arizona fatal collision involving an
autonomous vehicle, and a safety focused predictive role-responsibility
analysis for an AI-based diabetes co-morbidity predictor. In both examples our
primary focus is on safety, aiming to reduce unfair or disproportionate blame
being placed on operators or developers. We present a discussion and avenues
for future research.

<p class="mathjax">Handwritten signature verification poses a formidable challenge in biometrics
and document authenticity. The objective is to ascertain the authenticity of a
provided handwritten signature, distinguishing between genuine and forged ones.
This issue has many applications in sectors such as finance, legal
documentation, and security. Currently, the field of computer vision and
machine learning has made significant progress in the domain of handwritten
signature verification. The outcomes, however, may be enhanced depending on the
acquired findings, the structure of the datasets, and the used models. Four
stages make up our suggested strategy. First, we collected a large dataset of
12600 images from 420 distinct individuals, and each individual has 30
signatures of a certain kind (All authors signatures are genuine). In the
subsequent stage, the best features from each image were extracted using a deep
learning model named MobileNetV2. During the feature selection step, three
selectors neighborhood component analysis (NCA), Chi2, and mutual info (MI)
were used to pull out 200, 300, 400, and 500 features, giving a total of 12
feature vectors. Finally, 12 results have been obtained by applying machine
learning techniques such as SVM with kernels (rbf, poly, and linear), KNN, DT,
Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes. Without employing feature
selection techniques, our suggested offline signature verification achieved a
classification accuracy of 91.3%, whereas using the NCA feature selection
approach with just 300 features it achieved a classification accuracy of 97.7%.
High classification accuracy was achieved using the designed and suggested
model, which also has the benefit of being a self-organized framework.
Consequently, using the optimum minimally chosen features, the proposed method
could identify the best model performance and result validation prediction
vectors.

<p class="mathjax">This paper tackles instrument tracking and 3D visualization challenges in
minimally invasive surgery (MIS), crucial for computer-assisted interventions.
Conventional and robot-assisted MIS encounter issues with limited 2D camera
projections and minimal hardware integration. The objective is to track and
visualize the entire surgical instrument, including shaft and metallic clasper,
enabling safe navigation within the surgical environment. The proposed method
involves 2D tracking based on segmentation maps, facilitating creation of
labeled dataset without extensive ground-truth knowledge. Geometric changes in
2D intervals express motion, and kinematics based algorithms process results
into 3D tracking information. Synthesized and experimental results in 2D and 3D
motion estimates demonstrate negligible errors, validating the method for
labeling and motion tracking of instruments in MIS videos. The conclusion
underscores the proposed 2D segmentation technique's simplicity and
computational efficiency, emphasizing its potential as direct plug-in for 3D
visualization in instrument tracking and MIS practices.

<p class="mathjax">Business and technology are intricately connected through logic and design.
They are equally sensitive to societal changes and may be devastated by
scandal. Cooperative multi-robot systems (MRSs) are on the rise, allowing
robots of different types and brands to work together in diverse contexts.
Generative artificial intelligence has been a dominant topic in recent
artificial intelligence (AI) discussions due to its capacity to mimic humans
through the use of natural language and the production of media, including deep
fakes. In this article, we focus specifically on the conversational aspects of
generative AI, and hence use the term Conversational Generative artificial
intelligence (CGI). Like MRSs, CGIs have enormous potential for revolutionizing
processes across sectors and transforming the way humans conduct business. From
a business perspective, cooperative MRSs alone, with potential conflicts of
interest, privacy practices, and safety concerns, require ethical examination.
MRSs empowered by CGIs demand multi-dimensional and sophisticated methods to
uncover imminent ethical pitfalls. This study focuses on ethics in
CGI-empowered MRSs while reporting the stages of developing the MORUL model.

<p class="mathjax">A compiler bug arises if the behaviour of a compiled concurrent program, as
allowed by its architecture memory model, is not a behaviour permitted by the
source program under its source model. One might reasonably think that most
compiler bugs have been found in the decade since the introduction of the C/C++
memory model. We observe that processor implementations are increasingly
exploiting the behaviour of relaxed architecture models. As such, compiled
programs may exhibit bugs not seen on older hardware. To account for this we
require model-based compiler testing.
<br />While this observation is not surprising, its implications are broad.
Compilers and their testing tools will need to be updated to follow hardware
relaxations, concurrent test generators will need to be improved, and
assumptions of prior work will need revisiting. We explore these ideas using a
compiler toolchain bug we reported in LLVM.

<p class="mathjax">The integration of machine learning in medicine has significantly improved
diagnostic precision, particularly in the interpretation of complex structures
like the human brain. Diagnosing challenging conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease has prompted the development of brain age estimation techniques. These
methods often leverage three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans, with recent studies emphasizing the efficacy of 3D convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) like 3D ResNet. However, the untapped potential of Vision
Transformers (ViTs), known for their accuracy and interpretability, persists in
this domain due to limitations in their 3D versions. This paper introduces
Triamese-ViT, an innovative adaptation of the ViT model for brain age
estimation. Our model uniquely combines ViTs from three different orientations
to capture 3D information, significantly enhancing accuracy and
interpretability. Tested on a dataset of 1351 MRI scans, Triamese-ViT achieves
a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.84, a 0.9 Spearman correlation coefficient
with chronological age, and a -0.29 Spearman correlation coefficient between
the brain age gap (BAG) and chronological age, significantly better than
previous methods for brian age estimation. A key innovation of Triamese-ViT is
its capacity to generate a comprehensive 3D-like attention map, synthesized
from 2D attention maps of each orientation-specific ViT. This feature is
particularly beneficial for in-depth brain age analysis and disease diagnosis,
offering deeper insights into brain health and the mechanisms of age-related
neural changes.

<p class="mathjax">The main aim of the paper is to create a trust and transparency in the food
supply chain system, ensuring food safety for everyone with the help of
Blockchain Technology. Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from
the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a
safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural
necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the
present supply chain market today includes various companies involving
integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper
resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all
difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger
technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This
strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority,
intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and
security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and
safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in
the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and
IoT.

<p class="mathjax">The risk of hardware Trojans being inserted at various stages of chip
production has increased in a zero-trust fabless era. To counter this, various
machine learning solutions have been developed for the detection of hardware
Trojans. While most of the focus has been on either a statistical or deep
learning approach, the limited number of Trojan-infected benchmarks affects the
detection accuracy and restricts the possibility of detecting zero-day Trojans.
To close the gap, we first employ generative adversarial networks to amplify
our data in two alternative representation modalities, a graph and a tabular,
ensuring that the dataset is distributed in a representative manner. Further,
we propose a multimodal deep learning approach to detect hardware Trojans and
evaluate the results from both early fusion and late fusion strategies. We also
estimate the uncertainty quantification metrics of each prediction for
risk-aware decision-making. The outcomes not only confirms the efficacy of our
proposed hardware Trojan detection method but also opens a new door for future
studies employing multimodality and uncertainty quantification to address other
hardware security challenges.

<p class="mathjax">The ability to handle long texts is one of the most important capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), but as the text length increases, the consumption
of resources also increases dramatically. At present, reducing resource
consumption by compressing the KV cache is a common approach. Although there
are many existing compression methods, they share a common drawback: the
compression is not lossless. That is, information is inevitably lost during the
compression process. If the compression rate is high, the probability of losing
important information increases dramatically. We propose a new method, Lossless
Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which allows for lossless compression of
information into special memory token KV pairs according to a set compression
ratio. Our experiments have achieved remarkable results, demonstrating that
LoMA can be efficiently trained and has very effective performance.

<p class="mathjax">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), as a new and promising identity management
paradigm, needs mechanisms that can ease a gradual transition of existing
services and developers towards it. Systems that bridge the gap between SSI and
established identity and access management have been proposed but still lack
adoption. We argue that they are all some combination of too complex, locked
into specific ecosystems, have no source code available, or are not
sufficiently documented. We propose a comparatively simple system that enables
SSI-based sign-ins for services that support the widespread OpenID Connect or
OAuth 2.0 protocols. Its handling of claims is highly configurable through a
single policy and designed for cross-device authentication flows involving a
smartphone identity wallet. For external interfaces, we solely rely on open
standards, such as the recent OpenID for Verifiable Credentials standards. We
provide our implementation as open-source software intended for prototyping and
as a reference. Also, we contribute a detailed technical discussion of our
particular sign-in flow. To prove its feasibility, we have successfully tested
it with existing software and realistic hardware.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years there has been significant progress in time series anomaly
detection. However, after detecting an (perhaps tentative) anomaly, can we
explain it? Such explanations would be useful to triage anomalies. For example,
in an oil refinery, should we respond to an anomaly by dispatching a hydraulic
engineer, or an intern to replace the battery on a sensor? There have been some
parallel efforts to explain anomalies, however many proposed techniques produce
explanations that are indirect, and often seem more complex than the anomaly
they seek to explain. Our review of the literature/checklists/user-manuals used
by frontline practitioners in various domains reveals an interesting
near-universal commonality. Most practitioners discuss, explain and report
anomalies in the following format: The anomaly would be like normal data A, if
not for the corruption B. The reader will appreciate that is a type of
counterfactual explanation. In this work we introduce a domain agnostic
counterfactual explanation technique to produce explanations for time series
anomalies. As we will show, our method can produce both visual and text-based
explanations that are objectively correct, intuitive and in many circumstances,
directly actionable.

<p class="mathjax">Memory is inherently entangled with prediction and planning. Flexible
behavior in biological and artificial agents depends on the interplay of
learning from the past and predicting the future in ever-changing environments.
This chapter reviews computational, behavioral, and neural evidence suggesting
these processes rely on learning the relational structure of experiences, known
as cognitive maps, and draws two key takeaways. First, that these memory
structures are organized as multiscale, compact predictive representations in
hippocampal and prefrontal cortex, or PFC, hierarchies. Second, we argue that
such predictive memory structures are crucial to the complementary functions of
the hippocampus and PFC, both for enabling a recall of detailed and coherent
past episodes as well as generalizing experiences at varying scales for
efficient prediction and planning. These insights advance our understanding of
memory and planning mechanisms in the brain and hold significant implications
for advancing artificial intelligence systems.

<p class="mathjax">Expensive ultrasonic anemometers are usually required to measure wind speed
accurately. The aim of this work is to overcome the loss of accuracy of a low
cost hot-wire anemometer caused by the changes of air temperature, by means of
a probabilistic calibration using Gaussian Process Regression. Gaussian Process
Regression is a non-parametric, Bayesian, and supervised learning method
designed to make predictions of an unknown target variable as a function of one
or more known input variables. Our approach is validated against real datasets,
obtaining a good performance in inferring the actual wind speed values. By
performing, before its real use in the field, a calibration of the hot-wire
anemometer taking into account air temperature, permits that the wind speed can
be estimated for the typical range of ambient temperatures, including a
grounded uncertainty estimation for each speed measure.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the size and
complexity of System-on-Chip designs targeting different specialized
applications. The cost of an undetected bug in these systems is much higher
than in traditional processor systems as it may imply the loss of property or
life. The problem is further exacerbated by the ever-shrinking time-to-market
and ever-increasing demand to churn out billions of devices. Despite decades of
research in simulation and formal methods for debugging and verification, it is
still one of the most time-consuming and resource intensive processes in
contemporary hardware design cycle. In this work, we propose VeriBug, which
leverages recent advances in deep learning to accelerate debugging at the
Register-Transfer Level and generates explanations of likely root causes.
First, VeriBug uses control-data flow graph of a hardware design and learns to
execute design statements by analyzing the context of operands and their
assignments. Then, it assigns an importance score to each operand in a design
statement and uses that score for generating explanations for failures.
Finally, VeriBug produces a heatmap highlighting potential buggy source code
portions. Our experiments show that VeriBug can achieve an average bug
localization coverage of 82.5% on open-source designs and different types of
injected bugs.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models have gained significant attention in the
computer vision community in the recent past with state-of-the-art visual
quality and produced impressive demonstrations. Since then, technopreneurs have
sought to leverage NeRF models into a profitable business. Therefore, NeRF
models make it worth the risk of plagiarizers illegally copying,
re-distributing, or misusing those models. This paper proposes a comprehensive
intellectual property (IP) protection framework for the NeRF model in both
black-box and white-box settings, namely IPR-NeRF. In the black-box setting, a
diffusion-based solution is introduced to embed and extract the watermark via a
two-stage optimization process. In the white-box setting, a designated digital
signature is embedded into the weights of the NeRF model by adopting the sign
loss objective. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that not only does our
approach maintain the fidelity (\ie, the rendering quality) of IPR-NeRF models,
but it is also robust against both ambiguity and removal attacks compared to
prior arts.

<p class="mathjax">Annotation scarcity and cross-modality/stain data distribution shifts are two
major obstacles hindering the application of deep learning models for nuclei
analysis, which holds a broad spectrum of potential applications in digital
pathology. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been
proposed to mitigate the distributional gap between different imaging
modalities for unsupervised nuclei segmentation in histopathology images.
However, existing UDA methods are built upon the assumption that data
distributions within each domain should be uniform. Based on the
over-simplified supposition, they propose to align the histopathology target
domain with the source domain integrally, neglecting severe intra-domain
discrepancy over subpartitions incurred by mixed cancer types and sampling
organs. In this paper, for the first time, we propose to explicitly consider
the heterogeneity within the histopathology domain and introduce open compound
domain adaptation (OCDA) to resolve the crux. In specific, a two-stage
disentanglement framework is proposed to acquire domain-invariant feature
representations at both image and instance levels. The holistic design
addresses the limitations of existing OCDA approaches which struggle to capture
instance-wise variations. Two regularization strategies are specifically
devised herein to leverage the rich subpartition-specific characteristics in
histopathology images and facilitate subdomain decomposition. Moreover, we
propose a dual-branch nucleus shape and structure preserving module to prevent
nucleus over-generation and deformation in the synthesized images. Experimental
results on both cross-modality and cross-stain scenarios over a broad range of
diverse datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with
state-of-the-art UDA and OCDA methods.

<p class="mathjax">Gossip learning (GL), as a decentralized alternative to federated learning
(FL), is more suitable for resource-constrained wireless networks, such as
FANETs that are formed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). GL can significantly
enhance the efficiency and extend the battery life of UAV networks. Despite the
advantages, the performance of GL is strongly affected by data distribution,
communication speed, and network connectivity. However, how these factors
influence the GL convergence is still unclear. Existing work studied the
convergence of GL based on a virtual quantity for the sake of convenience,
which fail to reflect the real state of the network when some nodes are
inaccessible. In this paper, we formulate and investigate the impact of
inaccessible nodes to GL under a dynamic network topology. We first decompose
the weight divergence by whether the node is accessible or not. Then, we
investigate the GL convergence under the dynamic of node accessibility and
theoretically provide how the number of inaccessible nodes, data
non-i.i.d.-ness, and duration of inaccessibility affect the convergence.
Extensive experiments are carried out in practical settings to comprehensively
verify the correctness of our theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">A common pipeline in functional data analysis is to first convert the
discretely observed data to smooth functions, and then represent the functions
by a finite-dimensional vector of coefficients summarizing the information.
Existing methods for data smoothing and dimensional reduction mainly focus on
learning the linear mappings from the data space to the representation space,
however, learning only the linear representations may not be sufficient. In
this study, we propose to learn the nonlinear representations of functional
data using neural network autoencoders designed to process data in the form it
is usually collected without the need of preprocessing. We design the encoder
to employ a projection layer computing the weighted inner product of the
functional data and functional weights over the observed timestamp, and the
decoder to apply a recovery layer that maps the finite-dimensional vector
extracted from the functional data back to functional space using a set of
predetermined basis functions. The developed architecture can accommodate both
regularly and irregularly spaced data. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms functional principal component analysis in terms of
prediction and classification, and maintains superior smoothing ability and
better computational efficiency in comparison to the conventional autoencoders
under both linear and nonlinear settings.

<p class="mathjax">In the e-commerce advertising scenario, estimating the true probabilities
(known as a calibrated estimate) on CTR and CVR is critical and can directly
affect the benefits of the buyer, seller and platform. Previous research has
introduced numerous solutions for addressing the calibration problem. These
methods typically involve the training of calibrators using a validation set
and subsequently applying these calibrators to correct the original estimated
values during online inference. However, what sets e-commerce advertising
scenarios is the challenge of multi-field calibration. Multi-field calibration
can be subdivided into two distinct sub-problems: value calibration and shape
calibration. Value calibration is defined as no over- or under-estimation for
each value under concerned fields. Shape calibration is defined as no over- or
under-estimation for each subset of the pCTR within the specified range under
condition of concerned fields. In order to achieve shape calibration and value
calibration, it is necessary to have a strong data utilization ability.Because
the quantity of pCTR specified range for single field-value sample is relative
small, which makes the calibrator more difficult to train. However the existing
methods cannot simultaneously fulfill both value calibration and shape
calibration. To solve these problems, we propose a new method named Deep
Ensemble Shape Calibration (DESC). We introduce innovative basis calibration
functions, which enhance both function expression capabilities and data
utilization by combining these basis calibration functions. A significant
advancement lies in the development of an allocator capable of allocating the
most suitable shape calibrators to different estimation error distributions
within diverse fields and values.

<p class="mathjax">The stringent requirements for the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) accelerator's
reliability stand along with the need for reducing the computational burden on
the hardware platforms, i.e. reducing the energy consumption and execution time
as well as increasing the efficiency of DNN accelerators. Moreover, the growing
demand for specialized DNN accelerators with tailored requirements,
particularly for safety-critical applications, necessitates a comprehensive
design space exploration to enable the development of efficient and robust
accelerators that meet those requirements. Therefore, the trade-off between
hardware performance, i.e. area and delay, and the reliability of the DNN
accelerator implementation becomes critical and requires tools for analysis.
This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for exploring and enabling a
holistic assessment of the trilateral impact of quantization on model accuracy,
activation fault reliability, and hardware efficiency. A fully automated
framework is introduced that is capable of applying various quantization-aware
techniques, fault injection, and hardware implementation, thus enabling the
measurement of hardware parameters. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel
lightweight protection technique integrated within the framework to ensure the
dependable deployment of the final systolic-array-based FPGA implementation.
The experiments on established benchmarks demonstrate the analysis flow and the
profound implications of quantization on reliability, hardware performance, and
network accuracy, particularly concerning the transient faults in the network's
activations.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the problem of community detection on multiple
potentially correlated graphs from an information-theoretical perspective. We
first put forth a random graph model, called the multi-view stochastic block
model (MVSBM), designed to generate correlated graphs on the same set of nodes
(with cardinality $n$). The $n$ nodes are partitioned into two disjoint
communities of equal size. The presence or absence of edges in the graphs for
each pair of nodes depends on whether the two nodes belong to the same
community or not. The objective for the learner is to recover the hidden
communities with observed graphs. Our technical contributions are two-fold: (i)
We establish an information-theoretic upper bound (Theorem~1) showing that
exact recovery of community is achievable when the model parameters of MVSBM
exceed a certain threshold. (ii) Conversely, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound (Theorem~2) showing that when the model parameters of MVSBM fall
below the aforementioned threshold, then for any estimator, the expected number
of misclassified nodes will always be greater than one. Our results for the
MVSBM recover several prior results for community detection in the standard SBM
as well as in multiple independent SBMs as special cases.

<p class="mathjax">Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology brings significant advantages, such as giving
a voice to those with speech impairments, but also enables audio deepfakes and
spoofs. The former mislead individuals and may propagate misinformation, while
the latter undermine voice biometric security systems. AI-based detection can
help to address these challenges by automatically differentiating between
genuine and fabricated voice recordings. However, these models are only as good
as their training data, which currently is severely limited due to an
overwhelming concentration on English and Chinese audio in anti-spoofing
databases, thus restricting its worldwide effectiveness. In response, this
paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoof Dataset (MLAAD), created
using 52 TTS models, comprising 19 different architectures, to generate 160.1
hours of synthetic voice in 23 different languages. We train and evaluate three
state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD, and observe that MLAAD
demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild or
FakeOrReal when used as a training resource. Furthermore, in comparison with
the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary
resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately
outperformed each other, both excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD
and making trained models accessible via an interactive webserver , we aim to
democratize antispoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of
specialists, thus contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and
deepfakes.

<p class="mathjax">The quality of recorded videos and images is significantly influenced by the
camera's field of view (FOV). In critical applications like surveillance
systems and self-driving cars, an inadequate FOV can give rise to severe safety
and security concerns, including car accidents and thefts due to the failure to
detect individuals and objects. The conventional methods for establishing the
correct FOV heavily rely on human judgment and lack automated mechanisms to
assess video and image quality based on FOV. In this paper, we introduce an
innovative approach that harnesses semantic line detection and classification
alongside deep Hough transform to identify semantic lines, thus ensuring a
suitable FOV by understanding 3D view through parallel lines. Our approach
yields an effective F1 score of 0.729 on the public EgoCart dataset, coupled
with a notably high median score in the line placement metric. We illustrate
that our method offers a straightforward means of assessing the quality of the
camera's field of view, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.8\%. This
metric can serve as a proxy for evaluating the potential performance of video
and image quality applications.

<p class="mathjax">Learning neural operators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
has attracted great attention due to its high inference efficiency. However,
training such operators requires generating a substantial amount of labeled
data, i.e., PDE problems together with their solutions. The data generation
process is exceptionally time-consuming, as it involves solving numerous
systems of linear equations to obtain numerical solutions to the PDEs. Many
existing methods solve these systems independently without considering their
inherent similarities, resulting in extremely redundant computations. To tackle
this problem, we propose a novel method, namely Sorting Krylov Recycling (SKR),
to boost the efficiency of solving these systems, thus significantly
accelerating data generation for neural operators training. To the best of our
knowledge, SKR is the first attempt to address the time-consuming nature of
data generation for learning neural operators. The working horse of SKR is
Krylov subspace recycling, a powerful technique for solving a series of
interrelated systems by leveraging their inherent similarities. Specifically,
SKR employs a sorting algorithm to arrange these systems in a sequence, where
adjacent systems exhibit high similarities. Then it equips a solver with Krylov
subspace recycling to solve the systems sequentially instead of independently,

and extensive experiments demonstrate that SKR can significantly accelerate
neural operator data generation, achieving a remarkable speedup of up to 13.9
times.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning has been increasingly used to obtain individualized
neuroimaging signatures for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and response to
treatment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it
has contributed to a better understanding of disease heterogeneity by
identifying disease subtypes that present significant differences in various
brain phenotypic measures. In this review, we first present a systematic
literature overview of studies using machine learning and multimodal MRI to
unravel disease heterogeneity in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative
disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, major depressive
disorder, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, as well as their
potential in transdiagnostic settings. Subsequently, we summarize relevant
machine learning methodologies and discuss an emerging paradigm which we call
dimensional neuroimaging endophenotype (DNE). DNE dissects the neurobiological
heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders into a low
dimensional yet informative, quantitative brain phenotypic representation,
serving as a robust intermediate phenotype (i.e., endophenotype) largely
reflecting underlying genetics and etiology. Finally, we discuss the potential
clinical implications of the current findings and envision future research
avenues.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding the encoded representation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has
been a fundamental yet challenging objective. In this work, we focus on two
possible directions for analyzing representations of DNNs by studying simple
image classification tasks. Specifically, we consider \textit{On-Off pattern}
and \textit{PathCount} for investigating how information is stored in deep
representations. On-off pattern of a neuron is decided as `on' or `off'
depending on whether the neuron's activation after ReLU is non-zero or zero.
PathCount is the number of paths that transmit non-zero energy from the input
to a neuron. We investigate how neurons in the network encodes information by
replacing each layer's activation with On-Off pattern or PathCount and
evaluating its effect on classification performance. We also examine
correlation between representation and PathCount. Finally, we show a possible
way to improve an existing DNN interpretation method, Class Activation Map
(CAM), by directly utilizing On-Off or PathCount.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing trust concerns in Smart Home (SH) systems is imperative due to the
limited study on preservation approaches that focus on analyzing and evaluating
privacy threats for effective risk management. While most research focuses
primarily on user privacy, device data privacy, especially identity privacy, is
almost neglected, which can significantly impact overall user privacy within
the SH system. To this end, our study incorporates privacy engineering (PE)
principles in the SH system that consider user and device data privacy. We
start with a comprehensive reference model for a typical SH system. Based on
the initial stage of LINDDUN PRO for the PE framework, we present a data flow
diagram (DFD) based on a typical SH reference model to better understand SH
system operations. To identify potential areas of privacy threat and perform a
privacy threat analysis (PTA), we employ the LINDDUN PRO threat model. Then, a
privacy impact assessment (PIA) was carried out to implement privacy risk
management by prioritizing privacy threats based on their likelihood of
occurrence and potential consequences. Finally, we suggest possible privacy
enhancement techniques (PETs) that can mitigate some of these threats. The
study aims to elucidate the main threats to privacy, associated risks, and
effective prioritization of privacy control in SH systems. The outcomes of this
study are expected to benefit SH stakeholders, including vendors, cloud
providers, users, researchers, and regulatory bodies in the SH systems domain.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control
and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models,
however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning.
This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot
dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of
many robots are described in terms of their generalized coordinates on a matrix
Lie group, e.g. on SE(3) for ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, and
generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This paper
proposes a (port-)Hamiltonian formulation over a Lie group of the structure of
a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the robot
dynamics. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees
energy conservation principle and Lie group's constraints by construction and
explicitly accounts for energy-dissipation effect such as friction and drag
forces in the dynamics model. We develop energy shaping and damping injection
control for the learned, potentially under-actuated Hamiltonian dynamics to
enable a unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with
various robot platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Let $G$ be a planar graph and $I_s$ and $I_t$ be two independent sets in $G$,
each of size $k$. We begin with a ``token'' on each vertex of $I_s$ and seek to
move all tokens to $I_t$, by repeated ``token jumping'', removing a single
token from one vertex and placing it on another vertex. We require that each
intermediate arrangement of tokens again specifies an independent set of size
$k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we ask whether there exists a sequence of
token jumps that transforms $I_s$ to $I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this
problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito,
Kami\'nski, and Ono to be fixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is
fixed, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in the order of $G$. Here
we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by showing
that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we
transform an arbitrary input problem on a planar graph into an equivalent
problem on a (planar) graph with order $O(k)$.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of artificial intelligence, where a vast majority of data is
unstructured, obtaining substantial amounts of labeled data to train supervised
machine learning models poses a significant challenge. To address this, we
delve into few-shot and active learning, where are goal is to improve AI models
with human feedback on a few labeled examples. This paper focuses on
understanding how a continuous feedback loop can refine models, thereby
enhancing their accuracy, recall, and precision through incremental human
input. By employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, BERT, and
SetFit, we aim to analyze the efficacy of using a limited number of labeled
examples to substantially improve model accuracy. We benchmark this approach on
the Financial Phrasebank, Banking, Craigslist, Trec, Amazon Reviews datasets to
prove that with just a few labeled examples, we are able to surpass the
accuracy of zero shot large language models to provide enhanced text
classification performance. We demonstrate that rather than needing to manually
label millions of rows of data, we just need to label a few and the model can
effectively predict the rest.

<p class="mathjax">We study the benefit of sharing representations among tasks to enable the
effective use of deep neural networks in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning. We
leverage the assumption that learning from different tasks, sharing common
properties, is helpful to generalize the knowledge of them resulting in a more
effective feature extraction compared to learning a single task. Intuitively,
the resulting set of features offers performance benefits when used by
Reinforcement Learning algorithms. We prove this by providing theoretical
guarantees that highlight the conditions for which is convenient to share
representations among tasks, extending the well-known finite-time bounds of
Approximate Value-Iteration to the multi-task setting. In addition, we
complement our analysis by proposing multi-task extensions of three
Reinforcement Learning algorithms that we empirically evaluate on widely used
Reinforcement Learning benchmarks showing significant improvements over the
single-task counterparts in terms of sample efficiency and performance.

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of applications. These models excel in
generating text completions that are contextually coherent and cover an
extensive array of subjects. However, the vast datasets required for their
training make aligning response styles during the pretraining and instruction
tuning phases challenging. Consequently, an additional alignment phase is
typically employed, wherein the model is further trained with human preference
data to better align its outputs with human expectations. While this process
doesn't introduce new capabilities per se, it does accentuate generation styles
innate to the model. This paper explores the utilization of counterfactual
prompting within the framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
the model's style without relying on human intervention. We demonstrate that
this method effectively instils desirable behaviour, mitigates undesirable
ones, and encourages the model to disregard inappropriate instructions. Our
findings suggest that counterfactual prompting with DPO presents a low-resource
way to fine-tune LLMs to meet the demands for responsible and ethically aligned
AI systems.

<p class="mathjax">As the deployment of deep learning models continues to expand across
industries, the threat of malicious incursions aimed at gaining access to these
deployed models is on the rise. Should an attacker gain access to a deployed
model, whether through server breaches, insider attacks, or model inversion
techniques, they can then construct white-box adversarial attacks to manipulate
the model's classification outcomes, thereby posing significant risks to
organizations that rely on these models for critical tasks. Model owners need
mechanisms to protect themselves against such losses without the necessity of
acquiring fresh training data - a process that typically demands substantial
investments in time and capital.
<br />In this paper, we explore the feasibility of generating multiple versions of
a model that possess different attack properties, without acquiring new
training data or changing model architecture. The model owner can deploy one
version at a time and replace a leaked version immediately with a new version.
The newly deployed model version can resist adversarial attacks generated
leveraging white-box access to one or all previously leaked versions. We show
theoretically that this can be accomplished by incorporating parameterized
hidden distributions into the model training data, forcing the model to learn
task-irrelevant features uniquely defined by the chosen data. Additionally,
optimal choices of hidden distributions can produce a sequence of model
versions capable of resisting compound transferability attacks over time.
Leveraging our analytical insights, we design and implement a practical model
versioning method for DNN classifiers, which leads to significant robustness
improvements over existing methods. We believe our work presents a promising
direction for safeguarding DNN services beyond their initial deployment.

theory-based approach, in conjunction with other technologies like eXtended
Detection and Response (XDR), can effectively mitigate cyberattacks. As quantum
computing presents new challenges to ZT and cybersecurity as a whole, the paper
delves into the intricacies of ZT migration, automation, and orchestration,
addressing the complexities associated with these aspects. Finally, the paper
provides a best practice approach for the seamless implementation of ZT in
organizations, laying out the proposed guidelines to facilitate organizations
in their transition towards a more secure ZT model. The study aims to support
organizations in successfully implementing ZT and enhancing their cybersecurity
measures.

developing effective, multi-modal heterogeneous ensembles for classification.
eipy simultaneously provides both a rigorous, and user-friendly framework for
comparing and selecting the best-performing multi-modal data integration and
predictive modeling methods by systematically evaluating their performance
using nested cross-validation. The package is designed to leverage
scikit-learn-like estimators as components to build multi-modal predictive

<p class="mathjax">In the $0$-Extension problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph
$G=(V,E,c)$, a set $T\subseteq V$ of its vertices called terminals, and a
semi-metric $D$ over $T$, and the goal is to find an assignment $f$ of each
non-terminal vertex to a terminal, minimizing the sum, over all edges $(u,v)\in
E$, the product of the edge weight $c(u,v)$ and the distance $D(f(u),f(v))$
between the terminals that $u,v$ are mapped to. Current best approximation
algorithms on $0$-Extension are based on rounding a linear programming
relaxation called the \emph{semi-metric LP relaxation}. The integrality gap of
this LP, with best upper bound $O(\log |T|/\log\log |T|)$ and best lower bound
$\Omega((\log |T|)^{2/3})$, has been shown to be closely related to the best
quality of cut and flow vertex sparsifiers.
<br />We study a variant of the $0$-Extension problem where Steiner vertices are
allowed. Specifically, we focus on the integrality gap of the same semi-metric
LP relaxation to this new problem. Following from previous work, this new
integrality gap turns out to be closely related to the quality achievable by
cut/flow vertex sparsifiers with Steiner nodes, a major open problem in graph
compression. Our main result is that the new integrality gap stays
superconstant $\Omega(\log\log |T|)$ even if we allow a super-linear
$O(|T|\log^{1-\varepsilon}|T|)$ number of Steiner nodes.

<p class="mathjax">Bilevel optimization is an important formulation for many machine learning
problems. Current bilevel optimization algorithms assume that the gradient of
the upper-level function is Lipschitz. However, recent studies reveal that
certain neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs) exhibit potential unbounded smoothness,
rendering conventional bilevel optimization algorithms unsuitable. In this
paper, we design a new bilevel optimization algorithm, namely BO-REP, to
address this challenge. This algorithm updates the upper-level variable using
normalized momentum and incorporates two novel techniques for updating the
lower-level variable: \textit{initialization refinement} and \textit{periodic
updates}. Specifically, once the upper-level variable is initialized, a
subroutine is invoked to obtain a refined estimate of the corresponding optimal
lower-level variable, and the lower-level variable is updated only after every
specific period instead of each iteration. When the upper-level problem is
nonconvex and unbounded smooth, and the lower-level problem is strongly convex,
we prove that our algorithm requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^4)$
iterations to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the stochastic setting,
where each iteration involves calling a stochastic gradient or Hessian-vector
product oracle. Notably, this result matches the state-of-the-art complexity
results under the bounded smoothness setting and without mean-squared
smoothness of the stochastic gradient, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof
relies on novel technical lemmas for the periodically updated lower-level
variable, which are of independent interest. Our experiments on
hyper-representation learning, hyperparameter optimization, and data
hyper-cleaning for text classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Social computing is the study of how technology shapes human social
interactions. This topic has become increasingly relevant to secondary school
students (ages 11--18) as more of young people's everyday social experiences
take place online, particularly with the continuing effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. However, social computing topics are rarely touched upon in existing
middle and high school curricula. We seek to introduce concepts from social
computing to secondary school students so they can understand how computing has
wide-ranging social implications that touch upon their everyday lives, as well
as think critically about both the positive and negative sides of different
social technology designs.
<br />In this report, we present a series of six lessons combining presentations
and hands-on activities covering topics within social computing and detail our
experience teaching these lessons to approximately 1,405 students across 13
middle and high schools in our local school district. We developed lessons
covering how social computing relates to the topics of Data Management,
Encrypted Messaging, Human-Computer Interaction Careers, Machine Learning and
Bias, Misinformation, and Online Behavior. We found that 81.13% of students
expressed greater interest in the content of our lessons compared to their
interest in STEM overall. We also found from pre- and post-lesson comprehension
questions that 63.65% learned new concepts from the main activity. We release
all lesson materials on a website for public use. From our experience, we
observed that students were engaged in these topics and found enjoyment in
finding connections between computing and their own lives.

<p class="mathjax">Although the capacity of deep generative models for image generation, such as
Diffusion Models (DMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has
dramatically improved in recent years, much of their success can be attributed
to computationally expensive architectures. This has limited their adoption and
use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while
significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and
inference. In this work, we present LadaGAN, an efficient generative
adversarial network that is built upon a novel Transformer block named
Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention
mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the
quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and
discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the
training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN
consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on
benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more
efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of
magnitude less computational resources.

<p class="mathjax">The structured $\varepsilon$-stability radius is introduced as a quantity to
assess the robustness of transient bounds of solutions to linear differential
equations under structured perturbations of the matrix. This applies to general
linear structures such as complex or real matrices with a given sparsity
pattern or with restricted range and corange, or special classes such as
Toeplitz matrices. The notion conceptually combines unstructured and structured
pseudospectra in a joint pseudospectrum, allowing for the use of resolvent
bounds as with unstructured pseudospectra and for structured perturbations as
with structured pseudospectra. We propose and study an algorithm for computing
the structured $\varepsilon$-stability radius. This algorithm solves eigenvalue
optimization problems via suitably discretized rank-1 matrix differential
equations that originate from a gradient system. The proposed algorithm has
essentially the same computational cost as the known rank-1 algorithms for
computing unstructured and structured stability radii. Numerical experiments
illustrate the behavior of the algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">As with many machine learning problems, the progress of image generation
methods hinges on good evaluation metrics. One of the most popular is the
Frechet Inception Distance (FID). FID estimates the distance between a
distribution of Inception-v3 features of real images, and those of images
generated by the algorithm. We highlight important drawbacks of FID:
Inception's poor representation of the rich and varied content generated by
modern text-to-image models, incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample
complexity. We call for a reevaluation of FID's use as the primary quality
metric for generated images. We empirically demonstrate that FID contradicts
human raters, it does not reflect gradual improvement of iterative
text-to-image models, it does not capture distortion levels, and that it
produces inconsistent results when varying the sample size. We also propose an
alternative new metric, CMMD, based on richer CLIP embeddings and the maximum
mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel. It is an unbiased
estimator that does not make any assumptions on the probability distribution of
the embeddings and is sample efficient. Through extensive experiments and
analysis, we demonstrate that FID-based evaluations of text-to-image models may
be unreliable, and that CMMD offers a more robust and reliable assessment of
image quality.

<p class="mathjax">Advancements in machine learning (ML) have significantly revolutionized
medical image analysis, prompting hospitals to rely on external ML services.
However, the exchange of sensitive patient data, such as chest X-rays, poses
inherent privacy risks when shared with third parties. Addressing this concern,
we propose MedBlindTuner, a privacy-preserving framework leveraging fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) and a data-efficient image transformer (DEiT).
MedBlindTuner enables the training of ML models exclusively on FHE-encrypted
medical images. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that MedBlindTuner
achieves comparable accuracy to models trained on non-encrypted images,
offering a secure solution for outsourcing ML computations while preserving
patient data privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
uses data-efficient image transformers and fully homomorphic encryption in this

<p class="mathjax">Background. Within the software industry, it is commonly estimated that
software professionals invest a substantial portion of their work hours in the
process of understanding existing systems. In this context, an ineffective
technical onboarding process, which introduces newcomers to software under
development, can result in a prolonged period for them to absorb the necessary
knowledge required to become productive in their roles. Goal. The present study
aims to explore the familiarity of managers, leaders, and developers with
software visualization tools and how these tools are employed to facilitate the
technical onboarding of new team members. Method. To address the research
problem, we built upon the insights gained through the literature and embraced
a sequential exploratory approach. This approach incorporated quantitative and
qualitative analyses of data collected from practitioners using questionnaires
and semi-structured interviews. Findings. Our findings demonstrate a gap
between the concept of software visualization and the practical use of
onboarding tools and techniques. Overall, practitioners do not systematically
incorporate software visualization tools into their technical onboarding
processes due to a lack of conceptual understanding and awareness of their
potential benefits. Conclusion. The software industry could benefit from
standardized and evolving onboarding models, improved by incorporating software
visualization techniques and tools to support program comprehension of
newcomers in the software projects.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of robot action recognition, identifying distinct but spatially
proximate arm movements using vision systems in noisy environments poses a
significant challenge. This paper studies robot arm action recognition in noisy
environments using machine learning techniques. Specifically, a vision system
is used to track the robot's movements followed by a deep learning model to
extract the arm's key points. Through a comparative analysis of machine
learning methods, the effectiveness and robustness of this model are assessed
in noisy environments. A case study was conducted using the Tic-Tac-Toe game in
a 3-by-3 grid environment, where the focus is to accurately identify the
actions of the arms in selecting specific locations within this constrained
environment. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve precise
key point detection and action classification despite the addition of noise and
uncertainties to the dataset.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant
performance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent
studies have found that LLMs often resort to shortcuts when performing tasks,
creating an illusion of enhanced performance while lacking generalizability in
their decision rules. This phenomenon introduces challenges in accurately
assessing natural language understanding in LLMs. Our paper provides a concise
survey of relevant research in this area and puts forth a perspective on the
implications of shortcut learning in the evaluation of language models,
specifically for NLU tasks. This paper urges more research efforts to be put
towards deepening our comprehension of shortcut learning, contributing to the
development of more robust language models, and raising the standards of NLU
evaluation in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual wide-area networks (WANs) are WAN-as-a-service cloud offerings that
aim to bring the performance benefits of dedicated wide-area interconnects to
enterprise customers. In this work, we show that the topology of a virtual WAN
can render it both performance and cost inefficient. We develop Cornifer, a
tool that designs virtual WAN topologies by deciding the number of virtual WAN
nodes and their location in the cloud to minimize connection latency at low
cost to enterprises. By leveraging millions of latency measurements from
vantage points across the world to cloud points of presence, Cornifer designs
virtual WAN topologies that improve weighted client latency by 26% and lower
cost by 28% compared to the state-of-the-art. Cornifer identifies virtual WAN
topologies at the Pareto frontier of the deployment cost vs. connection latency
trade-off and proposes a heuristic for automatic selection of Pareto-optimal
virtual WAN topologies for enterprises.

<p class="mathjax">Contemporary approaches to data management are increasingly relying on
unified analytics and AI platforms to foster collaboration, interoperability,
seamless access to reliable data, and high performance. Data Lakes featuring
open standard table formats such as Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg
are central components of these data architectures. Choosing the right format
for managing a table is crucial for achieving the objectives mentioned above.
The challenge lies in selecting the best format, a task that is onerous and can
yield temporary results, as the ideal choice may shift over time with data
growth, evolving workloads, and the competitive development of table formats
and processing engines. Moreover, restricting data access to a single format
can hinder data sharing resulting in diminished business value over the long
term. The ability to seamlessly interoperate between formats and with
negligible overhead can effectively address these challenges. Our solution in
this direction is an innovative omni-directional translator, XTable, that
facilitates writing data in one format and reading it in any format, thus
achieving the desired format interoperability. In this work, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of XTable through application scenarios inspired by real-world
use cases.

<p class="mathjax">Hyper-parameter optimization is the black art of tuning a learner's control
parameters. In software analytics, a repeated result is that such tuning can
result in dramatic performance improvements. Despite this, hyper-parameter
optimization is often applied rarely or poorly in software analytics--perhaps
due to the CPU cost of exploring all those parameter options can be
prohibitive.
<br />We theorize that learners generalize better when the loss landscape is
``smooth''. This theory is useful since the influence on ``smoothness'' of
different hyper-parameter choices can be tested very quickly (e.g. for a deep
learner, after just one epoch).
<br />To test this theory, this paper implements and tests SMOOTHIE, a novel
hyper-parameter optimizer that guides its optimizations via considerations of
``smothness''. The experiments of this paper test SMOOTHIE on numerous SE tasks
including (a) GitHub issue lifetime prediction; (b) detecting false alarms in
static code warnings; (c) defect prediction, and (d) a set of standard ML
datasets. In all these experiments, SMOOTHIE out-performed state-of-the-art
optimizers. Better yet, SMOOTHIE ran 300% faster than the prior state-of-the
art. We hence conclude that this theory (that hyper-parameter optimization is
best viewed as a ``smoothing'' function for the decision landscape), is both
theoretically interesting and practically very useful.

once adopted by all agents of a congestion game, results in game-dynamics that
converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash Equilibrium in a polynomial number
of rounds with respect to $1/\epsilon$, the number of players and the number of
available resources. The proposed algorithm also guarantees sublinear regret to
any agent adopting it. As a result, our work answers an open question from

<p class="mathjax">In this paper we propose a new non-linear classifier based on a combination
of locally linear classifiers. A well known optimization formulation is given
as we cast the problem in a $\ell_1$ Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem
using many locally linear kernels. Since the number of such kernels is huge, we
provide a scalable generic MKL training algorithm handling streaming kernels.
With respect to the inference time, the resulting classifier fits the gap
between high accuracy but slow non-linear classifiers (such as classical MKL)
and fast but low accuracy linear classifiers.

<p class="mathjax">Magnetic navigation (MagNav) is a rising alternative to the Global
Positioning System (GPS) and has proven useful for aircraft navigation.
Traditional aircraft navigation systems, while effective, face limitations in
precision and reliability in certain environments and against attacks. Airborne
MagNav leverages the Earth's magnetic field to provide accurate positional
information. However, external magnetic fields induced by aircraft electronics
and Earth's large-scale magnetic fields disrupt the weaker signal of interest.
We introduce a physics-informed approach using Tolles-Lawson coefficients for
compensation and Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) to remove complex, noisy
signals derived from the aircraft's magnetic sources. Using real flight data
with magnetometer measurements and aircraft measurements, we observe up to a
64% reduction in aeromagnetic compensation error (RMSE nT), outperforming
conventional models. This significant improvement underscores the potential of
a physics-informed, machine learning approach for extracting clean, reliable,
and accurate magnetic signals for MagNav positional estimation.

<p class="mathjax">Patients derive numerous benefits from reading their clinical notes,
including an increased sense of control over their health and improved
understanding of their care plan. However, complex medical concepts and jargon
within clinical notes hinder patient comprehension and may lead to anxiety. We
developed a patient-facing tool to make clinical notes more readable,
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simplify, extract information from,
and add context to notes. We prompt engineered GPT-4 to perform these
augmentation tasks on real clinical notes donated by breast cancer survivors
and synthetic notes generated by a clinician, a total of 12 notes with 3868
words. In June 2023, 200 female-identifying US-based participants were randomly
assigned three clinical notes with varying levels of augmentations using our
tool. Participants answered questions about each note, evaluating their
understanding of follow-up actions and self-reported confidence. We found that
augmentations were associated with a significant increase in action
understanding score (0.63 $\pm$ 0.04 for select augmentations, compared to 0.54
$\pm$ 0.02 for the control) with p=0.002. In-depth interviews of
self-identifying breast cancer patients (N=7) were also conducted via video
conferencing. Augmentations, especially definitions, elicited positive
responses among the seven participants, with some concerns about relying on
LLMs. Augmentations were evaluated for errors by clinicians, and we found
misleading errors occur, with errors more common in real donated notes than
synthetic notes, illustrating the importance of carefully written clinical
notes. Augmentations improve some but not all readability metrics. This work
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve patients' experience with
clinical notes at a lower burden to clinicians. However, having a human in the
loop is important to correct potential model errors.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the sequential design of remedial control actions in
response to system anomalies for the ultimate objective of preventing
blackouts. A physics-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework is designed
to identify effective sequences of real-time remedial look-ahead decisions
accounting for the long-term impact on the system's stability. The paper
considers a space of control actions that involve both discrete-valued
transmission line-switching decisions (line reconnections and removals) and
continuous-valued generator adjustments. To identify an effective blackout
mitigation policy, a physics-guided approach is designed that uses power-flow
sensitivity factors associated with the power transmission network to guide the
RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive empirical evaluations using
the open-source Grid2Op platform demonstrate the notable advantages of
incorporating physical signals into RL decisions, establishing the gains of the
proposed physics-guided approach compared to its black box counterparts. One
important observation is that strategically~\emph{removing} transmission lines,
in conjunction with multiple real-time generator adjustments, often renders
effective long-term decisions that are likely to prevent or delay blackouts.

<p class="mathjax">In causal discovery, non-Gaussianity has been used to characterize the
complete configuration of a Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM),
encompassing both the causal ordering of variables and their respective
connection strengths. However, LiNGAM can only deal with the finite-dimensional
case. To expand this concept, we extend the notion of variables to encompass
vectors and even functions, leading to the Functional Linear Non-Gaussian
Acyclic Model (Func-LiNGAM). Our motivation stems from the desire to identify
causal relationships in brain-effective connectivity tasks involving, for
example, fMRI and EEG datasets. We demonstrate why the original LiNGAM fails to
handle these inherently infinite-dimensional datasets and explain the
availability of functional data analysis from both empirical and theoretical
perspectives. {We establish theoretical guarantees of the identifiability of
the causal relationship among non-Gaussian random vectors and even random
functions in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.} To address the issue of
sparsity in discrete time points within intrinsic infinite-dimensional
functional data, we propose optimizing the coordinates of the vectors using
functional principal component analysis. Experimental results on synthetic data
verify the ability of the proposed framework to identify causal relationships
among multivariate functions using the observed samples. For real data, we
focus on analyzing the brain connectivity patterns derived from fMRI data.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces ClimateGPT, a model family of domain-specific large
language models that synthesize interdisciplinary research on climate change.
We trained two 7B models from scratch on a science-oriented dataset of 300B
tokens. For the first model, the 4.2B domain-specific tokens were included
during pre-training and the second was adapted to the climate domain after
pre-training. Additionally, ClimateGPT-7B, 13B and 70B are continuously
pre-trained from Llama~2 on a domain-specific dataset of 4.2B tokens. Each
model is instruction fine-tuned on a high-quality and human-generated
domain-specific dataset that has been created in close cooperation with climate
scientists. To reduce the number of hallucinations, we optimize the model for
retrieval augmentation and propose a hierarchical retrieval strategy. To
increase the accessibility of our model to non-English speakers, we propose to
make use of cascaded machine translation and show that this approach can
perform comparably to natively multilingual models while being easier to scale
to a large number of languages. Further, to address the intrinsic
interdisciplinary aspect of climate change we consider different research
perspectives. Therefore, the model can produce in-depth answers focusing on
different perspectives in addition to an overall answer. We propose a suite of
automatic climate-specific benchmarks to evaluate LLMs. On these benchmarks,
ClimateGPT-7B performs on par with the ten times larger Llama-2-70B Chat model
while not degrading results on general domain benchmarks. Our human evaluation
confirms the trends we saw in our benchmarks. All models were trained and
evaluated using renewable energy and are released publicly.

<p class="mathjax">The rise in eating disorders, a dangerous mental health condition with high
mortality and morbidity, has been linked to the proliferation of idealized body
images on social media. However, the link between social media and eating
disorders is far more complex. We argue that social media platforms create a
feedback loop that amplifies the growth of content and communities that promote
eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Specifically, social media
platforms make it easy for vulnerable individuals to find and connect to
like-minded others, while group dynamic processes encourage them to stay
engaged within communities that promote and glorify harmful behaviors linked to
eating disorders. We characterize this dynamic empirically through a
combination of network and language analysis. We describe a novel framework
that leverages large language models to analyze the discourse within online
communities and probe their attitudes on topics related to eating disorders to
identify potentially harmful content. Our work emphasizes the need for better
social media moderation to disrupt harmful feedback loops and protect
vulnerable individuals.

<p class="mathjax">We address a key challenge for neuro-symbolic (NeSy) systems by leveraging
convex and bilevel optimization techniques to develop a general gradient-based
framework for end-to-end neural and symbolic parameter learning. The
applicability of our framework is demonstrated with NeuPSL, a state-of-the-art
NeSy architecture. To achieve this, we propose a smooth primal and dual
formulation of NeuPSL inference and show learning gradients are functions of
the optimal dual variables. Additionally, we develop a dual block coordinate
descent algorithm for the new formulation that naturally exploits warm-starts.
This leads to over 100x learning runtime improvements over the current best
NeuPSL inference method. Finally, we provide extensive empirical evaluations
across $8$ datasets covering a range of tasks and demonstrate our learning
framework achieves up to a 16% point prediction performance improvement over
alternative learning methods.

<p class="mathjax">Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) enables distributed training of models
across multiple devices with the help of several edge servers and a cloud edge
server in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we consider HFL with
highly mobile devices, mainly targeting at vehicular networks. Through
convergence analysis, we show that mobility influences the convergence speed by
both fusing the edge data and shuffling the edge models. While mobility is
usually considered as a challenge from the perspective of communication, we
prove that it increases the convergence speed of HFL with edge-level
heterogeneous data, since more diverse data can be incorporated. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a higher speed leads to faster convergence, since it
accelerates the fusion of data. Simulation results show that mobility increases
the model accuracy of HFL by up to 15.1% when training a convolutional neural
network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Designing traffic-smoothing cruise controllers that can be deployed onto
autonomous vehicles is a key step towards improving traffic flow, reducing
congestion, and enhancing fuel efficiency in mixed autonomy traffic. We bypass
the common issue of having to carefully fine-tune a large traffic
microsimulator by leveraging real-world trajectory data from the I-24 highway
in Tennessee, replayed in a one-lane simulation. Using standard deep
reinforcement learning methods, we train energy-reducing wave-smoothing
policies. As an input to the agent, we observe the speed and distance of only
the vehicle in front, which are local states readily available on most recent
vehicles, as well as non-local observations about the downstream state of the
traffic. We show that at a low 4% autonomous vehicle penetration rate, we
achieve significant fuel savings of over 15% on trajectories exhibiting many
stop-and-go waves. Finally, we analyze the smoothing effect of the controllers
and demonstrate robustness to adding lane-changing into the simulation as well
as the removal of downstream information.

<p class="mathjax">DistServe improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) serving by
disaggregating the prefill and decoding computation. Existing LLM serving
systems colocate the two phases and batch the computation of prefill and
decoding across all users and requests. We find that this strategy not only
leads to strong prefill-decoding interferences but also couples the resource
allocation and parallelism plans for both phases. LLM applications often
emphasize individual latency for each phase: time to first token (TTFT) for the
prefill phase and time per output token (TPOT) of each request for the decoding
phase. In the presence of stringent latency requirements, existing systems have
to prioritize one latency over the other, or over-provision compute resources
to meet both.
<br />DistServe assigns prefill and decoding computation to different GPUs, hence
eliminating prefill-decoding interferences. Given the application's TTFT and
TPOT requirements, DistServe co-optimizes the resource allocation and
parallelism strategy tailored for each phase. DistServe also places the two
phases according to the serving cluster's bandwidth to minimize the
communication caused by disaggregation. As a result, DistServe significantly
improves LLM serving performance in terms of the maximum rate that can be
served within both TTFT and TPOT constraints on each GPU. Our evaluations show
that on various popular LLMs, applications, and latency requirements, DistServe
can serve 4.48x more requests or 10.2x tighter SLO, compared to
state-of-the-art systems, while staying within latency constraints for &gt; 90% of
requests.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain translation (UDT) aims to find functions that convert
samples from one domain (e.g., sketches) to another domain (e.g., photos)
without changing the high-level semantic meaning (also referred to as
``content''). The translation functions are often sought by probability
distribution matching of the transformed source domain and target domain.
CycleGAN stands as arguably the most representative approach among this line of
work. However, it was noticed in the literature that CycleGAN and variants
could fail to identify the desired translation functions and produce
content-misaligned translations. This limitation arises due to the presence of
multiple translation functions -- referred to as ``measure-preserving
automorphism" (MPA) -- in the solution space of the learning criteria. Despite
awareness of such identifiability issues, solutions have remained elusive. This
study delves into the core identifiability inquiry and introduces an MPA
elimination theory. Our analysis shows that MPA is unlikely to exist, if
multiple pairs of diverse cross-domain conditional distributions are matched by
the learning function. Our theory leads to a UDT learner using distribution
matching over auxiliary variable-induced subsets of the domains -- other than
over the entire data domains as in the classical approaches. The proposed
framework is the first to rigorously establish translation identifiability
under reasonable UDT settings, to our best knowledge. Experiments corroborate
with our theoretical claims.

<p class="mathjax">Neural style transfer (NST) is widely adopted in computer vision to generate
new images with arbitrary styles. This process leverages neural networks to
merge aesthetic elements of a style image with the structural aspects of a
content image into a harmoniously integrated visual result. However,
unauthorized NST can exploit artwork. Such misuse raises socio-technical
concerns regarding artists' rights and motivates the development of technical
approaches for the proactive protection of original creations. Adversarial
attack is a concept primarily explored in machine learning security. Our work
introduces this technique to protect artists' intellectual property. In this
paper Locally Adaptive Adversarial Color Attack (LAACA), a method for altering
images in a manner imperceptible to the human eyes but disruptive to NST.
Specifically, we design perturbations targeting image areas rich in
high-frequency content, generated by disrupting intermediate features. Our
experiments and user study confirm that by attacking NST using the proposed
method results in visually worse neural style transfer, thus making it an
effective solution for visual artwork protection.

<p class="mathjax">It is a challenging problem to characterize the air-to-ground (A2G) channel
and identify the best deployment location for 3D UAVs with the QoS awareness.
To address this problem, we propose a QoS-aware UAV 3D coverage deployment
algorithm, which simulates the three-dimensional urban road scenario, considers
the UAV communication resource capacity and vehicle communication QoS
requirements comprehensively, and then obtains the optimal UAV deployment
position by improving the genetic algorithm. Specifically, the K-means
clustering algorithm is used to cluster the vehicles, and the center locations
of these clusters serve as the initial UAV positions to generate the initial
population. Subsequently, we employ the K-means initialized grey wolf
optimization (KIGWO) algorithm to achieve the UAV location with an optimal
fitness value by performing an optimal search within the grey wolf population.
To enhance the algorithm's diversity and global search capability, we randomly
substitute this optimal location with one of the individual locations from the
initial population. The fitness value is determined by the total number of
vehicles covered by UAVs in the system, while the allocation scheme's
feasibility is evaluated based on the corresponding QoS requirements.
Competitive selection operations are conducted to retain individuals with
higher fitness values, while crossover and mutation operations are employed to
maintain the diversity of solutions. Finally, the individual with the highest
fitness, which represents the UAV deployment position that covers the maximum
number of vehicles in the entire system, is selected as the optimal solution.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
effectively enhance the reliability and vehicle communication QoS.

<p class="mathjax">Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such
as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation.
These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal
or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two
types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, to ensure that the system
maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental
conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system
functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed
independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring
the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and
coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a
self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated
triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery.The key idea
behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven
adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening an
original (i.e., ideal) system requirement to be achieved by the system, and
recovery as strengthening the weakened requirement when the environment returns
within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and
strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based
adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and
recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL),
we propose a run-time adaptation framework that automatically performs
degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a
prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of
the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles
(UUVs).

<p class="mathjax">The synergy between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and metaverses is giving
rise to an emerging paradigm named UAV metaverses, which create a unified
ecosystem that blends physical and virtual spaces, transforming drone
interaction and virtual exploration. UAV Twins (UTs), as the digital twins of
UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive,
realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations,
e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV Metaverse
Users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication
coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure
seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs
and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and
efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine
learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for
efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a
multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion
metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny Multi-Agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks
representing the optimal game solution. Specifically, the actor-critic network
leverages the pruning techniques to reduce the number of network parameters and
achieve model size and computation reduction, allowing for efficient
implementation of Tiny MADRL. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed
schemes have better performance than traditional schemes.

<p class="mathjax">The theories of offline and online reinforcement learning, despite having
evolved in parallel, have begun to show signs of the possibility for a
unification, with algorithms and analysis techniques for one setting often
having natural counterparts in the other. However, the notion of density ratio
modeling, an emerging paradigm in offline RL, has been largely absent from
online RL, perhaps for good reason: the very existence and boundedness of
density ratios relies on access to an exploratory dataset with good coverage,
but the core challenge in online RL is to collect such a dataset without having
one to start. In this work we show -- perhaps surprisingly -- that density
ratio-based algorithms have online counterparts. Assuming only the existence of
an exploratory distribution with good coverage, a structural condition known as
coverability (Xie et al., 2023), we give a new algorithm (GLOW) that uses
density ratio realizability and value function realizability to perform
sample-efficient online exploration. GLOW addresses unbounded density ratios
via careful use of truncation, and combines this with optimism to guide
exploration. GLOW is computationally inefficient; we complement it with a more
efficient counterpart, HyGLOW, for the Hybrid RL setting (Song et al., 2022)
wherein online RL is augmented with additional offline data. HyGLOW is derived
as a special case of a more general meta-algorithm that provides a provable
black-box reduction from hybrid RL to offline RL, which may be of independent
interest.

<p class="mathjax">Categorical variables often appear in datasets for classification and
regression tasks, and they need to be encoded into numerical values before
training. Since many encoders have been developed and can significantly impact
performance, choosing the appropriate encoder for a task becomes a
time-consuming yet important practical issue. This study broadly classifies
machine learning models into three categories: 1) ATI models that implicitly
perform affine transformations on inputs, such as multi-layer perceptron neural
network; 2) Tree-based models that are based on decision trees, such as random
forest; and 3) the rest, such as kNN. Theoretically, we prove that the one-hot
encoder is the best choice for ATI models in the sense that it can mimic any
other encoders by learning suitable weights from the data. We also explain why
the target encoder and its variants are the most suitable encoders for
tree-based models. This study conducted comprehensive computational experiments
to evaluate 14 encoders, including one-hot and target encoders, along with
eight common machine-learning models on 28 datasets. The computational results
agree with our theoretical analysis. The findings in this study shed light on
how to select the suitable encoder for data scientists in fields such as fraud
detection, disease diagnosis, etc.

<p class="mathjax">Imitation learning enables robots to learn and replicate human behavior from
training data. Recent advances in machine learning enable end-to-end learning
approaches that directly process high-dimensional observation data, such as
images. However, these approaches face a critical challenge when processing
data from multiple modalities, inadvertently ignoring data with a lower
correlation to the desired output, especially when using short sampling
periods. This paper presents a useful method to address this challenge, which
amplifies the influence of data with a relatively low correlation to the output
by inputting the data into each neural network layer. The proposed approach
effectively incorporates diverse data sources into the learning process.
Through experiments using a simple pick-and-place operation with raw images and
joint information as input, significant improvements in success rates are
demonstrated even when dealing with data from short sampling periods.

<p class="mathjax">Recommendation systems are highly interested in technology companies
nowadays. The businesses are constantly growing users and products, causing the
number of users and items to continuously increase over time, to very large
numbers. Traditional recommendation algorithms with complexity dependent on the
number of users and items make them difficult to adapt to the industrial
environment. In this paper, we introduce a new method applying graph neural
networks with a contrastive learning framework in extracting user preferences.
We incorporate a soft clustering architecture that significantly reduces the
computational cost of the inference process. Experiments show that the model is
able to learn user preferences with low computational cost in both training and
prediction phases. At the same time, the model gives a very good accuracy. We
call this architecture EfficientRec with the implication of model compactness
and the ability to scale to unlimited users and products.

<p class="mathjax">A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and
reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large
multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission
Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within
the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for
coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power
set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while
maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple
independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources
while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the
only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas
within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis,
establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide
detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on
multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB-based
application which integrates with OpenDSS. The simulation results show that the
proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in
response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN
and maintaining DN operational limits.

<p class="mathjax">Relationships are essential to our happiness and wellbeing. The dissolution
of a relationship, the final stage of relationship's lifecycle and one of the
most stressful events in an individual's life, can have profound and
long-lasting impacts on people. With the breakup process increasingly
facilitated by computer-mediated communication (CMC), and the likely future
influence of AI-mediated communication (AIMC) tools, we conducted a
semi-structured interview study with 21 participants. We aim to understand: 1)
the current role of technology in the breakup process, 2) the needs and support
individuals have during the process, and 3) how AI might address these needs.
Our research shows that people have distinct needs at various stages of ending
a relationship. Presently, technology is used for information gathering and
community support, acting as a catalyst for breakups, enabling ghosting and
blocking, and facilitating communication. Participants anticipate that AI could
aid in sense-making of their relationship leading up to the breakup, act as a
mediator, assist in crafting appropriate wording, tones, and language during
breakup conversations, and support companionship, reflection, recovery, and
growth after a breakup. Our findings also demonstrate an overlap between the
breakup process and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change.
Through the lens of TTM, we explore the potential support and affordances AI
could offer in breakups, including its benefits and the necessary precautions
regarding AI's role in this sensitive process.

equality within the ever-evolving realms of educational technology and
curriculum development. In acknowledging the inherent obstacles posed by
existing methodologies, such as content conflicts and disruptions from language
translation, this paradigm aims to confront and overcome these challenges.
Notably, it addresses content conflicts and disruptions introduced by language
translation, hindrances that can impede the creation of an all-encompassing and
personalized learning experience. The paradigm's objective is to cultivate an
educational environment that not only embraces diversity but also customizes
learning experiences to suit the distinct needs of each learner. To overcome
these challenges, our approach builds upon notable contributions in curriculum
development and personalized learning, introducing three key innovations. These
include the integration of Transformer Base Model to enhance computational
efficiency, the implementation of InfoNCE Loss for accurate content-topic
matching, and the adoption of a language switching strategy to alleviate
translation-related ambiguities. Together, these innovations aim to
collectively tackle inherent challenges and contribute to forging a more

projection matrices are augmented based on original singular vectors. However,
these methods suffer from inefficiency due to the densification of the update
matrix and the application of the projection to all singular vectors. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel method for dynamically
approximating the truncated SVD of a sparse and temporally evolving matrix. Our
approach leverages sparsity in the orthogonalization process of augmented
matrices and utilizes an extended decomposition to independently store
projections in the column space of singular vectors. Numerical experiments
demonstrate a remarkable efficiency improvement of an order of magnitude
compared to previous methods. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved while
maintaining a comparable precision to existing approaches.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, drones have found increased applications in a wide array of
real-world tasks. Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as a practical
method for drone flight control, owing to its robustness against modeling
errors/uncertainties and external disturbances. However, MPC's sensitivity to
manually tuned parameters can lead to rapid performance degradation when faced
with unknown environmental dynamics. This paper addresses the challenge of
controlling a drone as it traverses a swinging gate characterized by unknown
dynamics. This paper introduces a parameterized MPC approach named hyMPC that
leverages high-level decision variables to adapt to uncertain environmental
conditions. To derive these decision variables, a novel policy search framework
aimed at training a high-level Gaussian policy is presented. Subsequently, we
harness the power of neural network policies, trained on data gathered through
the repeated execution of the Gaussian policy, to provide real-time decision
variables. The effectiveness of hyMPC is validated through numerical
simulations, achieving a 100\% success rate in 20 drone flight tests traversing
a swinging gate, demonstrating its capability to achieve safe and precise
flight with limited prior knowledge of environmental dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Although High Performance Computing (HPC) users understand basic resource
requirements such as the number of CPUs and memory limits, internal
infrastructural utilization data is exclusively leveraged by cluster operators,
who use it to configure batch schedulers. This task is challenging and
increasingly complex due to ever larger cluster scales and heterogeneity of
modern scientific workflows. As a result, HPC systems achieve low utilization
with long job completion times (makespans). To tackle these challenges, we
propose a co-scheduling algorithm based on an adaptive reinforcement learning
algorithm, where application profiling is combined with cluster monitoring. The
resulting cluster scheduler matches resource utilization to application
performance in a fine-grained manner (i.e., operating system level). As opposed
to nominal allocations, we apply decision trees to model applications' actual
resource usage, which are used to estimate how much resource capacity from one
allocation can be co-allocated to additional applications. Our algorithm learns
from incorrect co-scheduling decisions and adapts from changing environment
conditions, and evaluates when such changes cause resource contention that
impacts quality of service metrics such as jobs slowdowns. We integrate our
algorithm in an HPC resource manager that combines Slurm and Mesos for job
scheduling and co-allocation, respectively. Our experimental evaluation
performed in a dedicated cluster executing a mix of four real different
scientific workflows demonstrates improvements on cluster utilization of up to
51% even in high load scenarios, with 55% average queue makespan reductions
under low loads.

<p class="mathjax">Point-level Supervised Instance Segmentation (PSIS) aims to enhance the
applicability and scalability of instance segmentation by utilizing low-cost
yet instance-informative annotations. Existing PSIS methods usually rely on
positional information to distinguish objects, but predicting precise
boundaries remains challenging due to the lack of contour annotations.
Nevertheless, weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods are proficient in
utilizing intra-class feature consistency to capture the boundary contours of
the same semantic regions. In this paper, we design a Mutual Distillation
Module (MDM) to leverage the complementary strengths of both instance position
and semantic information and achieve accurate instance-level object perception.
The MDM consists of Semantic to Instance (S2I) and Instance to Semantic (I2S).
S2I is guided by the precise boundaries of semantic regions to learn the
association between annotated points and instance contours. I2S leverages
discriminative relationships between instances to facilitate the
differentiation of various objects within the semantic map. Extensive
experiments substantiate the efficacy of MDM in fostering the synergy between
instance and semantic information, consequently improving the quality of
instance-level object representations. Our method achieves 55.7 mAP$_{50}$ and
17.6 mAP on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, significantly outperforming
recent PSIS methods and several box-supervised instance segmentation
competitors.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-beam low earth orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components in
beyond 5G and 6G to provide global coverage and high data rate. To fully
unleash the potential of LEO satellite communication, resource management plays
a key role. However, the uneven distribution of users, the coupling of
multi-dimensional resources, complex inter-beam interference, and time-varying
network topologies all impose significant challenges on effective communication
resource management. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of beam
direction and the allocation of spectrum, time, and power resource in a dynamic
multi-beam LEO satellite network. The objective is to improve long-term user
sum data rate while taking user fairness into account. Since the concerned
resource management problem is mixed-integer non-convex programming, the
problem is decomposed into three subproblems, namely beam direction control and
time slot allocation, user subchannel assignment, and beam power allocation.
Then, these subproblems are solved iteratively by leveraging matching with
externalities and successive convex approximation, and the proposed algorithms
are analyzed in terms of stability, convergence, and complexity. Extensive
simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposal can
improve the number of served users by up to two times and the sum user data
rate by up to 68%, compared to baseline schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the
vision-language realm, obtaining impressive general multi-modal capabilities.
However, the exploration of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for
remote sensing (RS) data is still in its infancy, and the performance is not
satisfactory. In this work, we introduce SkyEyeGPT, a unified multi-modal large
language model specifically designed for RS vision-language understanding. To
this end, we meticulously curate an RS multi-modal instruction tuning dataset,
including single-task and multi-task conversation instructions. After manual
verification, we obtain a high-quality RS instruction-following dataset with
968k samples. Our research demonstrates that with a simple yet effective
design, SkyEyeGPT works surprisingly well on considerably different tasks
without the need for extra encoding modules. Specifically, after projecting RS
visual features to the language domain via an alignment layer, they are fed
jointly with task-specific instructions into an LLM-based RS decoder to predict
answers for RS open-ended tasks. In addition, we design a two-stage tuning
method to enhance instruction-following and multi-turn dialogue ability at
different granularities. Experiments on 8 datasets for RS vision-language tasks
demonstrate SkyEyeGPT's superiority in image-level and region-level tasks, such
as captioning and visual grounding. In particular, SkyEyeGPT exhibits
encouraging results compared to GPT-4V in some qualitative tests. The online
demo, code, and dataset will be released in
https://github.com/ZhanYang-nwpu/SkyEyeGPT.

<p class="mathjax">This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed
nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts
with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyse a virtual element
formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the
Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation
(written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and
stress-dependent diffusion. The two sub-problems are analysed using the
extended Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi--Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point
problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established
using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The
virtual element formulations for the uncoupled sub-problems are proven uniquely
solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection
operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and
performance of the proposed method through computational simulations.

<p class="mathjax">Domain Generalization (DG) endeavors to create machine learning models that
excel in unseen scenarios by learning invariant features. In DG, the prevalent
practice of constraining models to a fixed structure or uniform
parameterization to encapsulate invariant features can inadvertently blend
specific aspects. Such an approach struggles with nuanced differentiation of
inter-domain variations and may exhibit bias towards certain domains, hindering
the precise learning of domain-invariant features. Recognizing this, we
introduce a novel method designed to supplement the model with domain-level and
task-specific characteristics. This approach aims to guide the model in more
effectively separating invariant features from specific characteristics,
thereby boosting the generalization. Building on the emerging trend of visual
prompts in the DG paradigm, our work introduces the novel \textbf{H}ierarchical
\textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompt (HCVP) methodology. This
represents a significant advancement in the field, setting itself apart with a
unique generative approach to prompts, alongside an explicit model structure
and specialized loss functions. Differing from traditional visual prompts that
are often shared across entire datasets, HCVP utilizes a hierarchical prompt
generation network enhanced by prompt contrastive learning. These generative
prompts are instance-dependent, catering to the unique characteristics inherent
to different domains and tasks. Additionally, we devise a prompt modulation
network that serves as a bridge, effectively incorporating the generated visual
prompts into the vision transformer backbone. Experiments conducted on five DG
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HCVP, outperforming both established
DG algorithms and adaptation protocols.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a novel clothed human reconstruction method called
GaussianBody, based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Compared with the costly neural
radiance based models, 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently demonstrated great
performance in terms of training time and rendering quality. However, applying
the static 3D Gaussian Splatting model to the dynamic human reconstruction
problem is non-trivial due to complicated non-rigid deformations and rich cloth
details. To address these challenges, our method considers explicit pose-guided
deformation to associate dynamic Gaussians across the canonical space and the
observation space, introducing a physically-based prior with regularized
transformations helps mitigate ambiguity between the two spaces. During the
training process, we further propose a pose refinement strategy to update the
pose regression for compensating the inaccurate initial estimation and a
split-with-scale mechanism to enhance the density of regressed point clouds.
The experiments validate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art
photorealistic novel-view rendering results with high-quality details for
dynamic clothed human bodies, along with explicit geometry reconstruction.

<p class="mathjax">Point clouds are utilized in various 3D applications such as cross-reality
(XR) and realistic 3D displays. In some applications, e.g., for live streaming
using a 3D point cloud, real-time point cloud denoising methods are required to
enhance the visual quality. However, conventional high-precision denoising
methods cannot be executed in real time for large-scale point clouds owing to
the complexity of graph constructions with K nearest neighbors and noise level
estimation. This paper proposes a fast graph-based denoising (FGBD) for a
large-scale point cloud. First, high-speed graph construction is achieved by
scanning a point cloud in various directions and searching adjacent
neighborhoods on the scanning lines. Second, we propose a fast noise level
estimation method using eigenvalues of the covariance matrix on a graph.
Finally, we also propose a new low-cost filter selection method to enhance
denoising accuracy to compensate for the degradation caused by the acceleration
algorithms. In our experiments, we succeeded in reducing the processing time
dramatically while maintaining accuracy relative to conventional denoising
methods. Denoising was performed at 30fps, with frames containing approximately
1 million points.

<p class="mathjax">In the age of the infodemic, it is crucial to have tools for effectively
monitoring the spread of rampant rumors that can quickly go viral, as well as
identifying vulnerable users who may be more susceptible to spreading such
misinformation. This proactive approach allows for timely preventive measures
to be taken, mitigating the negative impact of false information on society. We
propose a novel approach to predict viral rumors and vulnerable users using a
unified graph neural network model. We pre-train network-based user embeddings
and leverage a cross-attention mechanism between users and posts, together with
a community-enhanced vulnerability propagation (CVP) method to improve user and
propagation graph representations. Furthermore, we employ two multi-task
training strategies to mitigate negative transfer effects among tasks in
different settings, enhancing the overall performance of our approach. We also
construct two datasets with ground-truth annotations on information virality
and user vulnerability in rumor and non-rumor events, which are automatically
derived from existing rumor detection datasets. Extensive evaluation results of
our joint learning model confirm its superiority over strong baselines in all
three tasks: rumor detection, virality prediction, and user vulnerability
scoring. For instance, compared to the best baselines based on the Weibo
dataset, our model makes 3.8\% and 3.0\% improvements on Accuracy and MacF1 for
rumor detection, and reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 23.9\% and 16.5\% for
virality prediction and user vulnerability scoring, respectively. Our findings
suggest that our approach effectively captures the correlation between rumor
virality and user vulnerability, leveraging this information to improve
prediction performance and provide a valuable tool for infodemic surveillance.

<p class="mathjax">Image-text matching aims to find matched cross-modal pairs accurately. While
current methods often rely on projecting cross-modal features into a common
embedding space, they frequently suffer from imbalanced feature representations
across different modalities, leading to unreliable retrieval results. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel Feature Enhancement Module that
adaptively aggregates single-modal features for more balanced and robust
image-text retrieval. Additionally, we propose a new loss function that
overcomes the shortcomings of original triplet ranking loss, thereby
significantly improving retrieval performance. The proposed model has been
evaluated on two public datasets and achieves competitive retrieval performance
when compared with several state-of-the-art models. Implementation codes can be
found here.

<p class="mathjax">The critical threat of phishing emails has been further exacerbated by the
potential of LLMs to generate highly targeted, personalized, and automated
spear phishing attacks. Two critical problems concerning LLM-facilitated
phishing require further investigation: 1) Existing studies on lateral phishing
lack specific examination of LLM integration for large-scale attacks targeting
the entire organization, and 2) Current anti-phishing infrastructure, despite
its extensive development, lacks the capability to prevent LLM-generated
attacks, potentially impacting both employees and IT security incident
management. However, the execution of such investigative studies necessitates a
real-world environment, one that functions during regular business operations
and mirrors the complexity of a large organizational infrastructure. This
setting must also offer the flexibility required to facilitate a diverse array
of experimental conditions, particularly the incorporation of phishing emails
crafted by LLMs. This study is a pioneering exploration into the use of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for the creation of targeted lateral phishing emails,
targeting a large tier 1 university's operation and workforce of approximately
9,000 individuals over an 11-month period. It also evaluates the capability of
email filtering infrastructure to detect such LLM-generated phishing attempts,
providing insights into their effectiveness and identifying potential areas for
improvement. Based on our findings, we propose machine learning-based detection
techniques for such emails to detect LLM-generated phishing emails that were
missed by the existing infrastructure, with an F1-score of 98.96.

<p class="mathjax">In offline imitation learning (IL), we generally assume only a handful of
expert trajectories and a supplementary offline dataset from suboptimal
behaviors to learn the expert policy. While it is now common to minimize the
divergence between state-action visitation distributions so that the agent also
considers the future consequences of an action, a sampling error in an offline
dataset may lead to erroneous estimates of state-action visitations in the
offline case. In this paper, we investigate the effect of controlling the
effective planning horizon (i.e., reducing the discount factor) as opposed to
imposing an explicit regularizer, as previously studied. Unfortunately, it
turns out that the existing algorithms suffer from magnified approximation
errors when the effective planning horizon is shortened, which results in a
significant degradation in performance. We analyze the main cause of the
problem and provide the right remedies to correct the algorithm. We show that
the corrected algorithm improves on popular imitation learning benchmarks by
controlling the effective planning horizon rather than an explicit
regularization.

<p class="mathjax">Temporally locating objects with arbitrary class texts is the primary pursuit
of open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). Because of the
insufficient vocabulary of video data, previous methods leverage image-text
pretraining model for recognizing object instances by separately aligning each
frame and class texts, ignoring the correlation between frames. As a result,
the separation breaks the instance movement context of videos, causing inferior
alignment between video and text. To tackle this issue, we propose to link
frame-level instance representations as a Brownian Bridge to model instance
dynamics and align bridge-level instance representation to class texts for more
precisely open-vocabulary VIS (BriVIS). Specifically, we build our system upon
a frozen video segmentor to generate frame-level instance queries, and design
Temporal Instance Resampler (TIR) to generate queries with temporal context
from frame queries. To mold instance queries to follow Brownian bridge and
accomplish alignment with class texts, we design Bridge-Text Alignment (BTA) to
learn discriminative bridge-level representations of instances via contrastive
objectives. Setting MinVIS as the basic video segmentor, BriVIS surpasses the
Open-vocabulary SOTA (OV2Seg) by a clear margin. For example, on the
challenging large-vocabulary VIS dataset (BURST), BriVIS achieves 7.43 mAP and
exhibits 49.49% improvement compared to OV2Seg (4.97 mAP).

<p class="mathjax">In High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, the control of resources
by batch systems can lead to prolonged queue waiting times and adverse effects
on the overall execution times of applications, particularly in data-intensive
and low-latency workflows where efficient processing hinges on resource
planning and timely allocation. Allocating the maximum capacity upfront ensures
the fastest execution but results in spare and idle resources, extended queue
waits, and costly usage. Conversely, dynamic allocation based on workflow stage
requirements optimizes resource usage but may negatively impact the total
workflow makespan. To address these issues, we introduce ASA, the Adaptive
Scheduling Algorithm. ASA is a novel, convergence-proven scheduling technique
that minimizes jobs inter-stage waiting times by estimating the queue waiting
times to proactively submit resource change requests ahead of time. It strikes
a balance between exploration and exploitation, considering both learning
(waiting times) and applying learnt insights. Real-world experiments over two
supercomputers centers with scientific workflows demonstrate ASA's
effectiveness, achieving near-optimal resource utilization and accuracy, with
up to 10% and 2% reductions in average workflow queue waiting times and

<p class="mathjax">Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be
represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue
with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing
the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance
between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or
ineffective. In this paper, we propose DirDist, an efficient, effective,
robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically,
we construct DirDist based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D
models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional
distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We
then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the
discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally
establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DirDist,
we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks,
including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration,
scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show
that our DirDist achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a
generic distance metric, DirDist has the potential to advance the field of 3D
geometric modeling. The source code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Backdoors and adversarial examples are the two primary threats currently
faced by deep neural networks (DNNs). Both attacks attempt to hijack the model
behaviors with unintended outputs by introducing (small) perturbations to the
inputs. Backdoor attacks, despite the high success rates, often require a
strong assumption, which is not always easy to achieve in reality. Adversarial
example attacks, which put relatively weaker assumptions on attackers, often
demand high computational resources, yet do not always yield satisfactory
success rates when attacking mainstream black-box models in the real world.
These limitations motivate the following research question: can model hijacking
be achieved more simply, with a higher attack success rate and more reasonable
assumptions? In this paper, we propose CleanSheet, a new model hijacking attack
that obtains the high performance of backdoor attacks without requiring the
adversary to tamper with the model training process. CleanSheet exploits
vulnerabilities in DNNs stemming from the training data. Specifically, our key
idea is to treat part of the clean training data of the target model as
"poisoned data," and capture the characteristics of these data that are more
sensitive to the model (typically called robust features) to construct
"triggers." These triggers can be added to any input example to mislead the
target model, similar to backdoor attacks. We validate the effectiveness of
CleanSheet through extensive experiments on 5 datasets, 79 normally trained
models, 68 pruned models, and 39 defensive models. Results show that CleanSheet
exhibits performance comparable to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, achieving
an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.5% on CIFAR-100 and 92.4% on GTSRB,
respectively. Furthermore, CleanSheet consistently maintains a high ASR, when
confronted with various mainstream backdoor defenses.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the novel Diffusion Visual Programmer (DVP), a neuro-symbolic
image translation framework. Our proposed DVP seamlessly embeds a
condition-flexible diffusion model within the GPT architecture, orchestrating a
coherent sequence of visual programs (i.e., computer vision models) for various
pro-symbolic steps, which span RoI identification, style transfer, and position
manipulation, facilitating transparent and controllable image translation
processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate DVP's remarkable performance,
surpassing concurrent arts. This success can be attributed to several key
features of DVP: First, DVP achieves condition-flexible translation via
instance normalization, enabling the model to eliminate sensitivity caused by
the manual guidance and optimally focus on textual descriptions for
high-quality content generation. Second, the framework enhances in-context
reasoning by deciphering intricate high-dimensional concepts in feature spaces
into more accessible low-dimensional symbols (e.g., [Prompt], [RoI object]),
allowing for localized, context-free editing while maintaining overall
coherence. Last but not least, DVP improves systemic controllability and
explainability by offering explicit symbolic representations at each
programming stage, empowering users to intuitively interpret and modify
results. Our research marks a substantial step towards harmonizing artificial
image translation processes with cognitive intelligence, promising broader
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Exploration remains a critical issue in deep reinforcement learning for an
agent to attain high returns in unknown environments. Although the prevailing
exploration Random Network Distillation (RND) algorithm has been demonstrated
to be effective in numerous environments, it often needs more discriminative
power in bonus allocation. This paper highlights the ``bonus inconsistency''
issue within RND, pinpointing its primary limitation. To address this issue, we
introduce the Distributional RND (DRND), a derivative of the RND. DRND enhances
the exploration process by distilling a distribution of random networks and
implicitly incorporating pseudo counts to improve the precision of bonus
allocation. This refinement encourages agents to engage in more extensive
exploration. Our method effectively mitigates the inconsistency issue without
introducing significant computational overhead. Both theoretical analysis and
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the
original RND algorithm. Our method excels in challenging online exploration
scenarios and effectively serves as an anti-exploration mechanism in D4RL
offline tasks.

samples are collected from diverse speakers, leading to a multi-domain shift
challenge across the feature distributions of data from different speakers.
Consequently, when the trained model is confronted with data from new speakers,
its performance tends to degrade. To address the issue, we propose a Dynamic
Joint Distribution Adaptation (DJDA) method under the framework of multi-source
domain adaptation. DJDA firstly utilizes joint distribution adaptation (JDA),
involving marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) and conditional distribution
adaptation (CDA), to more precisely measure the multi-domain distribution
shifts caused by different speakers. This helps eliminate speaker bias in
emotion features, allowing for learning discriminative and speaker-invariant
speech emotion features from coarse-level to fine-level. Furthermore, we
quantify the adaptation contributions of MDA and CDA within JDA by using a
dynamic balance factor based on $\mathcal{A}$-Distance, promoting to
effectively handle the unknown distributions encountered in data from new
speakers. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our DJDA
as compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the tremendous success of graph neural networks in learning
relational data, it has been widely investigated that graph neural networks are
vulnerable to structural attacks on homophilic graphs. Motivated by this, a
surge of robust models is crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of
graph neural networks on homophilic graphs. However, the vulnerability based on
heterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper,
we start to explore the vulnerability of graph neural networks on heterophilic
graphs and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification
loss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the
powered aggregated neighbor features. This theoretical proof explains the
empirical observations that the graph attacker tends to connect dissimilar node
pairs based on the similarities of neighbor features instead of ego features
both on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. In this way, we novelly introduce a
novel robust model termed NSPGNN which incorporates a dual-kNN graphs pipeline
to supervise the neighbor similarity-guided propagation. This propagation
utilizes the low-pass filter to smooth the features of node pairs along the
positive kNN graphs and the high-pass filter to discriminate the features of
node pairs along the negative kNN graphs. Extensive experiments on both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs validate the universal robustness of NSPGNN
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models often deteriorate in their performance when they are
used to predict the outcomes over data on which they were not trained. These
scenarios can often arise in real world when the distribution of data changes
gradually or abruptly due to major events like a pandemic. There have been many
attempts in machine learning research to come up with techniques that are
resilient to such Concept drifts. However, there is no principled framework to
identify the drivers behind the drift in model performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework - DBShap that uses Shapley values to identify the
main contributors of the drift and quantify their respective contributions. The
proposed framework not only quantifies the importance of individual features in
driving the drift but also includes the change in the underlying relation
between the input and output as a possible driver. The explanation provided by
DBShap can be used to understand the root cause behind the drift and use it to
make the model resilient to the drift.

<p class="mathjax">The utilization of existing terrestrial infrastructures to provide coverage
for aerial users is a potentially low-cost solution. However, the already
deployed terrestrial base stations (TBSs) result in weak ground-to-air (G2A)
coverage due to the down-tilted antennas. Furthermore, achieving optimal
coverage across the entire airspace through antenna adjustment is challenging
due to the complex signal coverage requirements in three-dimensional space,
especially in the vertical direction. In this paper, we propose a cooperative
tri-point (CoTP) model-based method that utilizes cooperative beams to enhance
the G2A coverage extension. To utilize existing TBSs for establishing effective
cooperation, we prove that the cooperation among three TBSs can ensure G2A
coverage with a minimum coverage overlap, and design the CoTP model to analyze
the G2A coverage extension. Using the model, a cooperative coverage structure
based on Delaunay triangulation is designed to divide triangular prism-shaped
subspaces and corresponding TBS cooperation sets. To enable TBSs in the
cooperation set to cover different height subspaces while maintaining ground
coverage, we design a cooperative beam generation algorithm to maximize the
coverage in the triangular prism-shaped airspace. The simulation results and
field trials demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently enhance the
G2A coverage extension while guaranteeing ground coverage.

<p class="mathjax">Word sense disambiguation primarily addresses the lexical ambiguity of common
words based on a predefined sense inventory. Conversely, proper names are
usually considered to denote an ad-hoc real-world referent. Once the reference
is decided, the ambiguity is purportedly resolved. However, proper names also
exhibit ambiguities through appellativization, i.e., they act like common words
and may denote different aspects of their referents. We proposed to address the
ambiguities of proper names through the light of regular polysemy, which we
formalized as dot objects. This paper introduces a combined word sense
disambiguation (WSD) model for disambiguating common words against Chinese
Wordnet (CWN) and proper names as dot objects. The model leverages the
flexibility of a gloss-based model architecture, which takes advantage of the
glosses and example sentences of CWN. We show that the model achieves
competitive results on both common and proper nouns, even on a relatively
sparse sense dataset. Aside from being a performant WSD tool, the model further
facilitates the future development of the lexical resource.

<p class="mathjax">Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a multimodal extension of automatic
speech recognition (ASR), using video as a complement to audio. In AVSR,
considerable efforts have been directed at datasets for facial features such as
lip-readings, while they often fall short in evaluating the image comprehension
capabilities in broader contexts. In this paper, we construct SlideAVSR, an
AVSR dataset using scientific paper explanation videos. SlideAVSR provides a
new benchmark where models transcribe speech utterances with texts on the
slides on the presentation recordings. As technical terminologies that are
frequent in paper explanations are notoriously challenging to transcribe
without reference texts, our SlideAVSR dataset spotlights a new aspect of AVSR
problems. As a simple yet effective baseline, we propose DocWhisper, an AVSR
model that can refer to textual information from slides, and confirm its
effectiveness on SlideAVSR.

<p class="mathjax">Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can outperform crowdsourcing on the data
annotation task is attracting interest recently. Some works verified this issue
with the average performance of individual crowd workers and LLM workers on
some specific NLP tasks by collecting new datasets. However, on the one hand,
existing datasets for the studies of annotation quality in crowdsourcing are
not yet utilized in such evaluations, which potentially provide reliable
evaluations from a different viewpoint. On the other hand, the quality of these
aggregated labels is crucial because, when utilizing crowdsourcing, the
estimated labels aggregated from multiple crowd labels to the same instances
are the eventually collected labels. Therefore, in this paper, we first
investigate which existing crowdsourcing datasets can be used for a comparative
study and create a benchmark. We then compare the quality between individual
crowd labels and LLM labels and make the evaluations on the aggregated labels.
In addition, we propose a Crowd-LLM hybrid label aggregation method and verify
the performance. We find that adding LLM labels from good LLMs to existing
crowdsourcing datasets can enhance the quality of the aggregated labels of the
datasets, which is also higher than the quality of LLM labels themselves.

non-negative weight and a color. The colors are used to impose certain
restrictions on the weight and colors of other vertices. We first extend the
enumeration algorithms of unweighted trees given in [19, 20] to generate
weighted trees that allow zero weight. We avoid isomorphisms by generalizing
the concept of centroids to weighted trees and then using the so-called
centroid-rooted canonical weighted trees. We provide a time complexity analysis
of unranking algorithms and also show that the output delay complexity of
enumeration is linear. The framework can be used to generate graph classes
taking advantage of their tree-based decompositions/representations. We
demonstrate our framework by generating weighted block trees which are in

<p class="mathjax">Software vulnerabilities are a major cyber threat and it is important to
detect them. One important approach to detecting vulnerabilities is to use deep
learning while treating a program function as a whole, known as function-level
vulnerability detectors. However, the limitation of this approach is not
understood. In this paper, we investigate its limitation in detecting one class
of vulnerabilities known as inter-procedural vulnerabilities, where the
to-be-patched statements and the vulnerability-triggering statements belong to
different functions. For this purpose, we create the first Inter-Procedural
Vulnerability Dataset (InterPVD) based on C/C++ open-source software, and we
propose a tool dubbed VulTrigger for identifying vulnerability-triggering
statements across functions. Experimental results show that VulTrigger can
effectively identify vulnerability-triggering statements and inter-procedural
vulnerabilities. Our findings include: (i) inter-procedural vulnerabilities are
prevalent with an average of 2.8 inter-procedural layers; and (ii)
function-level vulnerability detectors are much less effective in detecting
to-be-patched functions of inter-procedural vulnerabilities than detecting
their counterparts of intra-procedural vulnerabilities.

<p class="mathjax">Graphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world
entities. Heterophilous graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with
different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant
attention and found many applications. Meanwhile, increasing efforts have been
made to advance learning from heterophilous graphs. Although there exist
surveys on the relevant topic, they focus on heterophilous GNNs, which are only
sub-topics of heterophilous graph learning. In this survey, we comprehensively
overview existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily.First, we
collect over 180 publications and introduce the development of this field.
Then, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical
taxonomy including learning strategies, model architectures and practical
applications. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies
and highlight promising avenues for future research.More publication details
and corresponding open-source codes can be accessed and will be continuously
updated at our

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present an algorithm to approximate a set of data points
with G1 continuous arcs, using points' covariance data. To the best of our
knowledge, previous arc spline approximation approaches assumed that all data
points contribute equally (i.e. have the same weights) during the approximation
process. However, this assumption may cause serious instability in the
algorithm, if the collected data contains outliers. To resolve this issue, a
robust method for arc spline approximation is suggested in this work, assuming
that the 2D covariance for each data point is given. Starting with the
definition of models and parameters for single arc approximation, the framework
is extended to multiple-arc approximation for general usage. Then the proposed
algorithm is verified using generated noisy data and real-world collected data
via vehicle experiment in Sejong City, South Korea.

<p class="mathjax">A combined task-level reinforcement learning and motion planning framework is
proposed in this paper to address a multi-class in-rack test tube rearrangement
problem. At the task level, the framework uses reinforcement learning to infer
a sequence of swap actions while ignoring robotic motion details. At the motion
level, the framework accepts the swapping action sequences inferred by
task-level agents and plans the detailed robotic pick-and-place motion. The
task and motion-level planning form a closed loop with the help of a condition
set maintained for each rack slot, which allows the framework to perform
replanning and effectively find solutions in the presence of low-level
failures. Particularly for reinforcement learning, the framework leverages a
distributed deep Q-learning structure with the Dueling Double Deep Q Network
(D3QN) to acquire near-optimal policies and uses an A${}^\star$-based
post-processing technique to amplify the collected training data. The D3QN and
distributed learning help increase training efficiency. The post-processing
helps complete unfinished action sequences and remove redundancy, thus making
the training data more effective. We carry out both simulations and real-world
studies to understand the performance of the proposed framework. The results
verify the performance of the RL and post-processing and show that the
closed-loop combination improves robustness. The framework is ready to
incorporate various sensory feedback. The real-world studies also demonstrated
the incorporation.

<p class="mathjax">Nuclei instance segmentation in histopathological images is of great
importance for biological analysis and cancer diagnosis but remains challenging
for two reasons. (1) Similar visual presentation of intranuclear and
extranuclear regions of chromophobe nuclei often causes under-segmentation, and
(2) current methods lack the exploration of nuclei structure, resulting in
fragmented instance predictions. To address these problems, this paper proposes
a structure encoding and interaction network, termed SEINE, which develops the
structure modeling scheme of nuclei and exploits the structure similarity
between nuclei to improve the integrality of each segmented instance.
Concretely, SEINE introduces a contour-based structure encoding (SE) that
considers the correlation between nuclei structure and semantics, realizing a
reasonable representation of the nuclei structure. Based on the encoding, we
propose a structure-guided attention (SGA) that takes the clear nuclei as
prototypes to enhance the structure learning for the fuzzy nuclei. To
strengthen the structural learning ability, a semantic feature fusion (SFF) is
presented to boost the semantic consistency of semantic and structure branches.
Furthermore, a position enhancement (PE) method is applied to suppress
incorrect nuclei boundary predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approaches, and SEINE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on four datasets. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Large audio-video language models can generate descriptions for both video
and audio. However, they sometimes ignore audio content, producing audio
descriptions solely reliant on visual information. This paper refers to this as
audio hallucinations and analyzes them in large audio-video language models. We
gather 1,000 sentences by inquiring about audio information and annotate them
whether they contain hallucinations. If a sentence is hallucinated, we also
categorize the type of hallucination. The results reveal that 332 sentences are
hallucinated with distinct trends observed in nouns and verbs for each
hallucination type. Based on this, we tackle a task of audio hallucination
classification using pre-trained audio-text models in the zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. Our experimental results reveal that the zero-shot models
achieve higher performance (52.2% in F1) than the random (40.3%) and the
fine-tuning models achieve 87.9%, outperforming the zero-shot models.

<p class="mathjax">Yes/No or polar questions represent one of the main linguistic question
categories. They consist of a main interrogative clause, for which the answer
is binary (assertion or negation). Polar questions and answers (PQA) represent
a valuable knowledge resource present in many community and other curated QA
sources, such as forums or e-commerce applications. Using answers to polar
questions alone in other contexts is not trivial. Answers are contextualized,
and presume that the interrogative question clause and any shared knowledge
between the asker and answerer are provided.
<br />We address the problem of controllable rewriting of answers to polar
questions into decontextualized and succinct factual statements. We propose a
Transformer sequence to sequence model that utilizes soft-constraints to ensure
controllable rewriting, such that the output statement is semantically
equivalent to its PQA input. Evaluation on three separate PQA datasets as
measured through automated and human evaluation metrics show that our proposed
approach achieves the best performance when compared to existing baselines.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in various
applications, including zero-shot and few-shot learning. However, their
performance can be hampered by inherent biases. Instead of traditionally sought
methods that aim to minimize or correct these biases, this study introduces a
novel methodology named ``bias-kNN''. This approach capitalizes on the biased
outputs, harnessing them as primary features for kNN and supplementing with
gold labels. Our comprehensive evaluations, spanning diverse domain text
classification datasets and different GPT-2 model sizes, indicate the
adaptability and efficacy of the ``bias-kNN'' method. Remarkably, this approach
not only outperforms conventional in-context learning in few-shot scenarios but
also demonstrates robustness across a spectrum of samples, templates and
verbalizers. This study, therefore, presents a unique perspective on harnessing
biases, transforming them into assets for enhanced model performance.

<p class="mathjax">E-commerce customers frequently seek detailed product information for
purchase decisions, commonly contacting sellers directly with extended queries.
This manual response requirement imposes additional costs and disrupts buyer's
shopping experience with response time fluctuations ranging from hours to days.
We seek to automate buyer inquiries to sellers in a leading e-commerce store
using a domain-specific federated Question Answering (QA) system. The main
challenge is adapting current QA systems, designed for single questions, to
address detailed customer queries. We address this with a low-latency,
sequence-to-sequence approach, MESSAGE-TO-QUESTION ( M2Q ). It reformulates
buyer messages into succinct questions by identifying and extracting the most
salient information from a message. Evaluation against baselines shows that M2Q
yields relative increases of 757% in question understanding, and 1,746% in
answering rate from the federated QA system. Live deployment shows that
automatic answering saves sellers from manually responding to millions of
messages per year, and also accelerates customer purchase decisions by
eliminating the need for buyers to wait for a reply

<p class="mathjax">Scene graph generation (SGG) models have suffered from inherent problems
regarding the benchmark datasets such as the long-tailed predicate distribution
and missing annotation problems. In this work, we aim to alleviate the
long-tailed problem of SGG by utilizing unannotated triplets. To this end, we
introduce a Self-Training framework for SGG (ST-SGG) that assigns pseudo-labels
for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there
has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing
a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its
inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution
of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for
SGG, called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM), which is
a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models.
Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when
adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art
message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive
experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models,
particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes.

<p class="mathjax">Active learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the
performance of a model by strategically selecting and querying unlabeled data.
One effective selection strategy is to base it on the model's predictive
uncertainty, which can be interpreted as a measure of how informative a sample
is. The sample's distance to the decision boundary is a natural measure of
predictive uncertainty, but it is often intractable to compute, especially for
complex decision boundaries formed in multiclass classification tasks. To
address this issue, this paper proposes the {\it least disagree metric} (LDM),
defined as the smallest probability of disagreement of the predicted label, and
an estimator for LDM proven to be asymptotically consistent under mild
assumptions. The estimator is computationally efficient and can be easily
implemented for deep learning models using parameter perturbation. The
LDM-based active learning is performed by querying unlabeled data with the
smallest LDM. Experimental results show that our LDM-based active learning
algorithm obtains state-of-the-art overall performance on all considered
datasets and deep architectures.

<p class="mathjax">The growing trends in automation, Internet of Things, big data and cloud
computing technologies have led to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry
4.0), where it is possible to visualize and identify patterns and insights,
which results in a better understanding of the data and can improve the
manufacturing process. However, many times, the task of data exploration
results difficult for manufacturing experts because they might be interested in
analyzing also data that does not appear in pre-designed visualizations and
therefore they must be assisted by Information Technology experts. In this
paper, we present a proposal materialized in a semantic-based visual query
system developed for a real Industry 4.0 scenario that allows domain experts to
explore and visualize data in a friendly way. The main novelty of the system is
the combined use that it makes of captured data that are semantically annotated
first, and a 2D customized digital representation of a machine that is also
linked with semantic descriptions. Those descriptions are expressed using terms
of an ontology, where, among others, the sensors that are used to capture
indicators about the performance of a machine that belongs to a Industry 4.0
scenario have been modeled. Moreover, this semantic description allows to:
formulate queries at a higher level of abstraction, provide customized
graphical visualizations of the results based on the format and nature of the
data, and download enriched data enabling further types of analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection stands as a crucial aspect of time series analysis, aiming
to identify abnormal events in time series samples. The central challenge of
this task lies in effectively learning the representations of normal and
abnormal patterns in a label-lacking scenario. Previous research mostly relied
on reconstruction-based approaches, restricting the representational abilities
of the models. In addition, most of the current deep learning-based methods are
not lightweight enough, which prompts us to design a more efficient framework
for anomaly detection. In this study, we introduce PatchAD, a novel multi-scale
patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that leverages contrastive learning for
representational extraction and anomaly detection. Specifically, PatchAD is
composed of four distinct MLP Mixers, exclusively utilizing the MLP
architecture for high efficiency and lightweight architecture. Additionally, we
also innovatively crafted a dual project constraint module to mitigate
potential model degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PatchAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world multivariate time
series datasets. Our code is publicly
available.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/EmorZz1G/PatchAD}}

<p class="mathjax">In the field of image editing, Null-text Inversion (NTI) enables fine-grained
editing while preserving the structure of the original image by optimizing null
embeddings during the DDIM sampling process. However, the NTI process is
time-consuming, taking more than two minutes per image. To address this, we
introduce an innovative method that maintains the principles of the NTI while
accelerating the image editing process. We propose the WaveOpt-Estimator, which
determines the text optimization endpoint based on frequency characteristics.
Utilizing wavelet transform analysis to identify the image's frequency
characteristics, we can limit text optimization to specific timesteps during
the DDIM sampling process. By adopting the Negative-Prompt Inversion (NPI)
concept, a target prompt representing the original image serves as the initial
text value for optimization. This approach maintains performance comparable to
NTI while reducing the average editing time by over 80% compared to the NTI
method. Our method presents a promising approach for efficient, high-quality
image editing based on diffusion models.

<p class="mathjax">A number of life threatening neuro-degenerative disorders had degraded the
quality of life for the older generation in particular. Dementia is one such
symptom which may lead to a severe condition called Alzheimer's disease if not
detected at an early stage. It has been reported that the progression of such
disease from a normal stage is due to the change in several parameters inside
the human brain. In this paper, an innovative metaheuristic algorithms based
ViT model has been proposed for the identification of dementia at different
stage. A sizeable number of test data have been utilized for the validation of
the proposed scheme. It has also been demonstrated that our model exhibits
superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall as well as

<p class="mathjax">The distributed (federated) LLM is an important method for co-training the
domain-specific LLM using siloed data. However, maliciously stealing model
parameters and data from the server or client side has become an urgent problem
to be solved. In this paper, we propose a secure distributed LLM based on model
slicing. In this case, we deploy the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on
both the client and server side, and put the fine-tuned structure (LoRA or
embedding of P-tuning v2) into the TEE. Then, secure communication is executed
in the TEE and general environments through lightweight encryption. In order to
further reduce the equipment cost as well as increase the model performance and
accuracy, we propose a split fine-tuning scheme. In particular, we split the
LLM by layers and place the latter layers in a server-side TEE (the client does
not need a TEE). We then combine the proposed Sparsification Parameter
Fine-tuning (SPF) with the LoRA part to improve the accuracy of the downstream
task. Numerous experiments have shown that our method guarantees accuracy while
maintaining security.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT face `jailbreak' challenges, where
safeguards are bypassed to produce ethically harmful prompts. This study
introduces a simple black-box method to effectively generate jailbreak prompts,
overcoming the limitations of high complexity and computational costs
associated with existing methods. The proposed technique iteratively rewrites
harmful prompts into non-harmful expressions using the target LLM itself, based
on the hypothesis that LLMs can directly sample safeguard-bypassing
expressions. Demonstrated through experiments with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)
and Gemini-Pro, this method achieved an attack success rate of over 80% within
an average of 5 iterations and remained effective despite model updates. The
jailbreak prompts generated were naturally-worded and concise, suggesting they
are less detectable. The results indicate that creating effective jailbreak
prompts is simpler than previously considered, and black-box jailbreak attacks
pose a more serious security threat.

<p class="mathjax">Power system fault diagnosis is crucial for identifying the location and
causes of faults and providing decision-making support for power dispatchers.
However, most classical methods suffer from significant time-consuming, memory
overhead, and computational complexity issues as the scale of the power system
concerned increases. With rapid development of quantum computing technology,
the combinatorial optimization method based on quantum computing has shown
certain advantages in computational time over existing methods. Given this
background, this paper proposes a quantum computing based power system fault
diagnosis method with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
The proposed method reformulates the fault diagnosis problem as a Hamiltonian
by using Ising model, which completely preserves the coupling relationship
between faulty components and various operations of protective relays and
circuit breakers. Additionally, to enhance problem-solving efficiency under
current equipment limitations, the symmetric equivalent decomposition method of
multi-z-rotation gate is proposed. Furthermore, the small probability
characteristics of power system events is utilized to reduce the number of
qubits. Simulation results based on the test system show that the proposed
methods can achieve the same optimal results with a faster speed compared with
the classical higher-order solver provided by D-Wave.

<p class="mathjax">Online content platforms commonly use engagement-based optimization when
making recommendations. This encourages content creators to invest in quality,
but also rewards gaming tricks such as clickbait. To understand the total
impact on the content landscape, we study a game between content creators
competing on the basis of engagement metrics and analyze the equilibrium
decisions about investment in quality and gaming. First, we show the content
created at equilibrium exhibits a positive correlation between quality and
gaming, and we empirically validate this finding on a Twitter dataset. Using
the equilibrium structure of the content landscape, we then examine the
downstream performance of engagement-based optimization along several axes.
Perhaps counterintuitively, the average quality of content consumed by users
can decrease at equilibrium as gaming tricks become more costly for content
creators to employ. Moreover, engagement-based optimization can perform worse
in terms of user utility than a baseline with random recommendations, and
engagement-based optimization is also suboptimal in terms of realized
engagement relative to quality-based optimization. Altogether, our results
highlight the need to consider content creator incentives when evaluating a
platform's choice of optimization metric.

<p class="mathjax">Developing tools in the context of autonomous systems [22, 24 ], such as
self-driving cars (SDCs), is time-consuming and costly since researchers and
practitioners rely on expensive computing hardware and simulation software. We
propose SensoDat, a dataset of 32,580 executed simulation-based SDC test cases
generated with state-of-the-art test generators for SDCs. The dataset consists
of trajectory logs and a variety of sensor data from the SDCs (e.g., rpm, wheel
speed, brake thermals, transmission, etc.) represented as a time series. In
total, SensoDat provides data from 81 different simulated sensors. Future
research in the domain of SDCs does not necessarily depend on executing
expensive test cases when using SensoDat. Furthermore, with the high amount and
variety of sensor data, we think SensoDat can contribute to research,
particularly for AI development, regression testing techniques for
simulation-based SDC testing, flakiness in simulation, etc. Link to the

and backtranslate them can be effective for compositional generalization, but
only if we sample from the right distribution. Remarkably, sampling from a
uniform distribution performs almost as well as sampling from the test
distribution, and greatly outperforms earlier methods that sampled from the
training distribution. We further conduct experiments to investigate the reason
why this happens and where the benefit of such data augmentation methods come
from.

<p class="mathjax">The classical path planners, such as sampling-based path planners, have the
limitations of sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the
optimal solution. However, finding a near-optimal solution in a short period is
challenging in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited
power/fuel. To achieve an end-to-end near-optimal path planner, we first divide
the path planning problem into two subproblems, which are path's space
segmentation and waypoints generation in the given path's space. We further
propose a two-level cascade neural network named Path Planning Network (PPNet)
to solve the path planning problem by solving the abovementioned subproblems.
Moreover, we propose a novel efficient data generation method for path planning
named EDaGe-PP. The results show the total computation time is less than 1/33
and the success rate of PPNet trained by the dataset that is generated by
EDaGe-PP is about $2 \times$ compared to other methods. We validate PPNet
against state-of-the-art path planning methods. The results show PPNet can find
a near-optimal solution in 15.3ms, which is much shorter than the
state-of-the-art path planners.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we introduce Fast&amp;Focused-Net, a novel deep neural network
architecture tailored for efficiently encoding small objects into fixed-length
feature vectors. Contrary to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Fast&amp;Focused-Net employs a series of our newly proposed layer, the Volume-wise
Dot Product (VDP) layer, designed to address several inherent limitations of
CNNs. Specifically, CNNs often exhibit a smaller effective receptive field than
their theoretical counterparts, limiting their vision span. Additionally, the
initial layers in CNNs produce low-dimensional feature vectors, presenting a
bottleneck for subsequent learning. Lastly, the computational overhead of CNNs,
particularly in capturing diverse image regions by parameter sharing, is
significantly high. The VDP layer, at the heart of Fast&amp;Focused-Net, aims to
remedy these issues by efficiently covering the entire image patch information
with reduced computational demand. Experimental results demonstrate the prowess
of Fast&amp;Focused-Net in a variety of applications. For small object
classification tasks, our network outperformed state-of-the-art methods on
datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, SVHN-Cropped, and Fashion-MNIST.
In the context of larger image classification, when combined with a transformer
encoder (ViT), Fast&amp;Focused-Net produced competitive results for OpenImages V6,
ImageNet-1K, and Places365 datasets. Moreover, the same combination showcased
unparalleled performance in text recognition tasks across SVT, IC15, SVTP, and
HOST datasets. This paper presents the architecture, the underlying motivation,
and extensive empirical evidence suggesting that Fast&amp;Focused-Net is a
promising direction for efficient and focused deep learning.

<p class="mathjax">The mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in
wallet-related issues reported by ordinary users on social media platforms. In
parallel, there is an increase in an emerging fraud trend called
cryptocurrency-based technical support scam, in which fraudsters offer fake
wallet recovery services and target users experiencing wallet-related issues.
<br />In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of cryptocurrency-based
technical support scams. We present an analysis apparatus called HoneyTweet to
analyze this kind of scam. Through HoneyTweet, we lure over 9K scammers by
posting 25K fake wallet support tweets (so-called honey tweets). We then deploy
automated systems to interact with scammers to analyze their modus operandi. In
our experiments, we observe that scammers use Twitter as a starting point for
the scam, after which they pivot to other communication channels (eg email,
Instagram, or Telegram) to complete the fraud activity. We track scammers
across those communication channels and bait them into revealing their payment
methods. Based on the modes of payment, we uncover two categories of scammers
that either request secret key phrase submissions from their victims or direct
payments to their digital wallets. Furthermore, we obtain scam confirmation by
deploying honey wallet addresses and validating private key theft. We also
collaborate with the prominent payment service provider by sharing scammer data
collections. The payment service provider feedback was consistent with our
findings, thereby supporting our methodology and results. By consolidating our
analysis across various vantage points, we provide an end-to-end scam lifecycle
analysis and propose recommendations for scam mitigation.

<p class="mathjax">In semantic segmentation, accurate prediction masks are crucial for
downstream tasks such as medical image analysis and image editing. Due to the
lack of annotated data, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) performs poorly in
predicting masks with precise contours. Recently, we have noticed that the
large foundation model segment anything model (SAM) performs well in processing
detailed features. Inspired by SAM, we propose FSS-SAM to boost FSS methods by
addressing the issue of inaccurate contour. The FSS-SAM is training-free. It
works as a post-processing tool for any FSS methods and can improve the
accuracy of predicted masks. Specifically, we use predicted masks from FSS
methods to generate prompts and then use SAM to predict new masks. To avoid
predicting wrong masks with SAM, we propose a prediction result selection (PRS)
algorithm. The algorithm can remarkably decrease wrong predictions. Experiment
results on public datasets show that our method is superior to base FSS methods
in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

<p class="mathjax">In this research, we introduce the enhanced automated quality assessment
network (IBS-AQSNet), an innovative solution for assessing the quality of
interactive building segmentation within high-resolution remote sensing
imagery. This is a new challenge in segmentation quality assessment, and our
proposed IBS-AQSNet allievate this by identifying missed and mistaken segment
areas. First of all, to acquire robust image features, our method combines a
robust, pre-trained backbone with a lightweight counterpart for comprehensive
feature extraction from imagery and segmentation results. These features are
then fused through a simple combination of concatenation, convolution layers,
and residual connections. Additionally, ISR-AQSNet incorporates a multi-scale
differential quality assessment decoder, proficient in pinpointing areas where
segmentation result is either missed or mistaken. Experiments on a newly-built
EVLab-BGZ dataset, which includes over 39,198 buildings, demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in automating segmentation quality
assessment, thereby setting a new benchmark in the field.

<p class="mathjax">When carrying out robotic manipulation tasks, objects occasionally fall as a
result of the rotation caused by slippage. This can be prevented by obtaining
tactile information that provides better knowledge on the physical properties
of the grasping. In this paper, we estimate the rotation angle of a grasped
object when slippage occurs. We implement a system made up of a neural network
with which to segment the contact region and an algorithm with which to
estimate the rotated angle of that region. This method is applied to DIGIT
tactile sensors. Our system has additionally been trained and tested with our
publicly available dataset which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset related to tactile segmentation from non-synthetic images to appear in
the literature, and with which we have attained results of 95% and 90% as
regards Dice and IoU metrics in the worst scenario. Moreover, we have obtained
a maximum error of 3 degrees when testing with objects not previously seen by
our system in 45 different lifts. This, therefore, proved that our approach is
able to detect the slippage movement, thus providing a possible reaction that
will prevent the object from falling.

<p class="mathjax">Monocular 3D human pose estimation poses significant challenges due to the
inherent depth ambiguities that arise during the reprojection process from 2D
to 3D. Conventional approaches that rely on estimating an over-fit projection
matrix struggle to effectively address these challenges and often result in
noisy outputs. Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in
incorporating structural priors to address reprojection ambiguities. However,
there is still ample room for improvement as these methods often overlook the
exploration of correlation between the 2D and 3D joint-level features. In this
study, we propose a novel cross-channel embedding framework that aims to fully
explore the correlation between joint-level features of 3D coordinates and
their 2D projections. In addition, we introduce a context guidance mechanism to
facilitate the propagation of joint graph attention across latent channels
during the iterative diffusion process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
proposed method, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement
in terms of reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
code for our method will be made available online for further reference.

<p class="mathjax">The microservice architecture allows developers to divide the core
functionality of their software system into multiple smaller services. However,
this architectural style also makes it harder for them to debug and assess
whether the system's deployment conforms to its implementation. We present
CATMA, an automated tool that detects non-conformances between the system's
deployment and implementation. It automatically visualizes and generates
potential interpretations for the detected discrepancies. Our evaluation of
CATMA shows promising results in terms of performance and providing useful
insights. CATMA is available at

<p class="mathjax">Material science literature is a rich source of factual information about
various categories of entities (like materials and compositions) and various
relations between these entities, such as conductivity, voltage, etc.
Automatically extracting this information to generate a material science
knowledge base is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose MatSciRE
(Material Science Relation Extractor), a Pointer Network-based encoder-decoder
framework, to jointly extract entities and relations from material science
articles as a triplet ($entity1, relation, entity2$). Specifically, we target
the battery materials and identify five relations to work on - conductivity,
coulombic efficiency, capacity, voltage, and energy. Our proposed approach
achieved a much better F1-score (0.771) than a previous attempt using
ChemDataExtractor (0.716). The overall graphical framework of MatSciRE is shown
in Fig 1. The material information is extracted from material science
literature in the form of entity-relation triplets using MatSciRE.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation technologies have been widely utilized in many scientific research
fields such as weather forecasting, fluid mechanics and biological populations.
It is the best tool to handle problems in complex systems, where closed-form
expressions are unavailable and the target distribution in the representation
space is too complex to be fully represented by a deep learning (DL) model. We
believe that the development of simulation technologies is consistent with
scientific paradigms. This paper induces the evolution of scientific paradigms
from the perspective of data, algorithms, and computational power. Building
upon this perspective, we divide simulation technologies into three stages
aligning with the emergence of new paradigms, and find that advanced simulation
technologies are typical instances of paradigms integration. Moreover, we
propose the concept of behavioral simulation (BS), specifically sophisticated
behavioral simulation (SBS), representing a higher degree of paradigms
integration based on foundation models to simulate complex social systems
involving sophisticated human strategies and behaviors. BS and further SBS are
designed to tackle challenges concerning the complex human system that
surpasses the capacity of traditional agent-based modeling simulation (ABMS),
which can be regarded as a possible next paradigm for science. Through this
work, we look forward to more powerful BS and SBS applications in scientific
research branches within social science.

<p class="mathjax">Supply chains transform raw materials into finished goods and distribute them
to end consumers. The vast majority of products we use daily are supplied to us
through complex global supply chains. This paper proposes a modelling
methodology for dynamic competitive supply chains based on game theory and
model predictive control. We model each manufacturer in the supply chain as a
rational utility maximizing agent that selects their actions by finding an
open-loop generalized Nash equilibrium of a multi-stage game. To react to
competitors and the state of the market, every agent re-plans their actions in
a receding horizon manner based on estimates of market and supplier parameters
thereby creating an approximate closed-loop equilibrium policy. We demonstrate
through numerical simulations that this modelling approach is computationally
tractable and generates economically interpretable behaviors in a variety of
settings such as demand spikes, supply shocks, and information asymmetry.

<p class="mathjax">Climate change challenges require a notable decrease in worldwide greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions across technology sectors. Digital technologies, especially
video streaming, accounting for most Internet traffic, make no exception. Video
streaming demand increases with remote working, multimedia communication
services (e.g., WhatsApp, Skype), video streaming content (e.g., YouTube,
Netflix), video resolution (4K/8K, 50 fps/60 fps), and multi-view video, making
energy consumption and environmental footprint critical. This survey
contributes to a better understanding of sustainable and efficient video
streaming technologies by providing insights into the state-of-the-art and
potential future directions for researchers, developers, and engineers, service
providers, hosting platforms, and consumers. We widen this survey's focus on
content provisioning and content consumption based on the observation that
continuously active network equipment underneath video streaming consumes
substantial energy independent of the transmitted data type. We propose a
taxonomy of factors that affect the energy consumption in video streaming, such
as encoding schemes, resource requirements, storage, content retrieval,
decoding, and display. We identify notable weaknesses in video streaming that
require further research for improved energy efficiency: (1) fixed bitrate
ladders in HTTP live streaming; (2) inefficient hardware utilization of
existing video players; (3) lack of comprehensive open energy measurement
dataset covering various device types and coding parameters for reproducible
research.

<p class="mathjax">Supporting applications in emerging domains like cyber-physical systems and
human-in-the-loop scenarios typically requires adherence to strict end-to-end
delay guarantees. Contributions of many tandem processes unfolding layer by
layer within the wireless network result in violations of delay constraints,
thereby severely degrading application performance. Meeting the application's
stringent requirements necessitates coordinated optimization of the end-to-end
delay by fine-tuning all contributing processes. To achieve this task, we
designed and implemented EDAF, a framework to decompose packets' end-to-end
delays and determine each component's significance for 5G network. We showcase
EDAF on OpenAirInterface 5G uplink, modified to report timestamps across the
data plane. By applying the obtained insights, we optimized end-to-end uplink
delay by eliminating segmentation and frame-alignment delays, decreasing
average delay from 12ms to 4ms.

<p class="mathjax">We study matching settings in which a set of agents have private utilities
over a set of items. Each agent reports a partition of the items into approval
sets of different threshold utility levels. Given this limited information on
input, the goal is to compute an assignment of the items to the agents (subject
to cardinality constraints depending on the application) that (approximately)
maximizes the social welfare (the total utility of the agents for their
assigned items). We first consider the well-known, simple one-sided matching
problem in which each of $n$ agents is to be assigned exactly one of $n$ items.
We show that with $t$ threshold utility levels, the distortion of deterministic
matching algorithms is $\Theta(\sqrt[t]{n})$ while that of randomized
algorithms is $\Theta(\sqrt[t+1]{n})$. We then show that our distortion bounds
extend to a more general setting in which there are multiple copies of the
items, each agent can be assigned a number of items (even copies of the same
one) up to a capacity, and the utility of an agent for an item depends on the
number of its copies that the agent is given.

<p class="mathjax">Analog-Based In-Memory Computing (AIMC) inference accelerators can be used to
efficiently execute Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference workloads. However, to
mitigate accuracy losses, due to circuit and device non-idealities,
Hardware-Aware (HWA) training methodologies must be employed. These typically
require significant information about the underlying hardware. In this paper,
we propose two Post-Training (PT) optimization methods to improve accuracy
after training is performed. For each crossbar, the first optimizes the
conductance range of each column, and the second optimizes the input, i.e,
Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), range. It is demonstrated that, when these
methods are employed, the complexity during training, and the amount of
information about the underlying hardware can be reduced, with no notable
change in accuracy ($\leq$0.1%) when finetuning the pretrained RoBERTa
transformer model for all General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)
benchmark tasks. Additionally, it is demonstrated that further optimizing
learned parameters PT improves accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">This paper focuses on succinctness results for fragments of Linear Temporal
Logic with Past (LTL) devoid of binary temporal operators like until, and
provides methods to establish them. We prove that there is a family of cosafety
languages (Ln)_{n&gt;=1} such that Ln can be expressed with a pure future formula
of size O(n), but it requires formulae of size 2^{\Omega}(n) to be captured
with past formulae. As a by-product, such a succinctness result shows the
optimality of the pastification algorithm proposed in [Artale et al., KR,
2023]. We show that, in the considered case, succinctness cannot be proven by
relying on the classical automata-based method introduced in [Markey, Bull.
EATCS, 2003]. In place of this method, we devise and apply a combinatorial
proof system whose deduction trees represent LTL formulae. The system can be
seen as a proof-centric (one-player) view on the games used by Adler and
Immerman to study the succinctness of CTL.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the comprehension of multimedia content, bringing
together diverse modalities such as text, images, and videos. However, a
critical challenge faced by these models, especially when processing video
inputs, is the occurrence of hallucinations - erroneous perceptions or
interpretations, particularly at the event level. This study introduces an
innovative method to address event-level hallucinations in MLLMs, focusing on
specific temporal understanding in video content. Our approach leverages a
novel framework that extracts and utilizes event-specific information from both
the event query and the provided video to refine MLLMs' response. We propose a
unique mechanism that decomposes on-demand event queries into iconic actions.
Subsequently, we employ models like CLIP and BLIP2 to predict specific
timestamps for event occurrences. Our evaluation, conducted using the
Charades-STA dataset, demonstrates a significant reduction in temporal
hallucinations and an improvement in the quality of event-related responses.
This research not only provides a new perspective in addressing a critical
limitation of MLLMs but also contributes a quantitatively measurable method for
evaluating MLLMs in the context of temporal-related questions.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has attracted
considerable attention in various domains due to their remarkable performance
and versatility. As the use of these models continues to grow, the importance
of effective prompt engineering has come to the fore. Prompt optimization
emerges as a crucial challenge, as it has a direct impact on model performance
and the extraction of relevant information. Recently, evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) have shown promise in addressing this issue, paving the way for novel
optimization strategies. In this work, we propose a evolutionary
multi-objective (EMO) approach specifically tailored for prompt optimization
called EMO-Prompts, using sentiment analysis as a case study. We use sentiment
analysis capabilities as our experimental targets. Our results demonstrate that
EMO-Prompts effectively generates prompts capable of guiding the LLM to produce
texts embodying two conflicting emotions simultaneously.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce SPARse Fine-grained Contrastive Alignment (SPARC), a simple
method for pretraining more fine-grained multimodal representations from
image-text pairs. Given that multiple image patches often correspond to single
words, we propose to learn a grouping of image patches for every token in the
caption. To achieve this, we use a sparse similarity metric between image
patches and language tokens and compute for each token a language-grouped
vision embedding as the weighted average of patches. The token and
language-grouped vision embeddings are then contrasted through a fine-grained
sequence-wise loss that only depends on individual samples and does not require
other batch samples as negatives. This enables more detailed information to be
learned in a computationally inexpensive manner. SPARC combines this
fine-grained loss with a contrastive loss between global image and text
embeddings to learn representations that simultaneously encode global and local
information. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed method and show improved
performance over competing approaches both on image-level tasks relying on
coarse-grained information, e.g. classification, as well as region-level tasks
relying on fine-grained information, e.g. retrieval, object detection, and
segmentation. Moreover, SPARC improves model faithfulness and captioning in
foundational vision-language models.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot segmentation aims to train a segmentation model that can fast adapt
to a novel task for which only a few annotated images are provided. Most recent
models have adopted a prototype-based paradigm for few-shot inference. These
approaches may have limited generalization capacity beyond the standard 1- or
5-shot settings. In this paper, we closely examine and reevaluate the
fine-tuning based learning scheme that fine-tunes the classification layer of a
deep segmentation network pre-trained on diverse base classes. To improve the
generalizability of the classification layer optimized with sparsely annotated
samples, we introduce an instance-aware data augmentation (IDA) strategy that
augments the support images based on the relative sizes of the target objects.
The proposed IDA effectively increases the support set's diversity and promotes
the distribution consistency between support and query images. On the other
hand, the large visual difference between query and support images may hinder
knowledge transfer and cripple the segmentation performance. To cope with this
challenge, we introduce the local consensus guided cross attention (LCCA) to
align the query feature with support features based on their dense correlation,
further improving the model's generalizability to the query image. The
significant performance improvements on the standard few-shot segmentation
benchmarks PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ verify the efficacy of our proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">Goal representation affects the performance of Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) algorithms by decomposing the complex learning problem into
easier subtasks. Recent studies show that representations that preserve
temporally abstract environment dynamics are successful in solving difficult
problems and provide theoretical guarantees for optimality. These methods
however cannot scale to tasks where environment dynamics increase in complexity
i.e. the temporally abstract transition relations depend on larger number of
variables. On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial
abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include
scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge.
<br />In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer HRL algorithm that introduces,
at different levels of the hierarchy, both a spatial and a temporal goal
abstraction. We provide a theoretical study of the regret bounds of the learned
policies. We evaluate the approach on complex continuous control tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of spatial and temporal abstractions learned by
this approach.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate performance estimation of future many-node machines is challenging
because it requires detailed simulation models of both node and network.
However, simulating the full system in detail is unfeasible in terms of compute
and memory resources. State-of-the-art techniques use a two-phase approach that
combines detailed simulation of a single node with network-only simulation of
the full system. We show that these techniques, where the detailed node
simulation is done in isolation, are inaccurate because they ignore two
important node-level effects: compute time variability, and inter-node
communication.
<br />We propose a novel three-stage simulation method to allow scalable and
accurate many-node simulation, combining native profiling, detailed node
simulation and high-level network simulation. By including timing variability
and the impact of external nodes, our method leads to more accurate estimates.
We validate our technique against measurements on a multi-node cluster, and
report an average 6.7% error on 64 nodes (maximum error of 12%), compared to on
average 27% error and up to 54% when timing variability and the scaling
overhead are ignored. At higher node counts, the prediction error of ignoring
variable timings and scaling overhead continues to increase compared to our
technique, and may lead to selecting the wrong optimal cluster configuration.
<br />Using our technique, we are able to accurately project performance to
thousands of nodes within a day of simulation time, using only a single or a
few simulation hosts. Our method can be used to quickly explore large many-node
design spaces, including node micro-architecture, node count and network
configuration.

<p class="mathjax">One of the interests of modern poultry farming is the vocalization of laying
hens which contain very useful information on health behavior. This information
is used as health and well-being indicators that help breeders better monitor
laying hens, which involves early detection of problems for rapid and more
effective intervention. In this work, we focus on the sound analysis for the
recognition of the types of calls of the laying hens in order to propose a
robust system of characterization of their behavior for a better monitoring. To
do this, we first collected and annotated laying hen call signals, then
designed an optimal acoustic characterization based on the combination of time
and frequency domain features. We then used these features to build the
multi-label classification models based on recurrent neural network to assign a
semantic class to the vocalization that characterize the laying hen behavior.
The results show an overall performance with our model based on the combination
of time and frequency domain features that obtained the highest F1-score
(F1=92.75) with a gain of 17% on the models using the frequency domain features
and of 8% on the compared approaches from the litterature.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, data-driven modeling approaches have gained considerable
traction in various meteorological applications, particularly in the realm of
weather forecasting. However, these approaches often encounter challenges when
dealing with extreme weather conditions. In light of this, we propose
GA-SmaAt-GNet, a novel generative adversarial architecture that makes use of
two methodologies aimed at enhancing the performance of deep learning models
for extreme precipitation nowcasting. Firstly, it uses a novel SmaAt-GNet built
upon the successful SmaAt-UNet architecture as generator. This network
incorporates precipitation masks (binarized precipitation maps) as an
additional data source, leveraging valuable information for improved
predictions. Additionally, GA-SmaAt-GNet utilizes an attention-augmented
discriminator inspired by the well-established Pix2Pix architecture.
Furthermore, we assess the performance of GA-SmaAt-GNet using real-life
precipitation dataset from the Netherlands. Our experimental results reveal a
notable improvement in both overall performance and for extreme precipitation
events. Furthermore, we conduct uncertainty analysis on the proposed
GA-SmaAt-GNet model as well as on the precipitation dataset, providing
additional insights into the predictive capabilities of the model. Finally, we
offer further insights into the predictions of our proposed model using
Grad-CAM. This visual explanation technique generates activation heatmaps,
illustrating areas of the input that are more activated for various parts of
the network.

false-activation of background regions due to the fact that a lack of detailed
supervision can hinder the model's ability to understand the image as a whole.
In this paper, we propose a novel Question-Answer Cross-Language-Image Matching
framework for WSSS (QA-CLIMS), leveraging the vision-language foundation model
to maximize the text-based understanding of images and guide the generation of
activation maps. First, a series of carefully designed questions are posed to
the VQA (Visual Question Answering) model with Question-Answer Prompt
Engineering (QAPE) to generate a corpus of both foreground target objects and
backgrounds that are adaptive to query images. We then employ contrastive
learning in a Region Image Text Contrastive (RITC) network to compare the
obtained foreground and background regions with the generated corpus. Our
approach exploits the rich textual information from the open vocabulary as
additional supervision, enabling the model to generate high-quality CAMs with a
more complete object region and reduce false-activation of background regions.
We conduct extensive analysis to validate the proposed method and show that our
approach performs state-of-the-art on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO
datasets. Code is available at: https://github.com/CVI-SZU/QA-CLIMS

<p class="mathjax">Edge caching is a promising solution for next-generation networks by
empowering caching units in small-cell base stations (SBSs), which allows user
equipments (UEs) to fetch users' requested contents that have been pre-cached
in SBSs. It is crucial for SBSs to predict accurate popular contents through
learning while protecting users' personal information. Traditional federated
learning (FL) can protect users' privacy but the data discrepancies among UEs
can lead to a degradation in model quality. Therefore, it is necessary to train
personalized local models for each UE to predict popular contents accurately.
In addition, the cached contents can be shared among adjacent SBSs in
next-generation networks, thus caching predicted popular contents in different
SBSs may affect the cost to fetch contents. Hence, it is critical to determine
where the popular contents are cached cooperatively. To address these issues,
we propose a cooperative edge caching scheme based on elastic federated and
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CEFMR) to optimize the cost in the
network. We first propose an elastic FL algorithm to train the personalized
model for each UE, where adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model is adopted for
training to improve the prediction accuracy, then {a popular} content
prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the popular contents for each SBS
based on the trained AAE model. Finally, we propose a multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MADRL) based algorithm to decide where the predicted
popular contents are collaboratively cached among SBSs. Our experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme to existing baseline
caching schemes.

<p class="mathjax">One of the fundamental challenges in microscopy (MS) image analysis is
instance segmentation (IS), particularly when segmenting cluster regions where
multiple objects of varying sizes and shapes may be connected or even
overlapped in arbitrary orientations. Existing IS methods usually fail in
handling such scenarios, as they rely on coarse instance representations such
as keypoints and horizontal bounding boxes (h-bboxes). In this paper, we
propose a novel one-stage framework named A2B-IS to address this challenge and
enhance the accuracy of IS in MS images. Our approach represents each instance
with a pixel-level mask map and a rotated bounding box (r-bbox). Unlike
two-stage methods that use box proposals for segmentations, our method
decouples mask and box predictions, enabling simultaneous processing to
streamline the model pipeline. Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian skeleton
map to aid the IS task in two key ways: (1) It guides anchor placement,
reducing computational costs while improving the model's capacity to learn
RoI-aware features by filtering out noise from background regions. (2) It
ensures accurate isolation of densely packed instances by rectifying erroneous
box predictions near instance boundaries. To further enhance the performance,
we integrate two modules into the framework: (1) An Atrous Attention Block
(A2B) designed to extract high-resolution feature maps with fine-grained
multiscale information, and (2) A Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) strategy that
leverages both labeled and unlabeled images for model training. Our method has
been thoroughly validated on two large-scale MS datasets, demonstrating its
superiority over most state-of-the-art approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Internet memes have gained significant influence in communicating political,
psychological, and sociocultural ideas. While memes are often humorous, there
has been a rise in the use of memes for trolling and cyberbullying. Although a
wide variety of effective deep learning-based models have been developed for
detecting offensive multimodal memes, only a few works have been done on
explainability aspect. Recent laws like "right to explanations" of General Data
Protection Regulation, have spurred research in developing interpretable models
rather than only focusing on performance. Motivated by this, we introduce {\em
MultiBully-Ex}, the first benchmark dataset for multimodal explanation from
code-mixed cyberbullying memes. Here, both visual and textual modalities are
highlighted to explain why a given meme is cyberbullying. A Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) projection-based multimodal shared-private
multitask approach has been proposed for visual and textual explanation of a
meme. Experimental results demonstrate that training with multimodal
explanations improves performance in generating textual justifications and more
accurately identifying the visual evidence supporting a decision with reliable
performance improvements.

<p class="mathjax">Third-party dependency updates can cause a build to fail if the new
dependency version introduces a change that is incompatible with the usage:
this is called a breaking dependency update. Research on breaking dependency
updates is active, with works on characterization, understanding, automatic
repair of breaking updates, and other software engineering aspects. All such
research projects require a benchmark of breaking updates that has the
following properties: 1) it contains real-world breaking updates; 2) the
breaking updates can be executed; 3) the benchmark provides stable scientific
artifacts of breaking updates over time, a property we call reproducibility. To
the best of our knowledge, such a benchmark is missing. To address this
problem, we present BUMP, a new benchmark that contains reproducible breaking
dependency updates in the context of Java projects built with the Maven build
system. BUMP contains 571 breaking dependency updates collected from 153 Java
projects. BUMP ensures long-term reproducibility of dependency updates on
different platforms, guaranteeing consistent build failures. We categorize the
different causes of build breakage in BUMP, providing novel insights for future
work on breaking update engineering. To our knowledge, BUMP is the first of its
kind, providing hundreds of real-world breaking updates that have all been made
reproducible.

<p class="mathjax">Job scheduling is a critical component of workload management systems that
can significantly influence system performance, e.g., in HPC clusters. The
scheduling objectives are often mixed, such as maximizing resource utilization
and minimizing job waiting time. An increasing number of researchers are moving
from heuristic-based approaches to Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches in
order to optimize scheduling objectives. However, the job scheduler's state
space is partially observable to a DRL-based agent because the job queue is
practically unbounded. The agent's observation of the state space is constant
in size since the input size of the neural networks is predefined. All existing
solutions to this problem intuitively allow the agent to observe a fixed window
size of jobs at the head of the job queue. In our research, we have seen that
such an approach can lead to "window staleness" where the window becomes full
of jobs that can not be scheduled until the cluster has completed sufficient
work. In this paper, we propose a novel general technique that we call
\emph{split window}, which allows the agent to observe both the head \emph{and
tail} of the queue. With this technique, the agent can observe all arriving
jobs at least once, which completely eliminates the window staleness problem.
By leveraging the split window, the agent can significantly reduce the average
job waiting time and average queue length, alternatively allowing the use of
much smaller windows and, therefore, faster training times. We show a range of
simulation results using HPC job scheduling trace data that supports the
effectiveness of our technique.

<p class="mathjax">On-device learning remains a formidable challenge, especially when dealing
with resource-constrained devices that have limited computational capabilities.
This challenge is primarily rooted in two key issues: first, the memory
available on embedded devices is typically insufficient to accommodate the
memory-intensive back-propagation algorithm, which often relies on
floating-point precision. Second, the development of learning algorithms on
models with extreme quantization levels, such as Binary Neural Networks (BNNs),
is critical due to the drastic reduction in bit representation. In this study,
we propose a solution that combines recent advancements in the field of
Continual Learning (CL) and Binary Neural Networks to enable on-device training
while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, our approach leverages
binary latent replay (LR) activations and a novel quantization scheme that
significantly reduces the number of bits required for gradient computation. The
experimental validation demonstrates a significant accuracy improvement in
combination with a noticeable reduction in memory requirement, confirming the
suitability of our approach in expanding the practical applications of deep
learning in real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Rule set learning has recently been frequently revisited because of its
interpretability. Existing methods have several shortcomings though. First,
most existing methods impose orders among rules, either explicitly or
implicitly, which makes the models less comprehensible. Second, due to the
difficulty of handling conflicts caused by overlaps (i.e., instances covered by
multiple rules), existing methods often do not consider probabilistic rules.
Third, learning classification rules for multi-class target is understudied, as
most existing methods focus on binary classification or multi-class
classification via the ``one-versus-rest" approach.
<br />To address these shortcomings, we propose TURS, for Truly Unordered Rule
Sets. To resolve conflicts caused by overlapping rules, we propose a novel
model that exploits the probabilistic properties of our rule sets, with the
intuition of only allowing rules to overlap if they have similar probabilistic
outputs. We next formalize the problem of learning a TURS model based on the
MDL principle and develop a carefully designed heuristic algorithm. We
benchmark against a wide range of rule-based methods and demonstrate that our
method learns rule sets that have lower model complexity and highly competitive
predictive performance. In addition, we empirically show that rules in our
model are empirically ``independent" and hence truly unordered.

underlying noise level is known in many cases. However, the relevant question
is, which level of discretization, again driven by the noise level, is required
in order to
<br />achieve this best possible accuracy. The proposed concept adapts the one from
Information-based Complexity.
<br />Several examples indicate the relevance of this concept in the light of the

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer a model learned using
labeled data from the source domain to unlabeled data in the target domain. To
address the large domain gap issue between the source and target domains, we
propose a novel regularization method for domain adaptive object detection,
BlenDA, by generating the pseudo samples of the intermediate domains and their
corresponding soft domain labels for adaptation training. The intermediate
samples are generated by dynamically blending the source images with their
corresponding translated images using an off-the-shelf pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model which takes the text label of the target domain
as input and has demonstrated superior image-to-image translation quality.
Based on experimental results from two adaptation benchmarks, our proposed
approach can significantly enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art
domain adaptive object detector, Adversarial Query Transformer (AQT).
Particularly, in the Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes adaptation, we achieve an
impressive 53.4% mAP on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 1.5%. It is worth noting that our proposed method is also
applicable to various paradigms of domain adaptive object detection. The code

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art video object detection methods maintain a memory structure,
either a sliding window or a memory queue, to enhance the current frame using
attention mechanisms. However, we argue that these memory structures are not
efficient or sufficient because of two implied operations: (1) concatenating
all features in memory for enhancement, leading to a heavy computational cost;
(2) frame-wise memory updating, preventing the memory from capturing more
temporal information. In this paper, we propose a multi-level aggregation
architecture via memory bank called MAMBA. Specifically, our memory bank
employs two novel operations to eliminate the disadvantages of existing
methods: (1) light-weight key-set construction which can significantly reduce
the computational cost; (2) fine-grained feature-wise updating strategy which
enables our method to utilize knowledge from the whole video. To better enhance
features from complementary levels, i.e., feature maps and proposals, we
further propose a generalized enhancement operation (GEO) to aggregate
multi-level features in a unified manner. We conduct extensive evaluations on
the challenging ImageNetVID dataset. Compared with existing state-of-the-art
methods, our method achieves superior performance in terms of both speed and
accuracy. More remarkably, MAMBA achieves mAP of 83.7/84.6% at 12.6/9.1 FPS
with ResNet-101. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">We study discretizations of fractional fully nonlinear equations by powers of
discrete Laplacians. Our problems are parabolic and of order $\sigma\in(0,2)$
since they involve fractional Laplace operators $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$. They
arise e.g.~in control and game theory as dynamic programming equations, and
solutions are non-smooth in general and should be interpreted as viscosity
solutions. Our approximations are realized as finite-difference quadrature
approximations and are 2nd order accurate for all values of $\sigma$. The
accuracy of previous approximations depend on $\sigma$ and are worse when
$\sigma$ is close to $2$. We show that the schemes are monotone, consistent,
$L^\infty$-stable, and convergent using a priori estimates, viscosity solutions
theory, and the method of half-relaxed limits. We present several numerical
examples.

<p class="mathjax">The emergence of digital payment systems has transformed how individuals
conduct financial transactions, offering convenience, security, and efficiency.
One groundbreaking innovation making waves in the Indian financial landscape is
the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), developed by the National Payments
Corporation of India (NPCI). Existing work has explored how digital payments
benefit a country's economy and GDP. However, our study explores how the
introduction of UPI has influenced spending behavior among Indian users on an
"individual" level. We gathered 235 valid survey responses encompassing diverse
demographics and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 survey
respondents. Approximately 75% of the survey respondents reported increased
spending due to UPI, with only 7% indicating reduced spending. Significantly,
91.5% of the respondents reported satisfaction with their UPI usage. Also 95.2%
of the survey respondents found making payments via UPI convenient. Our
research also provides suggestions for UPI applications and various
stakeholders to enhance digital payment systems, enabling users to make
informed decisions and fostering responsible financial management.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate grasping is the key to several robotic tasks including assembly and
household robotics. Executing a successful grasp in a cluttered environment
requires multiple levels of scene understanding: First, the robot needs to
analyze the geometric properties of individual objects to find feasible grasps.
These grasps need to be compliant with the local object geometry. Second, for
each proposed grasp, the robot needs to reason about the interactions with
other objects in the scene. Finally, the robot must compute a collision-free
grasp trajectory while taking into account the geometry of the target object.
Most grasp detection algorithms directly predict grasp poses in a monolithic
fashion, which does not capture the composability of the environment. In this
paper, we introduce an end-to-end architecture for object-centric grasping. The
method uses pointcloud data from a single arbitrary viewing direction as an
input and generates an instance-centric representation for each partially
observed object in the scene. This representation is further used for object
reconstruction and grasp detection in cluttered table-top scenes. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed method by extensively evaluating it against
state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets, indicating superior performance
for grasping and reconstruction. Additionally, we demonstrate real-world
applicability by decluttering scenes with varying numbers of objects.

<p class="mathjax">Expected Goals (xG) has emerged as a popular tool for evaluating finishing
skill in soccer analytics. It involves comparing a player's cumulative xG with
their actual goal output, where consistent overperformance indicates strong
finishing ability. However, the assessment of finishing skill in soccer using
xG remains contentious due to players' difficulty in consistently outperforming
their cumulative xG. In this paper, we aim to address the limitations and
nuances surrounding the evaluation of finishing skill using xG statistics.
Specifically, we explore three hypotheses: (1) the deviation between actual and
expected goals is an inadequate metric due to the high variance of shot
outcomes and limited sample sizes, (2) the inclusion of all shots in cumulative
xG calculation may be inappropriate, and (3) xG models contain biases arising
from interdependencies in the data that affect skill measurement. We found that
sustained overperformance of cumulative xG requires both high shot volumes and
exceptional finishing, including all shot types can obscure the finishing
ability of proficient strikers, and that there is a persistent bias that makes
the actual and expected goals closer for excellent finishers than it really is.
Overall, our analysis indicates that we need more nuanced quantitative
approaches for investigating a player's finishing ability, which we achieved
using a technique from AI fairness to learn an xG model that is calibrated for
multiple subgroups of players. As a concrete use case, we show that (1) the
standard biased xG model underestimates Messi's GAX by 17% and (2) Messi's GAX
is 27% higher than the typical elite high-shot-volume attacker, indicating that
Messi is even a more exceptional finisher than people commonly believed.

<p class="mathjax">Effective tracking and re-identification of players is essential for
analyzing soccer videos. But, it is a challenging task due to the non-linear
motion of players, the similarity in appearance of players from the same team,
and frequent occlusions. Therefore, the ability to extract meaningful
embeddings to represent players is crucial in developing an effective tracking
and re-identification system. In this paper, a multi-purpose part-based person
representation method, called PRTreID, is proposed that performs three tasks of
role classification, team affiliation, and re-identification, simultaneously.
In contrast to available literature, a single network is trained with
multi-task supervision to solve all three tasks, jointly. The proposed joint
method is computationally efficient due to the shared backbone. Also, the
multi-task learning leads to richer and more discriminative representations, as
demonstrated by both quantitative and qualitative results. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of PRTreID, it is integrated with a state-of-the-art tracking
method, using a part-based post-processing module to handle long-term tracking.
The proposed tracking method outperforms all existing tracking methods on the
challenging SoccerNet tracking dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown considerable effectiveness in a
variety of graph learning tasks, particularly those based on the
message-passing approach in recent years. However, their performance is often
constrained by a limited receptive field, a challenge that becomes more acute
in the presence of sparse graphs. In light of the power series, which possesses
infinite expansion capabilities, we propose a novel \underline{G}raph
\underline{P}ower \underline{F}ilter \underline{N}eural Network (GPFN) that
enhances node classification by employing a power series graph filter to
augment the receptive field. Concretely, our GPFN designs a new way to build a
graph filter with an infinite receptive field based on the convergence power
series, which can be analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains. Besides, we
theoretically prove that our GPFN is a general framework that can integrate any
power series and capture long-range dependencies. Finally, experimental results
on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GPFN over state-of-the-art
baselines.

applications including safe manned and unmanned aviation. Current weather
models require too much compute and lack the necessary predictive capabilities
as they are valid only at the scale of multiple kilometers and hours - much
lower spatial and temporal resolutions than these applications require. Our
work, for the first time, demonstrates the ability to predict low-altitude wind
in real-time on limited-compute devices, from only sparse measurement data. We
train a neural network, WindSeer, using only synthetic data from computational
fluid dynamics simulations and show that it can successfully predict real wind
fields over terrain with known topography from just a few noisy and spatially
clustered wind measurements. WindSeer can generate accurate predictions at
different resolutions and domain sizes on previously unseen topography without

<p class="mathjax">Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are increasingly recognized for
their performance in areas like the web and e-commerce, where resilience
against adversarial attacks is crucial. However, existing adversarial attack
methods, which are primarily designed for homogeneous graphs, fall short when
applied to HGNNs due to their limited ability to address the structural and
semantic complexity of HGNNs. This paper introduces HGAttack, the first
dedicated gray box evasion attack method for heterogeneous graphs. We design a
novel surrogate model to closely resemble the behaviors of the target HGNN and
utilize gradient-based methods for perturbation generation. Specifically, the
proposed surrogate model effectively leverages heterogeneous information by
extracting meta-path induced subgraphs and applying GNNs to learn node
embeddings with distinct semantics from each subgraph. This approach improves
the transferability of generated attacks on the target HGNN and significantly
reduces memory costs. For perturbation generation, we introduce a
semantics-aware mechanism that leverages subgraph gradient information to
autonomously identify vulnerable edges across a wide range of relations within
a constrained perturbation budget. We validate HGAttack's efficacy with
comprehensive experiments on three datasets, providing empirical analyses of
its generated perturbations. Outperforming baseline methods, HGAttack
demonstrated significant efficacy in diminishing the performance of target HGNN
models, affirming the effectiveness of our approach in evaluating the
robustness of HGNNs against adversarial attacks.

gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining
expression complexity have relied on multistage pruning methods with
fine-tuning, but these often lead to significant performance loss. In this
work, we propose SymbolNet, a neural network approach to symbolic regression in
a novel framework that enables dynamic pruning of model weights, input
features, and mathematical operators in a single training, where both training
loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a
sparsity regularization term per pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its
own strength and lead to convergence to a target sparsity level. In contrast to
most existing symbolic regression methods that cannot efficiently handle
datasets with more than $O$(10) inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN
(3072 inputs).

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the preferred tool to process graph
data, with their efficacy being boosted through graph data augmentation
techniques. Despite the evolution of augmentation methods, issues like graph
property distortions and restricted structural changes persist. This leads to
the question: Is it possible to develop more property-conserving and
structure-sensitive augmentation methods? Through a spectral lens, we
investigate the interplay between graph properties, their augmentation, and
their spectral behavior, and found that keeping the low-frequency eigenvalues
unchanged can preserve the critical properties at a large scale when generating
augmented graphs. These observations inform our introduction of the Dual-Prism
(DP) augmentation method, comprising DP-Noise and DP-Mask, which adeptly
retains essential graph properties while diversifying augmented graphs.
Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of our approach, providing a new
and promising direction for graph data augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the problem of co-synthesis in $k$-player games over a
finite graph where each player has an individual $\omega$-regular specification
$\phi_i$. In this context, a secure equilibrium (SE) is a Nash equilibrium
w.r.t. the lexicographically ordered objectives of each player to first satisfy
their own specification, and second, to falsify other players' specifications.
A winning secure equilibrium (WSE) is an SE strategy profile
$(\pi_i)_{i\in[1;k]}$ that ensures the specification
$\phi:=\bigwedge_{i\in[1;k]}\phi_i$ if no player deviates from their strategy
$\pi_i$. Distributed implementations generated from a WSE make components act
rationally by ensuring that a deviation from the WSE strategy profile is
immediately punished by a retaliating strategy that makes the involved players
lose.
<br />In this paper, we move from deviation punishment in WSE-based implementations
to a distributed, assume-guarantee based realization of WSE. This shift is
obtained by generalizing WSE from strategy profiles to specification profiles
$(\varphi_i)_{i\in[1;k]}$ with $\bigwedge_{i\in[1;k]}\varphi_i = \phi$, which
we call most general winning secure equilibria (GWSE). Such GWSE have the
property that each player can individually pick a strategy $\pi_i$ winning for
$\varphi_i$ (against all other players) and all resulting strategy profiles
$(\pi_i)_{i\in[1;k]}$ are guaranteed to be a WSE. The obtained flexibility in
players' strategy choices can be utilized for robustness and adaptability of
local implementations.
<br />Concretely, our contribution is three-fold: (1) we formalize GWSE for
$k$-player games over finite graphs, where each player has an $\omega$-regular
specification $\phi_i$; (2) we devise an iterative semi-algorithm for GWSE
synthesis in such games, and (3) obtain an exponential-time algorithm for GWSE
synthesis with parity specifications $\phi_i$.

applications in various domains, such as business processes and fraud
detection. Existing systems like ELK are commonly used to tackle this
challenge, but their performance deteriorates for large patterns, while they
suffer from limitations in terms of expressiveness and explanatory capabilities
for their responses. In this work, we propose a solution that integrates a
Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine into a broader query processsor on top of
a decoupled storage infrastructure containing inverted indices of log events.
The results demonstrate that our system excels in scalability and robustness,

<p class="mathjax">Customized text-to-video generation aims to generate high-quality videos
guided by text prompts and subject references. Current approaches designed for
single subjects suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more

novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance
of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence
of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a
basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention
control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of
diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific object area,
we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding
object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject
text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark, with 69
individual subjects and 57 meaningful pairs. Extensive qualitative,
quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method,

<p class="mathjax">Leveraging recent advancements in large language models, modern neural code
completion models have demonstrated the capability to generate highly accurate
code suggestions. However, their massive size poses challenges in terms of
computational costs and environmental impact, hindering their widespread
adoption in practical scenarios. Dynamic inference emerges as a promising
solution, as it allocates minimal computation during inference while
maintaining the model's performance. In this research, we explore dynamic
inference within the context of code completion. Initially, we conducted an
empirical investigation on GPT-2, focusing on the inference capabilities of
intermediate layers for code completion. We found that 54.4% of tokens can be
accurately generated using just the first layer, signifying significant
computational savings potential. Moreover, despite using all layers, the model
still fails to predict 14.5% of tokens correctly, and the subsequent
completions continued from them are rarely considered helpful, with only a 4.2%
Acceptance Rate. These findings motivate our exploration of dynamic inference
in code completion and inspire us to enhance it with a decision-making
mechanism that stops the generation of incorrect code. We thus propose a novel
dynamic inference method specifically tailored for code completion models. This
method aims not only to produce correct predictions with largely reduced
computation but also to prevent incorrect predictions proactively. Our
extensive evaluation shows that it can averagely skip 1.7 layers out of 16
layers in the models, leading to an 11.2% speedup with only a marginal 1.1%
reduction in ROUGE-L.

<p class="mathjax">Endowing machines with abstract reasoning ability has been a long-term
research topic in artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) is
widely used to probe abstract visual reasoning in machine intelligence, where
models need to understand the underlying rules and select the missing
bottom-right images out of candidate sets to complete image matrices. The
participators can display powerful reasoning ability by inferring the
underlying attribute-changing rules and imagining the missing images at
arbitrary positions. However, existing solvers can hardly manifest such an
ability in realistic RPM problems. In this paper, we propose a conditional
generative model to solve answer generation problems through Rule AbstractIon
and SElection (RAISE) in the latent space. RAISE encodes image attributes as
latent concepts and decomposes underlying rules into atomic rules by means of
concepts, which are abstracted as global learnable parameters. When generating
the answer, RAISE selects proper atomic rules out of the global knowledge set
for each concept and composes them into the integrated rule of an RPM. In most
configurations, RAISE outperforms the compared generative solvers in tasks of
generating bottom-right and arbitrary-position answers. We test RAISE in the
odd-one-out task and two held-out configurations to demonstrate how learning
decoupled latent concepts and atomic rules helps find the image breaking the
underlying rules and handle RPMs with unseen combinations of rules and
attributes.

<p class="mathjax">Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model
outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or
architectural modifications. Its application is, however, typically restricted
to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via
softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models
(LLMs). This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a
novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates
without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SGCD utilizes a locally
hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM,
effectively treating this initial output as a "sketch" for further elaboration.
This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and
enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model
transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through
experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing
how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP
tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based models excel in various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, attracting countless efforts to explain their inner workings. Prior
methods explain Transformers by focusing on the raw gradient and attention as
token attribution scores, where non-relevant information is often considered
during explanation computation, resulting in confusing results. In this work,
we propose highlighting the important information and eliminating irrelevant
information by a refined information flow on top of the layer-wise relevance
propagation (LRP) method. Specifically, we consider identifying syntactic and
positional heads as important attention heads and focus on the relevance
obtained from these important heads. Experimental results demonstrate that
irrelevant information does distort output attribution scores and then should
be masked during explanation computation. Compared to eight baselines on both
classification and question-answering datasets, our method consistently
outperforms with over 3\% to 33\% improvement on explanation metrics, providing
superior explanation performance. Our anonymous code repository is available

of error states, i.e., unsafety. However, finding deep counterexamples that
require a large bound is challenging for BMC. On the other hand, acceleration
techniques compute "shortcuts" that "compress" many execution steps into a
single one. In this paper, we tightly integrate acceleration techniques into
SMT-based bounded model checking. By adding suitable "shortcuts" to the
SMT-problem on the fly, our approach can quickly detect deep counterexamples,
even when only using small bounds. Moreover, using so-called blocking clauses,
our approach can prove safety of examples where BMC diverges. An empirical
comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques shows that our approach is
highly competitive for proving unsafety, and orthogonal to existing techniques
for proving safety.

<p class="mathjax">Crystal plasticity (CP) simulations are a tool for understanding how
microstructure morphology and texture affect mechanical properties and are an
essential component of elucidating the structure-property relations. However,
it can be computationally expensive. Hence, data-driven machine learning models
have been applied to predict the mean-field response of a polycrystal
representative volume element to reduce computation time. In this work, we
proposed a novel Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture for predicting
microstructure stress-strain response. It employs a convolutional neural
network in the trunk to encode the microstructure. To account for different
material properties, boundary conditions, and loading, we proposed using single
crystal stress-strain curves as inputs to the branch network, furnishing a
material-response-informed DeepONet. Using four numerical examples, we
demonstrate that the current DeepONet can be trained on a single material and
loading and then generalized to new conditions via transfer learning. Results
show that using single crystal responses as input outperforms a similar model
using material properties as inputs and overcomes limitations with changing
boundary conditions and temporal resolution. In all cases, the new model
achieved a $R^2$ value of above 0.99, and over 95\% of predicted stresses have
a relative error of $\le$ 5\%, indicating superior accuracy. With as few as 20
new data points and under 1min training time, the trained DeepONet can be
fine-tuned to generate accurate predictions on different materials and loading.
Once trained, the prediction speed is almost $1\times10^{4}$ times faster the
CP simulations. The efficiency and high generalizability of our DeepONet render
it a powerful data-driven surrogate model for CP simulations in multi-scale
analyses.

<p class="mathjax">Multiobjective optimization is a hot topic in the artificial intelligence and
operations research communities. The design and development of multiobjective
methods is a frequent task for researchers and practitioners. As a result of
this vibrant activity, a myriad of techniques have been proposed in the
literature to date, demonstrating a significant effectiveness for dealing with
situations coming from a wide range of real-world areas. This paper is focused
on a multiobjective problem related to optimizing Infrastructure-as-Code

been coined as IaC Optimizer Platform (IOP). Despite the fact that a
prototypical version of the IOP has been introduced in the literature before, a
deeper analysis focused on the resolution of the problem is needed, in order to
determine which is the most appropriate multiobjective method for embedding in
the IOP. The main motivation behind the analysis conducted in this work is to
enhance the IOP performance as much as possible. This is a crucial aspect of
this system, deeming that it will be deployed in a real environment, as it is
being developed as part of a H2020 European project. Going deeper, we resort in
this paper to nine different evolutionary computation-based multiobjective
algorithms. For assessing the quality of the considered solvers, 12 different
problem instances have been generated based on real-world settings. Results
obtained by each method after 10 independent runs have been compared using
Friedman's non-parametric tests. Findings reached from the tests carried out
lad to the creation of a multi-algorithm system, capable of applying different
techniques according to the user's needs.

<p class="mathjax">ChatGPT, as a language model based on large-scale pre-training, has exerted a
profound influence on the domain of machine translation. In ChatGPT, a "Prompt"
refers to a segment of text or instruction employed to steer the model towards
generating a specific category of response. The design of the translation
prompt emerges as a key aspect that can wield influence over factors such as
the style, precision and accuracy of the translation to a certain extent.
However, there is a lack of a common standard and methodology on how to design
and select a translation prompt. Accordingly, this paper proposes a generic
taxonomy, which defines gradable translation prompts in terms of expression
type, translation style, POS information and explicit statement, thus
facilitating the construction of prompts endowed with distinct attributes
tailored for various translation tasks. Specific experiments and cases are
selected to validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

<p class="mathjax">World models play a crucial role in understanding and predicting the dynamics
of the world, which is essential for video generation. However, existing world
models are confined to specific scenarios such as gaming or driving, limiting
their ability to capture the complexity of general world dynamic environments.
Therefore, we introduce WorldDreamer, a pioneering world model to foster a
comprehensive comprehension of general world physics and motions, which
significantly enhances the capabilities of video generation. Drawing
inspiration from the success of large language models, WorldDreamer frames
world modeling as an unsupervised visual sequence modeling challenge. This is
achieved by mapping visual inputs to discrete tokens and predicting the masked
ones. During this process, we incorporate multi-modal prompts to facilitate
interaction within the world model. Our experiments show that WorldDreamer
excels in generating videos across different scenarios, including natural
scenes and driving environments. WorldDreamer showcases versatility in
executing tasks such as text-to-video conversion, image-tovideo synthesis, and
video editing. These results underscore WorldDreamer's effectiveness in
capturing dynamic elements within diverse general world environments.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning are inherently hampered by data heterogeneity: non-iid
distributed training data over local clients. We propose a novel model training
approach for federated learning, FLex&amp;Chill, which exploits the Logit Chilling
method. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that, in the presence of
non-iid data characteristics inherent in federated learning systems, this
approach can expedite model convergence and improve inference accuracy.
Quantitatively, from our experiments, we observe up to 6X improvement in the
global federated learning model convergence time, and up to 3.37% improvement
in inference accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion
in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online
determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model
uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise,
in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in
the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. To cope with
such situations, model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and
demonstrated performance improvements, highlighting the need for a robust
adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive and introduce A-KIT, an adaptive
Kalman-informed transformer to learn the varying process noise covariance
online. The A-KIT framework is applicable to any type of sensor fusion. Here,
we present our approach to nonlinear sensor fusion based on an inertial
navigation system and Doppler velocity log. By employing real recorded data
from an autonomous underwater vehicle, we show that A-KIT outperforms the
conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average
of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Honey bees pollinate about one-third of the world's food supply, but bee
colonies have alarmingly declined by nearly 40% over the past decade due to
several factors, including pesticides and pests. Traditional methods for
monitoring beehives, such as human inspection, are subjective, disruptive, and
time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, artificial intelligence has been
used to assess beehive health. However, previous studies have lacked an
end-to-end solution and primarily relied on data from a single source, either
bee images or sounds. This study introduces a comprehensive system consisting
of bee object detection and health evaluation. Additionally, it utilized a
combination of visual and audio signals to analyze bee behaviors. An
Attention-based Multimodal Neural Network (AMNN) was developed to adaptively
focus on key features from each type of signal for accurate bee health
assessment. The AMNN achieved an overall accuracy of 92.61%, surpassing eight
existing single-signal Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural
Networks. It outperformed the best image-based model by 32.51% and the top
sound-based model by 13.98% while maintaining efficient processing times.
Furthermore, it improved prediction robustness, attaining an F1-score higher
than 90% across all four evaluated health conditions. The study also shows that
audio signals are more reliable than images for assessing bee health. By
seamlessly integrating AMNN with image and sound data in a comprehensive bee
health monitoring system, this approach provides a more efficient and
non-invasive solution for the early detection of bee diseases and the
preservation of bee colonies.

<p class="mathjax">Reliable integration and operation of renewable distributed energy resources
requires accurate distribution grid models. However, obtaining precise models
is often prohibitively expensive, given their large scale and the ongoing
nature of grid operations. To address this challenge, considerable efforts have
been devoted to harnessing abundant consumption data for automatic model
inference. The primary result of the paper is that, while the impedance of a
line or a network can be estimated without synchronized phase angle
measurements in a consistent way, the admittance cannot. Furthermore, a
detailed statistical analysis is presented, quantifying the expected estimation
errors of four prevalent admittance estimation methods. Such errors constitute
fundamental model inference limitations that cannot be resolved with more data.
These findings are empirically validated using synthetic data and real
measurements from the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, confirming the theory.
The results contribute to our understanding of grid estimation limitations and
uncertainties, offering guidance for both practitioners and researchers in the
pursuit of more reliable and cost-effective solutions.

<p class="mathjax">Arbitrary shape scene text detection is of great importance in scene
understanding tasks. Due to the complexity and diversity of text in natural
scenes, existing scene text algorithms have limited accuracy for detecting
arbitrary shape text. In this paper, we propose a novel arbitrary shape scene
text detector through boundary points dynamic optimization(BPDO). The proposed
model is designed with a text aware module (TAM) and a boundary point dynamic
optimization module (DOM). Specifically, the model designs a text aware module
based on segmentation to obtain boundary points describing the central region
of the text by extracting a priori information about the text region. Then,
based on the idea of deformable attention, it proposes a dynamic optimization
model for boundary points, which gradually optimizes the exact position of the
boundary points based on the information of the adjacent region of each
boundary point. Experiments on CTW-1500, Total-Text, and MSRA-TD500 datasets
show that the model proposed in this paper achieves a performance that is
better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm, proving the
effectiveness of the model.

<p class="mathjax">The task of Information Extraction (IE) involves automatically converting
unstructured textual content into structured data. Most research in this field
concentrates on extracting all facts or a specific set of relationships from
documents. In this paper, we present a method for the extraction and
categorisation of an unrestricted set of relationships from text. Our method
relies on morpho-syntactic extraction patterns obtained by a distant
supervision method, and creates Syntactic and Semantic Indices to extract and
classify candidate graphs. We evaluate our approach on six datasets built on
Wikidata and Wikipedia. The evaluation shows that our approach can achieve
Precision scores of up to 0.85, but with lower Recall and F1 scores. Our
approach allows to quickly create rule-based systems for Information Extraction

<p class="mathjax">The increasing demand for intelligent systems capable of interpreting and
reasoning about visual content requires the development of Large Multi-Modal
Models (LMMs) that are not only accurate but also have explicit reasoning
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to imbue an LMM with the
ability to conduct explicit reasoning based on visual content and textual
instructions. We introduce a system that can ask a question to acquire
necessary knowledge, thereby enhancing the robustness and explicability of the
reasoning process. Our method comprises the development of a novel dataset
generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to promote chain-of-thought
reasoning combined with a question-asking mechanism. We designed an LMM, which
has high capabilities on region awareness to address the intricate requirements
of image-text alignment. The model undergoes a three-stage training phase,
starting with large-scale image-text alignment using a large-scale datasets,
followed by instruction tuning, and fine-tuning with a focus on
chain-of-thought reasoning. The results demonstrate a stride toward a more
robust, accurate, and interpretable LMM, capable of reasoning explicitly and

<p class="mathjax">While magnetic solid-state memory has found commercial applications to date,
magnetic logic has rather remained on a conceptual level so far. Here, we
discuss open challenges of different spintronic logic approaches, which use
magnetic excitations for computation. While different logic gate designs have
been proposed and proof of concept experiments have been reported, no
nontrivial operational spintronic circuit has been demonstrated due to many
open challenges in spintronic circuit and system design. Furthermore, the
integration of spintronic circuits in CMOS systems will require the usage of
transducers between the electric (CMOS) and magnetic domains. We show that
these transducers can limit the performance as well as the energy consumption
of hybrid CMOS-spintronic systems. Hence, the optimization of transducer
efficiency will be a major step towards competitive spintronic logic system.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly supervised text-based person re-identification (TPRe-ID) seeks to
retrieve images of a target person using textual descriptions, without relying
on identity annotations and is more challenging and practical. The primary
challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature
variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on
instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which
are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical
Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP
model to weakly supervised TPRe-ID for the first time, mapping visual and
textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed
Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between
heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person
through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping
fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further
distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the
creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between
image-text pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CPCL
attains state-of-the-art performance on all three public datasets, with a
significant improvement of 11.58%, 8.77% and 5.25% in Rank@1 accuracy on
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/codeGallery24/CPCL.

<p class="mathjax">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by
rapid and irregular contractions of the atria. It significantly elevates the
risk of strokes due to slowed blood flow in the atria, especially in the left
atrial appendage, which is prone to blood clot formation. Such clots can
migrate into cerebral arteries, leading to ischemic stroke. To assess whether
AF patients should be prescribed anticoagulants, doctors often use the
CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. However, anticoagulant use must be approached with
caution as it can impact clotting functions. This study introduces a machine
learning algorithm that predicts whether patients with AF should be recommended
anticoagulant therapy using 12-lead ECG data. In this model, we use STOME to
enhance time-series data and then process it through a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). By incorporating a path development layer, the model achieves a
specificity of 30.6% under the condition of an NPV of 1. In contrast, LSTM
algorithms without path development yield a specificity of only 2.7% under the
same NPV condition.

this problem. We first propose to define the concept of dysfluent speech and
dysfluent speech modeling. We then present Hierarchical Unconstrained
Dysfluency Modeling (H-UDM) approach that addresses both dysfluency
transcription and detection to eliminate the need for extensive manual

bias, highlighting the challenges posed by cross-linguistic settings and
statistical dependencies. A comprehensive overview of relevant existing work
related to gender bias in both conventional Neural Machine Translation
approaches and Generative Pretrained Transformer models employed as Machine

<p class="mathjax">Segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms can handle arbitrary shape
scene texts and have strong robustness and adaptability, so it has attracted
wide attention. Existing segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms
usually only segment the pixels in the center region of the text, while
ignoring other information of the text region, such as edge information,
distance information, etc., thus limiting the detection accuracy of the
algorithm for scene text. This paper proposes a plug-and-play module called the
Region Multiple Information Perception Module (RMIPM) to enhance the detection
performance of segmentation-based algorithms. Specifically, we design an
improved module that can perceive various types of information about scene text
regions, such as text foreground classification maps, distance maps, direction
maps, etc. Experiments on MSRA-TD500 and TotalText datasets show that our
method achieves comparable performance with current state-of-the-art
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in autonomously
completing tasks across real-world applications. Despite this, these LLM agents
introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments.
Instead of centering on LLM-generated content safety in most prior studies,
this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety
of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark
crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging safety risks given agent
interaction records. R-Judge comprises 162 agent interaction records,
encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 7 application categories and 10 risk
types. It incorporates human consensus on safety with annotated safety risk
labels and high-quality risk descriptions. Utilizing R-Judge, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of 8 prominent LLMs commonly employed as the backbone
for agents. The best-performing model, GPT-4, achieves 72.29% in contrast to
the human score of 89.38%, showing considerable room for enhancing the risk
awareness of LLMs. Notably, leveraging risk descriptions as environment
feedback significantly improves model performance, revealing the importance of
salient safety risk feedback. Furthermore, we design an effective chain of
safety analysis technique to help the judgment of safety risks and conduct an
in-depth case study to facilitate future research. R-Judge is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lordog/R-Judge.

<p class="mathjax">We posit that to achieve superhuman agents, future models require superhuman
feedback in order to provide an adequate training signal. Current approaches
commonly train reward models from human preferences, which may then be
bottlenecked by human performance level, and secondly these separate frozen
reward models cannot then learn to improve during LLM training. In this work,
we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is
used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training.
We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction
following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards
to itself. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of our approach yields a
model that outperforms many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard,
including Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 0613. While only a preliminary study,
this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually
improve in both axes.

<p class="mathjax">Cardiac digital twins are computational tools capturing key functional and
anatomical characteristics of patient hearts for investigating disease
phenotypes and predicting responses to therapy. When paired with large-scale
computational resources and large clinical datasets, digital twin technology
can enable virtual clinical trials on virtual cohorts to fast-track therapy
development. Here, we present an automated pipeline for personalising
ventricular anatomy and electrophysiological function based on routinely
acquired cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data and the standard 12-lead
electrocardiogram (ECG). Using CMR-based anatomical models, a sequential
Monte-Carlo approximate Bayesian computational inference method is extended to
infer electrical activation and repolarisation characteristics from the ECG.
Fast simulations are conducted with a reaction-Eikonal model, including the
Purkinje network and biophysically-detailed subcellular ionic current dynamics
for repolarisation. For each patient, parameter uncertainty is represented by
inferring a population of ventricular models rather than a single one, which
means that parameter uncertainty can be propagated to therapy evaluation.
Furthermore, we have developed techniques for translating from reaction-Eikonal
to monodomain simulations, which allows more realistic simulations of cardiac
electrophysiology. The pipeline is demonstrated in a healthy female subject,
where our inferred reaction-Eikonal models reproduced the patient's ECG with a
Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.93, and the translated monodomain
simulations have a correlation coefficient of 0.89. We then apply the effect of
Dofetilide to the monodomain population of models for this subject and show
dose-dependent QT and T-peak to T-end prolongations that are in keeping with
large population drug response data.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding how online media frame issues is crucial due to their impact on
public opinion. Research on framing using natural language processing
techniques mainly focuses on specific content features in messages and neglects
their narrative elements. Also, the distinction between framing in different
sources remains an understudied problem. We address those issues and
investigate how the framing of health-related topics, such as COVID-19 and
other diseases, differs between conspiracy and mainstream websites. We
incorporate narrative information into the framing analysis by introducing a
novel frame extraction approach based on semantic graphs. We find that
health-related narratives in conspiracy media are predominantly framed in terms
of beliefs, while mainstream media tend to present them in terms of science. We
hope our work offers new ways for a more nuanced frame analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs), built upon Transformer-based architectures with
massive pretraining on diverse data, have not only revolutionized natural
language processing but also extended their prowess to various domains, marking
a significant stride towards artificial general intelligence. The interplay
between LLMs and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives
and methodologies, reveals intriguing parallels, especially in their shared
optimization nature, black-box characteristics, and proficiency in handling
complex problems. Meanwhile, EA can not only provide an optimization framework
for LLM's further enhancement under black-box settings but also empower LLM
with flexible global search and iterative mechanism in applications. On the
other hand, LLM's abundant domain knowledge enables EA to perform smarter
searches, while its text processing capability assist in deploying EA across
various tasks. Based on their complementary advantages, this paper presents a
comprehensive review and forward-looking roadmap, categorizing their mutual
inspiration into LLM-enhanced evolutionary optimization and EA-enhanced LLM.
Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the
amalgamation of LLMs and EAs in various application scenarios, including neural
architecture search, code generation, software engineering, and text
generation. As the first comprehensive review specifically focused on the EA
research in the era of LLMs, this paper provides a foundational stepping stone
for understanding and harnessing the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs.
By presenting a comprehensive review, categorization, and critical analysis, we
contribute to the ongoing discourse on the cross-disciplinary study of these
two powerful paradigms. The identified challenges and future directions offer
guidance to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration.

<p class="mathjax">Security Operations Center (SoC) analysts gather threat reports from openly
accessible global threat databases and customize them manually to suit a
particular organization's needs. These analysts also depend on internal
repositories, which act as private local knowledge database for an
organization. Credible cyber intelligence, critical operational details, and
relevant organizational information are all stored in these local knowledge
databases. Analysts undertake a labor intensive task utilizing these global and
local knowledge databases to manually create organization's unique threat
response and mitigation strategies. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown the capability to efficiently process large diverse knowledge sources. We
leverage this ability to process global and local knowledge databases to
automate the generation of organization-specific threat intelligence.
<br />In this work, we present LOCALINTEL, a novel automated knowledge
contextualization system that, upon prompting, retrieves threat reports from
the global threat repositories and uses its local knowledge database to
contextualize them for a specific organization. LOCALINTEL comprises of three
key phases: global threat intelligence retrieval, local knowledge retrieval,
and contextualized completion generation. The former retrieves intelligence
from global threat repositories, while the second retrieves pertinent knowledge
from the local knowledge database. Finally, the fusion of these knowledge
sources is orchestrated through a generator to produce a contextualized
completion.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: In this paper, we present a novel approach to the automatic
evaluation of open surgery skills using depth cameras. This work is intended to
show that depth cameras achieve similar results to RGB cameras, which is the
common method in the automatic evaluation of open surgery skills. Moreover,
depth cameras offer advantages such as robustness to lighting variations,
camera positioning, simplified data compression, and enhanced privacy, making
them a promising alternative to RGB cameras.
<br />Methods: Experts and novice surgeons completed two simulators of open
suturing. We focused on hand and tool detection, and action segmentation in
suturing procedures. YOLOv8 was used for tool detection in RGB and depth
videos. Furthermore, UVAST and MSTCN++ were used for action segmentation. Our
study includes the collection and annotation of a dataset recorded with Azure
Kinect.
<br />Results: We demonstrated that using depth cameras in object detection and
action segmentation achieves comparable results to RGB cameras. Furthermore, we
analyzed 3D hand path length, revealing significant differences between experts
and novice surgeons, emphasizing the potential of depth cameras in capturing
surgical skills. We also investigated the influence of camera angles on
measurement accuracy, highlighting the advantages of 3D cameras in providing a
more accurate representation of hand movements.
<br />Conclusion: Our research contributes to advancing the field of surgical skill
assessment by leveraging depth cameras for more reliable and privacy
evaluations. The findings suggest that depth cameras can be valuable in
assessing surgical skills and provide a foundation for future research in this
area.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have
shown impressive performance in various visual recognition tasks. This
advancement paves the way for notable performance in Zero-Shot Egocentric
Action Recognition (ZS-EAR). Typically, VLMs handle ZS-EAR as a global
video-text matching task, which often leads to suboptimal alignment of vision
and linguistic knowledge. We propose a refined approach for ZS-EAR using VLMs,
emphasizing fine-grained concept-description alignment that capitalizes on the
rich semantic and contextual details in egocentric videos. In this paper, we
introduce GPT4Ego, a straightforward yet remarkably potent VLM framework for
ZS-EAR, designed to enhance the fine-grained alignment of concept and
description between vision and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
GPT4Ego significantly outperforms existing VLMs on three large-scale egocentric
video benchmarks, i.e., EPIC-KITCHENS-100 (33.2%, +9.4%), EGTEA (39.6%, +5.5%),
and CharadesEgo (31.5%, +2.6%).

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we champion the use of structured and semantic content
representation of discourse-based scholarly communication, inspired by tools
like Wikipedia infoboxes or structured Amazon product descriptions. These
representations provide users with a concise overview, aiding scientists in
navigating the dense academic landscape. Our novel automated approach leverages
the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce structured scholarly
contribution summaries, offering both a practical solution and insights into
LLMs' emergent abilities.
<br />For LLMs, the prime focus is on improving their general intelligence as
conversational agents. We argue that these models can also be applied
effectively in information extraction (IE), specifically in complex IE tasks
within terse domains like Science. This paradigm shift replaces the traditional
modular, pipelined machine learning approach with a simpler objective expressed
through instructions. Our results show that finetuned FLAN-T5 with 1000x fewer
parameters than the state-of-the-art GPT-davinci is competitive for the task.

<p class="mathjax">Scene text recognition, as a cross-modal task involving vision and text, is
an important research topic in computer vision. Most existing methods use
language models to extract semantic information for optimizing visual
recognition. However, the guidance of visual cues is ignored in the process of
semantic mining, which limits the performance of the algorithm in recognizing
irregular scene text. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel cross-modal
fusion network (CMFN) for irregular scene text recognition, which incorporates
visual cues into the semantic mining process. Specifically, CMFN consists of a
position self-enhanced encoder, a visual recognition branch and an iterative
semantic recognition branch. The position self-enhanced encoder provides
character sequence position encoding for both the visual recognition branch and
the iterative semantic recognition branch. The visual recognition branch
carries out visual recognition based on the visual features extracted by CNN
and the position encoding information provided by the position self-enhanced
encoder. The iterative semantic recognition branch, which consists of a
language recognition module and a cross-modal fusion gate, simulates the way
that human recognizes scene text and integrates cross-modal visual cues for
text recognition. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed CMFN algorithm
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art algorithms, indicating its
effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with nonvolatile resistive
memory has been developed for solving matrix problems in one step, e.g., matrix
inversion of solving linear systems. However, the analog nature sets up a
barrier to the scalability of AMC, due to the limits on the manufacturability
and yield of resistive memory arrays, non-idealities of device and circuit, and
cost of hardware implementations. Aiming to deliver a scalable AMC approach for
solving linear systems, this work presents BlockAMC, which partitions a large
original matrix into smaller ones on different memory arrays. A macro is
designed to perform matrix inversion and matrix-vector multiplication with the
block matrices, obtaining the partial solutions to recover the original
solution. The size of block matrices can be exponentially reduced by performing
multiple stages of divide-and-conquer, resulting in a two-stage solver design
that enhances the scalability of this approach. BlockAMC is also advantageous
in alleviating the accuracy issue of AMC, especially in the presence of device
and circuit non-idealities, such as conductance variations and interconnect
resistances. Compared to a single AMC circuit solving the same problem,
BlockAMC improves the area and energy efficiency by 48.83% and 40%,
respectively.

<p class="mathjax">We propose 'Deep spatial context' (DSCon) method, which serves for
investigation of the attention-based vision models using the concept of spatial
context. It was inspired by histopathologists, however, the method can be
applied to various domains. The DSCon allows for a quantitative measure of the
spatial context's role using three Spatial Context Measures: $SCM_{features}$,
$SCM_{targets}$, $SCM_{residuals}$ to distinguish whether the spatial context
is observable within the features of neighboring regions, their target values
(attention scores) or residuals, respectively. It is achieved by integrating
spatial regression into the pipeline. The DSCon helps to verify research
questions. The experiments reveal that spatial relationships are much bigger in
the case of the classification of tumor lesions than normal tissues. Moreover,
it turns out that the larger the size of the neighborhood taken into account
within spatial regression, the less valuable contextual information is.
Furthermore, it is observed that the spatial context measure is the largest
when considered within the feature space as opposed to the targets and
residuals.

<p class="mathjax">Antonyms vs synonyms distinction is a core challenge in lexico-semantic
analysis and automated lexical resource construction. These pairs share a
similar distributional context which makes it harder to distinguish them.
Leading research in this regard attempts to capture the properties of the
relation pairs, i.e., symmetry, transitivity, and trans-transitivity. However,
the inability of existing research to appropriately model the relation-specific
properties limits their end performance. In this paper, we propose InterlaCed
Encoder NETworks (i.e., ICE-NET) for antonym vs synonym distinction, that aim
to capture and model the relation-specific properties of the antonyms and
synonyms pairs in order to perform the classification task in a
performance-enhanced manner. Experimental evaluation using the benchmark
datasets shows that ICE-NET outperforms the existing research by a relative
score of upto 1.8% in F1-measure. We release the codes for ICE-NET at
https://github.com/asif6827/ICENET.

<p class="mathjax">While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, data
augmentation has emerged as a crucial strategy to mitigate overfitting and
enhance network performance. These techniques hold particular significance in
industrial manufacturing contexts. Recently, image mixing-based methods have
been introduced, exhibiting improved performance on public benchmark datasets.
However, their application to industrial tasks remains challenging. The
manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a
daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences. This leads
to severe data imbalance. Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not
straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling. Nonetheless,
this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity. For this reason, we
introduce ContextMix, a method tailored for industrial applications and
benchmark datasets. ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images
and integrating them into other images within the batch. This approach enables
our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized
images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using
occluded images. With the minimal additional computation cost of image
resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation
techniques. We evaluate its effectiveness across classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks using various network architectures on public benchmark
datasets. Our proposed method demonstrates improved results across a range of
robustness tasks. Its efficacy in real industrial environments is particularly
noteworthy, as demonstrated using the passive component dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Ensuring stability of discrete-time (DT) linear parameter-varying (LPV)
input-output (IO) models estimated via system identification methods is a
challenging problem as known stability constraints can only be numerically
verified, e.g., through solving Linear Matrix Inequalities. In this paper, an
unconstrained DT-LPV-IO parameterization is developed which gives a stable
model for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that
\textit{all} quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models can be generated by a
mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit
ball, i.e., a small-gain condition. The unit ball is then reparameterized
through a Cayley transformation, resulting in an unconstrained parameterization
of all quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models. As a special case, an
unconstrained parameterization of all stable DT linear time-invariant transfer
functions is obtained. Identification using the stable DT-LPV-IO model with
neural network coefficient functions is demonstrated on a simulation example of
a position-varying mass-damper-spring system.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have opened up new avenues for the field of image
generation, resulting in the proliferation of high-quality models shared on
open-source platforms. However, a major challenge persists in current
text-to-image systems are often unable to handle diverse inputs, or are limited
to single model results. Current unified attempts often fall into two
orthogonal aspects: i) parse Diverse Prompts in input stage; ii) activate
expert model to output. To combine the best of both worlds, we propose
DiffusionGPT, which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to offer a unified
generation system capable of seamlessly accommodating various types of prompts
and integrating domain-expert models. DiffusionGPT constructs domain-specific
Trees for various generative models based on prior knowledge. When provided
with an input, the LLM parses the prompt and employs the Trees-of-Thought to
guide the selection of an appropriate model, thereby relaxing input constraints
and ensuring exceptional performance across diverse domains. Moreover, we
introduce Advantage Databases, where the Tree-of-Thought is enriched with human
feedback, aligning the model selection process with human preferences. Through
extensive experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
DiffusionGPT, showcasing its potential for pushing the boundaries of image

<p class="mathjax">Reasoning is a fundamental component for achieving language understanding.
Among the multiple types of reasoning, conditional reasoning, the ability to
draw different conclusions depending on some condition, has been understudied
in large language models (LLMs). Recent prompting methods, such as chain of
thought, have significantly improved LLMs on reasoning tasks. Nevertheless,
there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in
LLMs. We hypothesize that code prompts can trigger conditional reasoning in
LLMs trained on text and code. We propose a chain of prompts that transforms a
natural language problem into code and prompts the LLM with the generated code.
Our experiments find that code prompts exhibit a performance boost between 2.6
and 7.7 points on GPT 3.5 across multiple datasets requiring conditional
reasoning. We then conduct experiments to discover how code prompts elicit
conditional reasoning abilities and through which features. We observe that
prompts need to contain natural language text accompanied by high-quality code
that closely represents the semantics of the instance text. Furthermore, we
show that code prompts are more efficient, requiring fewer demonstrations, and
that they trigger superior state tracking of variables or key entities.

<p class="mathjax">Heterogeneity in the cell population of cancer tissues poses many challenges
in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Studying the heterogeneity in cell
populations from gene expression measurement data in the context of cancer
research is a problem of paramount importance. In addition, reducing the
computation time of the algorithms that deal with high volumes of data has its
obvious merits. Parallelizable models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
are typically slow. This paper shows a novel, computationally efficient, and
parallelizable model to analyze heterogeneity in cancer tissues using GPUs.
Because our model is parallelizable, the input data size does not affect the
computation time much, provided the hardware resources are not exhausted. Our
model uses qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) gene expression
measurements to study heterogeneity in cancer tissue. We compute the cell
proportion breakup by accelerating variational methods on a GPU. We test this
model on synthetic and real-world gene expression data collected from
fibroblasts and compare the performance of our algorithm with those of MCMC and
Expectation Maximization. Our new model is computationally less complex and
faster than existing Bayesian models for cancer tissue heterogeneity.

<p class="mathjax">To protect privacy and meet legal regulations, federated learning (FL) has
gained significant attention for training speech-to-text (S2T) systems,
including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST).
However, the commonly used FL approach (i.e., \textsc{FedAvg}) in S2T tasks
typically suffers from extensive communication overhead due to multi-round
interactions based on the whole model and performance degradation caused by
data heterogeneity among clients.To address these issues, we propose a
personalized federated S2T framework that introduces \textsc{FedLoRA}, a
lightweight LoRA module for client-side tuning and interaction with the server
to minimize communication overhead, and \textsc{FedMem}, a global model
equipped with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier that captures
client-specific distributional shifts to achieve personalization and overcome
data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments based on Conformer and Whisper
backbone models on CoVoST and GigaSpeech benchmarks show that our approach
significantly reduces the communication overhead on all S2T tasks and
effectively personalizes the global model to overcome data heterogeneity.

<p class="mathjax">GPU architectures have become popular for executing general-purpose programs.
Their many-core architecture supports a large number of threads that run
concurrently to hide the latency among dependent instructions. In modern GPU
architectures, each SM/core is typically composed of several sub-cores, where
each sub-core has its own independent pipeline.
<br />Simulators are a key tool for investigating novel concepts in computer
architecture. They must be performance-accurate and have a proper model related
to the target hardware to explore the different bottlenecks properly.
<br />This paper presents a wide analysis of different parts of Accel-sim, a
popular GPGPU simulator, and some improvements of its model. First, we focus on
the front-end and developed a more realistic model. Then, we analyze the way
the result bus works and develop a more realistic one. Next, we describe the
current memory pipeline model and propose a model for a more cost-effective
design. Finally, we discuss other areas of improvement of the simulator.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel locally statistical variational active
contour model based on I-divergence-TV denoising model, which hybrides geodesic
active contour (GAC) model with active contours without edges (ACWE) model, and
can be used to segment images corrupted by multiplicative gamma noise. By
adding a diffusion term into the level set evolution (LSE) equation of the
proposed model, we construct a reaction-diffusion (RD) equation, which can
gradually regularize the level set function (LSF) to be piecewise constant in
each segment domain and gain the stable solution. We further transform the
proposed model into classic ROF model by adding a proximity term. Inspired by a
fast denoising algorithm proposed by Jia-Zhao recently, we propose two fast
fixed point algorithms to solve SAR image segmentation question. Experimental
results for real SAR images show that the proposed image segmentation model can
efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred edges, and can automatically
detect the exterior and interior boundaries of images with multiplicative gamma
noise. The proposed FPRD1/FPRD2 models are about 1/2 (or less than) of the time
required for the SBRD model based on the Split Bregman technique.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a control framework leveraging vision language models
(VLMs) for multiple tasks and robots. Notably, existing control methods using
VLMs have achieved high performance in various tasks and robots in the training
environment. However, these methods incur high costs for learning control
policies for tasks and robots other than those in the training environment.
Considering the application of industrial and household robots, learning in
novel environments where robots are introduced is challenging. To address this
issue, we propose a control framework that does not require learning control
policies. Our framework combines the vision-language CLIP model with a
randomized control. CLIP computes the similarity between images and texts by
embedding them in the feature space. This study employs CLIP to compute the
similarity between camera images and text representing the target state. In our
method, the robot is controlled by a randomized controller that simultaneously
explores and increases the similarity gradients. Moreover, we fine-tune the
CLIP to improve the performance of the proposed method. Consequently, we
confirm the effectiveness of our approach through a multitask simulation and a
real robot experiment using a two-wheeled robot and robot arm.

<p class="mathjax">This paper analyzes the stability of the class of Time-Accurate and
Highly-Stable Explicit Runge-Kutta (TASE-RK) methods, introduced in 2021 by
Bassenne et al. (J. Comput. Phys.) for the numerical solution of stiff Initial
Value Problems (IVPs). Such numerical methods are easy to implement and require
the solution of a limited number of linear systems per step, whose coefficient
matrices involve the exact Jacobian $J$ of the problem. To significantly reduce
the computational cost of TASE-RK methods without altering their consistency
properties, it is possible to replace $J$ with a matrix $A$ (not necessarily
tied to $J$) in their formulation, for instance fixed for a certain number of
consecutive steps or even constant. However, the stability properties of
TASE-RK methods strongly depend on this choice, and so far have been studied
assuming $A=J$.
<br />In this manuscript, we theoretically investigate the conditional and
unconditional stability of TASE-RK methods by considering arbitrary $A$. To
this end, we first split the Jacobian as $J=A+B$. Then, through the use of
stability diagrams and their connections with the field of values, we analyze
both the case in which $A$ and $B$ are simultaneously diagonalizable and not.
Numerical experiments, conducted on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
arising from applications, show the correctness and utility of the theoretical
results derived in the paper, as well as the good stability and efficiency of
TASE-RK methods when $A$ is suitably chosen.

<p class="mathjax">The most popular method for computing the matrix logarithm is a combination
of the inverse scaling and squaring method in conjunction with a Pad\'e
approximation, sometimes accompanied by the Schur decomposition. The main
computational effort lies in matrix-matrix multiplications and left matrix
division. In this work we illustrate that the number of such operations can be
substantially reduced, by using a graph based representation of an efficient
polynomial evaluation scheme. A technique to analyze the rounding error is
proposed, and backward error analysis is adapted. We provide substantial
simulations illustrating competitiveness both in terms of computation time and
rounding errors.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing
security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that
are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which
are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images
captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main
challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual
differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are
typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information.
Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the
visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the
variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can
potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval
across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the
security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation
attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes
perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby
disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between
modalities. We conducted experiments on two widely used cross-modality
datasets, namely RegDB and SYSU, which not only demonstrated the effectiveness
of our method but also provided insights for future enhancements in the
robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.

drop almost in half. In this paper, I replicate past adversarial research with
a new model, ELECTRA-Small, and demonstrate that the new model's F1 score drops
from 83.9% to 29.2%. To improve ELECTRA-Small's resistance to this attack, I
finetune the model on SQuAD v1.1 training examples with one to five adversarial
sentences appended to the context paragraph. Like past research, I find that
the finetuned model on one adversarial sentence does not generalize well across
evaluation datasets. However, when finetuned on four or five adversarial
sentences the model attains an F1 score of more than 70% on most evaluation
datasets with multiple appended and prepended adversarial sentences. The
results suggest that with enough examples we can make models robust to
adversarial attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Causal and counterfactual reasoning are emerging directions in data science
that allow us to reason about hypothetical scenarios. This is particularly
useful in domains where experimental data are usually not available. In the
context of environmental and ecological sciences, causality enables us, for
example, to predict how an ecosystem would respond to hypothetical
interventions. A structural causal model is a class of probabilistic graphical
models for causality, which, due to its intuitive nature, can be easily
understood by experts in multiple fields. However, certain queries, called
unidentifiable, cannot be calculated in an exact and precise manner. This paper
proposes applying a novel and recent technique for bounding unidentifiable
queries within the domain of socioecological systems. Our findings indicate
that traditional statistical analysis, including probabilistic graphical
models, can identify the influence between variables. However, such methods do
not offer insights into the nature of the relationship, specifically whether it
involves necessity or sufficiency. This is where counterfactual reasoning
becomes valuable.

<p class="mathjax">Scene Text Recognition (STR) is a challenging task that involves recognizing
text within images of natural scenes. Although current state-of-the-art models
for STR exhibit high performance, they typically suffer from low inference
efficiency due to their reliance on hybrid architectures comprised of visual
encoders and sequence decoders. In this work, we propose the VIsion Permutable
extractor for fast and efficient scene Text Recognition (VIPTR), which achieves
an impressive balance between high performance and rapid inference speeds in
the domain of STR. Specifically, VIPTR leverages a visual-semantic extractor
with a pyramid structure, characterized by multiple self-attention layers,
while eschewing the traditional sequence decoder. This design choice results in
a lightweight and efficient model capable of handling inputs of varying sizes.
Extensive experimental results on various standard datasets for both Chinese
and English scene text recognition validate the superiority of VIPTR. Notably,
the VIPTR-T (Tiny) variant delivers highly competitive accuracy on par with
other lightweight models and achieves SOTA inference speeds. Meanwhile, the
VIPTR-L (Large) variant attains greater recognition accuracy, while maintaining
a low parameter count and favorable inference speed. Our proposed method
provides a compelling solution for the STR challenge, which blends high
accuracy with efficiency and greatly benefits real-world applications requiring
fast and reliable text recognition. The code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Existing works show that augmenting training data of neural networks using
both clean and adversarial examples can enhance their generalizability under
adversarial attacks. However, this training approach often leads to performance
degradation on clean inputs. Additionally, it requires frequent re-training of
the entire model to account for new attack types, resulting in significant and
costly computations. Such limitations make adversarial training mechanisms less
practical, particularly for complex Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) with
millions or even billions of parameters. To overcome these challenges while
still harnessing the theoretical benefits of adversarial training, this study
combines two concepts: (1) adapters, which enable parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and (2) Mixup, which train NNs via convex combinations of pairs
data pairs. Intuitively, we propose to fine-tune PLMs through convex
combinations of non-data pairs of fine-tuned adapters, one trained with clean
and another trained with adversarial examples. Our experiments show that the
proposed method achieves the best trade-off between training efficiency and
predictive performance, both with and without attacks compared to other
baselines on a variety of downstream tasks.

lip movements are created convincingly using AI models to match altered or

(k-WL) hierarchy offer a theoretically well-understood expressive power.
However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance
on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global
attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong
performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the k-WL
hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on
positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive
performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the
downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
with multi-static sensing and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)
users. We propose a successive convex approximation-based power allocation
algorithm that maximizes energy efficiency while satisfying the sensing and
URLLC requirements. In addition, we provide a new definition for network
availability, which accounts for both sensing and URLLC requirements. The
impact of blocklength, sensing requirement, and required reliability as a
function of decoding error probability on network availability and energy
efficiency is investigated. The proposed power allocation algorithm is compared
to a communication-centric approach where only the URLLC requirement is
considered. It is shown that the URLLC-only approach is incapable of meeting
sensing requirements, while the proposed ISAC algorithm fulfills both sensing
and URLLC requirements, albeit with an associated increase in energy
consumption. This increment can be reduced up to 75% by utilizing additional
symbols for sensing. It is also demonstrated that larger blocklengths enhance
network availability and offer greater robustness against stringent reliability
requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Traffic prediction, a critical component for intelligent transportation
systems, endeavors to foresee future traffic at specific locations using
historical data. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize
developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not seen
improvements accordingly. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing
models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive
pre-training while maintaining their fundamental structures. In this paper, we
propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic
prediction. Specifically, ST-LLM redefines the timesteps at each location as
tokens and incorporates a spatial-temporal embedding module to learn the
spatial location and global temporal representations of tokens. Then these
representations are fused to provide each token with unified spatial and
temporal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel partially frozen
attention strategy of the LLM, which is designed to capture spatial-temporal
dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic
datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and
zero-shot prediction scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Adaptive finite element methods are a powerful tool to obtain numerical
simulation results in a reasonable time. Due to complex chemical and mechanical
couplings in lithium-ion batteries, numerical simulations are very helpful to
investigate promising new battery active materials such as amorphous silicon
featuring a higher energy density than graphite. Based on a thermodynamically
consistent continuum model with large deformation and chemo-mechanically
coupled approach, we compare three different spatial adaptive refinement
strategies: Kelly-, gradient recovery- and residual based error estimation. For
the residual based case, the strong formulation of the residual is explicitly
derived. With amorphous silicon as example material, we investigate two 3D
representative host particle geometries, reduced with symmetry assumptions to a
1D unit interval and a 2D elliptical domain. Our numerical studies show that
the Kelly estimator overestimates the error, whereas the gradient recovery
estimator leads to lower refinement levels and a good capture of the change of
the lithium flux. The residual based error estimator reveals a strong
dependency on the cell error part which can be improved by a more suitable
choice of constants to be more efficient. In a 2D domain, the concentration has
a larger influence on the mesh distribution than the Cauchy stress.

<p class="mathjax">Faced with over 100M open source projects most empirical investigations
select a subset. Most research papers in leading venues investigated filtering
projects by some measure of popularity with explicit or implicit arguments that
unpopular projects are not of interest, may not even represent "real" software
projects, or that less popular projects are not worthy of study. However, such
filtering may have enormous effects on the results of the studies if and
precisely because the sought-out response or prediction is in any way related
to the filtering criteria.
<br />We exemplify the impact of this practice on research outcomes: how filtering
of projects listed on GitHub affects the assessment of their popularity. We
randomly sample over 100,000 repositories and use multiple regression to model
the number of stars (a proxy for popularity) based on the number of commits,
the duration of the project, the number of authors, and the number of core
developers. Comparing control with the entire dataset with a filtered model
projects having ten or more authors we find that while certain characteristics
of the repository consistently predict popularity, the filtering process
significantly alters the relation ships between these characteristics and the
response. The number of commits exhibited a positive correlation with
popularity in the control sample but showed a negative correlation in the
filtered sample. These findings highlight the potential biases introduced by
data filtering and emphasize the need for careful sample selection in empirical
research of mining software repositories. We recommend that empirical work
should either analyze complete datasets such as World of Code, or employ
stratified random sampling from a complete dataset to ensure that filtering is
not biasing the results.

<p class="mathjax">The development of deep learning algorithms has extensively empowered
humanity's task automatization capacity. However, the huge improvement in the
performance of these models is highly correlated with their increasing level of
complexity, limiting their usefulness in human-oriented applications, which are
usually deployed in resource-constrained devices. This led to the development
of compression techniques that drastically reduce the computational and memory
costs of deep learning models without significant performance degradation. This
paper aims to systematize the current literature on this topic by presenting a
comprehensive survey of model compression techniques in biometrics
applications, namely quantization, knowledge distillation and pruning. We
conduct a critical analysis of the comparative value of these techniques,
focusing on their advantages and disadvantages and presenting suggestions for
future work directions that can potentially improve the current methods.
Additionally, we discuss and analyze the link between model bias and model
compression, highlighting the need to direct compression research toward model
fairness in future works.

<p class="mathjax">This paper is dedicated to the efficient numerical computation of solutions
to the 1D stationary Schr\"odinger equation in the highly oscillatory regime.
We compute an approximate solution based on the well-known WKB-ansatz, which
relies on an asymptotic expansion w.r.t. the small parameter $\varepsilon$.
Assuming that the coefficient in the equation is analytic, we derive an
explicit error estimate for the truncated WKB series, in terms of $\varepsilon$
and the truncation order $N$. For any fixed $\varepsilon$, this allows to
determine the optimal truncation order $N_{opt}$ which turns out to be
proportional to $\varepsilon^{-1}$. When chosen this way, the resulting error
of the optimally truncated WKB series behaves like
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\exp(-r/\varepsilon))$, with some parameter $r&gt;0$.
The theoretical results established in this paper are confirmed by several
numerical examples.

<p class="mathjax">Extracting structured representations from raw visual data is an important
and long-standing challenge in machine learning. Recently, techniques for
unsupervised learning of object-centric representations have raised growing
interest. In this context, enhancing the robustness of the latent features can
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training of downstream tasks. A
promising step in this direction is to disentangle the factors that cause
variation in the data. Previously, Invariant Slot Attention disentangled
position, scale, and orientation from the remaining features. Extending this
approach, we focus on separating the shape and texture components. In
particular, we propose a novel architecture that biases object-centric models
toward disentangling shape and texture components into two non-overlapping
subsets of the latent space dimensions. These subsets are known a priori, hence
before the training process. Experiments on a range of object-centric
benchmarks reveal that our approach achieves the desired disentanglement while
also numerically improving baseline performance in most cases. In addition, we
show that our method can generate novel textures for a specific object or
transfer textures between objects with distinct shapes.

<p class="mathjax">This paper demonstrates the potential for autonomous cyber defence to be
applied on industrial control systems and provides a baseline environment to
further explore Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning's (MARL) application to this
problem domain. It introduces a simulation environment, IPMSRL, of a generic
Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) and explores the use of MARL for
autonomous cyber defence decision-making on generic maritime based IPMS
Operational Technology (OT). OT cyber defensive actions are less mature than
they are for Enterprise IT. This is due to the relatively brittle nature of OT
infrastructure originating from the use of legacy systems, design-time
engineering assumptions, and lack of full-scale modern security controls. There
are many obstacles to be tackled across the cyber landscape due to continually
increasing cyber-attack sophistication and the limitations of traditional
IT-centric cyber defence solutions. Traditional IT controls are rarely deployed
on OT infrastructure, and where they are, some threats aren't fully addressed.
In our experiments, a shared critic implementation of Multi Agent Proximal
Policy Optimisation (MAPPO) outperformed Independent Proximal Policy
Optimisation (IPPO). MAPPO reached an optimal policy (episode outcome mean of
1) after 800K timesteps, whereas IPPO was only able to reach an episode outcome
mean of 0.966 after one million timesteps. Hyperparameter tuning greatly
improved training performance. Across one million timesteps the tuned
hyperparameters reached an optimal policy whereas the default hyperparameters
only managed to win sporadically, with most simulations resulting in a draw. We
tested a real-world constraint, attack detection alert success, and found that
when alert success probability is reduced to 0.75 or 0.9, the MARL defenders
were still able to win in over 97.5% or 99.5% of episodes, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Recent large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have demonstrated a powerful
generative ability to produce high-quality videos from detailed text
descriptions. However, exerting control over the motion of objects in videos
generated by any video diffusion model is a challenging problem. In this paper,
we propose a novel zero-shot moving object trajectory control framework,
Motion-Zero, to enable a bounding-box-trajectories-controlled text-to-video
diffusion model.To this end, an initial noise prior module is designed to
provide a position-based prior to improve the stability of the appearance of
the moving object and the accuracy of position. In addition, based on the
attention map of the U-net, spatial constraints are directly applied to the
denoising process of diffusion models, which further ensures the positional and
spatial consistency of moving objects during the inference. Furthermore,
temporal consistency is guaranteed with a proposed shift temporal attention
mechanism. Our method can be flexibly applied to various state-of-the-art video
diffusion models without any training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our proposed method can control the motion trajectories of objects
and generate high-quality videos.

<p class="mathjax">This article studies the problem of image segmentation-based semantic
communication in autonomous driving. In real traffic scenes, detecting the key
objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles) is more crucial than that
of other objects to guarantee driving safety. Therefore, we propose a vehicular
image segmentation-oriented semantic communication system, termed VIS-SemCom,
where image segmentation features of important objects are transmitted to
reduce transmission redundancy. First, to accurately extract image semantics,
we develop a semantic codec based on Swin Transformer architecture, which
expands the perceptual field thus improving the segmentation accuracy. Next, we
propose a multi-scale semantic extraction scheme via assigning the number of
Swin Transformer blocks for diverse resolution features, thus highlighting the
important objects' accuracy. Furthermore, the importance-aware loss is invoked
to emphasize the important objects, and an online hard sample mining (OHEM)
strategy is proposed to handle small sample issues in the dataset. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed VIS-SemCom can achieve a coding gain of
nearly 6 dB with a 60% mean intersection over union (mIoU), reduce the
transmitted data amount by up to 70% with a 60% mIoU, and improve the
segmentation intersection over union (IoU) of important objects by 4%, compared
to traditional transmission scheme.

<p class="mathjax">Real-time and accurate traffic flow prediction is the foundation for ensuring
the efficient operation of intelligent transportation systems.In existing
traffic flow prediction methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
pre-defined graphs were usually used to describe the spatial correlations of
different traffic nodes in urban road networks. However, the ability of
pre-defined graphs used to describe spatial correlation was limited by prior
knowledge and graph generation methods. Although time-varying graphs based on
data-driven learning can partially overcome the drawbacks of pre-defined
graphs, the learning ability of existing adaptive graphs was limited. For
example, time-varying graphs cannot adequately capture the inherent spatial
correlations in traffic flow data.In order to solve these problems, we have
proposed a hybrid time-varying graph neural network (HTVGNN) for traffic flow
prediction.

<p class="mathjax">Cooperative perception (CP) is a key technology to facilitate consistent and
accurate situational awareness for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To
tackle the network resource inefficiency issue in traditional broadcast-based
CP, unicast-based CP has been proposed to associate CAV pairs for cooperative
perception via vehicle-to-vehicle transmission. In this paper, we investigate
unicast-based CP among CAV pairs. With the consideration of dynamic perception
workloads and channel conditions due to vehicle mobility and dynamic radio
resource availability, we propose an adaptive cooperative perception scheme for
CAV pairs in a mixed-traffic autonomous driving scenario with both CAVs and
human-driven vehicles. We aim to determine when to switch between cooperative
perception and stand-alone perception for each CAV pair, and allocate
communication and computing resources to cooperative CAV pairs for maximizing
the computing efficiency gain under perception task delay requirements. A
model-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solution is developed,
which integrates MARL for an adaptive CAV cooperation decision and an
optimization model for communication and computing resource allocation.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in
achieving high computing efficiency gain, as compared with benchmark schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Beyond 5G and 6G networks are expected to support new and challenging use
cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service
(QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high
importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of
vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has
been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a
number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged.
Alternative solutions have been surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated
Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while
preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes
to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the
heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes
DISTINQT, a privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction.
Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and
model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This, enables the
incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will
enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS
prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by
encoding any raw input data into a non-linear latent representation before any
transmission. Evaluation results showcase that our framework achieves a
statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version and an
average performance improvement of up to 65% against six state-of-the-art
centralized baseline solutions in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) stand as
the two most popular foundation models for visual representation learning.
While CNNs exhibit remarkable scalability with linear complexity w.r.t. image
resolution, ViTs surpass them in fitting capabilities despite contending with
quadratic complexity. A closer inspection reveals that ViTs achieve superior
visual modeling performance through the incorporation of global receptive
fields and dynamic weights. This observation motivates us to propose a novel
architecture that inherits these components while enhancing computational
efficiency. To this end, we draw inspiration from the recently introduced state
space model and propose the Visual State Space Model (VMamba), which achieves
linear complexity without sacrificing global receptive fields. To address the
encountered direction-sensitive issue, we introduce the Cross-Scan Module (CSM)
to traverse the spatial domain and convert any non-causal visual image into
order patch sequences. Extensive experimental results substantiate that VMamba
not only demonstrates promising capabilities across various visual perception
tasks, but also exhibits more pronounced advantages over established benchmarks
as the image resolution increases. Source code has been available at
https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba.

<p class="mathjax">We present SHINOBI, an end-to-end framework for the reconstruction of shape,
material, and illumination from object images captured with varying lighting,
pose, and background. Inverse rendering of an object based on unconstrained
image collections is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics
and requires a joint optimization over shape, radiance, and pose. We show that
an implicit shape representation based on a multi-resolution hash encoding
enables faster and robust shape reconstruction with joint camera alignment
optimization that outperforms prior work. Further, to enable the editing of
illumination and object reflectance (i.e. material) we jointly optimize BRDF
and illumination together with the object's shape. Our method is class-agnostic
and works on in-the-wild image collections of objects to produce relightable 3D
assets for several use cases such as AR/VR, movies, games, etc. Project page:

<p class="mathjax">As machine learning becomes increasingly prevalent in impactful decisions,
recognizing when inference data is outside the model's expected input
distribution is paramount for giving context to predictions.
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have been created for this task.
Such methods can be split into representation-based or logit-based methods from
whether they respectively utilize the model's embeddings or predictions for OOD
detection. In contrast to most papers which solely focus on one such group, we
address both. We employ dimensionality reduction on feature embeddings in
representation-based methods for both time speedups and improved performance.
Additionally, we propose DICE-COL, a modification of the popular logit-based
method Directed Sparsification (DICE) that resolves an unnoticed flaw. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the OpenOODv1.5 benchmark
framework, where they significantly improve performance and set
state-of-the-art results.

weights. This underlies the potential for biologically inspired computational
models to further our understanding of vision processing systems and to improve
the efficacy of convolutional networks.

<p class="mathjax">Web search engines have long served as indispensable tools for information
retrieval; user behavior and query formulation strategies have been well
studied. The introduction of search engines powered by large language models
(LLMs) suggested more conversational search and new types of query strategies.
In this paper, we compare traditional and LLM-based search for the task of
image geolocation, i.e., determining the location where an image was captured.
Our work examines user interactions, with a particular focus on query
formulation strategies. In our study, 60 participants were assigned either
traditional or LLM-based search engines as assistants for geolocation.
Participants using traditional search more accurately predicted the location of
the image compared to those using the LLM-based search. Distinct strategies
emerged between users depending on the type of assistant. Participants using
the LLM-based search issued longer, more natural language queries, but had
shorter search sessions. When reformulating their search queries, traditional
search participants tended to add more terms to their initial queries, whereas
participants using the LLM-based search consistently rephrased their initial
queries.

<p class="mathjax">Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research
area, owing to its applications in smart environments, assisted living,
fitness, healthcare, etc. Recently, deep learning based end-to-end training has
resulted in state-of-the-art performance in domains such as computer vision and
natural language, where large amounts of annotated data are available. However,
large quantities of annotated data are not available for sensor-based HAR.
Moreover, the real-world settings on which the HAR is performed differ in terms
of sensor modalities, classification tasks, and target users. To address this
problem, transfer learning has been employed extensively. In this survey, we
focus on these transfer learning methods in the application domains of smart
home and wearables-based HAR. In particular, we provide a problem-solution
perspective by categorizing and presenting the works in terms of their
contributions and the challenges they address. We also present an updated view
of the state-of-the-art for both application domains. Based on our analysis of
205 papers, we highlight the gaps in the literature and provide a roadmap for
addressing them. This survey provides a reference to the HAR community, by
summarizing the existing works and providing a promising research agenda.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate to which extent open large language models (LLMs) can generate
coherent and relevant text from structured data. To prevent bias from
benchmarks leaked into LLM training data, we collect Quintd-1: an ad-hoc
benchmark for five data-to-text (D2T) generation tasks, consisting of
structured data records in standard formats gathered from public APIs. We
leverage reference-free evaluation metrics and LLMs' in-context learning
capabilities, allowing us to test the models with no human-written references.
Our evaluation focuses on annotating semantic accuracy errors on token-level,
combining human annotators and a metric based on GPT-4. Our systematic
examination of the models' behavior across domains and tasks suggests that
state-of-the-art open LLMs with 7B parameters can generate fluent and coherent
text from various standard data formats in zero-shot settings. However, we also
show that semantic accuracy of the outputs remains a major issue: on our
benchmark, 80% of outputs of open LLMs contain a semantic error according to
human annotators (91% according to GPT-4). Our code, data, and model outputs
are available at https://d2t-llm.github.io.

<p class="mathjax">Kronecker Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (Kron-Matmul) is the multiplication of
a matrix with the Kronecker Product of several smaller matrices. Kron-Matmul is
a core operation for many scientific and machine learning computations.
State-of-the-art Kron-Matmul implementations utilize existing tensor algebra
operations, such as matrix multiplication, transpose, and tensor matrix
multiplication. However, this design choice prevents several Kron-Matmul
specific optimizations, thus, leaving significant performance on the table. To
address this issue, we present FastKron, an efficient technique for Kron-Matmul
on single and multiple GPUs. FastKron is independent of linear algebra
operations enabling several new optimizations for Kron-Matmul. Thus, it
performs up to 40.7x and 7.85x faster than existing implementations on 1 and 16
GPUs respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-grained few-shot entity extraction in the chemical domain faces two
unique challenges. First, compared with entity extraction tasks in the general
domain, sentences from chemical papers usually contain more entities. Moreover,
entity extraction models usually have difficulty extracting entities of
long-tailed types. In this paper, we propose Chem-FINESE, a novel
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based few-shot entity extraction approach, to
address these two challenges. Our Chem-FINESE has two components: a seq2seq
entity extractor to extract named entities from the input sentence and a
seq2seq self-validation module to reconstruct the original input sentence from
extracted entities. Inspired by the fact that a good entity extraction system
needs to extract entities faithfully, our new self-validation module leverages
entity extraction results to reconstruct the original input sentence. Besides,
we design a new contrastive loss to reduce excessive copying during the
extraction process. Finally, we release ChemNER+, a new fine-grained chemical
entity extraction dataset that is annotated by domain experts with the ChemNER
schema. Experiments in few-shot settings with both ChemNER+ and CHEMET datasets
show that our newly proposed framework has contributed up to 8.26% and 6.84%
absolute F1-score gains respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Class-incremental learning is becoming more popular as it helps models widen
their applicability while not forgetting what they already know. A trend in
this area is to use a mixture-of-expert technique, where different models work
together to solve the task. However, the experts are usually trained all at
once using whole task data, which makes them all prone to forgetting and
increasing computational burden. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel approach named SEED. SEED selects only one, the most optimal expert for a
considered task, and uses data from this task to fine-tune only this expert.
For this purpose, each expert represents each class with a Gaussian
distribution, and the optimal expert is selected based on the similarity of
those distributions. Consequently, SEED increases diversity and heterogeneity
within the experts while maintaining the high stability of this ensemble
method. The extensive experiments demonstrate that SEED achieves
state-of-the-art performance in exemplar-free settings across various
scenarios, showing the potential of expert diversification through data in
continual learning.

<p class="mathjax">California has committed to ambitious decarbonization targets across multiple
sectors, including decarbonizing the electrical grid by 2045. In addition, the
medium- and heavy-duty truck fleets are expected to see rapid electrification
over the next two decades. Considering these two pathways in tandem is critical
for ensuring cost optimality and reliable power system operation. In
particular, we examine the potential cost savings of electrical generation
infrastructure by enabling flexible charging and bidirectional charging for
these trucks. We also examine costs adjacent to enabling these services, such
as charger upgrades and battery degradation. We deploy a large mixed-integer
decarbonization planning model to quantify the costs associated with the
electric generation decarbonization pathway. Example scenarios governing truck
driving and charging behaviors are implemented to reveal the sensitivity of
temporal driving patterns. Our experiments show that cost savings on the order
of multiple billions of dollars are possible by enabling flexible and
bidirectional charging in medium- and heavy-duty trucks in California.

<p class="mathjax">The problem of identifying the channel with the highest capacity among
several discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) is considered. The problem is cast
as a pure-exploration multi-armed bandit problem, which follows the practical
use of training sequences to sense the communication channel statistics. A
capacity estimator is proposed and tight confidence bounds on the estimator
error are derived. Based on this capacity estimator, a gap-elimination
algorithm termed BestChanID is proposed, which is oblivious to the
capacity-achieving input distribution and is guaranteed to output the DMC with
the largest capacity, with a desired confidence. Furthermore, two additional
algorithms NaiveChanSel and MedianChanEl, that output with certain confidence a
DMC with capacity close to the maximal, are introduced. Each of those
algorithms is beneficial in a different regime and can be used as a subroutine
in BestChanID. The sample complexity of all algorithms is analyzed as a
function of the desired confidence parameter, the number of channels, and the
channels' input and output alphabet sizes. The cost of best channel
identification is shown to scale quadratically with the alphabet size, and a
fundamental lower bound for the required number of channel senses to identify
the best channel with a certain confidence is derived.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses trust issues created from the ubiquity of black box
algorithms and surrogate explainers in Explainable Intrusion Detection Systems
(X-IDS). While Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to enhance
transparency, black box surrogate explainers, such as Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), are
difficult to trust. The black box nature of these surrogate explainers makes
the process behind explanation generation opaque and difficult to understand.
To avoid this problem, one can use transparent white box algorithms such as
Rule Extraction (RE). There are three types of RE algorithms: pedagogical,
decompositional, and eclectic. Pedagogical methods offer fast but untrustworthy
white-box explanations, while decompositional RE provides trustworthy
explanations with poor scalability. This work explores eclectic rule
extraction, which strikes a balance between scalability and trustworthiness. By
combining techniques from pedagogical and decompositional approaches, eclectic
rule extraction leverages the advantages of both, while mitigating some of
their drawbacks. The proposed Hybrid X-IDS architecture features eclectic RE as
a white box surrogate explainer for black box Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The
presented eclectic RE algorithm extracts human-readable rules from hidden
layers, facilitating explainable and trustworthy rulesets. Evaluations on
UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets demonstrate the algorithm's ability to
generate rulesets with 99.9% accuracy, mimicking DNN outputs. The contributions
of this work include the hybrid X-IDS architecture, the eclectic rule
extraction algorithm applicable to intrusion detection datasets, and a thorough
analysis of performance and explainability, demonstrating the trade-offs
involved in rule extraction speed and accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Developing generative models for interleaved image-text data has both
research and practical value. It requires models to understand the interleaved
sequences and subsequently generate images and text. However, existing attempts
are limited by the issue that the fixed number of visual tokens cannot
efficiently capture image details, which is particularly problematic in the
multi-image scenarios. To address this, this paper presents MM-Interleaved, an
end-to-end generative model for interleaved image-text data. It introduces a
multi-scale and multi-image feature synchronizer module, allowing direct access
to fine-grained image features in the previous context during the generation
process. MM-Interleaved is end-to-end pre-trained on both paired and
interleaved image-text corpora. It is further enhanced through a supervised
fine-tuning phase, wherein the model improves its ability to follow complex
multi-modal instructions. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of
MM-Interleaved in recognizing visual details following multi-modal instructions
and generating consistent images following both textual and visual conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Interval type-II Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) assumes a crucial role in
determining the coefficients of the PID controller, thereby augmenting the
controller's flexibility. Controlling chaotic systems presents inherent
challenges and difficulties due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and
the intricate dynamics that require precise and adaptive control strategies.
This paper offers an exhaustive exploration into the coordination and
regulation of a chaotic spur gear system, employing a Type-II Fuzzy Controller.
The initial control parameters of the PID controller undergo optimization using
the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to increase the overall system
performance. The adaptability and strength of the suggested control system are
tested in various scenarios, covering diverse reference inputs and
uncertainties. The investigation comprehensively assesses the operational
efficacy of the formulated controller, contrasting its performance with other
methodologies. The outcomes highlight the impressive efficiency of the
suggested strategy, confirming its supremacy in attaining synchronization and
control within the turbulent spur gear system under demanding circumstances

<p class="mathjax">Predicting the strategy (sequence of concepts) that a student is likely to
use in problem-solving helps Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs) better adapt
themselves to different types of learners based on their learning abilities.
This can lead to a more dynamic, engaging, and personalized experience for
students. To scale up training a prediction model (such as LSTMs) over
large-scale education datasets, we develop a non-parametric approach to cluster
symmetric instances in the data. Specifically, we learn a representation based
on Node2Vec that encodes symmetries over mastery or skill level since, to solve
a problem, it is natural that a student's strategy is likely to involve
concepts in which they have gained mastery. Using this representation, we use
DP-Means to group symmetric instances through a coarse-to-fine refinement of
the clusters. We apply our model to learn strategies for Math learning from
large-scale datasets from MATHia, a leading AIS for middle-school math
learning. Our results illustrate that our approach can consistently achieve
high accuracy using a small sample that is representative of the full dataset.
Further, we show that this approach helps us learn strategies with high
accuracy for students at different skill levels, i.e., leveraging symmetries
improves fairness in the prediction model.

<p class="mathjax">Changes and advances in information technology have played an important role
in the development of intelligent vehicle systems in recent years. Driver
fatigue and distracted driving are important factors in traffic accidents.
Thus, onboard monitoring of driving behavior has become a crucial component of
advanced driver assistance systems for intelligent vehicles. In this article,
we present techniques for simultaneously detecting fatigue and distracted
driving behaviors using vision-based and machine learning-based approaches. In
driving fatigue detection, we use facial alignment networks to identify facial
feature points in the images, and calculate the distance of the facial feature
points to detect the opening and closing of the eyes and mouth. Furthermore, we
use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the MobileNet architecture to
identify various distracted driving behaviors. Experiments are performed on a
PC based setup with a webcam and results are demonstrated using public datasets
as well as custom datasets created for training and testing. Compared to
previous approaches, we build our own datasets and provide better results in
terms of accuracy and computation time.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic Communication (SemCom) systems, empowered by deep learning (DL),
represent a paradigm shift in data transmission. These systems prioritize the
significance of content over sheer data volume. However, existing SemCom
designs face challenges when applied to diverse computational capabilities and
network conditions, particularly in time-sensitive applications. A key
challenge is the assumption that diverse devices can uniformly benefit from a
standard, large DL model in SemCom systems. This assumption becomes
increasingly impractical, especially in high-speed, high-reliability
applications such as industrial automation or critical healthcare. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel SemCom framework tailored for heterogeneous,
resource-constrained edge devices and computation-intensive servers. Our
approach employs dynamic knowledge distillation (KD) to customize semantic
models for each device, balancing computational and communication constraints
while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). We formulate an optimization problem
and develop an adaptive algorithm that iteratively refines semantic knowledge
on edge devices, resulting in better models tailored to their resource
profiles. This algorithm strategically adjusts the granularity of distilled
knowledge, enabling devices to maintain high semantic accuracy for precise
inference tasks, even under unstable network conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces model complexity for edge
devices, leading to better semantic extraction and achieving the desired QoS.

<p class="mathjax">Head avatar reconstruction, crucial for applications in virtual reality,
online meetings, gaming, and film industries, has garnered substantial
attention within the computer vision community. The fundamental objective of
this field is to faithfully recreate the head avatar and precisely control
expressions and postures. Existing methods, categorized into 2D-based warping,
mesh-based, and neural rendering approaches, present challenges in maintaining
multi-view consistency, incorporating non-facial information, and generalizing
to new identities. In this paper, we propose a framework named GPAvatar that
reconstructs 3D head avatars from one or several images in a single forward
pass. The key idea of this work is to introduce a dynamic point-based
expression field driven by a point cloud to precisely and effectively capture
expressions. Furthermore, we use a Multi Tri-planes Attention (MTA) fusion
module in the tri-planes canonical field to leverage information from multiple
input images. The proposed method achieves faithful identity reconstruction,
precise expression control, and multi-view consistency, demonstrating promising
results for free-viewpoint rendering and novel view synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important
role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this
equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible
representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such
operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this
work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the
computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the
commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are
integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients,
the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between
spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective
further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from
spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication
between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be
efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms.
This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps
from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of
irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which
serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across
different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and
3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved
performance of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">The many variations of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), where a neural
network is trained as a continuous representation of a signal, have tremendous
practical utility for downstream tasks including novel view synthesis, video
compression, and image superresolution. Unfortunately, the inner workings of
these networks are seriously under-studied. Our work, eXplaining the Implicit
Neural Canvas (XINC), is a unified framework for explaining properties of INRs
by examining the strength of each neuron's contribution to each output pixel.
We call the aggregate of these contribution maps the Implicit Neural Canvas and
we use this concept to demonstrate that the INRs which we study learn to
''see'' the frames they represent in surprising ways. For example, INRs tend to
have highly distributed representations. While lacking high-level object
semantics, they have a significant bias for color and edges, and are almost
entirely space-agnostic. We arrive at our conclusions by examining how objects
are represented across time in video INRs, using clustering to visualize
similar neurons across layers and architectures, and show that this is
dominated by motion. These insights demonstrate the general usefulness of our
analysis framework. Our project page is available at

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, image editing has advanced remarkably. With increased human
control, it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from
specifying in text what we want to change, to straight up dragging the contents
of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However, most of the focus
has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can
simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the
goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process, this paper
presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as
the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g., make
the face frontal), our method can automatically transfer that edit to other
test images, so that regardless of their initial state (pose), they all arrive
at the same final state (e.g., all facing front). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that edits performed using our method have similar visual quality
to existing single-image-editing methods, while having more visual consistency
and saving significant time and human effort.

<p class="mathjax">Foundation models encode rich representations that can be adapted to a
desired task by fine-tuning on task-specific data. However, fine-tuning a model
on one particular data distribution often compromises the model's original
performance on other distributions. Current methods for robust fine-tuning
utilize hand-crafted regularization techniques to constrain the fine-tuning
process towards the base foundation model. Yet, it is hard to precisely specify
what characteristics of the foundation model to retain during fine-tuning, as
this depends on how the pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation data
distributions relate to each other. We propose AutoFT, a data-driven approach
for guiding foundation model fine-tuning. AutoFT optimizes fine-tuning
hyperparameters to maximize performance on a small out-of-distribution (OOD)
validation set. To guide fine-tuning in a granular way, AutoFT searches a
highly expressive hyperparameter space that includes weight coefficients for
many different losses, in addition to learning rate and weight decay values. We
evaluate AutoFT on nine natural distribution shifts which include domain shifts
and subpopulation shifts. Our experiments show that AutoFT significantly
improves generalization to new OOD data, outperforming existing robust
fine-tuning methods. Notably, AutoFT achieves new state-of-the-art performance
on the WILDS-iWildCam and WILDS-FMoW benchmarks, outperforming the previous
best methods by $6.0\%$ and $1.5\%$, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Image-text training like CLIP has dominated the pretraining of vision
foundation models in recent years. Subsequent efforts have been made to
introduce region-level visual learning into CLIP's pretraining but face
scalability challenges due to the lack of large-scale region-level datasets.
Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in natural language
processing such as instruction tuning, we explore the potential of fine-grained
SFT in enhancing the generation of vision foundation models after their
pretraining. Thus a two-stage method ViSFT (Vision SFT) is proposed to unleash
the fine-grained knowledge of vision foundation models. In ViSFT, the vision
foundation model is enhanced by performing visual joint learning on some
in-domain tasks and then tested on out-of-domain benchmarks. With updating
using ViSFT on 8 V100 GPUs in less than 2 days, a vision transformer with over
4.4B parameters shows improvements across various out-of-domain benchmarks
including vision and vision-linguistic scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">In the past few decades, Japanese comics, commonly referred to as Manga, have
transcended both cultural and linguistic boundaries to become a true worldwide
sensation. Yet, the inherent reliance on visual cues and illustration within
manga renders it largely inaccessible to individuals with visual impairments.
In this work, we seek to address this substantial barrier, with the aim of
ensuring that manga can be appreciated and actively engaged by everyone.
Specifically, we tackle the problem of diarisation i.e. generating a
transcription of who said what and when, in a fully automatic way.
<br />To this end, we make the following contributions: (1) we present a unified
model, Magi, that is able to (a) detect panels, text boxes and character boxes,
(b) cluster characters by identity (without knowing the number of clusters
apriori), and (c) associate dialogues to their speakers; (2) we propose a novel
approach that is able to sort the detected text boxes in their reading order
and generate a dialogue transcript; (3) we annotate an evaluation benchmark for
this task using publicly available [English] manga pages. The code, evaluation
datasets and the pre-trained model can be found at:

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a family of conversational question
answering (QA) models, that obtain GPT-4 level accuracies. Specifically, we
propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that can significantly improve
the zero-shot conversational QA results from large language models (LLMs). To
handle retrieval in conversational QA, we fine-tune a dense retriever on a
multi-turn QA dataset, which provides comparable results to using the
state-of-the-art query rewriting model while largely reducing deployment cost.
Notably, our ChatQA-70B can outperform GPT-4 in terms of average score on 10
conversational QA datasets (54.14 vs. 53.90), without relying on any synthetic
data from OpenAI GPT models.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a new task -- language-driven video inpainting, which uses
natural language instructions to guide the inpainting process. This approach
overcomes the limitations of traditional video inpainting methods that depend
on manually labeled binary masks, a process often tedious and labor-intensive.
We present the Remove Objects from Videos by Instructions (ROVI) dataset,
containing 5,650 videos and 9,091 inpainting results, to support training and
evaluation for this task. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
language-driven video inpainting framework, the first end-to-end baseline for
this task, integrating Multimodal Large Language Models to understand and
execute complex language-based inpainting requests effectively. Our
comprehensive results showcase the dataset's versatility and the model's
effectiveness in various language-instructed inpainting scenarios. We will make
datasets, code, and models publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Panoptic and instance segmentation networks are often trained with
specialized object detection modules, complex loss functions, and ad-hoc
post-processing steps to handle the permutation-invariance of the instance
masks. This work builds upon Stable Diffusion and proposes a latent diffusion
approach for panoptic segmentation, resulting in a simple architecture which
omits these complexities. Our training process consists of two steps: (1)
training a shallow autoencoder to project the segmentation masks to latent
space; (2) training a diffusion model to allow image-conditioned sampling in
latent space. The use of a generative model unlocks the exploration of mask
completion or inpainting, which has applications in interactive segmentation.
The experimental validation yields promising results for both panoptic
segmentation and mask inpainting. While not setting a new state-of-the-art, our
model's simplicity, generality, and mask completion capability are desirable
properties.

<p class="mathjax">Advanced by transformer architecture, vision foundation models (VFMs) achieve
remarkable progress in performance and generalization ability. Segment Anything
Model (SAM) is one remarkable model that can achieve generalized segmentation.
However, most VFMs cannot run in realtime, which makes it difficult to transfer
them into several products. On the other hand, current real-time segmentation
mainly has one purpose, such as semantic segmentation on the driving scene. We
argue that diverse outputs are needed for real applications. Thus, this work
explores a new real-time segmentation setting, named all-purpose segmentation
in real-time, to transfer VFMs in real-time deployment. It contains three
different tasks, including interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and
video segmentation. We aim to use one model to achieve the above tasks in
real-time. We first benchmark several strong baselines. Then, we present
Real-Time All Purpose SAM (RAP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an
efficient decoupled decoder to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we
further explore different training strategies and tuning methods to boost
co-training performance further. Our code and model are available at
https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM/.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we address various segmentation tasks, each traditionally
tackled by distinct or partially unified models. We propose OMG-Seg, One Model
that is Good enough to efficiently and effectively handle all the segmentation
tasks, including image semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, as well
as their video counterparts, open vocabulary settings, prompt-driven,
interactive segmentation like SAM, and video object segmentation. To our
knowledge, this is the first model to handle all these tasks in one model and
achieve satisfactory performance. We show that OMG-Seg, a transformer-based
encoder-decoder architecture with task-specific queries and outputs, can
support over ten distinct segmentation tasks and yet significantly reduce
computational and parameter overhead across various tasks and datasets. We
rigorously evaluate the inter-task influences and correlations during
co-training. Code and models are available at https://github.com/lxtGH/OMG-Seg.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel approach that combines tactile estimation and control
for in-hand object manipulation. By integrating measurements from robot
kinematics and an image-based tactile sensor, our framework estimates and
tracks object pose while simultaneously generating motion plans to control the
pose of a grasped object. This approach consists of a discrete pose estimator
that uses the Viterbi decoding algorithm to find the most likely sequence of
object poses in a coarsely discretized grid, and a continuous pose
estimator-controller to refine the pose estimate and accurately manipulate the
pose of the grasped object. Our method is tested on diverse objects and
configurations, achieving desired manipulation objectives and outperforming
single-shot methods in estimation accuracy. The proposed approach holds
potential for tasks requiring precise manipulation in scenarios where visual
perception is limited, laying the foundation for closed-loop behavior
applications such as assembly and tool use. Please see supplementary videos for
real-world demonstration at https://sites.google.com/view/texterity.

<p class="mathjax">To enable machines to learn how humans interact with the physical world in
our daily activities, it is crucial to provide rich data that encompasses the
3D motion of humans as well as the motion of objects in a learnable 3D
representation. Ideally, this data should be collected in a natural setup,
capturing the authentic dynamic 3D signals during human-object interactions. To
address this challenge, we introduce the ParaHome system, designed to capture
and parameterize dynamic 3D movements of humans and objects within a common
home environment. Our system consists of a multi-view setup with 70
synchronized RGB cameras, as well as wearable motion capture devices equipped
with an IMU-based body suit and hand motion capture gloves. By leveraging the
ParaHome system, we collect a novel large-scale dataset of human-object
interaction. Notably, our dataset offers key advancement over existing datasets
in three main aspects: (1) capturing 3D body and dexterous hand manipulation
motion alongside 3D object movement within a contextual home environment during
natural activities; (2) encompassing human interaction with multiple objects in
various episodic scenarios with corresponding descriptions in texts; (3)
including articulated objects with multiple parts expressed with parameterized
articulations. Building upon our dataset, we introduce new research tasks aimed
at building a generative model for learning and synthesizing human-object
interactions in a real-world room setting.

<p class="mathjax">Intending to introduce a method for the topological analysis of fields, we
present a pipeline that takes as an input a weighted and based chain complex,
produces a tame epimorphic parametrized chain complex, and encodes it as a
barcode of tagged intervals. We show how to apply this pipeline to the weighted
and based chain complex of a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on a
compact Riemannian manifold in both the smooth and discrete settings.
Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between
tame epimorphic parametrized chain complexes endowed with the interleaving
distance and barcodes of tagged intervals endowed with the bottleneck distance.
Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough
gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous.
Finally, we prove that the barcode of any such vector field can be approximated
by the barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.

<p class="mathjax">Precipitation prediction plays a crucial role in modern agriculture and
industry. However, it poses significant challenges due to the diverse patterns
and dynamics in time and space, as well as the scarcity of high precipitation
events.
<br />To address this challenge, we propose an ensemble learning framework that
leverages multiple learners to capture the diverse patterns of precipitation
distribution. Specifically, the framework consists of a precipitation predictor
with multiple lightweight heads (learners) and a controller that combines the
outputs from these heads. The learners and the controller are separately
optimized with a proposed 3-stage training scheme.
<br />By utilizing provided satellite images, the proposed approach can effectively
model the intricate rainfall patterns, especially for high precipitation
events. It achieved 1st place on the core test as well as the nowcasting
leaderboards of the Weather4Cast 2023 competition. For detailed implementation,

<p class="mathjax">Spectral imaging enables the analysis of optical material properties that are
invisible to the human eye. Different spectral capturing setups, e.g., based on
filter-wheel, push-broom, line-scanning, or mosaic cameras, have been
introduced in the last years to support a wide range of applications in
agriculture, medicine, and industrial surveillance. However, these systems
often suffer from different disadvantages, such as lack of real-time
capability, limited spectral coverage or low spatial resolution. To address
these drawbacks, we present a novel approach combining two calibrated
multispectral real-time capable snapshot cameras, covering different spectral
ranges, into a stereo-system. Therefore, a hyperspectral data-cube can be
continuously captured. The combined use of different multispectral snapshot
cameras enables both 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis. Both captured
images are demosaicked avoiding spatial resolution loss. We fuse the spectral
data from one camera into the other to receive a spatially and spectrally high
resolution video stream. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach and the system is investigated with regard to its applicability for
surgical assistance monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">A smoothing algorithm is presented for solving the soft-margin Support Vector
Machine (SVM) optimization problem with an $\ell^{1}$ penalty. This algorithm
is designed to require a modest number of passes over the data, which is an
important measure of its cost for very large datasets. The algorithm uses
smoothing for the hinge-loss function, and an active set approach for the
$\ell^{1}$ penalty. The smoothing parameter $\alpha$ is initially large, but
typically halved when the smoothed problem is solved to sufficient accuracy.
Convergence theory is presented that shows
$\mathcal{O}(1+\log(1+\log_+(1/\alpha)))$ guarded Newton steps for each value
of $\alpha$ except for asymptotic bands $\alpha=\Theta(1)$ and
$\alpha=\Theta(1/N)$, with only one Newton step provided $\eta\alpha\gg1/N$,
where $N$ is the number of data points and the stopping criterion that the
predicted reduction is less than $\eta\alpha$. The experimental results show
that our algorithm is capable of strong test accuracy without sacrificing
training speed.

<p class="mathjax">The task of inferring three-dimensional molecular configurations from their
two-dimensional graph representations is of critical significance in the
domains of computational chemistry and the development of pharmaceuticals. It
contributes fundamentally to our grasp of molecular mechanisms and
interactions. The rapid evolution of machine learning, especially in the realm
of deep generative networks, has catalyzed breakthroughs in the precision of
such predictive modeling. Traditional methodologies typically employ a
bifurcated strategy: initially estimating interatomic distances followed by
sculpting the spatial molecular structure via solving a distance geometry
problem. This sequential approach, however, occasionally fails to capture the
intricacies of local atomic arrangements accurately, thus compromising the
integrity of the resultant structural models. Addressing these deficiencies,
this work introduces an avant-garde generative framework: \method{}, which is
predicated on the diffusion principles found in classical non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. \method{} envisages atoms as discrete entities and is adept at
guiding the reversal of diffusion morphing a distribution of stochastic noise
back into coherent molecular forms through a process akin to a Markov chain.
This transformation begins with the initial representation of a molecular graph
in an abstract latent space, progressing to the realization of the
three-dimensional forms via an elaborate bilevel optimization scheme, tailored
to respect the task's specific requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Acquired images for medical and other purposes can be affected by noise from
both the equipment used in the capturing or the environment. This can have
adverse effect on the information therein. Thus, the need to restore the image
to its original state by removing the noise. To effectively remove such noise,
pre knowledge of the type of noise model present is necessary. This work
explores different noise removal filters by first introducing noise to an image
and then applying different spatial domain filtering techniques to the image to
get rid of the noise. Different evaluation techniques such as Peak to Signal
Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) were adopted to determine
how effective each filter is on a given image noise. Result showed that some
filters are more effective on some noise models than others.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this thesis is to gain new insights into the drift phenomenon and
identify strategies to mitigate it. An extensive experimental characterization
of PCM devices and in particular drift forms the foundation of each chapter.
With respect to time-scales, ambient temperature, device dimensions, and
combinations thereof, drift is studied under unprecedented conditions. In three
studies, different aspects of drift are examined.
<br />(1) The origin of structural relaxation: Drift measurements over 9 orders of
magnitude in time reveal the onset of relaxation in a melt-quenched state. The
data is used to appraise two models, the Gibbs relaxation model and the
collective relaxation model. Additionally, a refined version of the collective
relaxation model is introduced and the consequences of a limited number of
structural defects are discussed.
<br />(2) Exploiting nanoscale effects in phase change memories: Scaling devices to
ever-smaller dimensions is incentivized by the requirement to achieve higher
storage densities and less power consumption. Eventually, confinement and
interfacial effects will govern the device characteristics. Anticipating these
consequences, the feasibility to use a single element, Antimony, is assessed
for the first time. The power efficiency, stability against crystallization,
and drift are characterized under different degrees of confinement.
<br />(3) State-dependent drift in a projected memory cell: New device concepts are
aiming to reduce drift by decoupling the cell resistance from the electronic
properties of the amorphous phase. A shunt resistor scaling with the amount of
amorphous material is added. Simulations and the drift characteristics of a
projected device put the idealized concept to the test. The contact resistance
between the phase change material and the shunt resistor is identified as a
decisive parameter to achieve the desired device properties.

<p class="mathjax">Climate change is one of the most critical challenges that our planet is
facing today. Rising global temperatures are already bringing noticeable
changes to Earth's weather and climate patterns with an increased frequency of
unpredictable and extreme weather events. Future projections for climate change
research are based on Earth System Models (ESMs), the computer models that
simulate the Earth's climate system. ESMs provide a framework to integrate
various physical systems, but their output is bound by the enormous
computational resources required for running and archiving higher-resolution
simulations. For a given resource budget, the ESMs are generally run on a
coarser grid, followed by a computationally lighter $downscaling$ process to
obtain a finer-resolution output. In this work, we present a deep-learning
model for downscaling ESM simulation data that does not require high-resolution
ground truth data for model optimization. This is realized by leveraging
salient data distribution patterns and the hidden dependencies between weather
variables for an $\textit{individual}$ data point at $\textit{runtime}$.
Extensive evaluation with $2$x, $3$x, and $4$x scaling factors demonstrates
that the proposed model consistently obtains superior performance over that of
various baselines. The improved downscaling performance and no dependence on
high-resolution ground truth data make the proposed method a valuable tool for
climate research and mark it as a promising direction for future research.

predict MGMT biomarker status in glioblastoma through binary classification on
Multi parameter mpMRI scans: T1w, T1wCE, T2w and FLAIR. The dataset is splitted
into three main cohorts: training set, validation set which were used during
training, and the testing were only used during final evaluation. Images were
either in a DICOM format or in Png format. different architectures were used to
investigate the problem including the 3D version of Vision Transformer (ViT3D),
ResNet50, Xception and EfficientNet-B3. AUC was used as the main evaluation
metric and the results showed an advantage for both the ViT3D and the Xception
models achieving 0.6015 and 0.61745 respectively on the testing set. compared
to other results, our results proved to be valid given the complexity of the
task. further improvements can be made through exploring different strategies,
different architectures and more diverse datasets.

<p class="mathjax">The intricate relationship between genetic variation and human diseases has
been a focal point of medical research, evidenced by the identification of risk
genes regarding specific diseases. The advent of advanced genome sequencing
techniques has significantly improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
detecting these genetic markers, playing a crucial role in disease diagnosis
and forming the basis for clinical decision-making and early risk assessment.
To overcome the limitations of existing databases that record disease-gene
associations from existing literature, which often lack real-time updates, we
propose a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for the
discovery of diseases associated with specific genes. This framework aims to
automate the labor-intensive process of sifting through medical literature for
evidence linking genetic variations to diseases, thereby enhancing the
efficiency of disease identification. Our approach involves using LLMs to
conduct literature searches, summarize relevant findings, and pinpoint diseases
related to specific genes. This paper details the development and application
of our LLM-powered framework, demonstrating its potential in streamlining the
complex process of literature retrieval and summarization to identify diseases
associated with specific genetic variations.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification,
but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for
studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear
Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between
radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting
VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when
radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the
extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from
inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to
intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We
find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the
intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can
discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric
or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of
processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional
dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a
higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We
demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by
constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing
using a nonlinear map, namely logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric
series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, R\"ossler, and
Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for
nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the
presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the
logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values.
The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this
method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous
dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing.
Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems
suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to
predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately
anticipates the time series for the future (self prediction).

implementable in currently available quantum cryptographic devices is proposed
and demonstrated. The protocol design involves a verifier and a prover knowing
a pre-shared secret, and the acceptance or rejection of the proof is determined
by the quantum bit error rate. It has been implemented in modified Quantum Key
Distribution devices executing two fundamental cases. In the first case, all
players are honest, while in the second case, one of the users is a malicious
player. We demonstrate an increase of the quantum bit error rate around 25% in
the latter case compared to the case of honesty. The protocol has also been

verifier and prover. The security and robustness of the protocol has been

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces a framework to address the computational complexity
inherent in Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) models by harnessing the potential
of deep learning. We compare the effectiveness of (a) feed-forward neural
networks (ANN) and (b) convolutional neural networks (CNN) in approximating the
active dimensions within MIP problems. We utilize multi-label classification to
account for more than one active dimension. To enhance the framework's
performance, we employ Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, aiming
to maximize sample-level accuracy. The primary objective is to train the neural
networks to predict all active dimensions accurately, thereby maximizing the
occurrence of global optimum solutions. We apply this framework to a flow-based
facility location allocation Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
formulation that describes long-term investment planning and medium-term

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the search for idempotent cellular automata (CA), we study CA
that act almost as the identity unless they read a fixed pattern $p$. We show
that constant and symmetrical patterns always produce idempotent CA, and we
characterize the quasi-constant patterns that produce idempotent CA. Our
results are valid for CA over an arbitrary group $G$. Moreover, we study the
semigroup theoretic natural partial order defined on idempotent CA. If $G$ is
infinite, we prove that there is an infinite independent set of idempotent CA,
and if $G$ has an element of infinite order, we prove that there is an infinite

<p class="mathjax">The progress in generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), opened new possibilities for image generation but raised
concerns about potential malicious uses, especially in sensitive areas like
medical imaging. This study introduces MITS-GAN, a novel approach to prevent
tampering in medical images, with a specific focus on CT scans. The approach
disrupts the output of the attacker's CT-GAN architecture by introducing
imperceptible but yet precise perturbations. Specifically, the proposed
approach involves the introduction of appropriate Gaussian noise to the input
as a protective measure against various attacks. Our method aims to enhance
tamper resistance, comparing favorably to existing techniques. Experimental
results on a CT scan dataset demonstrate MITS-GAN's superior performance,
emphasizing its ability to generate tamper-resistant images with negligible
artifacts. As image tampering in medical domains poses life-threatening risks,
our proactive approach contributes to the responsible and ethical use of
generative models. This work provides a foundation for future research in
countering cyber threats in medical imaging. Models and codes are publicly

<p class="mathjax">Intervertebral disc disease, a prevalent ailment, frequently leads to
intermittent or persistent low back pain, and diagnosing and assessing of this
disease rely on accurate measurement of vertebral bone and intervertebral disc
geometries from lumbar MR images. Deep neural network (DNN) models may assist
clinicians with more efficient image segmentation of individual instances
(disks and vertebrae) of the lumbar spine in an automated way, which is termed
as instance image segmentation. In this work, we proposed SymTC, an innovative
lumbar spine MR image segmentation model that combines the strengths of
Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, we designed a
parallel dual-path architecture to merge CNN layers and Transformer layers, and
we integrated a novel position embedding into the self-attention module of
Transformer, enhancing the utilization of positional information for more
accurate segmentation. To further improves model performance, we introduced a
new data augmentation technique to create synthetic yet realistic MR image
dataset, named SSMSpine, which is made publicly available. We evaluated our
SymTC and the other 15 existing image segmentation models on our private
in-house dataset and the public SSMSpine dataset, using two metrics, Dice
Similarity Coefficient and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The results show that our
SymTC has the best performance for segmenting vertebral bones and
intervertebral discs in lumbar spine MR images. The SymTC code and SSMSpine
dataset are available at https://github.com/jiasongchen/SymTC.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate liver segmentation from CT scans is essential for computer-aided
diagnosis and treatment planning. Recently, Vision Transformers achieved a
competitive performance in computer vision tasks compared to convolutional
neural networks due to their exceptional ability to learn global
representations. However, they often struggle with scalability, memory
constraints, and computational inefficiency, particularly in handling
high-resolution medical images. To overcome scalability and efficiency issues,
we propose a novel deep learning approach, \textit{\textbf{PVTFormer}}, that is
built upon a pretrained pyramid vision transformer (PVT v2) combined with
advanced residual upsampling and decoder block. By integrating a refined
feature channel approach with hierarchical decoding strategy, PVTFormer
generates high quality segmentation masks by enhancing semantic features.
Rigorous evaluation of the proposed method on Liver Tumor Segmentation
Benchmark (LiTS) 2017 demonstrates that our proposed architecture not only
achieves a high dice coefficient of 86.78\%, mIoU of 78.46\%, but also obtains
a low HD of 3.50. The results underscore PVTFormer's efficacy in setting a new
benchmark for state-of-the-art liver segmentation methods. The source code of
the proposed PVTFormer is available at

<p class="mathjax">Purpose: Ultrasound is the most commonly used medical imaging modality for
diagnosis and screening in clinical practice. Due to its safety profile,
noninvasive nature and portability, ultrasound is the primary imaging modality
for fetal assessment in pregnancy. Current ultrasound processing methods are
either manual or semi-automatic and are therefore laborious, time-consuming and
prone to errors, and automation would go a long way in addressing these
challenges. Automated identification of placental changes at earlier gestation
could facilitate potential therapies for conditions such as fetal growth
restriction and pre-eclampsia that are currently detected only at late
gestational age, potentially preventing perinatal morbidity and mortality.
<br />Methods: We propose an automatic three-dimensional multi-modal (B-mode and
power Doppler) ultrasound segmentation of the human placenta using deep
learning combined with different fusion strategies.We collected data containing
Bmode and power Doppler ultrasound scans for 400 studies.
<br />Results: We evaluated different fusion strategies and state-of-the-art image
segmentation networks for placenta segmentation based on standard overlap- and
boundary-based metrics. We found that multimodal information in the form of
B-mode and power Doppler scans outperform any single modality. Furthermore, we
found that B-mode and power Doppler input scans fused at the data level provide
the best results with a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.849.
<br />Conclusion: We conclude that the multi-modal approach of combining B-mode and
power Doppler scans is effective in segmenting the placenta from 3D ultrasound
scans in a fully automated manner and is robust to quality variation of the
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation, particularly in the context of ultrasound data,
is a crucial aspect of computer vision and medical imaging. This paper delves
into the complexities of uncertainty in the segmentation process, focusing on
fetal head and femur ultrasound images. The proposed methodology involves
extracting target contours and exploring techniques for precise parameter
measurement. Uncertainty modeling methods are employed to enhance the training
and testing processes of the segmentation network. The study reveals that the
average absolute error in fetal head circumference measurement is 8.0833mm,
with a relative error of 4.7347%. Similarly, the average absolute error in
fetal femur measurement is 2.6163mm, with a relative error of 6.3336%.
Uncertainty modeling experiments employing Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
demonstrate effective interpretability of data uncertainty on both datasets.
This suggests that incorporating data uncertainty based on the TTA method can
support clinical practitioners in making informed decisions and obtaining more
reliable measurement results in practical clinical applications. The paper
contributes to the advancement of ultrasound image segmentation, addressing
critical challenges and improving the reliability of biometric measurements.

<p class="mathjax">Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$,
quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\rho=\rho_0$ or
$\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1&gt;\varepsilon$, where $\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We
study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements,
namely measurements which operate only on one copy of $\rho$ at a time. When
there is a common source of shared randomness available and the unentangled
measurements are chosen based on this randomness, prior work has shown that
$\Theta(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds
even when the measurements are allowed to be chosen adaptively. We consider
deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed to randomized) and demonstrate
that ${\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for
state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms with and
without shared randomness.
<br />We develop a unified lower bound framework for both fixed and randomized
measurements, under the same theoretical framework that relates the hardness of
testing to the well-established L\"uders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower
bounds for randomized and fixed schemes as a function of the eigenvalues of the
L\"uders channel which characterizes one possible post-measurement state
transformation.

<p class="mathjax">We study a family of distributed stochastic optimization algorithms where
gradients are sampled by a token traversing a network of agents in random-walk
fashion. Typically, these random-walks are chosen to be Markov chains that
asymptotically sample from a desired target distribution, and play a critical
role in the convergence of the optimization iterates. In this paper, we take a
novel approach by replacing the standard linear Markovian token by one which
follows a nonlinear Markov chain - namely the Self-Repellent Radom Walk (SRRW).
Defined for any given 'base' Markov chain, the SRRW, parameterized by a
positive scalar {\alpha}, is less likely to transition to states that were
highly visited in the past, thus the name. In the context of MCMC sampling on a
graph, a recent breakthrough in Doshi et al. (2023) shows that the SRRW
achieves O(1/{\alpha}) decrease in the asymptotic variance for sampling. We
propose the use of a 'generalized' version of the SRRW to drive token
algorithms for distributed stochastic optimization in the form of stochastic
approximation, termed SA-SRRW. We prove that the optimization iterate errors of
the resulting SA-SRRW converge to zero almost surely and prove a central limit
theorem, deriving the explicit form of the resulting asymptotic covariance
matrix corresponding to iterate errors. This asymptotic covariance is always
smaller than that of an algorithm driven by the base Markov chain and decreases
at rate O(1/{\alpha}^2) - the performance benefit of using SRRW thereby
amplified in the stochastic optimization context. Empirical results support our
theoretical findings.

<p class="mathjax">The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary Digital Library portal
for researchers in astronomy and astrophysics. Over the past 30 years, the ADS
has gone from being an astronomy-focused bibliographic database to an open
digital library system supporting research in space and (soon) earth sciences.
This paper describes the evolution of the ADS system, its capabilities, and the
technological infrastructure underpinning it.
<br />We give an overview of the ADS's original architecture, constructed primarily
around simple database models. This bespoke system allowed for the efficient
indexing of metadata and citations, the digitization and archival of full-text
articles, and the rapid development of discipline-specific capabilities running
on commodity hardware. The move towards a cloud-based microservices
architecture and an open-source search engine in the late 2010s marked a
significant shift, bringing full-text search capabilities, a modern API, higher
uptime, more reliable data retrieval, and integration of advanced
visualizations and analytics.
<br />Another crucial evolution came with the gradual and ongoing incorporation of
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms in our data
pipelines. Originally used for information extraction and classification tasks,
NLP and ML techniques are now being developed to improve metadata enrichment,
search, notifications, and recommendations. we describe how these computational
techniques are being embedded into our software infrastructure, the challenges
faced, and the benefits reaped.
<br />Finally, we conclude by describing the future prospects of ADS and its
ongoing expansion, discussing the challenges of managing an interdisciplinary
information system in the era of AI and Open Science, where information is
abundant, technology is transformative, but their trustworthiness can be
elusive.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer architecture has enabled recent progress in speech enhancement.
Since Transformers are position-agostic, positional encoding is the de facto
standard component used to enable Transformers to distinguish the order of
elements in a sequence. However, it remains unclear how positional encoding
exactly impacts speech enhancement based on Transformer architectures. In this
paper, we perform a comprehensive empirical study evaluating five positional
encoding methods, i.e., Sinusoidal and learned absolute position embedding
(APE), T5-RPE, KERPLE, as well as the Transformer without positional encoding
(No-Pos), across both causal and noncausal configurations. We conduct extensive
speech enhancement experiments, involving spectral mapping and masking methods.
Our findings establish that positional encoding is not quite helpful for the
models in a causal configuration, which indicates that causal attention may
implicitly incorporate position information. In a noncausal configuration, the
models significantly benefit from the use of positional encoding. In addition,
we find that among the four position embeddings, relative position embeddings
outperform APEs.

<p class="mathjax">The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, challenging
task as it depends on the analysis of interactional behaviors by psychologists
rather than the use of biochemical diagnostics. In this paper, we present a
modeling approach to ASD diagnosis by analyzing acoustic/prosodic and
linguistic features extracted from diagnostic conversations between a
psychologist and children who either are typically developing (TD) or have ASD.
We compare the contributions of different features across a range of
conversation tasks. We focus on finding a minimal set of parameters that
characterize conversational behaviors of children with ASD. Because ASD is
diagnosed through conversational interaction, in addition to analyzing the
behavior of the children, we also investigate whether the psychologist's
conversational behaviors vary across diagnostic groups. Our results can
facilitate fine-grained analysis of conversation data for children with ASD to
support diagnosis and intervention.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we explore an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
system with backscattering RFID tags. In this setup, an access point employs a
communication beam to serve a user while leveraging a sensing beam to detect an
RFID tag. Under the total transmit power constraint of the system, our
objective is to design sensing and communication beams by considering the tag
detection and communication requirements. First, we adopt zero-forcing to
design the beamforming vectors, followed by solving a convex optimization
problem to determine the power allocation between sensing and communication.
Then, we study a joint beamforming design problem with the goal of minimizing
the total transmit power while satisfying the tag detection and communication
requirements. To resolve this, we re-formulate the non-convex constraints into
convex second-order cone constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that,
under different communication SINR requirements, joint beamforming optimization
outperforms the zero-forcing-based method in terms of achievable detection
distance, offering a promising approach for the ISAC-backscattering systems.

<p class="mathjax">A standard treatment protocol for breast cancer entails administering
neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical removal of the tumor and surrounding
tissue. Pathologists typically rely on cabinet X-ray radiographs, known as
Faxitron, to examine the excised breast tissue and diagnose the extent of
residual disease. However, accurately determining the location, size, and
focality of residual cancer can be challenging, and incorrect assessments can
lead to clinical consequences. The utilization of automated methods can improve
the histopathology process, allowing pathologists to choose regions for
sampling more effectively and precisely. Despite the recognized necessity,
there are currently no such methods available. Training such automated
detection models require accurate ground truth labels on ex-vivo radiology
images, which can be acquired through registering Faxitron and histopathology
images and mapping the extent of cancer from histopathology to x-ray images.
This study introduces a deep learning-based image registration approach trained
on mono-modal synthetic image pairs. The models were trained using data from 50
women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery. The results
demonstrate that our method is faster and yields significantly lower average
landmark error ($2.1\pm1.96$ mm) over the state-of-the-art iterative
($4.43\pm4.1$ mm) and deep learning ($4.02\pm3.15$ mm) approaches. Improved
performance of our approach in integrating radiology and pathology information
facilitates generating large datasets, which allows training models for more
accurate breast cancer detection.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores sentence-level Multilingual Visual Speech Recognition
with a single model for the first time. As the massive multilingual modeling of
visual data requires huge computational costs, we propose a novel strategy,
processing with visual speech units. Motivated by the recent success of the
audio speech unit, the proposed visual speech unit is obtained by discretizing
the visual speech features extracted from the self-supervised visual speech
model. To correctly capture multilingual visual speech, we first train the
self-supervised visual speech model on 5,512 hours of multilingual audio-visual
data. Through analysis, we verify that the visual speech units mainly contain
viseme information while suppressing non-linguistic information. By using the
visual speech units as the inputs of our system, we pre-train the model to
predict corresponding text outputs on massive multilingual data constructed by
merging several VSR databases. As both the inputs and outputs are discrete, we
can greatly improve the training efficiency compared to the standard VSR
training. Specifically, the input data size is reduced to 0.016% of the
original video inputs. In order to complement the insufficient visual
information in speech recognition, we apply curriculum learning where the
inputs of the system begin with audio-visual speech units and gradually change
to visual speech units. After pre-training, the model is finetuned on
continuous features. We set new state-of-the-art multilingual VSR performances
by achieving comparable performances to the previous language-specific VSR
models, with a single trained model.

<p class="mathjax">In medical imaging, scans often reveal objects with varied contrasts but
consistent internal intensities or textures. This characteristic enables the
use of low-frequency approximations for tasks such as segmentation and
deformation field estimation. Yet, integrating this concept into neural network
architectures for medical image analysis remains underexplored. In this paper,
we propose the Slicer Network, a novel architecture designed to leverage these
traits. Comprising an encoder utilizing models like vision transformers for
feature extraction and a slicer employing a learnable bilateral grid, the
Slicer Network strategically refines and upsamples feature maps via a
splatting-blurring-slicing process. This introduces an edge-preserving
low-frequency approximation for the network outcome, effectively enlarging the
effective receptive field. The enhancement not only reduces computational
complexity but also boosts overall performance. Experiments across different
medical imaging applications, including unsupervised and keypoints-based image
registration and lesion segmentation, have verified the Slicer Network's
improved accuracy and efficiency.

<p class="mathjax">A rational design of new therapeutic drugs aims to find a molecular structure
with desired biological functionality, e.g., an ability to activate or suppress
a specific protein via binding to it. Molecular docking is a common technique
for evaluating protein-molecule interactions. Recently, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has emerged as a promising approach to generating molecules with the
docking score (DS) as a reward. In this work, we reproduce, scrutinize and
improve the recent RL model for molecule generation called FREED
(<a href="/abs/2110.01219">arXiv:2110.01219</a>). Extensive evaluation of the proposed method reveals several
limitations and challenges despite the outstanding results reported for three
target proteins. Our contributions include fixing numerous implementation bugs
and simplifying the model while increasing its quality, significantly extending
experiments, and conducting an accurate comparison with current
state-of-the-art methods for protein-conditioned molecule generation. We show
that the resulting fixed model is capable of producing molecules with superior
docking scores compared to alternative approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have emerged as a
natural tool for supervised learning from a control perspective, yet a complete
understanding of their optimal architecture remains elusive. In this work, we
examine the interplay between their width $p$ and number of layer transitions
$L$ (effectively the depth $L+1$). Specifically, we assess the model
expressivity in terms of its capacity to interpolate either a finite dataset
$D$ comprising $N$ pairs of points or two probability measures in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ within a Wasserstein error margin $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Our findings
reveal a balancing trade-off between $p$ and $L$, with $L$ scaling as
$O(1+N/p)$ for dataset interpolation, and
$L=O\left(1+(p\varepsilon^d)^{-1}\right)$ for measure interpolation.
<br />In the autonomous case, where $L=0$, a separate study is required, which we
undertake focusing on dataset interpolation. We address the relaxed problem of
$\varepsilon$-approximate controllability and establish an error decay of
$\varepsilon\sim O(\log(p)p^{-1/d})$. This decay rate is a consequence of
applying a universal approximation theorem to a custom-built Lipschitz vector
field that interpolates $D$. In the high-dimensional setting, we further
demonstrate that $p=O(N)$ neurons are likely sufficient to achieve exact
control.

universal quantum computation combining digital single-qubit gates with global

<p class="mathjax">The commercial interest in producing low-cost space missions by exploiting
the superior propellant management of low-thrust propulsion technology has
become increasingly popular. Typical to such missions is the design of transfer
trajectories between desired targets. This is a complex and computationally
expensive process. Additionally, the optimal solvers used to generate these
trajectories are extremely sensitive to initial guesses. One way to overcome
this challenge is to use a reasonably approximate trajectory as an initial
guess on optimal solvers. This paper presents a flexible approach to generating
very low thrust trajectories. The initial guess is obtained from a flexible
semi-analytic approach that can provide both planar and three-dimensional
initial guess trajectories for various design scenarios like orbit raising,
orbit insertion, phasing, and rendezvous. NASA's Evolutionary Mission
Trajectory Generator (EMTG) and General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) are used
as optimal solvers in this analysis. Numerical case studies are presented in
this paper.

<p class="mathjax">Gaussian graphical models emerge in a wide range of fields. They model the
statistical relationships between variables as a graph, where an edge between
two variables indicates conditional dependence. Unfortunately, well-established
estimators, such as the graphical lasso or neighborhood selection, are known to
be susceptible to a high prevalence of false edge detections. False detections
may encourage inaccurate or even incorrect scientific interpretations, with
major implications in applications, such as biomedicine or healthcare. In this
paper, we introduce a nodewise variable selection approach to graph learning
and provably control the false discovery rate of the selected edge set at a
self-estimated level. A novel fusion method of the individual neighborhoods
outputs an undirected graph estimate. The proposed method is parameter-free and
does not require tuning by the user. Benchmarks against competing false
discovery rate controlling methods in numerical experiments considering
different graph topologies show a significant gain in performance.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding neural dynamics is a central topic in machine learning,
non-linear physics and neuroscience. However, the dynamics is non-linear,
stochastic and particularly non-gradient, i.e., the driving force can not be
written as gradient of a potential. These features make analytic studies very
challenging. The common tool is to use path integral approach or dynamical
mean-field theory, but the drawback is one has to solve the
integro-differential or dynamical mean-field equations, which is
computationally expensive and has no closed form solutions in general. From the
aspect of associated Fokker-Planck equation, the steady state solution is
generally unknown. Here, we treat searching for the steady state as an
optimization problem, and construct an approximate potential closely related to
the speed of the dynamics, and find that searching for the ground state of this
potential is equivalent to running a stochastic gradient dynamics. The
resultant stationary state follows exactly the canonical Boltzmann measure.
Within this framework, the quenched disorder intrinsic in the neural networks
can be averaged out by applying the replica method. Our theory reproduces the
well-known result of edge-of-chaos, and further the order parameters
characterizing the continuous transition are derived, and different scaling
behavior with respect to inverse temperature in both sides of the transition is
also revealed. Our method opens the door to analytically study the steady state
landscape of the deterministic or stochastic high dimensional dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this paper is to generate realistic audio with a lightweight and
fast diffusion-based vocoder, named FreGrad. Our framework consists of the
following three key components: (1) We employ discrete wavelet transform that
decomposes a complicated waveform into sub-band wavelets, which helps FreGrad
to operate on a simple and concise feature space, (2) We design a
frequency-aware dilated convolution that elevates frequency awareness,
resulting in generating speech with accurate frequency information, and (3) We
introduce a bag of tricks that boosts the generation quality of the proposed
model. In our experiments, FreGrad achieves 3.7 times faster training time and
2.2 times faster inference speed compared to our baseline while reducing the
model size by 0.6 times (only 1.78M parameters) without sacrificing the output
quality. Audio samples are available at:

<p class="mathjax">A bisection in a graph is a cut in which the number of vertices in the two
parts differ by at most 1. In this paper, we give lower bounds for the maximum
weight of bisections of edge-weighted graphs with bounded maximum degree. Our
results improve a bound of Lee, Loh, and Sudakov (J. Comb. Th. Ser. B 103
(2013)) for (unweighted) maximum bisections in graphs whose maximum degree is
either even or equals 3, and for almost all graphs. We show that a tight lower
bound for maximum size of bisections in 3-regular graphs obtained by Bollob\'as
and Scott (J. Graph Th. 46 (2004)) can be extended to weighted subcubic graphs.
We also consider edge-weighted triangle-free subcubic graphs and show that a
much better lower bound (than for edge-weighted subcubic graphs) holds for such
graphs especially if we exclude $K_{1,3}$. We pose three conjectures.

<p class="mathjax">Despite fundamental interests in learning quantum circuits, the existence of
a computationally efficient algorithm for learning shallow quantum circuits
remains an open question. Because shallow quantum circuits can generate
distributions that are classically hard to sample from, existing learning
algorithms do not apply. In this work, we present a polynomial-time classical
algorithm for learning the description of any unknown $n$-qubit shallow quantum
circuit $U$ (with arbitrary unknown architecture) within a small diamond
distance using single-qubit measurement data on the output states of $U$. We
also provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for learning the description
of any unknown $n$-qubit state $\lvert \psi \rangle = U \lvert 0^n \rangle$
prepared by a shallow quantum circuit $U$ (on a 2D lattice) within a small
trace distance using single-qubit measurements on copies of $\lvert \psi
\rangle$. Our approach uses a quantum circuit representation based on local
inversions and a technique to combine these inversions. This circuit
representation yields an optimization landscape that can be efficiently
navigated and enables efficient learning of quantum circuits that are
classically hard to simulate.

<p class="mathjax">Study Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) currently serves as the benchmark for
evaluating sleep disorders. Its discomfort, impracticality for home-use, and
introduction of bias in sleep quality assessment necessitate the exploration of
less invasive, cost-effective, and portable alternatives. One promising
contender is the in-ear-EEG sensor, which offers advantages in terms of
comfort, fixed electrode positions, resistance to electromagnetic interference,
and user-friendliness. This study aims to establish a methodology to assess the
similarity between the in-ear-EEG signal and standard PSG.
<br />Methods: We assess the agreement between the PSG and in-ear-EEG derived
hypnograms. We extract features in the time- and frequency- domain from PSG and
in-ear-EEG 30-second epochs. We only consider the epochs where the PSG-scorers
and the in-ear-EEG-scorers were in agreement. We introduce a methodology to
quantify the similarity between PSG derivations and the single-channel
in-ear-EEG. The approach relies on a comparison of distributions of selected
features -- extracted for each sleep stage and subject on both PSG and the
in-ear-EEG signals -- via a Jensen-Shannon Divergence Feature-based Similarity
Index (JSD-FSI).
<br />Results: We found a high intra-scorer variability, mainly due to the
uncertainty the scorers had in evaluating the in-ear-EEG signals. We show that
the similarity between PSG and in-ear-EEG signals is high (JSD-FSI: 0.61 +/-
0.06 in awake, 0.60 +/- 0.07 in NREM and 0.51 +/- 0.08 in REM), and in line
with the similarity values computed independently on standard
PSG-channel-combinations.
<br />Conclusions: In-ear-EEG is a valuable solution for home-based sleep
monitoring, however further studies with a larger and more heterogeneous
dataset are needed.

<p class="mathjax">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) suffers from speckle noise, causing the
deterioration of image quality, especially in high-resolution modalities like
visible light OCT (vis-OCT). The potential of conventional supervised deep
learning denoising methods is limited by the difficulty of obtaining clean
data. Here, we proposed an innovative self-supervised strategy called Sub2Full
(S2F) for OCT despeckling without clean data. This approach works by acquiring
two repeated B-scans, splitting the spectrum of the first repeat as a
low-resolution input, and utilizing the full spectrum of the second repeat as
the high-resolution target. The proposed method was validated on vis-OCT
retinal images visualizing sublaminar structures in outer retina and
demonstrated superior performance over conventional Noise2Noise and Noise2Void
schemes. The code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Medical image datasets are essential for training models used in
computer-aided diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical research. However,
some challenges are associated with these datasets, including variability in
data distribution, data scarcity, and transfer learning issues when using
models pre-trained from generic images. This work studies the effect of these
challenges at the intra- and inter-domain level in few-shot learning scenarios
with severe data imbalance. For this, we propose a methodology based on Siamese
neural networks in which a series of techniques are integrated to mitigate the
effects of data scarcity and distribution imbalance. Specifically, different
initialization and data augmentation methods are analyzed, and four adaptations
to Siamese networks of solutions to deal with imbalanced data are introduced,
including data balancing and weighted loss, both separately and combined, and
with a different balance of pairing ratios. Moreover, we also assess the
inference process considering four classifiers, namely Histogram, $k$NN, SVM,
and Random Forest. Evaluation is performed on three chest X-ray datasets with
annotated cases of both positive and negative COVID-19 diagnoses. The accuracy
of each technique proposed for the Siamese architecture is analyzed separately
and their results are compared to those obtained using equivalent methods on a
state-of-the-art CNN. We conclude that the introduced techniques offer
promising improvements over the baseline in almost all cases, and that the
selection of the technique may vary depending on the amount of data available
and the level of imbalance.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting interactions between proteins is one of the most important yet
challenging problems in structural bioinformatics. Intrinsically, potential
function sites in protein surfaces are determined by both geometric and
chemical features. However, existing works only consider handcrafted or
individually learned chemical features from the atom type and extract geometric
features independently. Here, we identify two key properties of effective
protein surface learning: 1) relationship among atoms: atoms are linked with
each other by covalent bonds to form biomolecules instead of appearing alone,
leading to the significance of modeling the relationship among atoms in
chemical feature learning. 2) hierarchical feature interaction: the neighboring
residue effect validates the significance of hierarchical feature interaction
among atoms and between surface points and atoms (or residues). In this paper,
we present a principled framework based on deep learning techniques, namely
Hierarchical Chemical and Geometric Feature Interaction Network (HCGNet), for
protein surface analysis by bridging chemical and geometric features with
hierarchical interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method by 2.3% in site prediction task
and 3.2% in interaction matching task, respectively. Our code is available at
https://github.com/xmed-lab/HCGNet.

<p class="mathjax">Neural network wavefunctions optimized using the variational Monte Carlo
method have been shown to produce highly accurate results for the electronic
structure of atoms and small molecules, but the high cost of optimizing such
wavefunctions prevents their application to larger systems. We propose the
Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) optimizer to
reduce this bottleneck. SPRING combines ideas from the recently introduced
minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration optimizer (MinSR) and the classical
randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems. We
demonstrate that SPRING outperforms both MinSR and the popular
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature method (KFAC) across a number of small
atoms and molecules, given that the learning rates of all methods are optimally
tuned. For example, on the oxygen atom, SPRING attains chemical accuracy after
forty thousand training iterations, whereas both MinSR and KFAC fail to do so
even after one hundred thousand iterations.

<p class="mathjax">A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible
to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to
understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical
oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any
classical circuit.
<br />In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a
quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo
and Gunn (<a href="/abs/2311.07794">arXiv:2311.07794</a>) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection
schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum
program, consisting of a quantum circuit $C$ with a classical description and
an auxiliary quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, into a functionally-equivalent
obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about $C$ and
$\ket{\psi}$. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any
pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly)
deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security
proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be
heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability
obfuscation for classical circuits.
<br />Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and
Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic
quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely
classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of
Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state
indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle. Indeed, our
quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first
candidate realization of a ``best-possible'' copy-protection scheme for all
polynomial-time functionalities.

<p class="mathjax">Protein post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction is a
fundamental task in bioinformatics. Several computational methods have been
developed to predict PTM sites. However, existing methods ignore the structure
information and merely utilize protein sequences. Furthermore, designing a more
fine-grained structure representation learning method is urgently needed as PTM
is a biological event that occurs at the atom granularity. In this paper, we
propose a PTM site prediction method by Coupling of Multi-Granularity structure
and Multi-Scale sequence representation, PTM-CMGMS for brevity. Specifically,
multigranularity structure-aware representation learning is designed to learn
neighborhood structure representations at the amino acid, atom, and whole
protein granularity from AlphaFold predicted structures, followed by utilizing
contrastive learning to optimize the structure representations.Additionally,
multi-scale sequence representation learning is used to extract context
sequence information, and motif generated by aligning all context sequences of
PTM sites assists the prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show
that PTM-CMGMS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
