<p class="mathjax">ATLASv2 is based on a previously generated dataset included in "ATLAS: A
Sequence-based Learning Approach for Attack Investigation." The original ATLAS
dataset is comprised of Windows Security Auditing system logs, Firefox logs,
and DNS logs via WireShark. In ATLASv2, we aim to enrich the ATLAS dataset with
higher quality background noise and additional logging vantage points. This
work replicates the ten attack scenarios described in ATLAS, but extends the
logging to include Sysmon logs and events tracked through VMware Carbon Black
Cloud.
<br />The main contribution of ATLASv2 is to improve the quality of the benign
system activity and the integration of the attack scenarios. Instead of relying
on automated scripts to generate activity, we had two researchers use the
victim machines as their primary work stations throughout the course of the
engagement. This allowed us to capture system logs on actual user behavior.
Additionally, the researchers conducted the attacks in a lab setup allowing the
integration of the attack into the work flow of the victim user. This allows
the ATLASv2 dataset to provide realistic system logs that mirror the system log
activity generated in real-world attacks.

<p class="mathjax">The last decades have been characterized by unprecedented technological
advances, many of them powered by modern technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The world has become more
digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most
significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments,
businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies
combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a
complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in
demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep
learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect
our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based
classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network
intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network
security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the
challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions
into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to
overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research
directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern
digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems.

<p class="mathjax">Previous research on behaviour-based attack detection on networks of IoT
devices has resulted in machine learning models whose ability to adapt to
unseen data is limited, and often not demonstrated. In this paper we present an
approach for modelling IoT network attacks that focuses on generalizability,
yet also leads to better detection and performance. First, we present an
improved rolling window approach for feature extraction, and introduce a
multi-step feature selection process that reduces overfitting. Second, we build
and test models using isolated train and test datasets, thereby avoiding common
data leaks that have limited the generalizability of previous models. Third, we
rigorously evaluate our methodology using a diverse portfolio of machine
learning models, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, we build confidence
in the models by using explainable AI techniques, allowing us to identify the
features that underlie accurate detection of attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) enhances network traffic
management, while Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) offers efficient data
transmission. This paper analyzes SD-WAN over MPLS in the Housing Bank, a major
Algerian financial institution. We deploy FortiGate for the SD-WAN solution,
comparing it to traditional MPLS and direct internet access across metrics like
bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and quality of service
(QoS). Security measures include encryption, firewall, intrusion prevention,
web filtering, antivirus, and addressing threats like spoofing, DoS attacks,
and unauthorized access. We explore future trends such as SASE architecture,
AI/ML integration, and emerging transport methods. SD-WAN over MPLS proves
advantageous, offering enhanced performance, security, and flexibility.
Recommendations include ongoing performance monitoring and research.

<p class="mathjax">A method to infer and synthetically extrapolate roughness fields from
electron microscope scans of additively manufactured surfaces using an
adaptation of Rogallo's synthetic turbulence method [R. S. Rogallo, NASA
Technical Memorandum 81315, 1981] based on Fourier modes is presented. The
resulting synthetic roughness fields are smooth and are compatible with grid
generators in computational fluid dynamics or other numerical simulations.
Unlike machine learning methods, which can require over twenty scans of surface
roughness for training, the Fourier mode based method can extrapolate
homogeneous synthetic roughness fields using a single physical roughness scan
to any desired size and range. Five types of synthetic roughness fields are
generated using an electron microscope roughness image from literature. A
comparison of their spectral energy and two-point correlation spectra show that
the synthetic fields closely approximate the roughness structures and spectral
energy of the scan.

<p class="mathjax">In the era of data-driven economies, incentive systems and loyalty programs,
have become ubiquitous in various sectors, including advertising, retail,
travel, and financial services. While these systems offer advantages for both
users and companies, they necessitate the transfer and analysis of substantial
amounts of sensitive data. Privacy concerns have become increasingly pertinent,
necessitating the development of privacy-preserving incentive protocols.
Despite the rising demand for secure and decentralised systems, the existing
landscape lacks a comprehensive solution. We propose the Boomerang protocol, a
novel decentralised privacy-preserving incentive protocol that leverages
cryptographic black box accumulators to securely store user interactions within
the incentive system. Moreover, the protocol employs zero-knowledge proofs
based on BulletProofs to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring
verifiability while preserving their privacy. To further enhance public
verifiability and transparency, we utilise a smart contract on a Layer 1
blockchain to verify these zero-knowledge proofs. The careful combination of
black box accumulators with selected elliptic curves in the zero-knowledge
proofs makes the Boomerang protocol highly efficient. Our proof of concept
implementation shows that we can handle up to 23.6 million users per day, on a
single-threaded backend server with financial costs of approximately 2 US$.
Using the Solana blockchain we can handle 15.5 million users per day with
approximate costs of 0.00011 US$ per user. The Boomerang protocol represents a
significant advancement in privacy-preserving incentive protocols, laying the
groundwork for a more secure and privacy-centric future.

teaching is becoming more prevalent. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such
as NPTEL, have been creating high-quality educational content that is freely
accessible to students online. A large number of colleges across the country
are now using NPTEL videos in their classrooms. So more video lectures are
being recorded, maintained, and uploaded. These videos generally contain
information about that video before the lecture begins. We generally observe
that these educational videos have metadata containing five to six attributes:
Institute Name, Publisher Name, Department Name, Professor Name, Subject Name,
and Topic Name. It would be easy to maintain these videos if we could organize
them according to their categories. The indexing of these videos based on this
information is beneficial for students all around the world to efficiently
utilise these videos. In this project, we are trying to get the metadata

<p class="mathjax">People living with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) lose the ability to produce insulin
naturally. To compensate, they inject synthetic insulin. One common way to
inject insulin is through automated insulin delivery systems, which use sensors
to monitor their metabolic state and an insulin pump device to adjust insulin
to adapt.
<br />In this paper, we present the Metabolic Operating System, a new automated
insulin delivery system that we designed from the ground up using security
first principles. From an architecture perspective, we apply separation
principles to simplify the core system and isolate non-critical functionality
from the core closed-loop algorithm. From an algorithmic perspective, we
evaluate trends in insulin technology and formulate a simple, but effective,
algorithm given the state-of-the-art. From a safety perspective, we build in
multiple layers of redundancy to ensure that the person using our system
remains safe.
<br />Fundamentally, this paper is a paper on real-world experiences building and
running an automated insulin delivery system. We report on the design
iterations we make based on experiences working with one individual using our
system. Our evaluation shows that an automated insulin delivery system built
from the ground up using security first principles can still help manage T1D
effectively.

<p class="mathjax">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used to face challenging tasks
like speech recognition, natural language processing or computer vision. As CNN
architectures get larger and more complex, their computational requirements
increase, incurring significant energetic costs and challenging their
deployment on resource-restricted devices. In this paper, we propose Optimizing
Convolutional Neural Network Architecture (OCNNA), a novel CNN optimization and
construction method based on pruning and knowledge distillation designed to
establish the importance of convolutional layers. The proposal has been
evaluated though a thorough empirical study including the best known datasets
(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenet) and CNN architectures (VGG-16, ResNet-50,
DenseNet-40 and MobileNet), setting Accuracy Drop and Remaining Parameters
Ratio as objective metrics to compare the performance of OCNNA against the
other state-of-art approaches. Our method has been compared with more than 20
convolutional neural network simplification algorithms obtaining outstanding
results. As a result, OCNNA is a competitive CNN constructing method which
could ease the deployment of neural networks into IoT or resource-limited
devices.

<p class="mathjax">For visually impaired people, it is highly difficult to make independent
movement and safely move in both indoors and outdoors environment. Furthermore,
these physically and visually challenges prevent them from in day-today live
activities. Similarly, they have problem perceiving objects of surrounding
environment that may pose a risk to them. The proposed approach suggests
detection of objects in real-time video by using a web camera, for the object
identification, process. You Look Only Once (YOLO) model is utilized which is
CNN-based real-time object detection technique. Additionally, The OpenCV
libraries of Python is used to implement the software program as well as deep
learning process is performed. Image recognition results are transferred to the
visually impaired users in audible form by means of Google text-to-speech
library and determine object location relative to its position in the screen.
The obtaining result was evaluated by using the mean Average Precision (mAP),
and it was found that the proposed approach achieves excellent results when it
compared to previous approaches.

<p class="mathjax">If the extraction of sensor fingerprints represents nowadays an important
forensic tool for sensor attribution, it has been shown recently that images
coming from several sensors were more prone to generate False Positives (FP) by
presenting a common "leak". In this paper, we investigate the possible cause of
this leak and after inspecting the EXIF metadata of the sources causing FP, we
found out that they were related to the Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop softwares.
The cross-correlation between residuals on images presenting FP reveals
periodic peaks showing the presence of a periodic pattern. By developing our
own images with Adobe Lightroom we are able to show that all developments from
raw images (or 16 bits per channel coded) to 8 bits-coded images also embed a
periodic 128x128 pattern very similar to a watermark. However, we also show
that the watermark depends on both the content and the architecture used to
develop the image. The rest of the paper presents two different ways of
removing this watermark, one by removing it from the image noise component, and
the other by removing it in the pixel domain. We show that for a camera
presenting FP, we were able to prevent the False Positives. A discussion with
Adobe representatives informed us that the company decided to add this pattern
in order to induce dithering.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems aim to recommend the most suitable items to users from a
large number of candidates. Their computation cost grows as the number of user
requests and the complexity of services (or models) increases. Under the
limitation of computation resources (CRs), how to make a trade-off between
computation cost and business revenue becomes an essential question. The
existing studies focus on dynamically allocating CRs in queue truncation
scenarios (i.e., allocating the size of candidates), and formulate the CR
allocation problem as an optimization problem with constraints. Some of them
focus on single-phase CR allocation, and others focus on multi-phase CR
allocation but introduce some assumptions about queue truncation scenarios.
However, these assumptions do not hold in other scenarios, such as retrieval
channel selection and prediction model selection. Moreover, existing studies
ignore the state transition process of requests between different phases,
limiting the effectiveness of their approaches.
<br />This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Multi-Phase
Computation Allocation approach (RL-MPCA), which aims to maximize the total
business revenue under the limitation of CRs. RL-MPCA formulates the CR
allocation problem as a Weakly Coupled MDP problem and solves it with an
RL-based approach. Specifically, RL-MPCA designs a novel deep Q-network to
adapt to various CR allocation scenarios, and calibrates the Q-value by
introducing multiple adaptive Lagrange multipliers (adaptive-$\lambda$) to
avoid violating the global CR constraints. Finally, experiments on the offline
simulation environment and online real-world recommender system validate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Spurred by consistent advances and innovation in deep learning, object
detection applications have become prevalent, particularly in autonomous
driving that leverages various visual data. As convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) are being optimized, the performances and computation speeds of object
detection in autonomous driving have been significantly improved. However, due
to the exponentially rapid growth in the complexity and scale of data used in
object detection, there are limitations in terms of computation speeds while
conducting object detection solely with classical computing. Motivated by this,
quantum convolution-based object detection (QCOD) is proposed to adopt quantum
computing to perform object detection at high speed. The QCOD utilizes our
proposed fast quantum convolution that uploads input channel information and
re-constructs output channels for achieving reduced computational complexity
and thus improving performances. Lastly, the extensive experiments with KITTI
autonomous driving object detection dataset verify that the proposed fast
quantum convolution and QCOD are successfully operated in real object detection
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Defect detection is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in the
quality control stage in the manufacturing sector. In this work, we introduce a
Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) and examine its performance on a
real defect detection application in one of the components of the ultrasonic
sensors produced at Robert Bosch's manufacturing plants. Our quantum-inspired
T-CNN operates on a reduced model parameter space to substantially improve the
training speed and performance of an equivalent CNN model without sacrificing
accuracy. More specifically, we demonstrate how T-CNNs are able to reach the
same performance as classical CNNs as measured by quality metrics, with up to
fifteen times fewer parameters and 4% to 19% faster training times. Our results
demonstrate that the T-CNN greatly outperforms the results of traditional human
visual inspection, providing value in a current real application in
manufacturing.

<p class="mathjax">An attack taxonomy offers a consistent and structured classification scheme
to systematically understand, identify, and classify cybersecurity threat
attributes. However, existing taxonomies only focus on a narrow range of
attacks and limited threat attributes, lacking a comprehensive characterization
of manufacturing cybersecurity threats. There is little to no focus on
characterizing threat actors and their intent, specific system and machine
behavioral deviations introduced by cyberattacks, system-level and operational
implications of attacks, and potential countermeasures against those attacks.
To close this pressing research gap, this work proposes a comprehensive attack
taxonomy for a holistic understanding and characterization of cybersecurity
threats in manufacturing systems. Specifically, it introduces taxonomical
classifications for threat actors and their intent and potential alterations in
system behavior due to threat events. The proposed taxonomy categorizes attack
methods/vectors and targets/locations and incorporates operational and
system-level attack impacts. This paper also presents a classification
structure for countermeasures, provides examples of potential countermeasures,
and explains how they fit into the proposed taxonomical classification.
Finally, the implementation of the proposed taxonomy is illustrated using two
realistic scenarios of attacks on typical smart manufacturing systems, as well
as several real-world cyber-physical attack incidents and academic case
studies. The developed manufacturing attack taxonomy offers a holistic view of
the attack chain in manufacturing systems, starting from the attack launch to
the possible damages and system behavior changes within the system.
Furthermore, it guides the design and development of appropriate protective and
detective countermeasures by leveraging the attack realization through observed
system deviations.

<p class="mathjax">Effective monitoring of walnut water status and stress level across the whole
orchard is an essential step towards precision irrigation management of
walnuts, a significant crop in California. This study presents a machine
learning approach using Random Forest (RF) models to map stem water potential
(SWP) by integrating high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery from
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights with weather data. From 2017 to 2018,
five flights of an UAV equipped with a seven-band multispectral camera were
conducted over a commercial walnut orchard, paired with concurrent ground
measurements of sampled walnut plants. The RF regression model, utilizing
vegetation indices derived from orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data,
effectively estimated ground-measured SWPs, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.63 and a
mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.80 bars. The integration of weather data was
particularly crucial for consolidating data across various flight dates.
Significant variables for SWP estimation included wind speed and vegetation
indices such as NDVI, NDRE, and PSRI.A reduced RF model excluding red-edge
indices of NDRE and PSRI, demonstrated slightly reduced accuracy ($R^2$ =
0.54). Additionally, the RF classification model predicted water stress levels
in walnut trees with 85% accuracy, surpassing the 80% accuracy of the reduced
classification model. The results affirm the efficacy of UAV-based
multispectral imaging combined with machine learning, incorporating thermal
data, NDVI, red-edge indices, and weather data, in walnut water stress
estimation and assessment. This methodology offers a scalable, cost-effective
tool for data-driven precision irrigation management at an individual plant
level in walnut orchards.

<p class="mathjax">The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possibility of implementing an
attack on ALPC connection in the Windows operating system through the kernel
without closing the connection covertly from programs and the operating system
and to propose a method of protection against this type of attacks.
Asynchronous Local Procedure Call technology (ALPC) is used in various Windows
information protection systems, including antivirus systems (AV) and Endpoint
Detection and Response systems (EDR). To ensure the concealment of malicious
software, attackers need to disrupt the operation of AV, EDR tools, which in
turn can be achieved by destructive impact on the components of the ALPC
technology. Examples of such attacks already exist and are covered in this
paper. To counteract such new threats, it is necessary to advance the
improvement of information security systems and the ALPC security research was
conducted. The most difficult case, Windows kernel driver attack, was
considered. Three attacks on the ALPC connection were carried out, based on
changing the ALPC structures in the kernel memory, which led to creation of
illegitimate connections in the system and the disruption of correct
connections. ALPChecker protection tool has been developed. The tool was
successfully tested on three demonstrated attacks.

<p class="mathjax">The field of few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promising results in scenarios
where training data is limited, but its vulnerability to backdoor attacks
remains largely unexplored. We first explore this topic by first evaluating the
performance of the existing backdoor attack methods on few-shot learning
scenarios. Unlike in standard supervised learning, existing backdoor attack
methods failed to perform an effective attack in FSL due to two main issues.
Firstly, the model tends to overfit to either benign features or trigger
features, causing a tough trade-off between attack success rate and benign
accuracy. Secondly, due to the small number of training samples, the dirty
label or visible trigger in the support set can be easily detected by victims,
which reduces the stealthiness of attacks. It seemed that FSL could survive
from backdoor attacks. However, in this paper, we propose the Few-shot Learning
Backdoor Attack (FLBA) to show that FSL can still be vulnerable to backdoor
attacks. Specifically, we first generate a trigger to maximize the gap between
poisoned and benign features. It enables the model to learn both benign and
trigger features, which solves the problem of overfitting. To make it more
stealthy, we hide the trigger by optimizing two types of imperceptible
perturbation, namely attractive and repulsive perturbation, instead of
attaching the trigger directly. Once we obtain the perturbations, we can poison
all samples in the benign support set into a hidden poisoned support set and
fine-tune the model on it. Our method demonstrates a high Attack Success Rate
(ASR) in FSL tasks with different few-shot learning paradigms while preserving
clean accuracy and maintaining stealthiness. This study reveals that few-shot
learning still suffers from backdoor attacks, and its security should be given
attention.

<p class="mathjax">Currently cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which enable
financial services on public blockchains, represents a new growing trend in
finance. In contrast to financial markets, ruled by traditional corporations,
DeFi is completely transparent as it keeps records of all transactions that
occur in the network and makes them publicly available. The availability of the
data represents an opportunity to analyze and understand the market from the
complexity that emerges from the interactions of the actors (users, bots and
companies) operating in the embedded market. In this paper we focus on the
Ethereum network and our main goal is to show that the properties of the
underlying transaction network provide further and useful information to
forecast the evolution of the market. We aim to separate the non redundant
effects of the blockchain transaction network properties from classic technical
indicators and social media trends in the future price of Ethereum. To this
end, we build two machine learning models to predict the future trend of the
market. The first one serves as a base model and considers a set of the most
relevant features according to the current scientific literature including
technical indicators and social media trends. The second model considers the
features of the base model, together with the network properties computed from
the transaction networks. We found that the full model outperforms the base
model and can anticipate 46 more rises in the price than the base model and 19
more falls.

<p class="mathjax">Existing music-driven 3D dance generation methods mainly concentrate on
high-quality dance generation, but lack sufficient control during the
generation process. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework
capable of generating high-quality dance movements and supporting multi-modal
control, including genre control, semantic control, and spatial control. First,
we decouple the dance generation network from the dance control network,
thereby avoiding the degradation in dance quality when adding additional
control information. Second, we design specific control strategies for
different control information and integrate them into a unified framework.
Experimental results show that the proposed dance generation framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of motion quality and

both global similarities and local similarities over the whole graph. We
introduce Transitivity Graph Neural Network (TransGNN), which more than local
node similarities, takes into account global similarities by distinguishing
strong transitivity relations from weak ones and exploiting them. We evaluate
our model over several real-world datasets and showed that it considerably
improves the performance of several well-known GNN models, for tasks such as
node classification.

<p class="mathjax">The task of Visual Relationship Recognition (VRR) aims to identify
relationships between two interacting objects in an image and is particularly
challenging due to the widely-spread and highly imbalanced distribution of
&lt;subject, relation, object&gt; triplets. To overcome the resultant performance
bias in existing VRR approaches, we introduce DiffAugment -- a method which
first augments the tail classes in the linguistic space by making use of
WordNet and then utilizes the generative prowess of Diffusion Models to expand
the visual space for minority classes. We propose a novel hardness-aware
component in diffusion which is based upon the hardness of each &lt;S,R,O&gt; triplet
and demonstrate the effectiveness of hardness-aware diffusion in generating
visual embeddings for the tail classes. We also propose a novel subject and
object based seeding strategy for diffusion sampling which improves the
discriminative capability of the generated visual embeddings. Extensive
experimentation on the GQA-LT dataset shows favorable gains in the
subject/object and relation average per-class accuracy using Diffusion
augmented samples.

<p class="mathjax">WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
enables contactless, long-range sensing in spatially constrained environments
while preserving visual privacy. However, despite the presence of numerous
WiFi-enabled devices around us, few expose CSI to users, resulting in a lack of
sensing hardware options. Variants of the Espressif ESP32 have emerged as
potential low-cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for WiFi CSI-based HAR. In this
work, four ESP32-S3-based 2.4GHz directional antenna systems are evaluated for
their ability to facilitate long-range through-wall HAR. Two promising systems
are proposed, one of which combines the ESP32-S3 with a directional biquad
antenna. This combination represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first
demonstration of such a system in WiFi-based HAR. The second system relies on
the built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) of the ESP32-S3 and achieves
directionality through a plane reflector. In a comprehensive evaluation of
line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) HAR performance, both systems
are deployed in an office environment spanning a distance of 18 meters across
five rooms. In this experimental setup, the Wallhack1.8k dataset, comprising
1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities, is collected and made
publicly available. Based on Wallhack1.8k, we train activity recognition models
using the EfficientNetV2 architecture to assess system performance in LOS and
NLOS scenarios. For the core NLOS activity recognition problem, the biquad
antenna and PIFA-based systems achieve accuracies of 92.0$\pm$3.5 and
86.8$\pm$4.7, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of long-range
through-wall HAR with the proposed systems.

<p class="mathjax">Neural implicit fields, such as the neural signed distance field (SDF) of a
shape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g.,
encoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit
fields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding
(PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side
effect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned
implicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate
these artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon
through the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the
appropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field
without undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet
effective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with
randomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It
is observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than
the highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this
intrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to
determine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the
setting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to
secure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate
would not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped
MLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the
existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) or
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for precise (Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing) PNT solutions. However, the vulnerability of GPS
signals to intentional and unintended threats due to their lack of encryption
and weak signal strength poses serious risks, thereby reducing the reliability
of AVs. GPS spoofing is a complex and damaging attack that deceives AVs by
altering GPS receivers to calculate false position and tracking information
leading to misdirection. This study explores a stealthy slow drift GPS spoofing
attack, replicating the victim AV's satellite reception pattern while changing
pseudo ranges to deceive the AV, particularly during turns. The attack is
designed to gradually deviate from the correct route, making real-time
detection challenging and jeopardizing user safety. We present a system and
study methodology for constructing covert spoofing attacks on AVs,
investigating the correlation between original and spoofed pseudo ranges to
create effective defenses. By closely following the victim vehicle and using
the same satellite signals, the attacker executes the attack precisely.
Changing the pseudo ranges confuses the AV, leading it to incorrect
destinations while remaining oblivious to the manipulation. The gradual
deviation from the actual route further conceals the attack, hindering its
swift identification. The experiments showcase a robust correlation between the
original and spoofed pseudo ranges, with R square values varying between 0.99
and 1. This strong correlation facilitates effective evaluation and mitigation
of spoofing signals.

dependencies between geographic features and distinct spatial patterns related
to topography, ecology, and human development. We identify a close connection
between modeling of spatial patterns of land use and the task of image
inpainting from computer vision and conduct a study of a modified PixelCNN
architecture with approximately 19 million parameters for modeling LULC. In
comparison with a benchmark spatial statistical model, we find that the former
is capable of capturing much richer spatial correlation patterns such as roads
and water bodies but does not produce a calibrated predictive distribution,
suggesting the need for additional tuning. We find evidence of predictive
underdispersion with regard to important ecologically-relevant land use

<p class="mathjax">Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise
couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting
behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or
independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability
of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic
complexity of $O(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible
pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most
networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is
only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of
reconstruction problems that achieves its result in subquadratic time, with a
data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with
a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. Our algorithm relies on
a stochastic second neighbor search that produces the best edge candidates with
high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. In practice,
our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster
than the quadratic baseline, allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables
the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of
nodes and edges.

<p class="mathjax">Does Donald Trump speak differently from other presidents? If so, in what
ways? Are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To
investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness
based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and
presents a framework for comparing the lexical features of political opponents.
Applying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find
considerable evidence that Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all
major party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Some notable
findings include Trump's employment of particularly divisive and antagonistic
language targeting of his political opponents and his patterns of repetition
for emphasis. Furthermore, Trump is significantly more distinctive than his
fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values are comparably closer to those of
the Democrats. These differences hold across a variety of measurement
strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential
addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular time trends.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and
geographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by
temporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the
cost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy
microservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource
configuration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload
variations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since
applications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new
resource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration
scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update
scheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization
problem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and
that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same
regional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service
disruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the
need to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the
updated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that
effectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero
service disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed
schemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service
disruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes
replicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.

Specifically, we explore the time uncertainty associated with the four major
Global Navigation Satellite Systems. Additionally, we provide a summary of

simulations provide partial usages. However, our research introduces a
comprehensive and precise time synchronization simulation named P-TimeSync,
leading to a better understanding of time synchronization in distributed
environments. It is a state-of-the-art simulation tool for time because (1) it
can simulate atomic clocks and quartz clocks with user-defined software clock
algorithms, (2) the simulation provides nanosecond-level precision time across
different network propagation paths and distances, (3) the tool offers a
visualization platform with classic algorithms for distributed time
synchronization, such as Cristian's algorithm and Berkeley algorithm, and (4)
the simulation includes three time-sync attack functions, including distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, IP spoofer, and router hijacker. The
simulation easily allows for the redefinition of configurations and functions,

<p class="mathjax">Supporting learners in introductory programming assignments at scale is a
necessity. This support includes automated feedback on what learners did
incorrectly. Existing approaches cast the problem as automatically repairing
learners' incorrect programs extrapolating the data from an existing correct
program from other learners. However, such approaches are limited because they
only compare programs with similar control flow and order of statements. A
potentially valuable set of repair feedback from flexible comparisons is thus
missing. In this paper, we present several modifications to CLARA, a
data-driven automated repair approach that is open source, to deal with
real-world introductory programs. We extend CLARA's abstract syntax tree
processor to handle common introductory programming constructs. Additionally,
we propose a flexible alignment algorithm over control flow graphs where we
enrich nodes with semantic annotations extracted from programs using operations
and calls. Using this alignment, we modify an incorrect program's control flow
graph to match the correct programs to apply CLARA's original repair process.
We evaluate our approach against a baseline on the twenty most popular
programming problems in Codeforces. Our results indicate that flexible
alignment has a significantly higher percentage of successful repairs at 46%
compared to 5% for baseline CLARA. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/towhidabsar/clara.

<p class="mathjax">We conduct a large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis of machine
translations (MT) against human translations (HT) through the lens of
morphosyntactic divergence. Across three language pairs and two types of
divergence defined as the structural difference between the source and the
target, MT is consistently more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic
diversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. Through
analysis on different decoding algorithms, we attribute this discrepancy to the
use of beam search that biases MT towards more convergent patterns. This bias
is most amplified when the convergent pattern appears around 50% of the time in
training data. Lastly, we show that for a majority of morphosyntactic
divergences, their presence in HT is correlated with decreased MT performance,
presenting a greater challenge for MT systems.

<p class="mathjax">Linear-Quadratic (LQ) problems that arise in systems and controls include the
classical optimal control problems of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in
both its deterministic and stochastic forms, as well as $H^\infty$-analysis
(the Bounded Real Lemma), the Positive Real Lemma, and general Integral
Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) tests. We present a unified treatment of all of
these problems using an approach which converts linear-quadratic problems to
matrix-valued linear-linear problems with a positivity constraint. This is done
through a system representation where the joint state/input covariance (the
outer product in the deterministic case) matrix is the fundamental object. LQ
problems then become infinite-dimensional semidefinite programs, and the key
tool used is that of linear-conic duality. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)
emerge naturally as conal constraints on dual problems. Riccati equations
characterize extrema of these special LMIs, and therefore provide solutions to
the dual problems. The state-feedback structure of all optimal signals in these
problems emerge out of alignment (complementary slackness) conditions between
primal and dual problems. Perhaps the new insight gained from this approach is
that first LMIs, and then second, Riccati equations arise naturally in dual,
rather than primal problems. Furthermore, while traditional LQ problems are set
up in $L^2$ spaces of signals, their equivalent covariance-representation
problems are most naturally set up in $L^1$ spaces of matrix-valued signals.

<p class="mathjax">Starting from the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation and Duhamel's principle of
time-domain wave equations, we propose novel butterfly-compressed Hadamard
integrators for self-adjoint wave equations in both time and frequency domain
in an inhomogeneous medium. First, we incorporate the leading term of
Hadamard's ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation to develop a
short-time valid propagator. Second, using the Fourier transform in time, we
derive the corresponding Eulerian short-time propagator in frequency domain; on
top of this propagator, we further develop a time-frequency-time (TFT) method
for the Cauchy problem of time-domain wave equations. Third, we further propose
the time-frequency-time-frequency (TFTF) method for the corresponding
point-source Helmholtz equation, which provides Green's functions of the
Helmholtz equation for all angular frequencies within a given frequency band.
Fourth, to implement TFT and TFTF methods efficiently, we introduce butterfly
algorithms to compress oscillatory integral kernels at different frequencies.
As a result, the proposed methods can construct wave field beyond caustics
implicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally with
quasi-optimal computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, once
constructed the Hadamard integrators can be employed to solve both time-domain
wave equations with various initial conditions and frequency-domain wave
equations with different point sources. Numerical examples for two-dimensional
wave equations illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.

<p class="mathjax">Information aging has gained prominence in characterizing communication
protocols for timely remote estimation and control applications. This work
proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame
slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type
communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput
in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined
to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame.
At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point
(AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node.
Depending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes,
and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The
maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at
each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may
render T-DFSA unstable. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-DFSA compared to the existing
optimal frame slotted ALOHA, threshold-ALOHA, and age-based thinning protocols
in a considerable range of update generation rates.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the high-level decision-making problem in highway
scenarios regarding lane changing and over-taking other slower vehicles. In
particular, this paper aims to improve the Travel Assist feature for automatic
overtaking and lane changes on highways. About 9 million samples including lane
images and other dynamic objects are collected in simulation. This data;
Overtaking on Simulated HighwAys (OSHA) dataset is released to tackle this
challenge. To solve this problem, an architecture called SwapTransformer is
designed and implemented as an imitation learning approach on the OSHA dataset.
Moreover, auxiliary tasks such as future points and car distance network
predictions are proposed to aid the model in better understanding the
surrounding environment. The performance of the proposed solution is compared
with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and multi-head self-attention networks as
baselines in a simulation environment. We also demonstrate the performance of
the model with and without auxiliary tasks. All models are evaluated based on
different metrics such as time to finish each lap, number of overtakes, and
speed difference with speed limit. The evaluation shows that the
SwapTransformer model outperforms other models in different traffic densities
in the inference phase.

<p class="mathjax">Pearl's causal hierarchy establishes a clear separation between
observational, interventional, and counterfactual questions. Researchers
proposed sound and complete algorithms to compute identifiable causal queries
at a given level of the hierarchy using the causal structure and data from the
lower levels of the hierarchy. However, most of these algorithms assume that we
can accurately estimate the probability distribution of the data, which is an
impractical assumption for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the
other hand, modern generative deep learning architectures can be trained to
learn how to accurately sample from such high-dimensional distributions.
Especially with the recent rise of foundation models for images, it is
desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries with such
high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose a sequential training
algorithm that, given the causal structure and a pre-trained conditional
generative model, can train a deep causal generative model, which utilizes the
pre-trained model and can provably sample from identifiable interventional and
counterfactual distributions. Our algorithm, called Modular-DCM, uses
adversarial training to learn the network weights, and to the best of our
knowledge, is the first algorithm that can make use of pre-trained models and
provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent
confounders with high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the utility of our
algorithm using semi-synthetic and real-world datasets containing images as
variables in the causal structure.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple access (MA) is a crucial part of any wireless system and refers to
techniques that make use of the resource dimensions to serve multiple
users/devices/machines/services, ideally in the most efficient way. Given the
needs of multi-functional wireless networks for integrated communications,
sensing, localization, computing, coupled with the surge of machine learning /
artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless networks, MA techniques are expected
to experience a paradigm shift in 6G and beyond. In this paper, we provide a
tutorial, survey and outlook of past, emerging and future MA techniques and pay
a particular attention to how wireless network intelligence and
multi-functionality will lead to a re-thinking of those techniques. The paper
starts with an overview of orthogonal, physical layer multicasting, space
domain, power domain, ratesplitting, code domain MAs, and other domains, and
highlight the importance of researching universal multiple access to shrink
instead of grow the knowledge tree of MA schemes by providing a unified
understanding of MA schemes across all resource dimensions. It then jumps into
rethinking MA schemes in the era of wireless network intelligence, covering AI
for MA such as AI-empowered resource allocation, optimization, channel
estimation, receiver designs, user behavior predictions, and MA for AI such as
federated learning/edge intelligence and over the air computation. We then
discuss MA for network multi-functionality and the interplay between MA and
integrated sensing, localization, and communications. We finish with studying
MA for emerging intelligent applications before presenting a roadmap toward 6G
standardization. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for
future research.

<p class="mathjax">LiDAR is used in autonomous driving to provide 3D spatial information and
enable accurate perception in off-road environments, aiding in obstacle
detection, mapping, and path planning. Learning-based LiDAR semantic
segmentation utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify
objects and regions in LiDAR point clouds. Learning-based models struggle in
off-road environments due to the presence of diverse objects with varying
colors, textures, and undefined boundaries, which can lead to difficulties in
accurately classifying and segmenting objects using traditional geometric-based
features. In this paper, we address this problem by harnessing the LiDAR
intensity parameter to enhance object segmentation in off-road environments.
Our approach was evaluated in the RELLIS-3D data set and yielded promising
results as a preliminary analysis with improved mIoU for classes "puddle" and
"grass" compared to more complex deep learning-based benchmarks. The
methodology was evaluated for compatibility across both Velodyne and Ouster
LiDAR systems, assuring its cross-platform applicability. This analysis
advocates for the incorporation of calibrated intensity as a supplementary
input, aiming to enhance the prediction accuracy of learning based semantic
segmentation frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">When implementing hierarchical federated learning over wireless networks,
scalability assurance and the ability to handle both interference and device
data heterogeneity are crucial. This work introduces a learning method designed
to address these challenges, along with a scalable transmission scheme that
efficiently uses a single wireless resource through over-the-air computation.
To provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient
aggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of interference is minimized through
optimized receiver normalizing factors. For this, we model a multi-cluster
wireless network using stochastic geometry, and characterize the mean squared
error of the aggregation estimations as a function of the network parameters.
We show that despite the interference and the data heterogeneity, the proposed
scheme achieves high learning accuracy and can significantly outperform the
conventional hierarchical algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of
indoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple
scenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the
reflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle
discovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this
problem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and
obstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground
plane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a
pre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict
the ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this
scheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected
ground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel
relative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature
representation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes.
Eventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry
fusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the
obstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of
obstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with
various ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400
RGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a
comparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the
reflection, the proposed approach outperforms others. The source code and the
dataset will be available at

<p class="mathjax">Multi-label image classification presents a challenging task in many domains,
including computer vision and medical imaging. Recent advancements have
introduced graph-based and transformer-based methods to improve performance and
capture label dependencies. However, these methods often include complex
modules that entail heavy computation and lack interpretability. In this paper,
we propose Probabilistic Multi-label Contrastive Learning (ProbMCL), a novel
framework to address these challenges in multi-label image classification
tasks. Our simple yet effective approach employs supervised contrastive
learning, in which samples that share enough labels with an anchor image based
on a decision threshold are introduced as a positive set. This structure
captures label dependencies by pulling positive pair embeddings together and
pushing away negative samples that fall below the threshold. We enhance
representation learning by incorporating a mixture density network into
contrastive learning and generating Gaussian mixture distributions to explore
the epistemic uncertainty of the feature encoder. We validate the effectiveness
of our framework through experimentation with datasets from the computer vision
and medical imaging domains. Our method outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art methods while achieving a low computational footprint on both
datasets. Visualization analyses also demonstrate that ProbMCL-learned
classifiers maintain a meaningful semantic topology.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving has rapidly developed and shown promising performance with
recent advances in hardware and deep learning methods. High-quality datasets
are fundamental for developing reliable autonomous driving algorithms. Previous
dataset surveys tried to review the datasets but either focused on a limited
number or lacked detailed investigation of the characters of datasets. To this
end, we present an exhaustive study of over 200 autonomous driving datasets
from multiple perspectives, including sensor modalities, data size, tasks, and
contextual conditions. We introduce a novel metric to evaluate the impact of
each dataset, which can also be a guide for establishing new datasets. We
further analyze the annotation process and quality of datasets. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth analysis of the data distribution of several vital
datasets. Finally, we discuss the development trend of the future autonomous

<p class="mathjax">Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness in
generating extremely high-quality images and have found wide-ranging
applications, including automatic sketch colorization. However, most existing
models use text to guide the conditional generation, with fewer attempts
exploring the potential advantages of using image tokens as conditional inputs
for networks. As such, this paper exhaustively investigates image-guided
models, specifically targeting reference-based sketch colorization, which aims
to colorize sketch images using reference color images. We investigate three
critical aspects of reference-based diffusion models: the shortcomings compared
to text-based counterparts, the training strategies, and the capability in
zero-shot, sequential text-based manipulation. We introduce two variations of
an image-guided latent diffusion model using different image tokens from the
pre-trained CLIP image encoder, and we propose corresponding manipulation
methods to adjust their results sequentially using weighted text inputs. We
conduct comprehensive evaluations of our models through qualitative and
quantitative experiments, as well as a user study.

<p class="mathjax">Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical
applications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various
memory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for
safety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to
single and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation,
aging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect
transient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications,
and require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose the \emph{uncertainty fingerprint} approach representing the
online fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology
specifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary
prediction of the NN in \emph{a single shot}. During the online operation, by
matching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up
to $100\%$ coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar
performance of the primary task. Compared to existing works, memory overhead is
reduced by up to $243.7$ MB, multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation is reduced
by up to $10000\times$, and false-positive rates are reduced by up to $89\%$.

<p class="mathjax">Disease control experts inspect public health data streams daily for outliers
worth investigating, like those corresponding to data quality issues or disease
outbreaks. However, they can only examine a few of the thousands of
maximally-tied outliers returned by univariate outlier detection methods
applied to large-scale public health data streams. To help experts distinguish
the most important outliers from these thousands of tied outliers, we propose a
new task for algorithms to rank the outputs of any univariate method applied to
each of many streams. Our novel algorithm for this task, which leverages
hierarchical networks and extreme value analysis, performed the best across
traditional outlier detection metrics in a human-expert evaluation using public
health data streams. Most importantly, experts have used our open-source Python
implementation since April 2023 and report identifying outliers worth
investigating 9.1x faster than their prior baseline. Other organizations can
readily adapt this implementation to create rankings from the outputs of their
tailored univariate methods across large-scale streams.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce Deep Set Linearized Optimal Transport, an algorithm designed for
the efficient simultaneous embedding of point clouds into an $L^2-$space. This
embedding preserves specific low-dimensional structures within the Wasserstein
space while constructing a classifier to distinguish between various classes of
point clouds. Our approach is motivated by the observation that $L^2-$distances
between optimal transport maps for distinct point clouds, originating from a
shared fixed reference distribution, provide an approximation of the
Wasserstein-2 distance between these point clouds, under certain assumptions.
To learn approximations of these transport maps, we employ input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) and establish that, under specific conditions, Euclidean
distances between samples from these ICNNs closely mirror Wasserstein-2
distances between the true distributions. Additionally, we train a
discriminator network that attaches weights these samples and creates a
permutation invariant classifier to differentiate between different classes of
point clouds. We showcase the advantages of our algorithm over the standard
deep set approach through experiments on a flow cytometry dataset with a
limited number of labeled point clouds.

<p class="mathjax">DSLR cameras can achieve multiple zoom levels via shifting lens distances or
swapping lens types. However, these techniques are not possible on smartphone
devices due to space constraints. Most smartphone manufacturers adopt a hybrid
zoom system: commonly a Wide (W) camera at a low zoom level and a Telephoto (T)
camera at a high zoom level. To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these
systems crop and digitally upsample images from W, leading to significant
detail loss. In this paper, we propose an efficient system for hybrid zoom
super-resolution on mobile devices, which captures a synchronous pair of W and
T shots and leverages machine learning models to align and transfer details
from T to W. We further develop an adaptive blending method that accounts for
depth-of-field mismatches, scene occlusion, flow uncertainty, and alignment
errors. To minimize the domain gap, we design a dual-phone camera rig to
capture real-world inputs and ground-truths for supervised training. Our method
generates a 12-megapixel image in 500ms on a mobile platform and compares
favorably against state-of-the-art methods under extensive evaluation on
real-world scenarios.

of the proposed task planning framework to realize these objectives by
integrating human leading/following preference and performance into its task

wherein the robot autonomously collaborates with participants. The outcomes of
the user study indicate that the proactive task planning framework successfully

<p class="mathjax">Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize
'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years
summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of
the art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate
results that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated
data for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of
an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that
attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic
complexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that
mitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach
summarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are
deemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite
efficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the
'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary
will not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of
Computer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of
input tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained
settings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address
this challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in
all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is
often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful
in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token
propagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different
token-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control
the reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient
token utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose
a smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy
outliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,
we introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image
structures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present
extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT
and Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For
example, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the
inference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification
accuracy by 1.0%.

<p class="mathjax">Context: Navigating the knowledge of Stack Overflow (SO) remains challenging.
To make the posts vivid to users, SO allows users to write and edit posts with
Markdown or HTML so that users can leverage various formatting styles (e.g.,
bold, italic, and code) to highlight the important information. Nonetheless,
there have been limited studies on the highlighted information. Objective: We
carried out the first large-scale exploratory study on the information
highlighted in SO answers in our recent study. To extend our previous study, we
develop approaches to automatically recommend highlighted content with
formatting styles using neural network architectures initially designed for the
Named Entity Recognition task. Method: In this paper, we studied 31,169,429
answers of Stack Overflow. For training recommendation models, we choose CNN
and BERT models for each type of formatting (i.e., Bold, Italic, Code, and
Heading) using the information highlighting dataset we collected from SO
answers. Results: Our models based on CNN architecture achieve precision
ranging from 0.71 to 0.82. The trained model for automatic code content
highlighting achieves a recall of 0.73 and an F1 score of 0.71, outperforming
the trained models for other formatting styles. The BERT models have even lower
recalls and F1 scores than the CNN models. Our analysis of failure cases
indicates that the majority of the failure cases are missing identification
(i.e., the model misses the content that is supposed to be highlighted) due to
the models tend to learn the frequently highlighted words while struggling to
learn less frequent words. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is possible
to develop recommendation models for highlighting information for answers with
different formatting styles on Stack Overflow.

<p class="mathjax">We present our general-purpose mobile manipulation system consisting of a
custom robot platform and key algorithms spanning perception and planning. To
extensively test the system in the wild and benchmark its performance, we
choose a grocery shopping scenario in an actual, unmodified grocery store. We
derive key performance metrics from detailed robot log data collected during
six week-long field tests, spread across 18 months. These objective metrics,
gained from complex yet repeatable tests, drive the direction of our research
efforts and let us continuously improve our system's performance. We find that
thorough end-to-end system-level testing of a complex mobile manipulation
system can serve as a reality-check for state-of-the-art methods in robotics.
This effectively grounds robotics research efforts in real world needs and
challenges, which we deem highly useful for the advancement of the field. To
this end, we share our key insights and takeaways to inspire and accelerate
similar system-level research projects.

<p class="mathjax">Time series forecasting task predicts future trends based on historical
information. Recent U-Net-based methods have demonstrated superior performance
in predicting real-world datasets. However, the performance of these models is
lower than patch-based models or linear models. In this work, we propose a
symmetric and hierarchical framework, Kernel-U-Net, which cuts the input
sequence into slices at each layer of the network and then computes them using
kernels. Furthermore, it generalizes the concept of convolutional kernels in
classic U-Net to accept custom kernels that follow the same design pattern.
Compared to the existing linear or transformer-based solution, our model
contains 3 advantages: 1) A small number of parameters: the parameters size is
$O(log(L)^2)$ where $L$ is the look-back window size, 2) Flexibility: its
kernels can be customized and fitted to the datasets, 3) Computation
efficiency: the computation complexity of transformer modules is reduced to
$O(log(L)^2)$ if they are placed close to the latent vector. Kernel-U-Net
accuracy was greater than or equal to the state-of-the-art model on six (out of
seven) real-world datasets.

<p class="mathjax">One of the most critical applications undertaken by coalitions of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is reaching
predefined targets by following the most time-efficient routes while avoiding
collisions. Unfortunately, UAVs are hampered by limited battery life, and UGVs
face challenges in reachability due to obstacles and elevation variations.
Existing literature primarily focuses on one-to-one coalitions, which
constrains the efficiency of reaching targets. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for a UAV-UGV coalition with a variable number of vehicles,
employing a modified mean-shift clustering algorithm to segment targets into
multiple zones. Each vehicle utilizes Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (MADDPG) and Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), two
advanced reinforcement learning algorithms, to form an effective coalition for
navigating obstructed environments without collisions. This approach of
assigning targets to various circular zones, based on density and range,
significantly reduces the time required to reach these targets. Moreover,
introducing variability in the number of UAVs and UGVs in a coalition enhances
task efficiency by enabling simultaneous multi-target engagement. The results
of our experimental evaluation demonstrate that our proposed method
substantially surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, nearly doubling
efficiency in terms of target navigation time and task completion rate.

<p class="mathjax">Existing object recognition models have been shown to lack robustness in
diverse geographical scenarios due to significant domain shifts in design and
context. Class representations need to be adapted to more accurately reflect an
object concept under these shifts. In the absence of training data from target
geographies, we hypothesize that geography-specific descriptive knowledge of
object categories can be leveraged to enhance robustness. For this purpose, we
explore the feasibility of probing a large-language model for
geography-specific object knowledge, and we investigate integrating knowledge
in zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with the CLIP vision-language model.
In particular, we propose a geography knowledge regularization method to ensure
that soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an
unseen target set of geographies. Our gains on DollarStreet when generalizing
from a model trained only on data from Europe are as large as +2.8 on countries
from Africa, and +4.6 on the hardest classes. We further show competitive
performance vs. few-shot target training, and provide insights into how
descriptive knowledge captures geographical differences.

framework that takes into account both human leading/following preferences and
performance, specifically focusing on task allocation and scheduling in
collaborative settings. We present a proactive task allocation approach with
three primary objectives: enhancing team performance, incorporating human
preferences, and upholding a positive human perception of the robot and the
collaborative experience. Through a user study, involving an autonomous mobile
manipulator robot working alongside participants in a collaborative scenario,
we confirm that the task planning framework successfully attains all three
intended goals, thereby contributing to the advancement of adaptive task
planning in human-robot collaboration. This paper mainly focuses on the first
two objectives, and we discuss the third objective, participants' perception of
the robot, tasks, and collaboration in a companion paper.

<p class="mathjax">The Evidential Regression Network (ERN) represents a novel approach that
integrates deep learning with Dempster-Shafer's theory to predict a target and
quantify the associated uncertainty. Guided by the underlying theory, specific
activation functions must be employed to enforce non-negative values, which is
a constraint that compromises model performance by limiting its ability to
learn from all samples. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of this
limitation and introduces an improvement to overcome it. Initially, we define
the region where the models can't effectively learn from the samples. Following
this, we thoroughly analyze the ERN and investigate this constraint. Leveraging
the insights from our analysis, we address the limitation by introducing a
novel regularization term that empowers the ERN to learn from the whole
training set. Our extensive experiments substantiate our theoretical findings
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of financial decision-making, predicting stock prices is
pivotal. Artificial intelligence techniques such as long short-term memory
networks (LSTMs), support-vector machines (SVMs), and natural language
processing (NLP) models are commonly employed to predict said prices. This
paper utilizes stock percentage change as training data, in contrast to the
traditional use of raw currency values, with a focus on analyzing publicly
released news articles. The choice of percentage change aims to provide models
with context regarding the significance of price fluctuations and overall price
change impact on a given stock. The study employs specialized BERT natural
language processing models to predict stock price trends, with a particular
emphasis on various data modalities. The results showcase the capabilities of
such strategies with a small natural language processing model to accurately
predict overall stock trends, and highlight the effectiveness of certain data
features and sector-specific data.

<p class="mathjax">This study was groundbreaking in its application of neural network models for
nitrate management in the Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). A hybrid
neural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate
concentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a
105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five
sets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention.
Furthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data
to evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The
experimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate
concentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced
proportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from
the past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe
allows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we
compared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network
models (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network
models (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that
the C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network
models (R2=0.901-0.927). Our study suggests that the utilization of neural
network models, specifically the C-L-A model, could potentially assist the RAS
industry in conserving resources for daily nitrate monitoring.

<p class="mathjax">Remote Sensing Target Fine-grained Classification (TFGC) is of great
significance in both military and civilian fields. Due to location differences,
growth in data size, and centralized server storage constraints, these data are
usually stored under different databases across regions/countries. However,
privacy laws and national security concerns constrain researchers from
accessing these sensitive remote sensing images for further analysis.
Additionally, low-resource remote sensing devices encounter challenges in terms
of communication overhead and efficiency when dealing with the ever-increasing
data and model scales. To solve the above challenges, this paper proposes a
novel Privacy-Reserving TFGC Framework based on Federated Learning, dubbed
PRFL. The proposed framework allows each client to learn global and local
knowledge to enhance the local representation of private data in environments
with extreme statistical heterogeneity (non. Independent and Identically
Distributed, IID). Thus, it provides highly customized models to clients with
differentiated data distributions. Moreover, the framework minimizes
communication overhead and improves efficiency while ensuring satisfactory
performance, thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability under
resource-scarce conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
PRFL on the classical TFGC task by leveraging four public datasets.

<p class="mathjax">In terms of human-computer interaction, it is becoming more and more
important to correctly understand the user's emotional state in a conversation,
so the task of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) started to receive more
attention. However, existing emotion classification methods usually perform
classification only once. Sentences are likely to be misclassified in a single
round of classification. Previous work usually ignores the similarities and
differences between different morphological features in the fusion process. To
address the above issues, we propose a two-stage emotion recognition model
based on graph contrastive learning (TS-GCL). First, we encode the original
dataset with different preprocessing modalities. Second, a graph contrastive
learning (GCL) strategy is introduced for these three modal data with other
structures to learn similarities and differences within and between modalities.
Finally, we use MLP twice to achieve the final emotion classification. This
staged classification method can help the model to better focus on different
levels of emotional information, thereby improving the performance of the
model. Extensive experiments show that TS-GCL has superior performance on
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets compared with previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">Sequential recommenders are crucial to the success of online applications,
\eg e-commerce, video streaming, and social media. While model architectures
continue to improve, for every new application domain, we still have to train a
new model from scratch for high quality recommendations. On the other hand,
pre-trained language and vision models have shown great success in zero-shot or
few-shot adaptation to new application domains. Inspired by the success of
pre-trained models in peer AI fields, we propose a novel pre-trained sequential
recommendation framework: PrepRec. We learn universal item representations by
modeling item popularity dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five
real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information,
can not only zero-shot transfer to a new domain, but achieve competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models with
only a fraction of the model size. In addition, with a simple post-hoc
interpolation, PrepRec can improve the performance of existing sequential
recommenders on average by 13.8\% in Recall@10 and 29.5% in NDCG@10. We provide
an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at

<p class="mathjax">Real-time safety metrics are important for the automated driving system (ADS)
to assess the risk of driving situations and to assist the decision-making.
Although a number of real-time safety metrics have been proposed in the
literature, systematic performance evaluation of these safety metrics has been
lacking. As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety
metrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their
performance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an
evaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data, in that vehicle
trajectories for both subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are
obtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be
eliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision
unavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of
BVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety
metrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the
collision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips
are available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics'
statistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time
safety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC), the PEGASUS Criticality
Metric (PCM), and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM),
are evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The proposed
evaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and
regulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics
for different applications. Moreover, by conducting failure analysis on moments
when a safety metric failed, we can identify its potential weaknesses which are
valuable for its potential refinements and improvements.

<p class="mathjax">The values of two-player general-sum differential games are viscosity
solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Value and policy
approximations for such games suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD).
Alleviating CoD through physics-informed neural networks (PINN) encounters
convergence issues when value discontinuity is present due to state
constraints. On top of these challenges, it is often necessary to learn
generalizable values and policies across a parametric space of games, e.g., for
game parameter inference when information is incomplete. To address these
challenges, we propose in this paper a Pontryagin-mode neural operator that
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) on safety performance across games
with parametric state constraints. Our key contribution is the introduction of
a costate loss defined on the discrepancy between forward and backward costate
rollouts, which are computationally cheap. We show that the discontinuity of
costate dynamics (in the presence of state constraints) effectively enables the
learning of discontinuous values, without requiring manually supervised data as
suggested by the current SOTA. More importantly, we show that the close
relationship between costates and policies makes the former critical in
learning feedback control policies with generalizable safety performance.

<p class="mathjax">Specific emitter identification (SEI) technology is significant in device
administration scenarios, such as self-organized networking and spectrum
management, owing to its high security. For nonlinear and non-stationary
electromagnetic signals, SEI often employs variational modal decomposition
(VMD) to decompose the signal in order to effectively characterize the distinct
device fingerprint. However, the trade-off of VMD between the robustness to
noise and the ability to preserve signal information has not been investigated
in the current literature. Moreover, the existing VMD algorithm does not
utilize the stability of the intrinsic distortion of emitters within a certain
temporal span, consequently constraining its practical applicability in SEI. In
this paper, we propose a joint variational modal decomposition (JVMD)
algorithm, which is an improved version of VMD by simultaneously implementing
modal decomposition on multi-frame signals. The consistency of multi-frame
signals in terms of the central frequencies and the inherent modal functions
(IMFs) is exploited, which effectively highlights the distinctive
characteristics among emitters and reduces noise. Additionally, the complexity
of JVMD is analyzed, which is proven to be more computational-friendly than
VMD. Simulations of both modal decomposition and SEI that involve real-world
datasets are presented to illustrate that when compared with VMD, the JVMD
algorithm improves the accuracy of device classification and the robustness
towards noise.

<p class="mathjax">Reasoning over sports videos for question answering is an important task with
numerous applications, such as player training and information retrieval.
However, this task has not been explored due to the lack of relevant datasets
and the challenging nature it presents. Most datasets for video question
answering (VideoQA) focus mainly on general and coarse-grained understanding of
daily-life videos, which is not applicable to sports scenarios requiring
professional action understanding and fine-grained motion analysis. In this
paper, we introduce the first dataset, named Sports-QA, specifically designed
for the sports VideoQA task. The Sports-QA dataset includes various types of
questions, such as descriptions, chronologies, causalities, and counterfactual
conditions, covering multiple sports. Furthermore, to address the
characteristics of the sports VideoQA task, we propose a new Auto-Focus
Transformer (AFT) capable of automatically focusing on particular scales of
temporal information for question answering. We conduct extensive experiments
on Sports-QA, including baseline studies and the evaluation of different
methods. The results demonstrate that our AFT achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<p class="mathjax">The Kov\'ats Retention index (RI) is a quantity measured using gas
chromatography and commonly used in the identification of chemical structures.
Creating libraries of observed RI values is a laborious task, so we explore the
use of a deep neural network for predicting RI values from structure for
standard semipolar columns. This network generated predictions with a mean
absolute error of 15.1 and, in a quantification of the tail of the error
distribution, a 95th percentile absolute error of 46.5. Because of the
Artificial Intelligence Retention Indices (AIRI) network's accuracy, it was
used to predict RI values for the NIST EI-MS spectral libraries. These RI
values are used to improve chemical identification methods and the quality of
the library. Estimating uncertainty is an important practical need when using
prediction models. To quantify the uncertainty of our network for each
individual prediction, we used the outputs of an ensemble of 8 networks to
calculate a predicted standard deviation for each RI value prediction. This
predicted standard deviation was corrected to follow the error between observed
and predicted RI values. The Z scores using these predicted standard deviations
had a standard deviation of 1.52 and a 95th percentile absolute Z score
corresponding to a mean RI value of 42.6.

<p class="mathjax">Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now a cornerstone of requirements
automation. One compelling factor behind the growing adoption of NLP in
Requirements Engineering (RE) is the prevalent use of natural language (NL) for
specifying requirements in industry. NLP techniques are commonly used for
automatically classifying requirements, extracting important information, e.g.,
domain models and glossary terms, and performing quality assurance tasks, such
as ambiguity handling and completeness checking. With so many different NLP
solution strategies available and the possibility of applying machine learning
alongside, it can be challenging to choose the right strategy for a specific RE
task and to evaluate the resulting solution in an empirically rigorous manner.
This book chapter presents guidelines for the selection of NLP techniques as
well as for their evaluation in the context of RE. In particular, we discuss
how to choose among different strategies such as traditional NLP, feature-based
machine learning, and language-model-based methods. Our ultimate hope for this
chapter is to serve as a stepping stone, assisting newcomers to NLP4RE in
quickly initiating themselves into the NLP technologies most pertinent to the
RE field.

<p class="mathjax">While significant advancements have been made in video question answering
(VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through
tailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing
research. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a
curriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from
simpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL
methods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not
accurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the
concept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding
principle for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the
challenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach
for VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation
graph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables.
This yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent
uncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In
practice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and
conduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not
only achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty
in the context of VideoQA.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized information retrieval,
ushering in a new era of expansive knowledge accessibility. While these models
excel in providing open-world knowledge, effectively extracting answers in
diverse linguistic environments with varying levels of literacy remains a
formidable challenge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a
promising solution, bridging the gap between information availability and
multilingual comprehension. However, deploying RAG models in real-world
scenarios demands careful consideration of various factors. This paper
addresses the critical challenges associated with implementing RAG models in
multicultural environments. We delve into essential considerations, including
data feeding strategies, timely updates, mitigation of hallucinations,
prevention of erroneous responses, and optimization of delivery speed. Our work
involves the integration of a diverse array of tools, meticulously combined to
facilitate the seamless adoption of RAG models across languages and literacy
levels within a multicultural organizational context. Through strategic tweaks
in our approaches, we achieve not only effectiveness but also efficiency,
ensuring the accelerated and accurate delivery of information in a manner that
is tailored to the unique requirements of multilingual and multicultural
settings.

measurements may lead to an overestimation of models' capabilities by
neglecting the syntax rules of programming languages. To address these issues,
we introduce a technique called SyntaxEval in which Syntactic Capabilities are
used to enhance the evaluation of MLMs. SyntaxEval automates the process of
masking elements in the model input based on their Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs). We conducted a case study on two popular MLMs using data from GitHub

<p class="mathjax">We study the efficiency of fair allocations using the well-studied price of
fairness concept, which quantitatively measures the worst-case efficiency loss
when imposing fairness constraints. Previous works provided partial results on
the price of fairness with well-known fairness notions such as envy-freeness up
to one good (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). In this paper, we
give a complete characterization for the price of envy-freeness in various
settings. In particular, we first consider the two-agent case under the
indivisible-goods setting and present tight ratios for the price of EF1 (for
scaled utility) and EFX (for unscaled utility), which resolve questions left
open in the literature. Next, we consider the mixed goods setting which
concerns a mixture of both divisible and indivisible goods. We focus on
envy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which generalizes both envy-freeness and
EF1, as well as its strengthening called envy-freeness up to any good for mixed
goods (EFXM), which generalizes envy-freeness and EFX. To this end, we settle
the price of EFM and EFXM by providing a complete picture of tight bounds for
two agents and asymptotically tight bounds for $n$ agents, for both scaled and
unscaled utilities.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the frontiers of large language models (LLMs) in
psychology applications. Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes,
and the current use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning,
particularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We provide a
detailed exploration of how LLMs like ChatGPT are transforming psychological
research. It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of
psychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling,
educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting
their potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper
delves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text
generation, offering innovative tools for literature review, hypothesis
generation, experimental design, experimental subjects, data analysis, academic
writing, and peer review in psychology. While LLMs are essential in advancing
research methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their
technical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the
ethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for
a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should
responsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards
and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in
sensitive areas. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of LLMs in psychology, exploring potential benefits and
challenges. It serves as a call to action for researchers to leverage LLLs'
advantages responsibly while addressing associated risks.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools, rivaling GANs in
sample quality and mirroring the likelihood scores of autoregressive models. A
subset of these models, exemplified by DDIMs, exhibit an inherent asymmetry:
they are trained over $T$ steps but only sample from a subset of $T$ during
generation. This selective sampling approach, though optimized for speed,
inadvertently misses out on vital information from the unsampled steps, leading
to potential compromises in sample quality. To address this issue, we present
the S$^{2}$-DMs, which is a new training method by using an innovative
$L_{skip}$, meticulously designed to reintegrate the information omitted during
the selective sampling phase. The benefits of this approach are manifold: it
notably enhances sample quality, is exceptionally simple to implement, requires
minimal code modifications, and is flexible enough to be compatible with
various sampling algorithms. On the CIFAR10 dataset, models trained using our
algorithm showed an improvement of 3.27% to 14.06% over models trained with
traditional methods across various sampling algorithms (DDIMs, PNDMs, DEIS) and
different numbers of sampling steps (10, 20, ..., 1000). On the CELEBA dataset,
the improvement ranged from 8.97% to 27.08%. Access to the code and additional
resources is provided in the github.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum computing offers significant acceleration capabilities over its
classical counterpart in various application domains. Consequently, there has
been substantial focus on improving quantum computing capabilities. However, to
date, the security implications of these quantum computing platforms have been
largely overlooked. With the emergence of cloud-based quantum computing
services, it is critical to investigate the extension of classical computer
security threats to the realm of quantum computing.
<br />In this study, we investigated timing-based side-channel vulnerabilities
within IBM's cloud-based quantum service. The proposed attack effectively
subverts the confidentiality of the executed quantum algorithm, using a more
realistic threat model compared to existing approaches. Our experimental
results, conducted using IBM's quantum cloud service, demonstrate that with
just 10 measurements, it is possible to identify the underlying quantum
computer that executed the circuit. Moreover, when evaluated using the popular
Grover circuit, we showcase the ability to leak the quantum oracle with a mere
500 measurements. These findings underline the pressing need to address
timing-based vulnerabilities in quantum computing platforms and advocate for
enhanced security measures to safeguard sensitive quantum algorithms and data.

<p class="mathjax">Table structure recognition (TSR) aims at extracting tables in images into
machine-understandable formats. Recent methods solve this problem by predicting
the adjacency relations of detected cell boxes or learning to directly generate
the corresponding markup sequences from the table images. However, existing
approaches either count on additional heuristic rules to recover the table
structures, or face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies within
tables, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we propose an
alternative paradigm. We model TSR as a logical location regression problem and
propose a new TSR framework called LORE, standing for LOgical location
REgression network, which for the first time regresses logical location as well
as spatial location of table cells in a unified network. Our proposed LORE is
conceptually simpler, easier to train, and more accurate than other paradigms
of TSR. Moreover, inspired by the persuasive success of pre-trained models on a
number of computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we propose two
pre-training tasks to enrich the spatial and logical representations at the
feature level of LORE, resulting in an upgraded version called LORE++. The
incorporation of pre-training in LORE++ has proven to enjoy significant
advantages, leading to a substantial enhancement in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and few-shot capability compared to its predecessor.
Experiments on standard benchmarks against methods of previous paradigms
demonstrate the superiority of LORE++, which highlights the potential and
promising prospect of the logical location regression paradigm for TSR.

<p class="mathjax">The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how
information is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in
the digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant
increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes
is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings,
which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of
this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest
due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In
response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity
of various LMMs (e.g. GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of
social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme
benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes
such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing
GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness,
misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive
experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a
deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of
implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment
to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and
accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/,
contributing to ongoing research in this vital field.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal deep learning utilizing imaging and diagnostic reports has made
impressive progress in the field of medical imaging diagnostics, demonstrating
a particularly strong capability for auxiliary diagnosis in cases where
sufficient annotation information is lacking. Nonetheless, localizing diseases
accurately without detailed positional annotations remains a challenge.
Although existing methods have attempted to utilize local information to
achieve fine-grained semantic alignment, their capability in extracting the
fine-grained semantics of the comprehensive contextual within reports is
limited. To solve this problem, we introduce a new method that takes full
sentences from textual reports as the basic units for local semantic alignment.
Our approach combines chest X-ray images with their corresponding textual
reports, performing contrastive learning at both global and local levels. The
leading results obtained by our method on multiple datasets confirm its
efficacy in the task of lesion localization.

<p class="mathjax">FinTech platforms facilitated by digital payments are watching growth
rapidly, which enable the distribution of mutual funds personalized to
individual investors via mobile Apps. As the important intermediation of
financial products investment, these platforms distribute thousands of mutual
funds obtaining impressions under guaranteed delivery (GD) strategy required by
fund companies. Driven by the profit from fund purchases of users, the platform
aims to maximize each transaction amount of customers by promoting mutual funds
to these investors who will be interested in. Different from the conversions in
traditional advertising or e-commerce recommendations, the investment amount in
each purchase varies greatly even for the same financial product, which
provides a significant challenge for the promotion recommendation of mutual
funds. In addition to predicting the click-through rate (CTR) or the conversion
rate (CVR) as in traditional recommendations, it is essential for FinTech
platforms to estimate the customers' purchase amount for each delivered fund
and achieve an effective allocation of impressions based on the predicted
results to optimize the total expected transaction value (ETV). In this paper,
we propose an ETV optimized customer allocation framework (EOCA) that aims to
maximize the total ETV of recommended funds, under the constraints of GD dealt
with fund companies. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first attempt to
solve the GD problem for financial product promotions based on customer
purchase amount prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on large scale
real-world datasets and online tests based on LiCaiTong, Tencent wealth
management platform, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EOCA
framework.

<p class="mathjax">Modern recommender systems have seen substantial success, yet they remain
vulnerable to malicious activities, notably poisoning attacks. These attacks
involve injecting malicious data into the training datasets of RS, thereby
compromising their integrity and manipulating recommendation outcomes for
gaining illicit profits. This survey paper provides a systematic and up-to-date
review of the research landscape on Poisoning Attacks against Recommendation
(PAR). A novel and comprehensive taxonomy is proposed, categorizing existing
PAR methodologies into three distinct categories: Component-Specific,
Goal-Driven, and Capability Probing. For each category, we discuss its
mechanism in detail, along with associated methods. Furthermore, this paper
highlights potential future research avenues in this domain. Additionally, to
facilitate and benchmark the empirical comparison of PAR, we introduce an
open-source library, ARLib, which encompasses a comprehensive collection of PAR
models and common datasets. The library is released at

<p class="mathjax">Two-sided matching markets have been widely studied in the literature due to
their rich applications. Since participants are usually uncertain about their
preferences, online algorithms have recently been adopted to learn them through
iterative interactions. \citet{wang2022bandit} initiate the study of this
problem in a many-to-one setting with \textit{responsiveness}. However, their
results are far from optimal and lack guarantees of incentive compatibility. An
extension of \citet{kong2023player} to this more general setting achieves a
near-optimal bound for player-optimal regret. Nevertheless, due to the
substantial requirement for collaboration, a single player's deviation could
lead to a huge increase in its own cumulative rewards and an $O(T)$ regret for
others. In this paper, we aim to enhance the regret bound in many-to-one
markets while ensuring incentive compatibility. We first propose the adaptively
explore-then-deferred-acceptance (AETDA) algorithm for responsiveness setting
and derive an $O(N\min\left\{N,K\right\}C\log T/\Delta^2)$ upper bound for
player-optimal stable regret while demonstrating its guarantee of incentive
compatibility, where $N$ represents the number of players, $K$ is the number of
arms, $T$ denotes the time horizon, $C$ is arms' total capacities and $\Delta$
signifies the minimum preference gap among players. This result is a
significant improvement over \citet{wang2022bandit}. And to the best of our
knowledge, it constitutes the first player-optimal guarantee in matching
markets that offers such robust assurances. We also consider broader
\textit{substitutable} preferences, one of the most general conditions to
ensure the existence of a stable matching and cover responsiveness. We devise
an online DA (ODA) algorithm and establish an $O(NK\log T/\Delta^2)$
player-pessimal stable regret bound for this setting.

<p class="mathjax">Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a vital tool to evaluate
agents' ability to understand human daily behaviors. Despite the recent success
of large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation
reasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still
remains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series
of episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments
for reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the
Glance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to
predict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a
closed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead
of that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event
memories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching
to obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory
generation method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the
focusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the
correlation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level
lengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the
generated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for
reasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including
STAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA. Our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing current large models in various
challenging reasoning tasks. The code and models are available at

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores opportunities and challenges of task (goal)-oriented and
semantic communications for next-generation (NextG) communication networks
through the integration of multi-task learning. This approach employs deep
neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and
multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle
diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input
reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the
applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision
the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning
addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging
federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across
decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on
the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential
vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and
testing phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder
at the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side,
highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against
potential multi-domain exploits. Overall, the joint and robust design of
task-oriented communications, semantic communications, and integrated sensing
and communications in a multi-task learning framework emerges as the key
enabler for context-aware, resource-efficient, and secure communications
ultimately needed in NextG network systems.

<p class="mathjax">The area of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is experiencing increased
implementation due to recent advancements in the AI (Artificial Intelligence)
industry. However, this spike has prompted concerns regarding AI defense
mechanisms, specifically regarding potential covert attacks from third-party
providers that cannot be entirely trusted. Recent research has uncovered that
auditory backdoors may use certain modifications as their initiating mechanism.
DynamicTrigger is introduced as a methodology for carrying out dynamic backdoor
attacks that use cleverly designed tweaks to ensure that corrupted samples are
indistinguishable from clean. By utilizing fluctuating signal sampling rates
and masking speaker identities through dynamic sound triggers (such as the
clapping of hands), it is possible to deceive speech recognition systems (ASR).
Our empirical testing demonstrates that DynamicTrigger is both potent and
stealthy, achieving impressive success rates during covert attacks while
maintaining exceptional accuracy with non-poisoned datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Data privacy and protection through anonymization is a critical issue for
network operators or data owners before it is forwarded for other possible use
of data. With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization
augments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information;
preventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable
to any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic
regardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of
actual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular
generative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which
disguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data.
In this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is
showcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of
performance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics. A well-known
algorithm, K-means outperforms other algorithms in terms of similarity
assessment of synthetic data over real data while achieving nearest scores
0.634, 23714.57, and 0.598 as Silhouette, Calinski and Harabasz and Davies
Bouldin metric respectively. On exploiting a comparative analysis in validation
scores among several algorithms, K-means forms the epitome of unsupervised
clustering algorithms ensuring explicit usage of synthetic data at the same
time a replacement for real data. Hence, the experimental results aim to show
the viability of using CTGAN-generated synthetic data in lieu of publishing
anonymized data to be utilized in various applications.

<p class="mathjax">Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep
neural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision
quantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical
representation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is
advocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous
bit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining
two-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal
bit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently, while ignoring the
considerable time costs in the second stage. However, retraining always
consumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs, thus hindering
deployment efficiency significantly. In this paper, we devise a one-shot
training-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression.
Specifically, in the first stage, all potential bit-width configurations are
coupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights.
However, our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width
interference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization,
leading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio.
To tackle this problem, we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically
freeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training, to ensure the
rest bit-widths converged properly. Then, taking inspiration from information
theory, we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the
behaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones.

<p class="mathjax">Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and
industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving
system. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a
single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to
driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles
(CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this
article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as
data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the
possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where
the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a
scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a
channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the
communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception
performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

<p class="mathjax">We propose DDN-SLAM, a real-time dense neural implicit semantic SLAM system
designed for dynamic scenes. While existing neural implicit SLAM systems
perform well in static scenes, they often encounter challenges in real-world
environments with dynamic interferences, leading to ineffective tracking and
mapping. DDN-SLAM utilizes the priors provided by the deep semantic system,
combined with conditional probability fields, for segmentation.By constructing
depth-guided static masks and employing joint multi-resolution hashing
encoding, we ensure fast hole filling and high-quality mapping while mitigating
the effects of dynamic information interference. To enhance tracking
robustness, we utilize sparse feature points validated with optical flow and
keyframes, enabling loop closure detection and global bundle optimization.
Furthermore, DDN-SLAM supports monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, operating
robustly at a frequency of 20-30Hz. Extensive experiments on 6 virtual/real
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
both dynamic and static scenes.

<p class="mathjax">Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as an effective method for
unsupervised image denoising. However, INR models are typically
overparameterized; consequently, these models are prone to overfitting during
learning, resulting in suboptimal results, even noisy ones. To tackle this
problem, we propose a general recipe for regularizing INR models in image
denoising. In detail, we propose to iteratively substitute the supervision
signal with the mean value derived from both the prediction and supervision
signal during the learning process. We theoretically prove that such a simple
iterative substitute can gradually enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the
supervision signal, thereby benefiting INR models during the learning process.
Our experimental results demonstrate that INR models can be effectively
regularized by the proposed approach, relieving overfitting and boosting image
denoising performance.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs), it remains
challenging to explain the predictions made by DNNs. Existing explanation
methods for DNNs mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another
explanatory model is employed to provide explanations. The fact that post-hoc
methods can fail to reveal the actual original reasoning process of DNNs raises
the need to build DNNs with built-in interpretability. Motivated by this, many
self-explaining neural networks have been proposed to generate not only
accurate predictions but also clear and intuitive insights into why a
particular decision was made. However, existing self-explaining networks are
limited in providing distribution-free uncertainty quantification for the two
simultaneously generated prediction outcomes (i.e., a sample's final prediction
and its corresponding explanations for interpreting that prediction).
Importantly, they also fail to establish a connection between the confidence
values assigned to the generated explanations in the interpretation layer and
those allocated to the final predictions in the ultimate prediction layer. To
tackle the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we design a novel
uncertainty modeling framework for self-explaining networks, which not only
demonstrates strong distribution-free uncertainty modeling performance for the
generated explanations in the interpretation layer but also excels in producing
efficient and effective prediction sets for the final predictions based on the
informative high-level basis explanations. We perform the theoretical analysis
for the proposed framework. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty framework.

<p class="mathjax">Point cloud completion is an indispensable task for recovering complete point
clouds due to incompleteness caused by occlusion, limited sensor resolution,
etc. The family of coarse-to-fine generation architectures has recently
exhibited great success in point cloud completion and gradually became
mainstream. In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these
methods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit
cross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that
efficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention
mechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can
capture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is
beneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior
methodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level
cross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their
combination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution
Transformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by
switching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into
one up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine
manner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with
stacked up-sampling blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several widely used
benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/EasyRy/CRA-PCN.

<p class="mathjax">Late fusion multi-view clustering (LFMVC) has become a rapidly growing class
of methods in the multi-view clustering (MVC) field, owing to its excellent
computational speed and clustering performance. One bottleneck faced by
existing late fusion methods is that they are usually aligned to the average
kernel function, which makes the clustering performance highly dependent on the
quality of datasets. Another problem is that they require subsequent k-means
clustering after obtaining the consensus partition matrix to get the final
discrete labels, and the resulting separation of the label learning and cluster
structure optimization processes limits the integrity of these models. To
address the above issues, we propose an integrated framework named One-Step
Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering with Compressed Subspace (OS-LFMVC-CS).
Specifically, we use the consensus subspace to align the partition matrix while
optimizing the partition fusion, and utilize the fused partition matrix to
guide the learning of discrete labels. A six-step iterative optimization
approach with verified convergence is proposed. Sufficient experiments on
multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) paradigm, an emerging research topic in
evolutionary computation, has been successfully applied in solving
high-dimensional feature selection (FS) problems recently. However, existing
EMT-based FS methods suffer from several limitations, such as a single mode of
multitask generation, conducting the same generic evolutionary search for all
tasks, relying on implicit transfer mechanisms through sole solution encodings,
and employing single-objective transformation, which result in inadequate
knowledge acquisition, exploitation, and transfer. To this end, this paper
develops a novel EMT framework for multiobjective high-dimensional feature
selection problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks
are constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search
spaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with
the original task through a multi-slover-based multitask optimization scheme.
Each task has an independent population with task-specific representations and
is solved using separate evolutionary solvers with different biases and search
preferences. A task-specific knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to
leverage the advantage information of each task, enabling the discovery and
effective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MO-FSEMT framework can
achieve overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FS
methods on 26 datasets. Moreover, the ablation studies verify the contributions
of different components of the proposed MO-FSEMT.

<p class="mathjax">We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While
most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or
independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the
semantic information desired by different receivers is different but
correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian
broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the
receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to
their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of
superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded
modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic
information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature
vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then
developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is
uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their
refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation.
Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with
coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM
outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition
structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation.
It also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one
receiver.

<p class="mathjax">We describe team ielab from CSIRO and The University of Queensland's approach
to the 2023 TREC Clinical Trials Track. Our approach was to use neural rankers
but to utilise Large Language Models to overcome the issue of lack of training
data for such rankers. Specifically, we employ ChatGPT to generate relevant
patient descriptions for randomly selected clinical trials from the corpus.
This synthetic dataset, combined with human-annotated training data from
previous years, is used to train both dense and sparse retrievers based on
PubmedBERT. Additionally, a cross-encoder re-ranker is integrated into the
system. To further enhance the effectiveness of our approach, we prompting
GPT-4 as a TREC annotator to provide judgments on our run files. These
judgments are subsequently employed to re-rank the results. This architecture
tightly integrates strong PubmedBERT-based rankers with the aid of SOTA Large
Language Models, demonstrating a new approach to clinical trial retrieval.

<p class="mathjax">Communication protocols form the bedrock of our interconnected world, yet
vulnerabilities within their implementations pose significant security threats.
Recent developments have seen a surge in fuzzing-based research dedicated to
uncovering these vulnerabilities within protocol implementations. However,
there still lacks a systematic overview of protocol fuzzing for answering the
essential questions such as what the unique challenges are, how existing works
solve them, etc. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation
of related works from both academia and industry. Our study includes a detailed
summary of the specific challenges in protocol fuzzing, and provides a
systematic categorization and overview of existing research efforts.
Furthermore, we explore and discuss potential future research directions in
protocol fuzzing. This survey serves as a foundational guideline for
researchers and practitioners in the field.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, many algorithms have employed image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs)
to achieve real-time image enhancement. Nonetheless, a prevailing trend among
existing methods has been the employment of linear combinations of basic LUTs
to formulate image-adaptive LUTs, which limits the generalization ability of
these methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named
AttentionLut for real-time image enhancement, which utilizes the attention
mechanism to generate image-adaptive LUTs. Our proposed framework consists of
three lightweight modules. We begin by employing the global image context
feature module to extract image-adaptive features. Subsequently, the attention
fusion module integrates the image feature with the priori attention feature
obtained during training to generate image-adaptive canonical polyadic tensors.
Finally, the canonical polyadic reconstruction module is deployed to
reconstruct image-adaptive residual 3DLUT, which is subsequently utilized for
enhancing input images. Experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better enhancement performance
quantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">In the domain of large-scale software development, the demands for dynamic
and multifaceted static code analysis exceed the capabilities of traditional
tools. To bridge this gap, we present CodeFuse-Query, a system that redefines
static code analysis through the fusion of Domain Optimized System Design and
Logic Oriented Computation Design.
<br />CodeFuse-Query reimagines code analysis as a data computation task, support
scanning over 10 billion lines of code daily and more than 300 different tasks.
It optimizes resource utilization, prioritizes data reusability, applies
incremental code extraction, and introduces tasks types specially for Code
Change, underscoring its domain-optimized design. The system's logic-oriented
facet employs Datalog, utilizing a unique two-tiered schema, COREF, to convert
source code into data facts. Through Godel, a distinctive language,
CodeFuse-Query enables formulation of complex tasks as logical expressions,
harnessing Datalog's declarative prowess.
<br />This paper provides empirical evidence of CodeFuse-Query's transformative
approach, demonstrating its robustness, scalability, and efficiency. We also
highlight its real-world impact and diverse applications, emphasizing its
potential to reshape the landscape of static code analysis in the context of
large-scale software development.Furthermore, in the spirit of collaboration

<p class="mathjax">Hallucinations are a type of output error produced by deep neural networks.
While this has been studied in natural language processing, they have not been
researched previously in automatic speech recognition. Here, we define
hallucinations in ASR as transcriptions generated by a model that are
semantically unrelated to the source utterance, yet still fluent and coherent.
The similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the
model creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system.
We show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot
differentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address
this, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility
of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time,
which does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this
method helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models
that have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the
relationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to
determine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs.
We devise a framework for identifying hallucinations by analysing their
semantic connection with the ground truth and their fluency. Finally, we
discover how to induce hallucinations with a random noise injection to the
utterance.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) visual geo-localization aims to match images of
the same geographic target captured from different views, i.e., the UAV view
and the satellite view. It is very challenging due to the large appearance
differences in UAV-satellite image pairs. Previous works map images captured by
UAVs and satellites to a shared feature space and employ a classification
framework to learn location-dependent features while neglecting the overall
distribution shift between the UAV view and the satellite view. In this paper,
we address these limitations by introducing distribution alignment of the two
views to shorten their distance in a common space. Specifically, we propose an
end-to-end network, called PVDA (Progressive View Distribution Alignment).
During training, feature encoder, location classifier, and view discriminator
are jointly optimized by a novel progressive adversarial learning strategy.
Competition between feature encoder and view discriminator prompts both of them
to be stronger. It turns out that the adversarial learning is progressively
emphasized until UAV-view images are indistinguishable from satellite-view
images. As a result, the proposed PVDA becomes powerful in learning
location-dependent yet view-invariant features with good scalability towards
unseen images of new locations. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed PVDA requires less inference time but has achieved superior
performance on the University-1652 dataset.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) visual
geo-localization, which aims to match images of the same geographic target
taken by different platforms, i.e., UAVs and satellites. In general, the key to
achieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual
features that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and
rotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV
visual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image
details and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the
importance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations
is not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive
semantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative
semantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are
learned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes
part-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features. By doing this,
the learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics.
Extensive experiments on the University-1652 dataset have shown the superiority
of our method over the current works.

people's concern about privacy and security. A new type of adversarial privacy
cloak (class-universal) can be applied to all the images of regular users, to
prevent malicious FR systems from acquiring their identity information. In this
work, we discover the optimization dilemma in the existing methods -- the local
optima problem in large-batch optimization and the gradient information
elimination problem in small-batch optimization. To solve these problems, we
propose Gradient Accumulation (GA) to aggregate multiple small-batch gradients

<p class="mathjax">Despite the recent remarkable achievement in gaze estimation, efficient and
accurate personalization of gaze estimation without labels is a practical
problem but rarely touched on in the literature. To achieve efficient
personalization, we take inspiration from the recent advances in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by updating a negligible number of parameters,
"prompts", at the test time. Specifically, the prompt is additionally attached
without perturbing original network and can contain less than 1% of a
ResNet-18's parameters. Our experiments show high efficiency of the prompt
tuning approach. The proposed one can be 10 times faster in terms of adaptation
speed than the methods compared. However, it is non-trivial to update the
prompt for personalized gaze estimation without labels. At the test time, it is
essential to ensure that the minimizing of particular unsupervised loss leads
to the goals of minimizing gaze estimation error. To address this difficulty,
we propose to meta-learn the prompt to ensure that its updates align with the
goal. Our experiments show that the meta-learned prompt can be effectively
adapted even with a simple symmetry loss. In addition, we experiment on four
cross-dataset validations to show the remarkable advantages of the proposed
method.

<p class="mathjax">Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a
spatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite
advancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object
appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the
text, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework,
context-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for

including instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering
visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and
instance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context
from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the
context. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each
decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning.
Particularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the
next stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative
object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which
conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving
localization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object
information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for
more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks,
including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in
m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy. The code will be
released at https://github.com/HengLan/CGSTVG.

<p class="mathjax">Sample efficiency is crucial in optimization, particularly in black-box
scenarios characterized by expensive evaluations and zeroth-order feedback.
When computing resources are plentiful, Bayesian optimization is often favored
over evolution strategies. In this paper, we introduce a full invariance
oriented evolution strategies algorithm, derived from its corresponding
framework, that effectively rivals the leading Bayesian optimization method in
tasks with dimensions at the upper limit of Bayesian capability. Specifically,
we first build the framework InvIGO that fully incorporates historical
information while retaining the full invariant and computational complexity. We
then exemplify InvIGO on multi-dimensional Gaussian, which gives an invariant
and scalable optimizer SynCMA . The theoretical behavior and advantages of our
algorithm over other Gaussian-based evolution strategies are further analyzed.
Finally, We benchmark SynCMA against leading algorithms in Bayesian
optimization and evolution strategies on various high dimension tasks, in
cluding Mujoco locomotion tasks, rover planning task and synthetic functions.
In all scenarios, SynCMA demonstrates great competence, if not dominance, over
other algorithms in sample efficiency, showing the underdeveloped potential of
property oriented evolution strategies.

<p class="mathjax">The development of multi-modal medical foundation models has attracted
significant attention in the field of medicine and healthcare due to their
promising prospects in various clinical applications. One area of focus in this
research direction is the extractions of features at different scales. While
previous studies have explored feature learning at individual scales,
investigation on integrating the diverse scales and modalities of information
is lacking, which may hinder the potential for mutual reinforcement among these
features. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method that
effectively exploits multi-scale and cross-modality information to enhance the
performance of medical foundation models. The proposed method simultaneously
exploit features at the local, instance, modality and global aspects,
facilitating comprehensive representation learning within the models. We
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six open-source datasets
across different clinical tasks, demonstrating its ability to enhance the
performance of medical foundation models.

<p class="mathjax">The elderly population is increasing rapidly around the world. There are no
enough caretakers for them. Use of AI-based in-home medical care systems is
gaining momentum due to this. Human fall detection is one of the most important
tasks of medical care system for the aged people. Human fall is a common
problem among elderly people. Detection of a fall and providing medical help as
early as possible is very important to reduce any further complexity. The
chances of death and other medical complications can be reduced by detecting
and providing medical help as early as possible after the fall. There are many
state-of-the-art fall detection techniques available these days, but the
majority of them need very high computing power. In this paper, we proposed a
lightweight and fast human fall detection system using pose estimation. We used
`Movenet' for human joins key-points extraction. Our proposed method can work
in real-time on any low-computing device with any basic camera. All computation
can be processed locally, so there is no problem of privacy of the subject. We
used two datasets `GMDCSA' and `URFD' for the experiment. We got the
sensitivity value of 0.9375 and 0.9167 for the dataset `GMDCSA' and `URFD'
respectively. The source code and the dataset GMDCSA of our work are available
online to access.

<p class="mathjax">Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud
computing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the
network's edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local
servers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data
processing, and extends the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) for
end-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary
components necessary for its deployment have presented additional security and
privacy concerns. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can cope
with excessively unpredictable and complex data, which offers a distinct
advantage in dealing with sophisticated and developing adversaries in the
security industry. Hence, in this paper we comprehensively provide a survey of
security and privacy in MEC from the perspective of AI. On the one hand, we use
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference
architecture as our based framework while merging the Software Defined Network
(SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to better illustrate a
serviceable platform of MEC. On the other hand, we focus on new security and
privacy issues, as well as potential solutions from the viewpoints of AI.
Finally, we comprehensively discuss the opportunities and challenges associated
with applying AI to MEC security and privacy as possible future research
directions.

<p class="mathjax">Existing contrastive language-image pre-training aims to learn a joint
representation by matching abundant image-text pairs. However, the number of
image-text pairs in medical datasets is usually orders of magnitude smaller
than that in natural datasets. Besides, medical image-text pairs often involve
numerous complex fine-grained correspondences. This paper aims to enhance the
data efficiency by introducing multiple-to-multiple local relationship modeling
to capture denser supervisions. More specifically, we propose a Medical
Language-Image Pre-training (MLIP) framework, which exploits the limited
image-text medical data more efficiently through patch-sentence matching.
Furthermore, we introduce a masked contrastive learning strategy with semantic
integrity estimation to reduce redundancy in images while preserving the
underlying semantics. Our evaluation results show that MLIP outperforms
previous work in zero/few-shot classification and few-shot segmentation tasks
by a large margin.

<p class="mathjax">In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is
critical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making.
Although medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of
research in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods,
overlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of
medical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This
work introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for
codemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce
the Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which
combines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This
integration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition,
providing a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named
MedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing
our MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information
from images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This
multimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also
promotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future
exploration in personalized and responsive medical care. Our dataset, code, and
pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption provides a promising
solution for reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency in
transportation systems. However, the increasing numbers of EVs pose significant
challenges to the electrical grids. In addition, the number of Distributed
Energy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to
meet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure.
Recently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from
DERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs.
Accommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution
systems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and
resilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the
critical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems
with grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency
in DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution
systems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and
algorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market
clearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain
technology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other
models from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the
policies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and
challenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs. A
roadmap for future research and sharing strategies is provided to guide
policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders toward a sustainable,
resilient, and efficient energy market by integrating P2P technology into EVCIs
and MGs.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new
classes based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones
encountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in
this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP)
and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with
Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP
for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential
methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its
adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific
knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting
old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach.
Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a
feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is
estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features
generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are
sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the
current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new
knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent
benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging
benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the
superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL. Code is

<p class="mathjax">The generalization error curve of certain kernel regression method aims at
determining the exact order of generalization error with various source
condition, noise level and choice of the regularization parameter rather than
the minimax rate. In this work, under mild assumptions, we rigorously provide a
full characterization of the generalization error curves of the kernel gradient
descent method (and a large class of analytic spectral algorithms) in kernel
regression. Consequently, we could sharpen the near inconsistency of kernel
interpolation and clarify the saturation effects of kernel regression
algorithms with higher qualification, etc. Thanks to the neural tangent kernel
theory, these results greatly improve our understanding of the generalization
behavior of training the wide neural networks. A novel technical contribution,
the analytic functional argument, might be of independent interest.

<p class="mathjax">Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in
understanding and interacting with natural language across various sectors.
However, their effectiveness is limited in specialized areas requiring high
accuracy, such as plant science, due to a lack of specific expertise in these
fields. This paper introduces PLLaMa, an open-source language model that
evolved from LLaMa-2. It's enhanced with a comprehensive database, comprising
more than 1.5 million scholarly articles in plant science. This development
significantly enriches PLLaMa with extensive knowledge and proficiency in plant
and agricultural sciences. Our initial tests, involving specific datasets
related to plants and agriculture, show that PLLaMa substantially improves its
understanding of plant science-related topics. Moreover, we have formed an
international panel of professionals, including plant scientists, agricultural
engineers, and plant breeders. This team plays a crucial role in verifying the
accuracy of PLLaMa's responses to various academic inquiries, ensuring its
effective and reliable application in the field. To support further research
and development, we have made the model's checkpoints and source codes
accessible to the scientific community. These resources are available for
download at \url{https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/PLLaMa}.

<p class="mathjax">Hierarchical beam search in mmWave communications incurs substantial training
overhead, necessitating deep learning-enabled beam predictions to effectively
leverage channel priors and mitigate this overhead. In this study, we introduce
a comprehensive probabilistic model of power distribution in beamspace, and
formulate the joint optimization problem of probing beam selection and
probabilistic beam prediction as an entropy minimization problem. Then, we
propose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem,
where a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional
power distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each
iteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes
the entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions
and the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a
two-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected
from a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and
predictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is
identified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power
values. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes
compared to hierarchical beam search and beam prediction with uniform probing
beams.

<p class="mathjax">The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially
GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries
of multimodal models beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual
question answering. In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V
as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to
complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent
that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting
on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to
standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online
evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live
websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it
can successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually
ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially
outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2)
specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a
major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting
turns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we
develop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals. Yet, there is
still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further
improvement.

<p class="mathjax">In order to correct the pair-errors generated during the transmission of
modern high-density data storage that the outputs of the channels consist of
overlapping pairs of symbols, a new coding scheme named symbol-pair code is
proposed. The error-correcting capability of the symbol-pair code is determined
by its minimum symbol-pair distance. For such codes, the larger the minimum
symbol-pair distance, the better. It is a challenging task to construct
symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially,
maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the
permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrixes

Turbo can perform risk stratification and predict post-operative outcome
measures using a description of the procedure and a patient's clinical notes
derived from the electronic health record. We examine predictive performance on
8 different tasks: prediction of ASA Physical Status Classification, hospital
admission, ICU admission, unplanned admission, hospital mortality, PACU Phase 1
duration, hospital duration, and ICU duration. Few-shot and chain-of-thought
prompting improves predictive performance for several of the tasks. We achieve
F1 scores of 0.50 for ASA Physical Status Classification, 0.81 for ICU

tasks were universally poor across all prompt strategies. Current generation
large language models can assist clinicians in perioperative risk
stratification on classification tasks and produce high-quality natural

<p class="mathjax">The prevalence of maximal extractable value (MEV) in the Ethereum ecosystem
has led to a characterization of the latter as a dark forest. Studies of MEV
have thus far largely been restricted to purely on-chain MEV, i.e., sandwich
attacks, cyclic arbitrage, and liquidations. In this work, we shed light on the
prevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the
Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price
differences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges
outside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other
blockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions
on and off the Ethereum blockchain.
<br />In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of
the volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October
2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV. We further highlight that
only eleven searchers are responsible for more than 80% of the identified
non-atomic arbitrage volume sitting at a staggering 137 billion US$ and draw a
connection between the centralization of the block construction market and
non-atomic arbitrage. Finally, we discuss the security implications of these
high-value transactions that account for more than 10% of Ethereum's total
block value and outline possible mitigations.

<p class="mathjax">Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation, but
its assessment remains a complex and often subjective endeavor. With the rise
of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for human
creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for its
responsible development and application. This paper addresses the complexities
in defining and evaluating creativity by introducing a new concept called
Relative Creativity. Instead of trying to define creativity universally, we
shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a
hypothetical human. This perspective draws inspiration from the Turing Test,
expanding upon it to address the challenges and subjectivities inherent in
evaluating creativity. This methodological shift facilitates a statistically
quantifiable evaluation of AI's creativity, which we term Statistical
Creativity. This approach allows for direct comparisons of AI's creative
abilities with those of specific human groups. Building on this foundation, we
discuss the application of statistical creativity in contemporary
prompt-conditioned autoregressive models. In addition to defining and analyzing
a measure of creativity, we introduce an actionable training guideline,
effectively bridging the gap between theoretical quantification of creativity
and practical model training. Through these multifaceted contributions, the
paper establishes a cohesive, continuously evolving, and transformative
framework for assessing and fostering statistical creativity in AI models.

<p class="mathjax">RGB-T semantic segmentation is a key technique for autonomous driving scenes
understanding. For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however,
the effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different
modalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple
levels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network
(CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs
interaction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly
guided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary
Reasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship
between multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and
channel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual
and detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module
and Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary
supervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the
segmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and
PST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YingLv1106/CAINet.

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose
behaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally,
network data contains information about relationships between entities, and the
anomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to
comprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major
focus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily
assumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon
obliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal
entities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by
anomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive
learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks,
\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and
provide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by
introducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments
are conducted on five benchmark real-world datasets and the results show that
SCALA consistently outperforms all baseline methods significantly.

<p class="mathjax">The study of Graph Neural Networks has received considerable interest in the
past few years. By extending deep learning to graph-structured data, GNNs can
solve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and
medicine. The development of GNN architectures has largely been focused on
improving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification.
However, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures
that have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power
and designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.
<br />While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a
GNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the
most natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of
GNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another
direction focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different
graph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's
ability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as
another form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are
complementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture
choices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of
"expressive power" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the
design choices of GNNs.

<p class="mathjax">The Polynomial-Time Hierarchy ($\mathsf{PH}$) is a staple of classical
complexity theory, with applications spanning randomized computation to circuit
lower bounds to ''quantum advantage'' analyses for near-term quantum computers.
Quantumly, however, despite the fact that at least \emph{four} definitions of
quantum $\mathsf{PH}$ exist, it has been challenging to prove analogues for
these of even basic facts from $\mathsf{PH}$. This work studies three
quantum-verifier based generalizations of $\mathsf{PH}$, two of which are from
[Gharibian, Santha, Sikora, Sundaram, Yirka, 2022] and use classical strings
($\mathsf{QCPH}$) and quantum mixed states ($\mathsf{QPH}$) as proofs, and one
of which is new to this work, utilizing quantum pure states
($\mathsf{pureQPH}$) as proofs. We first resolve several open problems from
[GSSSY22], including a collapse theorem and a Karp-Lipton theorem for
$\mathsf{QCPH}$. Then, for our new class $\mathsf{pureQPH}$, we show one-sided
error reduction for $\mathsf{pureQPH}$, as well as the first bounds relating
these quantum variants of $\mathsf{PH}$, namely $\mathsf{QCPH}\subseteq
\mathsf{pureQPH} \subseteq \mathsf{EXP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless communication highly depends on the cellular ground base station
(GBS). A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or
man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas.
In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save
the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the
PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services
in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations
(UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible,
mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted
PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's
ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV.
The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the
video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by
optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the
distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power,
while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate,
rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To
this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is
mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge
for a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex
approximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed.
Finally, simulation results are provided which show that our proposed approach
outperforms the existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Social media advertisements are key for brand marketing, aiming to attract
consumers with captivating captions and pictures or logos. While previous
research has focused on generating captions for general images, incorporating
brand personalities into social media captioning remains unexplored. Brand
personalities are shown to be affecting consumers' behaviours and social
interactions and thus are proven to be a key aspect of marketing strategies.
Current open-source multimodal LLMs are not directly suited for this task.
Hence, we propose a pipeline solution to assist brands in creating engaging
social media captions that align with the image and the brand personalities.
Our architecture is based on two parts: a the first part contains an image
captioning model that takes in an image that the brand wants to post online and
gives a plain English caption; b the second part takes in the generated caption
along with the target brand personality and outputs a catchy
personality-aligned social media caption. Along with brand personality, our
system also gives users the flexibility to provide hashtags, Instagram handles,
URLs, and named entities they want the caption to contain, making the captions
more semantically related to the social media handles. Comparative evaluations
against various baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become the de facto training paradigm of
large models where pre-training is followed by supervised fine-tuning using
domain-specific data and labels. Hypothesizing that SSL models would learn more
generic, hence less biased, representations, this study explores the impact of
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies on fairness (i.e., performing equally
on different demographic breakdowns). Motivated by human-centric applications
on real-world timeseries data, we interpret inductive biases on the model,
layer, and metric levels by systematically comparing SSL models to their
supervised counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that SSL has the capacity to
achieve performance on par with supervised methods while significantly
enhancing fairness--exhibiting up to a 27% increase in fairness with a mere 1%
loss in performance through self-supervision. Ultimately, this work underscores
SSL's potential in human-centric computing, particularly high-stakes,
data-scarce application domains like healthcare.

<p class="mathjax">Machine learning models underpin many modern financial systems for use cases
such as fraud detection and churn prediction. Most are based on supervised
learning with hand-engineered features, which relies heavily on the
availability of labelled data. Large self-supervised generative models have
shown tremendous success in natural language processing and computer vision,
yet so far they haven't been adapted to multivariate time series of financial
transactions. In this paper, we present a generative pretraining method that
can be used to obtain contextualised embeddings of financial transactions.
Benchmarks on public datasets demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised methods on a range of downstream tasks. We additionally perform
large-scale pretraining of an embedding model using a corpus of data from 180
issuing banks containing 5.1 billion transactions and apply it to the card
fraud detection problem on hold-out datasets. The embedding model significantly
improves value detection rate at high precision thresholds and transfers well
to out-of-domain distributions.

<p class="mathjax">Perceiving the complete shape of occluded objects is essential for human and
machine intelligence. While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the
complete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and
labor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks.
Box-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying
solely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision,
thereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations.
Nevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in
generating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the
demands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to
tackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible
masks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end
network based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances
intersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions
and non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the
expansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity
loss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks
and facilitates accurate amodal segmentation. Experiments are conducted on
several challenging datasets and the results show that our proposed method can
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods with large margins.

<p class="mathjax">Stereo matching and semantic segmentation are significant tasks in binocular
satellite 3D reconstruction. However, previous studies primarily view these as
independent parallel tasks, lacking an integrated multitask learning framework.
This work introduces a solution, the Single-branch Semantic Stereo Network
(S3Net), which innovatively combines semantic segmentation and stereo matching
using Self-Fuse and Mutual-Fuse modules. Unlike preceding methods that utilize
semantic or disparity information independently, our method dentifies and
leverages the intrinsic link between these two tasks, leading to a more
accurate understanding of semantic information and disparity estimation.
Comparative testing on the US3D dataset proves the effectiveness of our S3Net.
Our model improves the mIoU in semantic segmentation from 61.38 to 67.39, and
reduces the D1-Error and average endpoint error (EPE) in disparity estimation
from 10.051 to 9.579 and 1.439 to 1.403 respectively, surpassing existing
competitive methods. Our codes are available at:https://github.com/CVEO/S3Net.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction,
especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite
advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive
redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and
compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated
information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images
(WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic
data, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy" issue. (2) Duplicated information
among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes
modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an
``inter-modal redundancy" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework,
Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of
Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and
Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal
redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed
to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk
levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within
modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct
components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance
of the joint prototypical distribution. Extensive experiments on five cancer
benchmark datasets demonstrated our superiority over other methods.

<p class="mathjax">Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements
in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most
generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing
existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel
approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated
object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency
across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find
that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to
generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single
views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of
modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on
the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated
image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the
image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the
edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.

<p class="mathjax">Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from
a source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the source data is
unavailable during adaptation. Existing approaches for SFDA focus on
self-training usually including well-established entropy minimization and
pseudo-labeling techniques. Recent work suggested a co-learning strategy to
improve the quality of the generated target pseudo-labels using robust
pretrained networks such as Swin-B. However, since the generated pseudo-labels
depend on the source model, they may be noisy due to domain shift. In this
paper, we view SFDA from the perspective of label noise learning and learn to
de-confuse the pseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition
matrix of the pseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and
learn the underlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition
matrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation results with better
prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach applied
with several SFDA methods: SHOT, SHOT++, and AaD. We obtain state-of-the-art
results on three domain adaptation datasets: VisDA, DomainNet, and OfficeHome.

<p class="mathjax">The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is
witnessing rapid advancements, particularly in video generation. This paper
introduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark
designed to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus
on Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of
existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including
a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different
state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text
combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate
images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation
framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics
spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are
control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video
quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free,
ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed
correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive
experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.
AIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks
for the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework
for future assessments of video generation tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In mobile networks, Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a framework for
implementing network slicing that interacts with the resources at the lower
layers. Both monitoring and Radio Access Network (RAN) control is feasible for
both 4G and 5G systems. In this work, we consider how data-driven resource
allocation in a 4G context can enable adaptive slice allocation to steer the
experienced latency of Virtual Reality (VR) traffic towards a requested
latency. We develop an xApp for the near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller
(RIC) that embeds a heuristic algorithm for latency control, aiming to: (1)
maintain latency of a VR stream around a requested value; and (2) improve the
available RAN allocation to offer higher bit rate to another user. We have
experimentally demonstrated the proposed approach in an ORAN testbed. Our
results show that the data-driven approach can dynamically follow the variation
of the traffic load while satisfying the required latency. This results in
15.8% more resources to secondary users than a latency-equivalent static
allocation.

<p class="mathjax">E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several
organic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view
request. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes,
directly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV).
Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the
corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of
the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the
ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad
auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual
display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad
allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the
display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC)
for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the
traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases
its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement
cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve
higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often
focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may
result in suboptimal outcomes...

<p class="mathjax">The back-end module of Distributed Collaborative Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (DCSLAM) requires solving a nonlinear Pose Graph Optimization (PGO)
under a distributed setting, also known as SE(d)-synchronization. Most existing
distributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential
partitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to
the different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra
communication load. Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian
optimization algorithms can be further accelerated. In this letter, we propose
a novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level
partitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method. Firstly, we
employ the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive
pose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem. In addition, inspired
by the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian
Block Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is
globally optimal. Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph
partitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover
that the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance. Also, we
implement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols.

<p class="mathjax">Object detection models represented by YOLO series have been widely used and
have achieved great results on the high quality datasets, but not all the
working conditions are ideal. To settle down the problem of locating targets on
low quality datasets, the existing methods either train a new object detection
network, or need a large collection of low-quality datasets to train. However,
we propose a framework in this paper and apply it on the YOLO models called
DiffYOLO. Specifically, we extract feature maps from the denoising diffusion
probabilistic models to enhance the well-trained models, which allows us
fine-tune YOLO on high-quality datasets and test on low-quality datasets. The
results proved this framework can not only prove the performance on noisy
datasets, but also prove the detection results on high-quality test datasets.
We will supplement more experiments later (with various datasets and network
architectures).

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) plays a crucial role in the
noninvasive investigation of tissue microstructural properties and structural
connectivity in the \textit{in vivo} human brain. However, to effectively
capture the intricate characteristics of water diffusion at various directions
and scales, it is important to employ comprehensive q-space sampling.
Unfortunately, this requirement leads to long scan times, limiting the clinical
applicability of dMRI. To address this challenge, we propose SSOR, a
Simultaneous q-Space sampling Optimization and Reconstruction framework. We
jointly optimize a subset of q-space samples using a continuous representation
of spherical harmonic functions and a reconstruction network. Additionally, we
integrate the unique properties of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
in both the q-space and image domains by applying $l1$-norm and total-variation
regularization. The experiments conducted on HCP data demonstrate that SSOR has
promising strengths both quantitatively and qualitatively and exhibits
robustness to noise.

<p class="mathjax">Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers various services to users
through content creation, which is believed to be one of the most important
components in future networks. However, training and deploying big artificial
intelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and
communication overhead.This poses a critical challenge to centralized
approaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and
the reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud
services. Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services,
partly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI
services to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences. In this
paper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big
cloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework
and a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI
services. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence,
enhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden.
The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an image
generation use case. Finally, we outline fundamental research directions to
fully exploit the collaborative potential of edge and cloud for native GenAI
and BAIM applications.

<p class="mathjax">While Transformer-based pre-trained language models and their variants
exhibit strong semantic representation capabilities, the question of
comprehending the information gain derived from the additional components of
PLMs remains an open question in this field. Motivated by recent efforts that
prove Multilayer-Perceptrons (MLPs) modules achieving robust structural capture
capabilities, even outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this paper aims
to quantify whether simple MLPs can further enhance the already potent ability
of PLMs to capture linguistic information. Specifically, we design a simple yet
effective probing framework containing MLPs components based on BERT structure
and conduct extensive experiments encompassing 10 probing tasks spanning three
distinct linguistic levels. The experimental results demonstrate that MLPs can
indeed enhance the comprehension of linguistic structure by PLMs. Our research
provides interpretable and valuable insights into crafting variations of PLMs
utilizing MLPs for tasks that emphasize diverse linguistic structures.

<p class="mathjax">In extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems for
future sixth-generation (6G) communications, codebook-based beam training
stands out as a promising technology to acquire channel state information
(CSI). Despite their effectiveness, when the pilot overhead is limited,
existing beam training methods suffer from significant achievable rate
degradation for remote users with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To tackle
this challenge, leverging the error-correcting capability of channel codes, we
introduce channel coding theory into hierarchical beam training to extend the
coverage area. Specifically, we establish the duality between hierarchical beam
training and channel coding, and the proposed coded beam training scheme serves
as a general framework. Then, we present two specific implementations
exemplified by coded beam training methods based on Hamming codes and
convolutional codes, during which the beam encoding and decoding processes are
refined respectively to better accommodate to the beam training problem.
Simulation results have demonstrated that, the proposed coded beam training
method can enable reliable beam training performance for remote users with low
SNR, while keeping training overhead low.

<p class="mathjax">Many RGBT tracking researches primarily focus on modal fusion design, while
overlooking the effective handling of target appearance changes. While some
approaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial
templates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting
the original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate
these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which
mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates
and multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance
changes, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template
tokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to
address appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial
static template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the
preservation of the original reliable target appearance information that
prevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal
updates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of
multimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make
the multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template
tokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of
multimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the
transformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction,
search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on
three RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains
competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms
while running at 39.1 FPS.

<p class="mathjax">In the last years, social media has gained an unprecedented amount of
attention, playing a pivotal role in shaping the contemporary landscape of
communication and connection. However, Coordinated Inhautentic Behaviour (CIB),
defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about
their identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online
discourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a
general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a
directed tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy
post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration
influence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on Twitter to
compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that,
according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of
their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role
than expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two
separate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.

<p class="mathjax">Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames
are critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current
top-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships
between reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can
only interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited
temporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple,
flexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \textbf{ODTrack},
which densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an
online token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary
length to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance,
and compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a
target into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new
solution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can
serve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past
information is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online
update strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token
sequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and
computation. ODTrack achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance on seven
benchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at
\url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning algorithms are often said to be data hungry. The performance of
such algorithms generally improve as more and more annotated data is fed into
the model. While collecting unlabelled data is easier (as they can be scraped
easily from the internet), annotating them is a tedious and expensive task.
Given a fixed budget available for data annotation, Active Learning helps
selecting the best subset of data for annotation, such that the deep learning
model when trained over that subset will have maximum generalization
performance under this budget. In this work, we aim to propose a new Active
Learning approach which is model agnostic as well as one doesn't require an
iterative process. We aim to leverage self-supervised learnt features for the
task of Active Learning. The benefit of self-supervised learning, is that one
can get useful feature representation of the input data, without having any
annotation.

<p class="mathjax">Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves
to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due
to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from
external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging
three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge
rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language
model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification
(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from
student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML
and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast
to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered
features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three
approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'
challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,
although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to
issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of
learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity
evaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion
on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible
and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI). Nevertheless, existing methods tend to suffer from Rician noise
and detail loss in reconstructing the DTI-derived parametric maps especially
when sparsely sampled q-space data are used. This paper proposes a novel
method, AID-DTI (Accelerating hIgh fiDelity Diffusion Tensor Imaging), to
facilitate fast and accurate DTI with only six measurements. AID-DTI is
equipped with a newly designed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based
regularizer, which can effectively capture fine details while suppressing noise
during network training. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project (HCP)
data consistently demonstrate that the proposed method estimates DTI parameter
maps with fine-grained details and outperforms three state-of-the-art methods
both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p class="mathjax">Language similarities can be caused by genetic relatedness, areal contact,
universality, or chance. Colexification, i.e.~a type of similarity where a
single lexical form is used to convey multiple meanings, is underexplored. In
our work, we shed light on the linguistic causes of cross-lingual similarity in
colexification and phonology, by exploring genealogical stability (persistence)
and contact-induced change (diffusibility). We construct large-scale graphs
incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for
1,966 languages. We then show the potential of this resource, by investigating
several established hypotheses from previous work in linguistics, while
proposing new ones. Our results strongly support a previously established
hypothesis in the linguistic literature, while offering contradicting evidence
to another. Our large scale resource opens for further research across
disciplines, e.g.~in multilingual NLP and comparative linguistics.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces the WordArt Designer API, a novel framework for
user-driven artistic typography synthesis utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ModelScope. We address the challenge of simplifying artistic
typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and
computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our
approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input,
facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various
case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and
functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and
creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements
in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing
systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography
but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and
design.

<p class="mathjax">Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available
source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.
However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within
a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing
APIs. Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or
produce variants of already existing code. Although the API information is
available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion
techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. This paper
presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds
the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable
API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable
context information in the prompt. The approach exploits the observation that
LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails
to correctly refer to already existing APIs. De-Hallucinator automatically
identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to
the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. Our
evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in
open-source Python projects. We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves
the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the
model only with the code before the cursor. In particular, the approach
improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of
correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.

<p class="mathjax">We present Image Sculpting, a new framework for editing 2D images by
incorporating tools from 3D geometry and graphics. This approach differs
markedly from existing methods, which are confined to 2D spaces and typically
rely on textual instructions, leading to ambiguity and limited control. Image
Sculpting converts 2D objects into 3D, enabling direct interaction with their
3D geometry. Post-editing, these objects are re-rendered into 2D, merging into
the original image to produce high-fidelity results through a coarse-to-fine
enhancement process. The framework supports precise, quantifiable, and
physically-plausible editing options such as pose editing, rotation,
translation, 3D composition, carving, and serial addition. It marks an initial
step towards combining the creative freedom of generative models with the
precision of graphics pipelines.

<p class="mathjax">Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
security of neural networks. Existing works have leveraged the fact that
In-distribution (ID) samples form a subspace in the feature space, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, the comprehensive characteristics
of the ID subspace still leave under-explored. Recently, the discovery of
Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) sheds light on novel properties of the ID
subspace. Leveraging insight from $\mathcal{NC}$, we observe that the Principal
Angle between the features and the ID feature subspace forms a superior
representation for measuring the likelihood of OOD. Building upon this
observation, we propose a novel $\mathcal{NC}$-inspired OOD scoring function,
named Entropy-enhanced Principal Angle (EPA), which integrates both the global
characteristic of the ID subspace and its inner property. We experimentally
compare EPA with various SOTA approaches, validating its superior performance
and robustness across different network architectures and OOD datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Conversational question answering systems often rely on semantic parsing to
enable interactive information retrieval, which involves the generation of
structured database queries from a natural language input. For
information-seeking conversations about facts stored within a knowledge graph,
dialogue utterances are transformed into graph queries in a process that is
called knowledge-based conversational question answering. This paper evaluates
the performance of large language models that have not been explicitly
pre-trained on this task. Through a series of experiments on an extensive
benchmark dataset, we compare models of varying sizes with different prompting
techniques and identify common issue types in the generated output. Our results
demonstrate that large language models are capable of generating graph queries
from dialogues, with significant improvements achievable through few-shot
prompting and fine-tuning techniques, especially for smaller models that
exhibit lower zero-shot performance.

<p class="mathjax">Monitoring cameras are extensively utilized in industrial production to
monitor equipment running. With advancements in computer vision, device
recognition using image features is viable. This paper presents a
vision-assisted identification system that implements real-time automatic
equipment labeling through image matching in surveillance videos. The system
deploys the ORB algorithm to extract image features and the GMS algorithm to
remove incorrect matching points. According to the principles of clustering and
template locality, a method known as Local Adaptive Clustering (LAC) has been
established to enhance label positioning. This method segments matching
templates using the cluster center, which improves the efficiency and stability
of labels. The experimental results demonstrate that LAC effectively curtails
the label drift.

<p class="mathjax">Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based solutions are
well-established for limited feedback schemes in frequency division duplex
(FDD) systems. In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve
higher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the
propagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a
versatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was
recently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits
low complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility
concerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment
knowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for
online inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders
using either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A
major shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is
only evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to
fully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the
question of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world
measurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based
solution. Our experiments reveal that the GMM-based feedback scheme
tremendously improves the system performance measured in terms of sum-rate,
allowing to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.

<p class="mathjax">This overview is devoted to splitting methods, a class of numerical
integrators intended for differential equations that can be subdivided into
different problems easier to solve than the original system. Closely connected
with this class of integrators are composition methods, in which one or several
low-order schemes are composed to construct higher-order numerical
approximations to the exact solution. We analyze in detail the order conditions
that have to be satisfied by these classes of methods to achieve a given order,
and provide some insight about their qualitative properties in connection with
geometric numerical integration and the treatment of highly oscillatory
problems. Since splitting methods have received considerable attention in the
realm of partial differential equations, we also cover this subject in the
present survey, with special attention to parabolic equations and their
problems. An exhaustive list of methods of different orders is collected and
tested on simple examples. Finally, some applications of splitting methods in
different areas, ranging from celestial mechanics to statistics, are also
provided.

<p class="mathjax">JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of
transmitted images. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information
loss, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the
subsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision
models trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when
dealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. Numerous
learning-based JPEG artifact removal methods have been proposed to handle
visual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifact
removal methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the
following reasons: 1. These methods are designed for human vision rather than
high-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as
pre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of
pre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a
FDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next,
the estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping
relationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features.
A simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural
re-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature
representation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the
deployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module
can serve as a "plug-and-play" model for pre-trained classification models to
improve their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that
our proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the
pre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Modern deep learning models, growing larger and more complex, have
demonstrated exceptional generalization and accuracy due to training on huge
datasets. This trend is expected to continue. However, the increasing size of
these models poses challenges in training, as traditional centralized methods
are limited by memory constraints at such scales. This paper proposes an
asynchronous decentralized training paradigm for large modern deep learning
models that harnesses the compute power of regular heterogeneous PCs with
limited resources connected across the internet to achieve favourable
performance metrics. Ravnest facilitates decentralized training by efficiently
organizing compute nodes into clusters with similar data transfer rates and
compute capabilities, without necessitating that each node hosts the entire
model. These clusters engage in $\textit{Zero-Bubble Asynchronous Model
Parallel}$ training, and a $\textit{Parallel Multi-Ring All-Reduce}$ method is
employed to effectively execute global parameter averaging across all clusters.
We have framed our asynchronous SGD loss function as a block structured
optimization problem with delayed updates and derived an optimal convergence
rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$. We further discuss linear speedup
with respect to the number of participating clusters and the bound on the
staleness parameter.

<p class="mathjax">Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique is found to be an excellent
candidate for bio-sensing and food quality monitoring applications due to its
rapid, robust, cost-effective and point-of-care approach. The present research
work investigates the implementation of EIS technique supported by several
optical spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) and
Fourier Transform Mid Infrared (FT-MIR) to detect and quantify several toxic
adulterants in foods and bio-consumables. A comprehensive understanding on the
background theory related to the study has been developed to analyze the
overall polarization of the system and the effect of frequency on complex
permittivity of such system have been observed. In the current work, the
technique is applied to adulterated saccharides, honey and turmeric samples
through a prototype sensing device. All the corresponding measurements have
been performed by dipping a custom-made parallel plate conductivity cell with
unity cell constant inside the solution under test. EIS study exhibited a
steady variation of electrical parameters such as impedance, capacitance,
conductance and current values with increasing adulterant percentage in the
solution. Variation in such properties due to adulteration provides a
systematic sensor plot through which one can determine their percentage of
adulteration in unknown adulterated samples. Co-efficient of sensitivity has
been extracted from the EIS data for adulteration study in terms of one of the
measured parameters. The results of UV-Vis and FT-MIR studies have been used
for comparative analyses which corroborate with the EIS results, wherever
applicable.

<p class="mathjax">The recovery of 3D human mesh from monocular images has significantly been
developed in recent years. However, existing models usually ignore spatial and
temporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and
temporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal
Alignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence
clues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module
(TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local
information through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the
spatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment
Fusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame.
In addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow
the model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target
frame. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results
from video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the
superiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision
and smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page

<p class="mathjax">Leakages are a major risk in water distribution networks as they cause water
loss and increase contamination risks. Leakage detection is a difficult task
due to the complex dynamics of water distribution networks. In particular,
small leakages are hard to detect. From a machine-learning perspective,
leakages can be modeled as concept drift. Thus, a wide variety of drift
detection schemes seems to be a suitable choice for detecting leakages. In this
work, we explore the potential of model-loss-based and distribution-based drift
detection methods to tackle leakage detection. We additionally discuss the
issue of temporal dependencies in the data and propose a way to cope with it
when applying distribution-based detection. We evaluate different methods
systematically for leakages of different sizes and detection times.
Additionally, we propose a first drift-detection-based technique for localizing
leakages.

<p class="mathjax">Assistive robots should be able to wash, fold or iron clothes. However, due
to the variety, deformability and self-occlusions of clothes, creating
general-purpose robot systems for cloth manipulation is challenging. Synthetic
data is a promising direction to improve generalization, though its usability
is often limited by the sim-to-real gap. To advance the use of synthetic data
for cloth manipulation and to enable tasks such as robotic folding, we present
a synthetic data pipeline to train keypoint detectors for almost flattened
cloth items. To test its performance, we have also collected a real-world
dataset. We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an
average precision of 64.3%. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance
to 74.2%. Additional insight is provided by discussing various failure modes of
the keypoint detectors and by comparing different approaches to obtain cloth
meshes and materials. We also quantify the remaining sim-to-real gap and argue
that further improvements to the fidelity of cloth assets will be required to
further reduce this gap. The code, dataset and trained models are available
online.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for
general-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are
capable of playing various types of economics games. Following these works, to
overcome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose
to explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate
multi-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history
revealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that
they play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as
indicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available,
certain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies,
which suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the
meantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are
available, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability
with respect to the strategies of other players. Throughout all our
experiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules
described by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested. In this
work, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a
dynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e.
rationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal (vision-language) models, such as CLIP, are replacing traditional
supervised pre-training models (e.g., ImageNet-based pre-training) as the new
generation of visual foundation models. These models with robust and aligned
semantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and
can be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in
some fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the
performance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired.
Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation
methods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches:
1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external
knowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has
produced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically
organize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and
analyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for
multi-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups,
and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of
reliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot
adaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem
reveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is
constrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size.
Based on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects:
1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive
knowledge utilization.

<p class="mathjax">Benefitting from the vast spatial degrees of freedom, the amalgamation of
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) is expected to simultaneously improve spectral and
energy efficiencies as well as the sensing capability. However, a large number
of antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in
acquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter
information. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we
first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel
tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target
sensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional
communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we
associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets
in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared
training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the
channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a
canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical
expression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the
tensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing
the specific Vandermonde

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a new type of soft continuum robot, called SCoReS,
which is capable of self-controlling continuously its curvature at the segment
level; in contrast to previous designs which either require external forces or
machine elements, or whose variable curvature capabilities are discrete --
depending on the number of locking mechanisms and segments. The ability to have
a variable curvature, whose control is continuous and independent from external
factors, makes a soft continuum robot more adaptive in constrained
environments, similar to what is observed in nature in the elephant's trunk or
ostrich's neck for instance which exhibit multiple curvatures. To this end, our
soft continuum robot enables reconfigurable variable curvatures utilizing a
variable stiffness growing spine based on micro-particle granular jamming for
the first time. We detail the design of the proposed robot, presenting its
modeling through beam theory and FEA simulation -- which is validated through
experiments. The robot's versatile bending profiles are then explored in
experiments and an application to grasp fruits at different configurations is
demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">Fully explicit stabilized multirate (mRKC) methods are well-suited for the
numerical solution of large multiscale systems of stiff ordinary differential
equations thanks to their improved stability properties. To demonstrate their
efficiency for the numerical solution of stiff, multiscale, nonlinear parabolic
PDE's, we apply mRKC methods to the monodomain equation from cardiac
electrophysiology. In doing so, we propose an improved version, specifically
tailored to the monodomain model, which leads to the explicit exponential
multirate stabilized (emRKC) method. Several numerical experiments are
conducted to evaluate the efficiency of both mRKC and emRKC, while taking into
account different finite element meshes (structured and unstructured) and
realistic ionic models. The new emRKC method typically outperforms a standard
implicit-explicit baseline method for cardiac electrophysiology. Code profiling
and strong scalability results further demonstrate that emRKC is faster and
inherently parallel without sacrificing accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Images generated by most of generative models trained with limited data often
exhibit deficiencies in either fidelity, diversity, or both. One effective
solution to address the limitation is few-shot generative model adaption.
However, the type of approaches typically rely on a large-scale pre-trained
model, serving as a source domain, to facilitate information transfer to the
target domain. In this paper, we propose a method called Information Transfer
from the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), which contains two module: Feature
Augmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS); Interpolation and Regularization
(I\&amp;R). With the FAGS module, a pseudo-source domain is created by projecting
image features from the training dataset into the Pre-Shape Space, subsequently
generating new features on the Geodesic surface. Thus, no pre-trained models is
needed for the adaption process during the training of generative models with
FAGS. I\&amp;R module are introduced for supervising the interpolated images and
regularizing their relative distances, respectively, to further enhance the
quality of generated images. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments,
we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves optimal or
comparable results across a diverse range of semantically distinct datasets,
even in extremely few-shot scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">The attention mechanism has been proven effective on various visual tasks in
recent years. In the semantic segmentation task, the attention mechanism is
applied in various methods, including the case of both Convolution Neural
Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbones. However, we observe
that the attention mechanism is vulnerable to patch-based adversarial attacks.
Through the analysis of the effective receptive field, we attribute it to the
fact that the wide receptive field brought by global attention may lead to the
spread of the adversarial patch. To address this issue, in this paper, we
propose a Robust Attention Mechanism (RAM) to improve the robustness of the
semantic segmentation model, which can notably relieve the vulnerability
against patch-based attacks. Compared to the vallina attention mechanism, RAM
introduces two novel modules called Max Attention Suppression and Random
Attention Dropout, both of which aim to refine the attention matrix and limit
the influence of a single adversarial patch on the semantic segmentation
results of other positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our RAM to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation models against
various patch-based attack methods under different attack settings.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become
mainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model
has received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to
prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness,
which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new
challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for
adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial
robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop
the novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before
the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in
parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms.
<br />Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA-AT framework by integrating the
learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while
keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model
robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner.
<br />Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed FullLoRA-AT framework. It achieves comparable
robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5% of the learnable
parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model
storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.

very noisy, and therefore increase toil on developers. The next step -
modifying code itself - to automatically remediate a detection, is a complex

incremental synthesis due to their fully parallel architecture such as
transformer. In this work, we propose Incremental FastPitch, a novel FastPitch
variant capable of incrementally producing high-quality Mel chunks by improving
the architecture with chunk-based FFT blocks, training with receptive-field

<p class="mathjax">Many researchers around the world are researching to get control solutions
that enhance robots' ability to navigate in dynamic environments autonomously.
However, until these days robots have limited capability and many navigation
tasks on Earth and other planets have been difficult so far. This paperwork
presents the development of a control system for a differential drive-wheeled
mobile robot that autonomously controls its position, heading, and speed based
on destination information given and surrounding data gathered through mounted
proximity and GPS sensors. The intelligence of this control system is
implemented by using a fuzzy logic algorithm which is a very powerful tool to
handle un-modeled systems like the dynamically changing environment dealt with
in this research. The fuzzy controller is used to address the problems
associated with navigation in an obstacle-strewn environment. Such issues
include position estimation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. In this

<p class="mathjax">With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on
social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual
information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual
information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making
multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal
rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source
claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors
and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the
wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these
methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider
tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we
propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor
detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the
crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the
textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three
datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and
outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-target stance detection (CTSD) is an important task, which infers the
attitude of the destination target by utilizing annotated data derived from the
source target. One important approach in CTSD is to extract domain-invariant
features to bridge the knowledge gap between multiple targets. However, the
analysis of informal and short text structure, and implicit expressions,
complicate the extraction of domain-invariant knowledge. In this paper, we
propose a Multi-Perspective Prompt-Tuning (MPPT) model for CTSD that uses the
analysis perspective as a bridge to transfer knowledge. First, we develop a
two-stage instruct-based chain-of-thought method (TsCoT) to elicit target
analysis perspectives and provide natural language explanations (NLEs) from
multiple viewpoints by formulating instructions based on large language model
(LLM). Second, we propose a multi-perspective prompt-tuning framework
(MultiPLN) to fuse the NLEs into the stance predictor. Extensive experiments
results demonstrate the superiority of MPPT against the state-of-the-art
baseline methods.

<p class="mathjax">The so-called independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) has demonstrated a
great potential for dealing with the problem of determined blind source
separation (BSS) for audio and speech signals. This method assumes that the
spectra from different frequency bands are independent and the spectral
coefficients in any frequency band are Gaussian distributed. The Itakura-Saito
divergence is then employed to estimate the source model related parameters. In
reality, however, the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands may
be dependent, which is not considered in the existing ILRMA algorithm. This
paper presents an improved version of ILRMA, which considers the dependency
between the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands. The Sinkhorn
divergence is then exploited to optimize the source model parameters. As a
result of using the cross-band information, the BSS performance is improved.
But the number of parameters to be estimated also increases significantly, and
so is the computational complexity. To reduce the algorithm complexity, we
apply the Kronecker product to decompose the modeling matrix into the product
of a number of matrices of much smaller dimensionality. An efficient algorithm
is then developed to implement the Sinkhorn divergence based BSS algorithm and
the complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude.

<p class="mathjax">Multichannel convolutive blind speech source separation refers to the problem
of separating different speech sources from the observed multichannel mixtures
without much a priori information about the mixing system. Multichannel
nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) has been proven to be one of the most
powerful separation frameworks and the representative algorithms such as MNMF
and the independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) have demonstrated great
performance. However, the sparseness properties of speech source signals are
not fully taken into account in such a framework. It is well known that speech
signals are sparse in nature, which is considered in this work to improve the
separation performance. Specifically, we utilize the Bingham and Laplace
distributions to formulate a disjoint constraint regularizer, which is
subsequently incorporated into both MNMF and ILRMA. We then derive
majorization-minimization rules for updating parameters related to the source
model, resulting in the development of two enhanced algorithms: s-MNMF and
s-ILRMA. Comprehensive simulations are conducted, and the results unequivocally
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation (DA) encodes invariance and provides implicit
regularization critical to a model's performance in image classification tasks.
However, while DA improves average accuracy, recent studies have shown that its
impact can be highly class dependent: achieving optimal average accuracy comes
at the cost of significantly hurting individual class accuracy by as much as
20% on ImageNet. There has been little progress in resolving class-level
accuracy drops due to a limited understanding of these effects. In this work,
we present a framework for understanding how DA interacts with class-level
learning dynamics. Using higher-quality multi-label annotations on ImageNet, we
systematically categorize the affected classes and find that the majority are
inherently ambiguous, co-occur, or involve fine-grained distinctions, while DA
controls the model's bias towards one of the closely related classes. While
many of the previously reported performance drops are explained by multi-label
annotations, our analysis of class confusions reveals other sources of accuracy
degradation. We show that simple class-conditional augmentation strategies
informed by our framework improve performance on the negatively affected
classes.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have permeated various disciplinary
domains, ranging from bioinformatics to financial analytics, where their
application has become an indispensable facet of contemporary scientific
research endeavors. However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural
networks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation
functions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed,
which leads to poor "unit representation ability" of the network, and it is
often used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network
structure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or
insufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel
neural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating
Backpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation
functions based on derivative information during training to enhance the
network's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it
accurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate
tasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series
of experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of
reducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms
of the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\%$ of baselines on average, and
only 1.4$\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can
achieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the
activation function without introducing any parameters. Finally, we also tested
the ability of X-Net to help scientific discovery on data from multiple
disciplines such as society, energy, environment, and aerospace, and achieved
concise and good results.

<p class="mathjax">We extend Ziv and Lempel's model of finite-state encoders to the realm of
lossy compression of individual sequences. In particular, the model of the
encoder includes a finite-state reconstruction codebook followed by an
information lossless finite-state encoder that compresses the reconstruction
codeword with no additional distortion. We first derive two different lower
bounds to the compression ratio that depend on the number of states of the
lossless encoder. Both bounds are asymptotically achievable by conceptually
simple coding schemes. We then show that when the number of states of the
lossless encoder is large enough in terms of the reconstruction block-length,
the performance can be improved, sometimes significantly so. In particular, the
improved performance is achievable using a random-coding ensemble that is
universal, not only in terms of the source sequence, but also in terms of the
distortion measure.

<p class="mathjax">While Large Language Models (LLM) are able to accumulate and restore
knowledge, they are still prone to hallucination. Especially when faced with
factual questions, LLM cannot only rely on knowledge stored in parameters to
guarantee truthful and correct answers. Augmenting these models with the
ability to search on external information sources, such as the web, is a
promising approach to ground knowledge to retrieve information. However,
searching in a large collection of documents introduces additional
computational/time costs. An optimal behavior would be to query external
resources only when the LLM is not confident about answers. In this paper, we
propose a new LLM able to self-estimate if it is able to answer directly or
needs to request an external tool. We investigate a supervised approach by
introducing a hallucination masking mechanism in which labels are generated
using a close book question-answering task. In addition, we propose to leverage
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to train our model on a small amount
of data. Our model directly provides answers for $78.2\%$ of the known queries
and opts to search for $77.2\%$ of the unknown ones. This results in the API
being utilized only $62\%$ of the time.

<p class="mathjax">Classical numerical schemes exist for solving PDEs numerically, and recently,
neural network-based methods have been developed. However, methodologies using
neural networks, such as PINN and neural operators, lack robustness and
generalization power. To compensate for such drawbacks, there are many types of
research combining classical numerical schemes and machine learning methods by
replacing a small portion of the numerical schemes with neural networks. In
this work, we focus on hyperbolic conservation laws and replace numerical
fluxes in the numerical schemes by neural operator. For this, we construct
losses that are motivated by numerical schemes for conservation laws and
approximate numerical flux by FNO. Through experiments, we show that our
methodology has advantages of both numerical schemes and FNO by comparing with
original methods. For instance, we demonstrate our method gains robustness,
resolution invariance property, and feasibility of a data-driven method. Our
method especially has the ability to predict continuously in time and
generalization power on the out-of-distribution samples, which are challenges
to be tackled for existing neural operator methods.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless powered communication (WPC) combines information and energy
transmission for energy-constrained nodes. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) are capable of controlling radio signals in a dynamic and goal-oriented
manner. This paper investigates the combination of RIS and WPC to enhance the
performance of an energy-constrained user. Using an RIS, a base station, and a
wireless user transmit energy and information signals, respectively. We derive
closed-form expressions for outage probability and secrecy rate to analyze the
performance of the proposed framework. Based on the theoretical analysis and
simulation results, valuable insights are revealed and parameter selection is
demonstrated.

<p class="mathjax">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills seven
million people every year. Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental
health problem affecting low, middle, and high-income countries. In the past
few years, the research community has explored IoT-enabled machine learning
applications for outdoor air pollution prediction. The general objective of
this paper is to systematically review applications of machine learning and
Internet of Things (IoT) for outdoor air pollution prediction and the
combination of monitoring sensors and input features used. Two research
questions were formulated for this review. 1086 publications were collected in
the initial PRISMA stage. After the screening and eligibility phases, 37 papers
were selected for inclusion. A cost-based analysis was conducted on the
findings to highlight high-cost monitoring, low-cost IoT and hybrid enabled
prediction. Three methods of prediction were identified: time series,
feature-based and spatio-temporal. This review's findings identify major
limitations in applications found in the literature, namely lack of coverage,
lack of diversity of data and lack of inclusion of context-specific features.
This review proposes directions for future research and underlines practical
implications in healthcare, urban planning, global synergy and smart cities.

<p class="mathjax">Existing chain-based rotating leader BFT SMR protocols for the partially
synchronous network model that commit blocks with $O(1)$ minimum latency have
block periods of at least $2\delta$ (where $\delta$ is the message transmission
latency). While a protocol with a block period of $\delta$ exists under the
synchronous model, its minimum commit latency is linear in the size of the
system.
<br />To close this gap, we present the first chain-based BFT SMR protocols with
best-case delays of $\delta$ between the proposals of distinct honest leaders,
and minimum commit latencies of $3\delta$. We present three protocols for the
partially synchronous network model under different notions of optimistic
responsiveness, two of which implement pipelining and one of which does not.
All of our protocols achieve reorg resilience and two have short view lengths;
properties that many existing chain-based BFT SMR protocols lack. We
experimentally evaluate our protocols and show that they achieve significant
increases in throughput and reductions in latency compared to the
state-of-the-art, Jolteon. Our results also demonstrate that techniques
commonly employed to reduce communication complexity$\unicode{x2014}$such as
vote-pipelining and the use of designated
vote-aggregators$\unicode{x2014}$actually reduce practical performance in many
settings.

<p class="mathjax">User facing 'platform safety technology' encompasses an array of tools
offered by platforms to help people protect themselves from harm, for example
allowing people to report content and unfollow or block other users. These
tools are an increasingly important part of online safety: in the UK,
legislation has made it a requirement for large platforms to offer them.
However, little is known about user engagement with such tools. We present
findings from a nationally representative survey of UK adults covering their
awareness of and experiences with seven common safety technologies. We show
that experience of online harms is widespread, with 67% of people having seen
what they perceived as harmful content online; 26% of people have also had at
least one piece of content removed by content moderation. Use of safety
technologies is also high, with more than 80\% of people having used at least
one. Awareness of specific tools is varied, with people more likely to be aware
of 'post-hoc' safety tools, such as reporting, than preventative measures.
However, satisfaction with safety technologies is generally low. People who
have previously seen online harms are more likely to use safety tools, implying
a 'learning the hard way' route to engagement. Those higher in digital literacy
are also more likely to use some of these tools, raising concerns about the
accessibility of these technologies to all users. Additionally, women are more
likely to engage in particular types of online 'safety work'. We discuss the
implications of our results for those seeking a safer online environment.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we are concerned with the micro-macro Parareal algorithm for
the simulation of initial-value problems. In this algorithm, a coarse (fast)
solver is applied sequentially over the time domain, and a fine
(time-consuming) solver is applied as a corrector in parallel over smaller
chunks of the time interval. Moreover, the coarse solver acts on a reduced
state variable, which is coupled to the fine state variable through appropriate
coupling operators. We first provide a contribution to the convergence analysis
of the micro-macro Parareal method for multiscale linear ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Then, we extend a variant of the micro-macro Parareal
algorithm for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to
higher-dimensional SDEs.

numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular
generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are
updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient
algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the
theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool
for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact
forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up

<p class="mathjax">By conceiving physical systems as 3D many-body point clouds, geometric graph
neural networks (GNNs), such as SE(3)/E(3) equivalent GNNs, have showcased
promising performance. In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics
make them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However,
current geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body
system, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in
capturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address
this limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to
handle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced.
Nevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing
framework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g.,
permutation and rotation) challenges. In response, we introduce an innovative
equivariant Matrix Product State (MPS)-based message-passing strategy, through
achieving an efficient implementation of the tensor contraction operation. Our
method effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing
mean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs.
Importantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and
layer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs. We empirically validate
the superior accuracy of our approach on benchmark tasks, including predicting
classical Newton systems and quantum tensor Hamiltonian matrices. To our
knowledge, our approach represents the inaugural utilization of parameterized
geometric tensor networks.

additional styles with only a single image. We hope to encourage further

<p class="mathjax">It is a popular hypothesis in neuroscience that ganglion cells in the retina
are activated by selectively detecting visual features in an observed scene.
While ganglion cell firings can be predicted via data-trained deep neural nets,
the networks remain indecipherable, thus providing little understanding of the
cells' underlying operations. To extract knowledge from the cell firings, in
this paper we learn an interpretable graph-based classifier from data to
predict the firings of ganglion cells in response to visual stimuli.
Specifically, we learn a positive semi-definite (PSD) metric matrix $\mathbf{M}
\succeq 0$ that defines Mahalanobis distances between graph nodes (visual
events) endowed with pre-computed feature vectors; the computed inter-node
distances lead to edge weights and a combinatorial graph that is amenable to
binary classification. Mathematically, we define the objective of metric matrix
$\mathbf{M}$ optimization using a graph adaptation of large margin nearest
neighbor (LMNN), which is rewritten as a semi-definite programming (SDP)
problem. We solve it efficiently via a fast approximation called Gershgorin
disc perfect alignment (GDPA) linearization. The learned metric matrix
$\mathbf{M}$ provides interpretability: important features are identified along
$\mathbf{M}$'s diagonal, and their mutual relationships are inferred from
off-diagonal terms. Our fast metric learning framework can be applied to other
biological systems with pre-chosen features that require interpretation.

<p class="mathjax">Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing
undesirable concepts from large language models. However, it remains unclear
whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To
investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept
saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining. Our findings
reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating
advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed
neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit
polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual
neurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts,
our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved
model \textit{safety}. Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques
to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more
robust model editing. Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience
and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.

<p class="mathjax">This study tasckles the problem of many-objective sequence optimization for
semi-automated robotic disassembly operations. To this end, we employ a
many-objective genetic algorithm (MaOGA) algorithm inspired by the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-III, along with
robotic-disassembly-oriented constraints and objective functions derived from
geometrical and robot simulations using 3-dimensional (3D) geometrical
information stored in a 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the target
product. The MaOGA begins by generating a set of initial chromosomes based on a
contact and connection graph (CCG), rather than random chromosomes, to avoid
falling into a local minimum and yield repeatable convergence. The optimization
imposes constraints on feasibility and stability as well as objective functions
regarding difficulty, efficiency, prioritization, and allocability to generate
a sequence that satisfies many preferred conditions under mandatory
requirements for semi-automated robotic disassembly. The NSGA-III-inspired
MaOGA also utilizes non-dominated sorting and niching with reference lines to
further encourage steady and stable exploration and uniformly lower the overall
evaluation values. Our sequence generation experiments for a complex product
(36 parts) demonstrated that the proposed method can consistently produce
feasible and stable sequences with a 100% success rate, bringing the multiple
preferred conditions closer to the optimal solution required for semi-automated
robotic disassembly operations.

importance of achieving realistic touch sensations in digital environments.
Realizing this goal highly depends on comprehensive databases of finger-surface
interactions, which need further development. Here, we present SENS3, an
extensive open-access repository of multisensory data acquired from fifty
surfaces when two participants explored them with their fingertips through
static contact, pressing, tapping, and sliding. SENS3 encompasses high-fidelity
visual, audio, and haptic information recorded during these interactions,
including videos, sounds, contact forces, torques, positions, accelerations,
skin temperature, heat flux, and surface photographs. Additionally, it
incorporates thirteen participants' psychophysical sensation ratings while
exploring these surfaces freely. We anticipate that SENS3 will be valuable for
advancing multisensory texture rendering, user experience development, and
touch sensing in robotics.

<p class="mathjax">Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative
technology that can change our daily life. Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave)
bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can
provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high
attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing
solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then
apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver
end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant
overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose
an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave
signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging),
cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for ``automated'', to facilitate mmWave
vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around
the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative
the process via pilot signals. This multimodal data fusion, together with AI,
is expected to bring significant advances in ``connected'' research.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the video detours problem for navigating instructional videos.
Given a source video and a natural language query asking to alter the how-to
video's current path of execution in a certain way, the goal is to find a
related ''detour video'' that satisfies the requested alteration. To address
this challenge, we propose VidDetours, a novel video-language approach that
learns to retrieve the targeted temporal segments from a large repository of
how-to's using video-and-text conditioned queries. Furthermore, we devise a
language-based pipeline that exploits how-to video narration text to create
weakly supervised training data. We demonstrate our idea applied to the domain
of how-to cooking videos, where a user can detour from their current recipe to
find steps with alternate ingredients, tools, and techniques. Validating on a
ground truth annotated dataset of 16K samples, we show our model's significant
improvements over best available methods for video retrieval and question
answering, with recall rates exceeding the state of the art by 35%.

<p class="mathjax">The capabilities of the most recent language models have increased the
interest in integrating them into real-world applications. However, the fact
that these models generate plausible, yet incorrect text poses a constraint
when considering their use in several domains. Healthcare is a prime example of
a domain where text-generative trustworthiness is a hard requirement to
safeguard patient well-being. In this paper, we present Physio, a chat-based
application for physical rehabilitation. Physio is capable of making an initial
diagnosis while citing reliable health sources to support the information
provided. Furthermore, drawing upon external knowledge databases, Physio can
recommend rehabilitation exercises and over-the-counter medication for symptom
relief. By combining these features, Physio can leverage the power of
generative models for language processing while also conditioning its response
on dependable and verifiable sources. A live demo of Physio is available at

<p class="mathjax">In the current high-performance and embedded computing era, full-stack
energy-centric design is paramount. Use cases require increasingly high
performance at an affordable power budget, often under real-time constraints.
Extreme heterogeneity and parallelism address these issues but greatly
complicate online power consumption assessment, which is essential for dynamic
hardware and software stack adaptations. We introduce a novel
architecture-agnostic power modeling methodology with state-of-the-art
accuracy, low overhead, and high responsiveness. Our methodology identifies the
best Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) to model the power consumption of
each hardware sub-system at each Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
state. The individual linear models are combined into a complete model that
effectively describes the power consumption of the whole system, achieving high
accuracy and low overhead. Our evaluation reports an average estimation error
of 7.5 % for power consumption and 1.3 % for energy. Furthermore, we propose
Runmeter, an open-source, PMC-based monitoring framework integrated into the
Linux kernel. Runmeter manages PMC samples collection and manipulation,
efficiently evaluating our power models at runtime. With a time overhead of
only 0.7 % in the worst case, Runmeter provides responsive and accurate power
measurements directly in the kernel, which can be employed for actuation
policies such as Dynamic Power Management (DPM) and power-aware task
scheduling.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing video diffusion models (VDMs) are limited to mere text
conditions. Thereby, they are usually lacking in control over visual appearance
and geometry structure of the generated videos. This work presents Moonshot, a
new video generation model that conditions simultaneously on multimodal inputs
of image and text. The model builts upon a core module, called multimodal video
block (MVB), which consists of conventional spatialtemporal layers for
representing video features, and a decoupled cross-attention layer to address
image and text inputs for appearance conditioning. In addition, we carefully
design the model architecture such that it can optionally integrate with
pre-trained image ControlNet modules for geometry visual conditions, without
needing of extra training overhead as opposed to prior methods. Experiments
show that with versatile multimodal conditioning mechanisms, Moonshot
demonstrates significant improvement on visual quality and temporal consistency
compared to existing models. In addition, the model can be easily repurposed
for a variety of generative applications, such as personalized video
generation, image animation and video editing, unveiling its potential to serve
as a fundamental architecture for controllable video generation. Models will be
made public on https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS.

<p class="mathjax">Energy disaggregation is a promising solution to access detailed information
on energy consumption in a household, by itemizing its total energy
consumption. However, in real-world applications, overfitting remains a
challenging problem for data-driven disaggregation methods. First, the
available real-world datasets are biased towards the most frequently used
appliances. Second, both real and synthetic publicly-available datasets are
limited in number of appliances, which may not be sufficient for a
disaggregation algorithm to learn complex relations among different types of
appliances and their states. To address the lack of appliance data, we propose
two physics-informed data generators: one for high sampling rate signals (kHz)
and another for low sampling rate signals (Hz). These generators rely on prior
knowledge of the physics of appliance energy consumption, and are capable of
simulating a virtually unlimited number of different appliances and their
corresponding signatures for any time period. Both methods involve defining a
mathematical model, selecting centroids corresponding to individual appliances,
sampling model parameters around each centroid, and finally substituting the
obtained parameters into the mathematical model. Additionally, by using
Principal Component Analysis and Kullback-Leibler divergence, we demonstrate
that our methods significantly outperform the previous approaches.

<p class="mathjax">Data augmentation is an effective technique for improving the performance of
machine learning models. However, it has not been explored as extensively in
natural language processing (NLP) as it has in computer vision. In this paper,
we propose a novel text augmentation method that leverages the Fill-Mask
feature of the transformer-based BERT model. Our method involves iteratively
masking words in a sentence and replacing them with language model predictions.
We have tested our proposed method on various NLP tasks and found it to be
effective in many cases. Our results are presented along with a comparison to
existing augmentation methods. Experimental results show that our proposed
method significantly improves performance, especially on topic classification
datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Training students in basic concepts of physics, such as the ones related to
mass, volume, or density, is much more complicated than just stating the
underlying definitions and laws. One of the reasons for this is that most
students have deeply rooted delusions and misconceptions about the behavior of
objects, sometimes close to magical thinking. Many innovative and promising
technologies, in particular Virtual Reality (VR), can be used to enhance
student learning. We compared the effectiveness of a serious immersive game in
teaching the concept of density in various conditions: a 2D version in an
embedded web browser and a 3D immersive game in VR. We also developed a
specific questionnaire to assess students' knowledge improvement. Primary
results have shown an increase in learning efficiency using VR. Also, most
students were able to see the shortcomings of their initial theories and revise
them, which means that they improved their understanding of this topic.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual Reality (VR) has repeatedly proven its effectiveness in student
learning. However, despite its benefits, the student equipped with a personal
headset remains isolated from the real world while immersed in a virtual space
and the classic student-teacher model of learning is difficult to transpose in
such a situation. This study aims to bring the teacher back into the learning
process when students use a VR headset. We describe the benefits of using a
companion for educational purposes, taking as a test case the concept of
gravity. We present an experimental setup designed to compare three different
teaching contexts: with a physically present real teacher, using a live video
of the teacher, and with a VR avatar of the teacher. We designed and evaluated
three scenarios to teach the concept of gravity: an introduction to the concept
of free fall, a parabolic trajectory workshop and a final exercise combining
both approaches. Due to sanitary conditions, only pre-tests are reported. The
results showed that the effectiveness of using the VR simulations for learning
and the self-confidence level of the students increased as well. The interviews
show that the students ranked the teaching modes in this order: VR companion
mode, video communication and real teacher.

<p class="mathjax">Addressing the complexity of comprehensive information retrieval, this study
introduces an innovative, iterative retrieval-augmented generation system. Our
approach uniquely integrates a vector-space driven re-ranking mechanism with
concurrent brainstorming to expedite the retrieval of highly relevant
documents, thereby streamlining the generation of potential queries. This sets
the stage for our novel hybrid process, which synergistically combines
hypothesis formulation with satisfying decision-making strategy to determine
content adequacy, leveraging a chain of thought-based prompting technique. This
unified hypothesize-satisfied phase intelligently distills information to
ascertain whether user queries have been satisfactorily addressed. Upon
reaching this criterion, the system refines its output into a concise
representation, maximizing conceptual density with minimal verbosity. The
iterative nature of the workflow enhances process efficiency and accuracy.
Crucially, the concurrency within the brainstorming phase significantly
accelerates recursive operations, facilitating rapid convergence to solution
satisfaction. Compared to conventional methods, our system demonstrates a
marked improvement in computational time and cost-effectiveness. This research
advances the state-of-the-art in intelligent retrieval systems, setting a new
benchmark for resource-efficient information extraction and abstraction in
knowledge-intensive applications.

<p class="mathjax">Controlling complex dynamical systems is generally associated with minimizing
certain control objectives with known dynamics under the variational calculus
framework. For systems with unknown dynamics, an additional step of dynamics
modeling is required. However, any inaccuracy in dynamics modeling will lead to
sub-optimality in the resulting control function. Another set of approaches for
controlling unknown dynamical systems - reinforcement learning, folds the
dynamics modeling into controller training via value function approximation or
policy gradient through extensively interacting with the environment, but it
suffers from low data efficiency. To address these, we introduce NODEC, a novel
framework for controlling unknown dynamical systems, which combines dynamics
modelling and controller training using a coupled neural ODE model. Through an
intriguing interplay between the two coupled neural networks, NODEC learns
system dynamics as well as optimal controls that guides the unknown dynamical
system towards target states. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
data efficiency of NODEC for learning optimal control of unknown dynamical
systems.

or using metric learning constraints to learn modality-invariant features, they
often overlook which specific component of the image causes the modality
discrepancy problem. In this paper, we first reveal that the difference in the
amplitude component of visible and infrared images is the primary factor that
causes the modality discrepancy and further propose a novel Frequency Domain
modality-invariant feature learning framework (FDMNet) to reduce modality
discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective. Our framework introduces two
novel modules, namely the Instance-Adaptive Amplitude Filter (IAF) module and
the Phrase-Preserving Normalization (PPNorm) module, to enhance the
modality-invariant amplitude component and suppress the modality-specific
component at both the image- and feature-levels. Extensive experimental results
on two standard benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate the superior
performance of our FDMNet against state-of-the-art methods.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental (and largely open) challenge in sequential decision-making is
dealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental
conditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as
non-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches
for decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume
that the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although
future dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e.,
the agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the
environment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice --
updated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts
with the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being
pessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We
present a heuristic search algorithm called \textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree
Search (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can
learn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it
learns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has
updated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify ``updated
knowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the
agent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for
decision-making. We compare the proposed approach with the multiple
state-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established
open-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and
highly adaptive without sacrificing safety.

<p class="mathjax">Nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) has become an important tool for
feature extraction and part-based representation with preserved intrinsic
structure information from nonnegative high-order data. However, the original
NTF methods utilize Euclidean or Kullback-Leibler divergence as the loss
function which treats each feature equally leading to the neglect of the
side-information of features. To utilize correlation information of features
and manifold information of samples, we introduce Wasserstein manifold
nonnegative tensor factorization (WMNTF), which minimizes the Wasserstein
distance between the distribution of input tensorial data and the distribution
of reconstruction. Although some researches about Wasserstein distance have
been proposed in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), they ignore the
spatial structure information of higher-order data. We use Wasserstein distance
(a.k.a Earth Mover's distance or Optimal Transport distance) as a metric and
add a graph regularizer to a latent factor. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other NMF and NTF
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Using large training datasets enhances the generalization capabilities of
neural networks. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is useful when there are few
labeled data and a lot of unlabeled data. SSL methods that use data
augmentation are most successful for image datasets. In contrast, texts do not
have consistent augmentation methods as images. Consequently, methods that use
augmentation are not as effective in text data as they are in image data. In
this study, we compared SSL algorithms that do not require augmentation; these
are self-training, co-training, tri-training, and tri-training with
disagreement. In the experiments, we used 4 different text datasets for
different tasks. We examined the algorithms from a variety of perspectives by
asking experiment questions and suggested several improvements. Among the
algorithms, tri-training with disagreement showed the closest performance to
the Oracle; however, performance gap shows that new semi-supervised algorithms
or improvements in existing methods are needed.

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting future stock trends remains challenging for academia and industry
due to stochastic inter-stock dynamics and hierarchical intra-stock dynamics
influencing stock prices. In recent years, graph neural networks have achieved
remarkable performance in this problem by formulating multiple stocks as
graph-structured data. However, most of these approaches rely on artificially
defined factors to construct static stock graphs, which fail to capture the
intrinsic interdependencies between stocks that rapidly evolve. In addition,
these methods often ignore the hierarchical features of the stocks and lose
distinctive information within. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning
approach implemented without expert knowledge to address these issues. First,
our approach automatically constructs dynamic stock graphs by entropy-driven
edge generation from a signal processing perspective. Then, we further learn
task-optimal dependencies between stocks via a generalized graph diffusion
process on constructed stock graphs. Last, a decoupled representation learning
scheme is adopted to capture distinctive hierarchical intra-stock features.
Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines on real-world datasets. Moreover, the ablation study and sensitivity
study further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling
the time-evolving inter-stock and intra-stock dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their
ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly
crucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model
acquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another
language. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction
tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We
first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities
to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only
40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve
multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during
tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures
exhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to
monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those
languages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the
instruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual
generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual
instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual
instruction-responses.

<p class="mathjax">Density estimation, a central problem in machine learning, can be performed
using Normalizing Flows (NFs). NFs comprise a sequence of invertible
transformations, that turn a complex target distribution into a simple one, by
exploiting the change of variables theorem. Neural Autoregressive Flows (NAFs)
and Block Neural Autoregressive Flows (B-NAFs) are arguably the most perfomant
members of the NF family. However, they suffer scalability issues and training
instability due to the constraints imposed on the network structure. In this
paper, we propose a novel solution to these challenges by exploiting
transformers to define a new class of neural flows called Transformer Neural
Autoregressive Flows (T-NAFs). T-NAFs treat each dimension of a random variable
as a separate input token, using attention masking to enforce an autoregressive
constraint. We take an amortization-inspired approach where the transformer
outputs the parameters of an invertible transformation. The experimental
results demonstrate that T-NAFs consistently match or outperform NAFs and
B-NAFs across multiple datasets from the UCI benchmark. Remarkably, T-NAFs
achieve these results using an order of magnitude fewer parameters than
previous approaches, without composing multiple flows.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of designing contextual bandit algorithms in the
``cross-learning'' setting of Balseiro et al., where the learner observes the
loss for the action they play in all possible contexts, not just the context of
the current round. We specifically consider the setting where losses are chosen
adversarially and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. In
this setting, we resolve an open problem of Balseiro et al. by providing an
efficient algorithm with a nearly tight (up to logarithmic factors) regret
bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{TK})$, independent of the number of contexts. As
a consequence, we obtain the first nearly tight regret bounds for the problems
of learning to bid in first-price auctions (under unknown value distributions)
and sleeping bandits with a stochastic action set.
<br />At the core of our algorithm is a novel technique for coordinating the
execution of a learning algorithm over multiple epochs in such a way to remove
correlations between estimation of the unknown distribution and the actions
played by the algorithm. This technique may be of independent interest for
other learning problems involving estimation of an unknown context
distribution.

language models (LLMs) about the visual world? We systematically evaluate LLMs'
abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of
increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual
representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language
models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we
use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not
look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models
to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can
teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore,
experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images

<p class="mathjax">Context: Cybersecurity vendors often publish cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
reports, referring to the written artifacts on technical and forensic analysis
of the techniques used by the malware in APT attacks. Objective: The goal of
this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries
form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in
cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques
cataloged in MITRE ATT\&amp;CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI
reports that MITRE ATT\&amp;CK used as citations in the descriptions of the
cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and
trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the
implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to
identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform
qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques
in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370
techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for
37.3\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant
recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these
pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used
by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or
affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c)
overlapping in their implementations. Overall, the study quantifies how
adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on
publicly reported documents. We advocate organizations prioritize their defense
against the identified prevalent techniques and actively hunt for potential
malicious intrusion based on the identified pairs of techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Motivated by the goals of dataset pruning and defect identification, a
growing body of methods have been developed to score individual examples within
a dataset. These methods, which we call "example difficulty scores", are
typically used to rank or categorize examples, but the consistency of rankings
between different training runs, scoring methods, and model architectures is
generally unknown. To determine how example rankings vary due to these random
and controlled effects, we systematically compare different formulations of
scores over a range of runs and model architectures. We find that scores
largely share the following traits: they are noisy over individual runs of a
model, strongly correlated with a single notion of difficulty, and reveal
examples that range from being highly sensitive to insensitive to the inductive
biases of certain model architectures. Drawing from statistical genetics, we
develop a simple method for fingerprinting model architectures using a few
sensitive examples. These findings guide practitioners in maximizing the
consistency of their scores (e.g. by choosing appropriate scoring methods,
number of runs, and subsets of examples), and establishes comprehensive
baselines for evaluating scores in the future.

<p class="mathjax">With an aging population, numerous assistive and monitoring technologies are
under development to enable older adults to age in place. To facilitate aging
in place predicting risk factors such as falls, and hospitalization and
providing early interventions are important. Much of the work on ambient
monitoring for risk prediction has centered on gait speed analysis, utilizing
privacy-preserving sensors like radar. Despite compelling evidence that
monitoring step length, in addition to gait speed, is crucial for predicting
risk, radar-based methods have not explored step length measurement in the
home. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on step length measurement using
radars are limited to proof of concept studies with few healthy subjects. To
address this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is
proposed based on detection and tracking using radar point cloud, followed by
Doppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home. The
proposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment, involving 35 frail
older adults, to establish its validity. Additionally, the method was assessed
in people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the
clinical assessment. The proposed radar-based step length measurement method
was compared to the gold standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing
a 4.5cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent
reliability (ICC(2,k)=0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) in uncontrolled home settings.
The method also proved accurate in uncontrolled home settings, as indicated by
a strong agreement (ICC(3,k)=0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92)) between home
measurements and in-clinic assessments.

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of learning equivariant neural networks via gradient
descent. The incorporation of known symmetries ("equivariance") into neural
nets has empirically improved the performance of learning pipelines, in domains
ranging from biology to computer vision. However, a rich yet separate line of
learning theoretic research has demonstrated that actually learning shallow,
fully-connected (i.e. non-symmetric) networks has exponential complexity in the
correlational statistical query (CSQ) model, a framework encompassing gradient
descent. In this work, we ask: are known problem symmetries sufficient to
alleviate the fundamental hardness of learning neural nets with gradient
descent? We answer this question in the negative. In particular, we give lower
bounds for shallow graph neural networks, convolutional networks, invariant
polynomials, and frame-averaged networks for permutation subgroups, which all
scale either superpolynomially or exponentially in the relevant input
dimension. Therefore, in spite of the significant inductive bias imparted via
symmetry, actually learning the complete classes of functions represented by
equivariant neural networks via gradient descent remains hard.

<p class="mathjax">A simple and effective method for the alignment of generative models is the
best-of-$n$ policy, where $n$ samples are drawn from a base policy, and ranked
based on a reward function, and the highest ranking one is selected. A commonly

between the best-of-$n$ policy and the base policy is equal to $\log (n) -

<p class="mathjax">Model uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the implementation of
safety-critical control systems. With this as motivation, this paper proposes a
safe control design approach that guarantees the robustness of nonlinear
feedback systems in the presence of matched or unmatched unmodelled system
dynamics and external disturbances. Our approach couples control barrier
functions (CBFs) with a new uncertainty/disturbance estimator to ensure robust
safety against input and state-dependent model uncertainties. We prove upper
bounds on the estimator's error and estimated outputs. We use an uncertainty
estimator-based composite feedback control law to adaptively improve robust
control performance under hard safety constraints by compensating for the
matched uncertainty. Then, we robustify existing CBF constraints with this
uncertainty estimate and the estimation error bounds to ensure robust safety
via a quadratic program (CBF-QP). We also extend our method to higher-order
CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which causes
relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbance. We
assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a
second-order cone (SOC) condition. The proposed robust HOCBFs method is
demonstrated in a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem.
Finally, the efficacy of our method is experimentally demonstrated on a tracked
robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level
adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack
incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To
avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify
and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal
attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides
structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past
cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in
prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal
attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose
ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from
cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct
ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and
apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and
machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports,
where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine
pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to
trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack,
followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on
the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about
cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with
limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we
advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI
and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a concrete and a symbolic rewriting logic semantics for
parametric time Petri nets with inhibitor arcs (PITPNs), a flexible model of
timed systems where parameters are allowed in firing bounds. We prove that our
semantics is bisimilar to the "standard" semantics of PITPNs. This allows us to
use the rewriting logic tool Maude, combined with SMT solving, to provide sound
and complete formal analyses for PITPNs. We develop and implement a new general
folding approach for symbolic reachability, so that Maude-with-SMT reachability
analysis terminates whenever the parametric state-class graph of the PITPN is
finite. Our work opens up the possibility of using the many formal analysis
capabilities of Maude -- including full LTL model checking, analysis with
user-defined analysis strategies, and even statistical model checking -- for
such nets. We illustrate this by explaining how almost all formal analysis and
parameter synthesis methods supported by the state-of-the-art PITPN tool Romeo
can be performed using Maude with SMT. In addition, we also support analysis
and parameter synthesis from parametric initial markings, as well as full LTL
model checking and analysis with user-defined execution strategies. Experiments
show that our methods outperform Romeo in many cases.

gesture according to the conversational dynamics of a dyadic interaction. Given
speech audio, we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an
individual, including face, body, and hands. The key behind our method is in
combining the benefits of sample diversity from vector quantization with the
high-frequency details obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic,
expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly
photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nuances in gestures (e.g.
sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research, we introduce a
first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for
photorealistic reconstruction. Experiments show our model generates appropriate

Furthermore, our perceptual evaluation highlights the importance of
photorealism (vs. meshes) in accurately assessing subtle motion details in
conversational gestures. Code and dataset available online.

<p class="mathjax">Visual odometry estimates the motion of a moving camera based on visual
input. Existing methods, mostly focusing on two-view point tracking, often
ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence, thereby overlooking the
global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory
reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion,
dynamic objects, and low-texture areas. To address these challenges, we present
the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively
combines visual, inter-track, and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors
for dynamic track estimation. Moreover, LEAP's temporal probabilistic
formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative
refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these
traits, we develop LEAP-VO, a robust visual odometry system adept at handling
occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel
practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms
existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">As time progresses, the need for more secure applications grows
exponentially. The different types of sensitive information that is being
transferred virtually has sparked a rise in systems that leverage blockchain.
Different sectors are beginning to use this disruptive technology to evaluate
the risks and benefits. Sectors like finance, medicine, higher education, and
wireless communication have research regarding blockchain. Futhermore, the need
for security standards in this area of research is pivotal. In recent past,
several attacks on blockchain infrastructures have resulted in hundreds of
millions dollars lost and sensitive information compromised. Some of these
attacks include DAO attacks, bZx attacks, and Parity Multisignature Wallet
Double Attacks which targeted vulnerabilities within smart contracts on the
Ethereum network. These attacks exposed the weaknesses of current smart
contract development practices which has led to the increase in distrust and
adoption of systems that leverage blockchain for its functionality. In this
paper, I identify common software vulnerabilities and attacks on blockchain
infrastructures, thoroughly detail the smart contract development process and
propose a model for ensuring a stronger security standard for future systems
leveraging smart contracts. The purpose for proposing a model is to promote
trust among end users in the system which is a foundational element for
blockchain adoption in the future.

<p class="mathjax">In the misspecified spectral algorithms problem, researchers usually assume
the underground true function $f_{\rho}^{*} \in [\mathcal{H}]^{s}$, a
less-smooth interpolation space of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
$\mathcal{H}$ for some $s\in (0,1)$. The existing minimax optimal results
require $\|f_{\rho}^{*}\|_{L^{\infty}}&lt;\infty$ which implicitly requires $s &gt;
\alpha_{0}$ where $\alpha_{0}\in (0,1)$ is the embedding index, a constant
depending on $\mathcal{H}$. Whether the spectral algorithms are optimal for all
$s\in (0,1)$ is an outstanding problem lasting for years. In this paper, we
show that spectral algorithms are minimax optimal for any
$\alpha_{0}-\frac{1}{\beta} &lt; s &lt; 1$, where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue decay
rate of $\mathcal{H}$. We also give several classes of RKHSs whose embedding
index satisfies $ \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{\beta} $. Thus, the spectral algorithms
are minimax optimal for all $s\in (0,1)$ on these RKHSs.

<p class="mathjax">The study investigates the role of 'superspreaders' in shaping opinions
within networks, distinguishing three types: A, B, and C. Type A has a
significant influence in shaping opinions, Type B acts as a counterbalance to
A, and Type C functions like media, providing an objective viewpoint and
potentially regulating A and B's influence. The research uses a confidence
coefficient and z-score to survey superspreaders' behaviors, with a focus on
the conditions affecting group dynamics and opinion formation, including
environmental factors and forgetfulness over time. The findings offer insights
for improving online communication security and understanding social influence.

<p class="mathjax">Cognitive maps are a proposed concept on how the brain efficiently organizes
memories and retrieves context out of them. The entorhinal-hippocampal complex
is heavily involved in episodic and relational memory processing, as well as
spatial navigation and is thought to built cognitive maps via place and grid
cells. To make use of the promising properties of cognitive maps, we set up a
multi-modal neural network using successor representations which is able to
model place cell dynamics and cognitive map representations. Here, we use
multi-modal inputs consisting of images and word embeddings. The network learns
the similarities between novel inputs and the training database and therefore
the representation of the cognitive map successfully. Subsequently, the
prediction of the network can be used to infer from one modality to another
with over $90\%$ accuracy. The proposed method could therefore be a building
block to improve current AI systems for better understanding of the environment
and the different modalities in which objects appear. The association of
specific modalities with certain encounters can therefore lead to context
awareness in novel situations when similar encounters with less information
occur and additional information can be inferred from the learned cognitive
map. Cognitive maps, as represented by the entorhinal-hippocampal complex in
the brain, organize and retrieve context from memories, suggesting that large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could harness similar architectures to
function as a high-level processing center, akin to how the hippocampus
operates within the cortex hierarchy. Finally, by utilizing multi-modal inputs,
LLMs can potentially bridge the gap between different forms of data (like
images and words), paving the way for context-awareness and grounding of
abstract concepts through learned associations, addressing the grounding
problem in AI.

<p class="mathjax">The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during
the first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain
connectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three
major limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction
tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality
or connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require
extensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often
challenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time
series data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a
federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of
federation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited
datasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local
generative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of
FedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework
specifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a
data-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the
local objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity
within the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)
introducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based
precompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors
to improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive
experimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain
multi-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with
benchmark methods.

<p class="mathjax">Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually
eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole
slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide
image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to
computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are
utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational
advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without
human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis
if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or
air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely
on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from
the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the
goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their
severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data.
Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity
automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity
evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The
proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of
six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This
method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for
artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the
evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the
system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical
usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.

<p class="mathjax">A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method
(BNQN) - which has strong theoretical guarantee, is easy to implement, and has
good experimental performance, was recently introduced by the third author.
<br />Experiments performed previously showed some remarkable properties of the
basins of attractions for finding roots of polynomials and meromorphic
functions, with BNQN. In general, they look more smooth than that of Newton's
method.
<br />In this paper, we continue to experimentally explore in depth this remarkable
phenomenon, and connect BNQN to Newton's flow and Voronoi's diagram. This link
poses a couple of challenging puzzles to be explained. Experiments also
indicate that BNQN is more robust against random perturbations than Newton's
method and Random Relaxed Newton's method.

<p class="mathjax">Molecular property optimization (MPO) problems are inherently challenging
since they are formulated over discrete, unstructured spaces and the labeling
process involves expensive simulations or experiments, which fundamentally
limits the amount of available data. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful
and popular framework for efficient optimization of noisy, black-box objective
functions (e.g., measured property values), thus is a potentially attractive
framework for MPO. To apply BO to MPO problems, one must select a structured
molecular representation that enables construction of a probabilistic surrogate
model. Many molecular representations have been developed, however, they are
all high-dimensional, which introduces important challenges in the BO process
-- mainly because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define and
perform inference over a suitable class of surrogate models. This challenge has
been recently addressed by learning a lower-dimensional encoding of a SMILE or
graph representation of a molecule in an unsupervised manner and then
performing BO in the encoded space. In this work, we show that such methods
have a tendency to "get stuck," which we hypothesize occurs since the mapping
from the encoded space to property values is not necessarily well-modeled by a
Gaussian process. We argue for an alternative approach that combines numerical
molecular descriptors with a sparse axis-aligned Gaussian process model, which
is capable of rapidly identifying sparse subspaces that are most relevant to
modeling the unknown property function. We demonstrate that our proposed method
substantially outperforms existing MPO methods on a variety of benchmark and
real-world problems. Specifically, we show that our method can routinely find
near-optimal molecules out of a set of more than $&gt;100$k alternatives within
100 or fewer expensive queries.

<p class="mathjax">Visual attribution in medical imaging seeks to make evident the
diagnostically-relevant components of a medical image, in contrast to the more
common detection of diseased tissue deployed in standard machine vision
pipelines (which are less straightforwardly interpretable/explainable to
clinicians). We here present a novel generative visual attribution technique,
one that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with domain-specific
large language models, in order to generate normal counterparts of abnormal
images. The discrepancy between the two hence gives rise to a mapping
indicating the diagnostically-relevant image components. To achieve this, we
deploy image priors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning mechanisms in
order to control the image generative process, including natural language text
prompts acquired from medical science and applied radiology. We perform
experiments and quantitatively evaluate our results on the COVID-19 Radiography
Database containing labelled chest X-rays with differing pathologies via the
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Multi Scale
Structural Similarity Metric (MS-SSIM) metrics obtained between real and

capabilities including zero-shot localized disease induction, which are

<p class="mathjax">We introduce the entangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\mathsf{QEPH}$ as
the class of problems that are efficiently verifiable given alternating quantum
proofs that may be entangled with each other. We prove $\mathsf{QEPH}$
collapses to its second level. In fact, we show that a polynomial number of
alternations collapses to just two. As a consequence, $\mathsf{QEPH} =
\mathsf{QRG(1)}$, the class of problems having one-turn quantum refereed games,
which is known to be contained in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. This is in contrast to the
unentangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\mathsf{QPH}$, which contains
$\mathsf{QMA(2)}$.
<br />We also introduce a generalization of the quantum-classical polynomial
hierarchy $\mathsf{QCPH}$ where the provers send probability distributions over
strings (instead of strings) and denote it by $\mathsf{DistributionQCPH}$.
Conceptually, this class is intermediate between $\mathsf{QCPH}$ and
$\mathsf{QPH}$. We prove $\mathsf{DistributionQCPH} = \mathsf{QCPH}$,
suggesting that only quantum superposition (not classical probability)
increases the computational power of these hierarchies. To prove this equality,
we generalize a game-theoretic result of Lipton and Young (1994) which says
that the provers can send distributions that are uniform over a polynomial-size
support. We also prove the analogous result for the polynomial hierarchy, i.e.,
$\mathsf{DistributionPH} = \mathsf{PH}$. These results also rule out certain
approaches for showing $\mathsf{QPH}$ collapses.
<br />Finally, we show that $\mathsf{PH}$ and $\mathsf{QCPH}$ are contained in
$\mathsf{QPH}$, resolving an open question of Gharibian et al. (2022).

<p class="mathjax">Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition
systems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data,
unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a
scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning
(SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised
frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online
clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative
bottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels
through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the
student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input
and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated
via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past
iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for
consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples.
Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative
approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single
training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components
like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent
improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts
demonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks
an important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation
learning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.

<p class="mathjax">In the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a
promising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal
physiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the
current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by
conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons,
especially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their
environment towards a specific desired state through their output. This
environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor
sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their
control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control
(DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which
implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control.
Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift
from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and
feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant
stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the
brain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional,
feedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a
novel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural
networks.

<p class="mathjax">Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and accurately
distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid tumors is crucial for
developing effective treatment plans in clinical practice. Pathologically,
thyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In
this study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning
to integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid
tumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to
predict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to
extract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature
representations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for
the final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of
different image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the
information from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image
blocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by
classification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more
accurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained
pathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin
staining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides. Furthermore, by
leveraging the concept of indirect measurement and extracting polarized
features from structures correlated with lesions, the proposed method can also
classify samples where membrane structures cannot be obtained through sampling,
providing a potential objective and highly accurate indirect diagnostic
technique for thyroid tumors.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel text-to-speech (TTS) framework centered around a neural
transducer. Our approach divides the whole TTS pipeline into semantic-level
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling and fine-grained acoustic modeling
stages, utilizing discrete semantic tokens obtained from wav2vec2.0 embeddings.
For a robust and efficient alignment modeling, we employ a neural transducer
named token transducer for the semantic token prediction, benefiting from its
hard monotonic alignment constraints. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive (NAR)
speech generator efficiently synthesizes waveforms from these semantic tokens.
Additionally, a reference speech controls temporal dynamics and acoustic
conditions at each stage. This decoupled framework reduces the training
complexity of TTS while allowing each stage to focus on semantic and acoustic
modeling. Our experimental results on zero-shot adaptive TTS demonstrate that
our model surpasses the baseline in terms of speech quality and speaker
similarity, both objectively and subjectively. We also delve into the inference
speed and prosody control capabilities of our approach, highlighting the
potential of neural transducers in TTS frameworks.

<p class="mathjax">Access to high-quality datasets in the medical industry limits machine
learning model performance. To address this issue, we propose a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) combined with a UNet architecture for
X-ray image synthesis. Focused on pneumonia medical condition, our methodology
employs over 3000 pneumonia X-ray images obtained from Kaggle for training.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as the model
successfully generated realistic images with low Mean Squared Error (MSE). The
synthesized images showed distinct differences from non-pneumonia images,
highlighting the model's ability to capture key features of positive cases.
Beyond pneumonia, the applications of this synthesizer extend to various
medical conditions, provided an ample dataset is available. The capability to
produce high-quality images can potentially enhance machine learning models'
performance, aiding in more accurate and efficient medical diagnoses. This
innovative DDPM-based X-ray photo synthesizer presents a promising avenue for
addressing the scarcity of positive medical image datasets, paving the way for
improved medical image analysis and diagnosis in the healthcare industry.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image
analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical
information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the
diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is
not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited
resources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure
the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing
modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to
performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the
clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation
framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The
single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the
multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI
from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node
Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set
without missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing
modality is 80\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with
multi-modal data and missing modality. Such a model has the potential to
improve treatment decision-making for early breast cancer patients who have
axillary lymph node metastatic status.

<p class="mathjax">During the last decade, wireless data services have had an incredible impact
on people's lives in ways we could never have imagined. The number of mobile
devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every
year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the
explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity,
network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of
growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile
communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining
various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new
technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive
multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network
densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new
waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including
terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks
(NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G
networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key
technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and
beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates
significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is
essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate
severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and
Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified
classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of
interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference
management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports
and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth
literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes.
We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be
encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested
new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an
AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry
in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and
will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has shown the potential of deep learning in multi-parametric
MRI-based visual pathway (VP) segmentation. However, obtaining labeled data for
training is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to develop
effective algorithms in situations with limited labeled samples. In this work,
we propose a label-efficient deep learning method with self-ensembling (LESEN).
LESEN incorporates supervised and unsupervised losses, enabling the student and
teacher models to mutually learn from each other, forming a self-ensembling
mean teacher framework. Additionally, we introduce a reliable unlabeled sample
selection (RUSS) mechanism to further enhance LESEN's effectiveness. Our
experiments on the human connectome project (HCP) dataset demonstrate the
superior performance of our method when compared to state-of-the-art
techniques, advancing multimodal VP segmentation for comprehensive analysis in
clinical and research settings. The implementation code will be available at:

<p class="mathjax">The availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data is
increasing along with the availability of different GPS receivers and with the
increasing use of various mobility services. GPS trajectory is an important
data source which is used in traffic density detection, transport mode
detection, mapping data inferences with the use of different methods such as
image processing and machine learning methods. While the data size increases,
efficient representation of this type of data is becoming difficult to be used
in these methods. A common approach is the representation of GPS trajectory
information such as average speed, bearing, etc. in raster image form and
applying analysis methods. In this study, we evaluate GPS trajectory data
rasterization using the spatial join functions of QGIS, PostGIS+QGIS, and our
iterative spatial structured grid aggregation implementation coded in the
Python programming language. Our implementation is also parallelizable, and
this parallelization is also included as the fourth method. According to the
results of experiment carried out with an example GPS trajectory dataset, QGIS
method and PostGIS+QGIS method showed relatively low performance with respect
to our method using the metric of total processing time. PostGIS+QGIS method
achieved the best results for spatial join though its total performance
decreased quickly while test area size increases. On the other hand, both of
our methods' performances decrease directly proportional to GPS point. And our
methods' performance can be increased proportional to the increase with the
number of processor cores and/or with multiple computing clusters.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate segmentation of the retinogeniculate visual pathway (RGVP) aids in
the diagnosis and treatment of visual disorders by identifying disruptions or
abnormalities within the pathway. However, the complex anatomical structure and
connectivity of RGVP make it challenging to achieve accurate segmentation. In
this study, we propose a novel Modality Exchange Network (ME-Net) that
effectively utilizes multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging information to
enhance RGVP segmentation. Our ME-Net has two main contributions. Firstly, we
introduce an effective multi-modal soft-exchange technique. Specifically, we
design a channel and spatially mixed attention module to exchange modality
information between T1-weighted and fractional anisotropy MR images. Secondly,
we propose a cross-fusion module that further enhances the fusion of
information between the two modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of RGVP
segmentation performance.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce an extension of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method that captures
the Landau collisional effects in the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau equations. The
method arises from a regularisation of the variational formulation of the
Landau equation, leading to a discretisation of the operator that conserves
mass, charge, momentum, and energy, while dissipating the (regularised)
entropy. The collisional effects appear as a fully deterministic effective
force, thus the method does not require any transport-collision splitting. The
scheme can be used in arbitrary dimension, and for a general interaction,
including the Coulomb case. We validate the scheme on scenarios such as the
Landau damping, the two-stream instability, and the Weibel instability,
demonstrating its effectiveness in the numerical simulation of plasma.

and linear fractional stable motions (lfsm). The work involves a fast
generation of extensive datasets for fBm and fOU to train the LSTM network on a
large volume of data in a feasible time. The study analyses the accuracy of the
LSTM network's Hurst parameter estimation regarding various performance
measures like RMSE, MAE, MRE, and quantiles of the absolute and relative
errors. It finds that LSTM outperforms the traditional statistical methods in
the case of fBm and fOU processes; however, it has limited accuracy on lfsm
processes. The research also delves into the implications of training length
and valuation sequence length on the LSTM's performance. The methodology is
applied by estimating the Hurst parameter in Li-ion battery degradation data
and obtaining confidence bounds for the estimation. The study concludes that
while deep learning methods show promise in parameter estimation of fractional
processes, their effectiveness is contingent on the process type and the
quality of training data.

<p class="mathjax">The diffusion-based Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) methods have achieved
remarkable performances, producing natural audios with high similarity to the
target timbre. However, the iterative sampling process results in slow
inference speed, and acceleration thus becomes crucial. In this paper, we
propose CoMoSVC, a consistency model-based SVC method, which aims to achieve
both high-quality generation and high-speed sampling. A diffusion-based teacher
model is first specially designed for SVC, and a student model is further
distilled under self-consistency properties to achieve one-step sampling.
Experiments on a single NVIDIA GTX4090 GPU reveal that although CoMoSVC has a
significantly faster inference speed than the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
diffusion-based SVC system, it still achieves comparable or superior conversion
performance based on both subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples and
codes are available at https://comosvc.github.io/.

<p class="mathjax">Surfactants are of high importance in different industrial sectors such as
cosmetics, detergents, oil recovery and drug delivery systems. Therefore, many
quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models have been developed
for surfactants. Each predictive model typically focuses on one surfactant
class, mostly nonionics. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited a great
predictive performance for property prediction of ionic liquids, polymers and
drugs in general. Specifically for surfactants, GNNs can successfully predict
critical micelle concentration (CMC), a key surfactant property associated with
micellization. A key factor in the predictive ability of QSPR and GNN models is
the data available for training. Based on extensive literature search, we
create the largest available CMC database with 429 molecules and the first
large data collection for surface excess concentration ($\Gamma$$_{m}$),
another surfactant property associated with foaming, with 164 molecules. Then,
we develop GNN models to predict the CMC and $\Gamma$$_{m}$ and we explore
different learning approaches, i.e., single- and multi-task learning, as well
as different training strategies, namely ensemble and transfer learning. We
find that a multi-task GNN with ensemble learning trained on all $\Gamma$$_{m}$
and CMC data performs best. Finally, we test the ability of our CMC model to
generalize on industrial grade pure component surfactants. The GNN yields
highly accurate predictions for CMC, showing great potential for future
industrial applications.
