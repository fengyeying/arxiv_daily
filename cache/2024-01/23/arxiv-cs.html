<p class="mathjax">Knowledge graph embedding transforms knowledge graphs into a continuous,
low-dimensional space, facilitating inference and completion tasks. This field
is mainly divided into translational distance models and semantic matching
models. A key challenge in translational distance models is their inability to
effectively differentiate between 'head' and 'tail' entities in graphs. To
address this, the novel location-sensitive embedding (LSE) method has been
developed. LSE innovatively modifies the head entity using relation-specific
mappings, conceptualizing relations as linear transformations rather than mere
translations. The theoretical foundations of LSE, including its
representational capabilities and its connections to existing models, have been
thoroughly examined. A more streamlined variant, LSEd, employs a diagonal
matrix for transformations to enhance practical efficiency. In tests conducted
on four large-scale datasets for link prediction, LSEd either outperforms or is
competitive with leading contemporary models.

<p class="mathjax">Supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) has witnessed a profound evolution
through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) techniques, revolutionizing predictive capabilities and risk mitigation
strategies. The significance of this evolution stems from the critical role of
robust risk management strategies in ensuring operational resilience and
continuity within modern supply chains. Previous reviews have outlined
established methodologies but have overlooked emerging AI/ML techniques,
leaving a notable research gap in understanding their practical implications
within SCRA. This paper conducts a systematic literature review combined with a
comprehensive bibliometric analysis. We meticulously examined 1,717 papers and
derived key insights from a select group of 48 articles published between 2014
and 2023. The review fills this research gap by addressing pivotal research
questions, and exploring existing AI/ML techniques, methodologies, findings,
and future trajectories, thereby providing a more encompassing view of the
evolving landscape of SCRA. Our study unveils the transformative impact of
AI/ML models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and hybrids, in substantially
enhancing precision within SCRA. It underscores adaptable post-COVID
strategies, advocating for resilient contingency plans and aligning with
evolving risk landscapes. Significantly, this review surpasses previous
examinations by accentuating emerging AI/ML techniques and their practical
implications within SCRA. Furthermore, it highlights the contributions through
a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, revealing publication trends,
influential authors, and highly cited articles.

<p class="mathjax">As artificial intelligence transforms a wide range of sectors and drives
innovation, it also introduces complex challenges concerning ethics,
transparency, bias, and fairness. The imperative for integrating Responsible AI
(RAI) principles within governance frameworks is paramount to mitigate these
emerging risks. While there are many solutions for AI governance, significant
questions remain about their effectiveness in practice. Addressing this
knowledge gap, this paper aims to examine the existing literature on AI
Governance. The focus of this study is to analyse the literature to answer key
questions: WHO is accountable for AI systems' governance, WHAT elements are
being governed, WHEN governance occurs within the AI development life cycle,
and HOW it is executed through various mechanisms like frameworks, tools,
standards, policies, or models. Employing a systematic literature review
methodology, a rigorous search and selection process has been employed. This
effort resulted in the identification of 61 relevant articles on the subject of
AI Governance. Out of the 61 studies analysed, only 5 provided complete
responses to all questions. The findings from this review aid research in
formulating more holistic and comprehensive Responsible AI (RAI) governance
frameworks. This study highlights important role of AI governance on various
levels specially organisational in establishing effective and responsible AI
practices. The findings of this study provides a foundational basis for future
research and development of comprehensive governance models that align with RAI
principles.

<p class="mathjax">With the current nations struggling to track the pandemic's trajectories.
There has been a lack of transparency or real-live data streaming for pandemic
cases and symptoms. This phenomenon has led to a rapid and uncontrolled spread
of these deadly pandemics. One of the main issues in creating a global pandemic
tracking system is the lack of standardization of communications protocols and
the deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) device sensors. The Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) has developed several sensor web Enablement standards that
allow the expeditious deployment of communications protocols within IoT devices
and other sensor devices like the OGC SensorThings application programming
interface (API). In this paper, to address this issue, we outline the
interoperability challenge and provide a qualitative and quantitative study of
the OGC SensorThings API's deployment and its respective server. The OGC
SensorThings API is developed to provide data exchange services between sensors
and their observations. The OGC SensorThings API would play a primary and
essential role in creating an automated pandemic tracking system. This API
would reduce the deployment of any set of sensors and provide real-time data
tracking. Accordingly, global health organizations would react expeditiously
and concentrate their efforts on high infection rates.

<p class="mathjax">As AI systems proliferate in society, the AI community is increasingly
preoccupied with the concept of AI Safety, namely the prevention of failures
due to accidents that arise from an unanticipated departure of a system's
behavior from designer intent in AI deployment. We demonstrate through an
analysis of real world cases of such incidents that although current vocabulary
captures a range of the encountered issues of AI deployment, an expanded
socio-technical framing will be required for a more complete understanding of
how AI systems and implemented safety mechanisms fail and succeed in real life.

<p class="mathjax">In the new research and innovation (R&amp;I) paradigm, aimed at a transformation
towards more sustainable, inclusive and fair pathways to address societal and
environmental challenges, and at generating new patterns of specialisation and
new trajectories for socioeconomic development, it is essential to provide
monitoring systems and tools to map and understand the contribution of R&amp;I
policies and projects. To address this transformation, we present the RIS3-MCAT
platform, the result of a line of work aimed at exploring the potential of open
data, semantic analysis, and data visualisation, for monitoring
challenge-oriented smart specialisation in Catalonia. RIS3-MCAT is an
interactive platform that facilitates access to R&amp;I project data in formats
that allow for sophisticated analyses of a large volume of texts, enabling the
detailed study of thematic specialisations and challenges beyond classical
classification systems. Its conceptualisation, development framework and use
are presented in this paper.

considerably high production cost, which is nearly one-third of cryptocurrency
(e.g. Bitcoin) price itself. As the core of mining process is based on SHA-256
cryptographic hashing function, by using the alternative quantum computers,
hybrid quantum computers or more larger quantum computing devices like quantum
annealers, it would be possible to reduce the mining energy consumption with a
quantum hardware's low-energy-operation characteristics. Within this work we

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel run-time testing, analysis, and code
optimization (TACO) method for quantum neural network (QNN) software in
advanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, which visually presents the learning
performance that is called a barren plateau. The run-time visual presentation
of barren plateau situations is helpful for real-time quantum-based advanced
IoT software testing because the software engineers can easily be aware of the
training performances of QNN. Moreover, this tool is obviously useful for
software engineers because it can intuitively guide them in designing and
implementing high-accurate QNN-based advanced IoT software even if they are not
familiar with quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Lastly, the proposed
TACO is also capable of visual feedback because software engineers visually
identify the barren plateau situations using tensorboard. In turn, they are
also able to modify QNN structures based on the information.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence (AI) has acquired notorious relevance in modern
computing as it effectively solves complex tasks traditionally done by humans.
AI provides methods to represent and infer knowledge, efficiently manipulate
texts and learn from vast amount of data. These characteristics are applicable
in many activities that human find laborious or repetitive, as is the case of
the analysis of scientific literature. Manually preparing and writing a
systematic literature review (SLR) takes considerable time and effort, since it
requires planning a strategy, conducting the literature search and analysis,
and reporting the findings. Depending on the area under study, the number of
papers retrieved can be of hundreds or thousands, meaning that filtering those
relevant ones and extracting the key information becomes a costly and
error-prone process. However, some of the involved tasks are repetitive and,
therefore, subject to automation by means of AI. In this paper, we present a
survey of AI techniques proposed in the last 15 years to help researchers
conduct systematic analyses of scientific literature. We describe the tasks
currently supported, the types of algorithms applied, and available tools
proposed in 34 primary studies. This survey also provides a historical
perspective of the evolution of the field and the role that humans can play in
an increasingly automated SLR process.

<p class="mathjax">In Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs), two groups of actors interact toward the
maximization of system performance: the sensors, observing and disseminating
the system state, and the actuators, performing physical decisions based on the
received information. While it is generally assumed that sensors periodically
transmit updates, returning the feedback signal only when necessary, and
consequently adapting the physical decisions to the communication policy, can
significantly improve the efficiency of the system. In particular, the choice
between push-based communication, in which updates are initiated autonomously
by the sensors, and pull-based communication, in which they are requested by
the actuators, is a key design step. In this work, we propose an analytical
model for optimizing push- and pull-based communication in CPSs, observing that
the policy optimality coincides with Value of Information (VoI) maximization.
Our results also highlight that, despite providing a better optimal solution,
implementable push-based communication strategies may underperform even in
relatively simple scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is estimated to affect about
5-10% of the population. In particular, phonological dyslexia causes problems
in connecting the sounds of words with their written forms. This results in
difficulties such as slow reading speed, inaccurate reading, and difficulty
decoding unfamiliar words. Moreover, dyslexia can also be a challenging and
frustrating experience for students as they may feel misunderstood or
stigmatized by their peers or educators. For these reasons, the use of
compensatory tools and strategies is of crucial importance for dyslexic
students to have the same opportunities as non-dyslexic ones. However,
generally, people underestimate the problem and are not aware of the importance
of support methodologies. In the light of this, the main purpose of this paper
is to propose a virtual reality (VR) serious game through which teachers,
students and, in general, non-dyslexic people could understand which are some
of the issues of student with dyslexia and the fundamental utility of offering
support to them. In the game, players must create a potion by following a
recipe written in an alphabet that is specifically designed to replicate the
reading difficulties experienced by individuals with dyslexia. The task must be
solved first without any help and then by receiving supporting tools and
strategies with the idea that the player can put himself in the place of the
dyslexic person and understand the real need for support methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">In online advertising scenario, sellers often create multiple creatives to
provide comprehensive demonstrations, making it essential to present the most
appealing design to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, sellers
generally struggle to consider users preferences for creative design, leading
to the relatively lower aesthetics and quantities compared to Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based approaches. Traditional AI-based approaches still face
the same problem of not considering user information while having limited
aesthetic knowledge from designers. In fact that fusing the user information,
the generated creatives can be more attractive because different users may have
different preferences. To optimize the results, the generated creatives in
traditional methods are then ranked by another module named creative ranking
model. The ranking model can predict the CTR score for each creative
considering user features. However, the two above stages are regarded as two
different tasks and are optimized separately. In this paper, we proposed a new
automated Creative Generation pipeline for Click-Through Rate (CG4CTR) with the
goal of improving CTR during the creative generation stage. Our contributions
have 4 parts: 1) The inpainting mode in stable diffusion is firstly applied to
creative generation task in online advertising scene. A self-cyclic generation
pipeline is proposed to ensure the convergence of training. 2) Prompt model is
designed to generate individualized creatives for different user groups, which
can further improve the diversity and quality. 3) Reward model comprehensively
considers the multimodal features of image and text to improve the
effectiveness of creative ranking task, and it is also critical in self-cyclic
pipeline. 4) The significant benefits obtained in online and offline
experiments verify the significance of our proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents are designed to automate complex tasks
on digital devices, such as smartphones and desktops. Most existing GUI agents
interact with the environment through extracted structured data, which can be
notably lengthy (e.g., HTML) and occasionally inaccessible (e.g., on desktops).
To alleviate this issue, we propose a visual GUI agent -- SeeClick, which only
relies on screenshots for task automation. In our preliminary study, we have
discovered a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding --
the capacity to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. To
tackle this challenge, we propose to enhance SeeClick with GUI grounding
pre-training and devise a method to automate the curation of GUI grounding
data. Along with the efforts above, we have also created ScreenSpot, the first
realistic GUI grounding dataset that encompasses mobile, desktop, and web
environments. After pre-training, SeeClick demonstrates significant improvement
in ScreenSpot over various baselines. Moreover, comprehensive evaluations on
three widely used benchmarks consistently support our finding that advancements
in GUI grounding directly correlate with enhanced performance in downstream GUI
agent tasks. The model, data and code are available at
https://github.com/njucckevin/SeeClick.

<p class="mathjax">EXplainable AI has received significant attention in recent years. Machine
learning models often operate as black boxes, lacking explainability and
transparency while supporting decision-making processes. Local post-hoc
explainability queries attempt to answer why individual inputs are classified
in a certain way by a given model. While there has been important work on
counterfactual explanations, less attention has been devoted to semifactual
ones. In this paper, we focus on local post-hoc explainability queries within
the semifactual `even-if' thinking and their computational complexity among
different classes of models, and show that both linear and tree-based models
are strictly more interpretable than neural networks. After this, we introduce
a preference-based framework that enables users to personalize explanations
based on their preferences, both in the case of semifactuals and
counterfactuals, enhancing interpretability and user-centricity. Finally, we
explore the complexity of several interpretability problems in the proposed
preference-based framework and provide algorithms for polynomial cases.

<p class="mathjax">Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train
agents using human feedback through pairwise preferences over pairs of
behaviors, enabling agents to learn desired behaviors when it is difficult to
specify a numerical reward function. While this paradigm leverages human
feedback, it currently treats the feedback as given by a single human user.
Meanwhile, incorporating preference feedback from crowds (i.e. ensembles of
users) in a robust manner remains a challenge, and the problem of training RL
agents using feedback from multiple human users remains understudied. In this
work, we introduce Crowd-PrefRL, a framework for performing preference-based RL
leveraging feedback from crowds. This work demonstrates the viability of
learning reward functions from preference feedback provided by crowds of
unknown expertise and reliability. Crowd-PrefRL not only robustly aggregates
the crowd preference feedback, but also estimates the reliability of each user
within the crowd using only the (noisy) crowdsourced preference comparisons.
Most importantly, we show that agents trained with Crowd-PrefRL outperform
agents trained with majority-vote preferences or preferences from any
individual user in most cases, especially when the spread of user error rates
among the crowd is large. Results further suggest that our method can identify
minority viewpoints within the crowd.

<p class="mathjax">This review explores machine unlearning (MUL) in recommendation systems,
addressing adaptability, personalization, privacy, and bias challenges. Unlike
traditional models, MUL dynamically adjusts system knowledge based on shifts in
user preferences and ethical considerations. The paper critically examines
MUL's basics, real-world applications, and challenges like algorithmic
transparency. It sifts through literature, offering insights into how MUL could
transform recommendations, discussing user trust, and suggesting paths for
future research in responsible and user-focused artificial intelligence (AI).
The document guides researchers through challenges involving the trade-off
between personalization and privacy, encouraging contributions to meet
practical demands for targeted data removal. Emphasizing MUL's role in secure
and adaptive machine learning, the paper proposes ways to push its boundaries.
The novelty of this paper lies in its exploration of the limitations of the
methods, which highlights exciting prospects for advancing the field.

<p class="mathjax">State-of-the-art vehicle dynamics estimation techniques usually share one
common drawback: each variable to estimate is computed with an independent,
simplified filtering module. These modules run in parallel and need to be
calibrated separately. To solve this issue, a unified Twin-in-the-Loop (TiL)
Observer architecture has recently been proposed: the classical simplified
control-oriented vehicle model in the estimators is replaced by a full-fledged
vehicle simulator, or digital twin (DT). The states of the DT are corrected in
real time with a linear time invariant output error law. Since the simulator is
a black-box, no explicit analytical formulation is available, hence classical
filter tuning techniques cannot be used. Due to this reason, Bayesian
Optimization will be used to solve a data-driven optimization problem to tune
the filter. Due to the complexity of the DT, the optimization problem is
high-dimensional. This paper aims to find a procedure to tune the
high-complexity observer by lowering its dimensionality. In particular, in this
work we will analyze both a supervised and an unsupervised learning approach.
The strategies have been validated for speed and yaw-rate estimation on
real-world data.

<p class="mathjax">Emotion recognition plays a crucial role in various domains of human-robot
interaction. In long-term interactions with humans, robots need to respond
continuously and accurately, however, the mainstream emotion recognition
methods mostly focus on short-term emotion recognition, disregarding the
context in which emotions are perceived. Humans consider that contextual
information and different contexts can lead to completely different emotional
expressions. In this paper, we introduce self context-aware model (SCAM) that
employs a two-dimensional emotion coordinate system for anchoring and
re-labeling distinct emotions. Simultaneously, it incorporates its distinctive
information retention structure and contextual loss. This approach has yielded
significant improvements across audio, video, and multimodal. In the auditory
modality, there has been a notable enhancement in accuracy, rising from 63.10%
to 72.46%. Similarly, the visual modality has demonstrated improved accuracy,
increasing from 77.03% to 80.82%. In the multimodal, accuracy has experienced
an elevation from 77.48% to 78.93%. In the future, we will validate the
reliability and usability of SCAM on robots through psychology experiments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper explores the integration of optimal transport (OT) theory with
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). This integration uses OT to handle
distributions and transportation problems to enhance the efficiency,
coordination, and adaptability of MARL. There are five key areas where OT can
impact MARL: (1) policy alignment, where OT's Wasserstein metric is used to
align divergent agent strategies towards unified goals; (2) distributed
resource management, employing OT to optimize resource allocation among agents;
(3) addressing non-stationarity, using OT to adapt to dynamic environmental
shifts; (4) scalable multi-agent learning, harnessing OT for decomposing
large-scale learning objectives into manageable tasks; and (5) enhancing energy
efficiency, applying OT principles to develop sustainable MARL systems. This
paper articulates how the synergy between OT and MARL can address scalability
issues, optimize resource distribution, align agent policies in cooperative
environments, and ensure adaptability in dynamically changing conditions.

<p class="mathjax">To ensure the proper functioning of the current and future electrical grid,
it is necessary for Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to verify that energy
providers comply with the grid code and specifications provided by TSOs. A lot
of energy production are conntected to the grid through a power electronic
inverter. Grid Forming (GFM) and Grid Following (GFL) are the two types of
operating modes used to control power electronic converters. The choice of
control mode by TSOs to avoid impacting the stability of the grid is crucial,
as is the commitment to these choices by energy suppliers. This article
proposes a comparison between commonplace machine learning algorithms for
converter control mode classification: GFL or GFM. The classification is based
on frequency-domain admittance obtained by external measurement methods. Most
algorithms are able to classify accurately when the control structure belongs
to the training data, but they fail to classify modified control structures
with the exception of the random forest algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Our goal is to learn about the political interests and preferences of the
Members of Parliament by mining their parliamentary activity, in order to
develop a recommendation/filtering system that, given a stream of documents to
be distributed among them, is able to decide which documents should receive
each Member of Parliament. We propose to use positive unlabeled learning to
tackle this problem, because we only have information about relevant documents
(the own interventions of each Member of Parliament in the debates) but not
about irrelevant documents, so that we cannot use standard binary classifiers
trained with positive and negative examples. We have also developed a new
algorithm of this type, which compares favourably with: a) the baseline
approach assuming that all the interventions of other Members of Parliament are
irrelevant, b) another well-known positive unlabeled learning method and c) an
approach based on information retrieval methods that matches documents and
legislators' representations. The experiments have been carried out with data
from the regional Andalusian Parliament at Spain.

<p class="mathjax">Visual fine-tuning has garnered significant attention with the rise of
pre-trained vision models. The current prevailing method, full fine-tuning,
suffers from the issue of knowledge forgetting as it focuses solely on fitting
the downstream training set. In this paper, we propose a novel weight
rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step
Review). OLOR combines fine-tuning with optimizers, incorporating a weight
rollback term into the weight update term at each step. This ensures
consistency in the weight range of upstream and downstream models, effectively
mitigating knowledge forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance. In
addition, a layer-wise penalty is presented to employ penalty decay and the
diversified decay rate to adjust the weight rollback levels of layers for
adapting varying downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on various
tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation,
and instance segmentation, we demonstrate the general applicability and
state-of-the-art performance of our proposed OLOR. Code is available at
https://github.com/rainbow-xiao/OLOR-AAAI-2024.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we examine the problem of building a user profile from a set
of documents. This profile will consist of a subset of the most representative
terms in the documents that best represent user preferences or interests.
Inspired by the discrete concentration theory we have conducted an axiomatic
study of seven properties that a selection function should fulfill: the minimum
and maximum uncertainty principle, invariant to adding zeros, invariant to
scale transformations, principle of nominal increase, transfer principle and
the richest get richer inequality. We also present a novel selection function
based on the use of similarity metrics, and more specifically the cosine
measure which is commonly used in information retrieval, and demonstrate that
this verifies six of the properties in addition to a weaker variant of the
transfer principle, thereby representing a good selection approach. The
theoretical study was complemented with an empirical study to compare the
performance of different selection criteria (weight- and unweight-based) using
real data in a parliamentary setting. In this study, we analyze the performance
of the different functions focusing on the two main factors affecting the
selection process: profile size (number of terms) and weight distribution.
These profiles are then used in a document filtering task to show that our
similarity-based approach performs well in terms not only of recommendation
accuracy but also efficiency (we obtain smaller profiles and consequently
faster recommendations).

<p class="mathjax">One of the major challenges in the coordination of large, open,
collaborative, and commercial vehicle fleets is dynamic task allocation.
Self-concerned individually rational vehicle drivers have both local and global
objectives, which require coordination using some fair and efficient task
allocation method. In this paper, we review the literature on scalable and
dynamic task allocation focusing on deterministic and dynamic two-dimensional
linear assignment problems. We focus on multiagent system representation of
open vehicle fleets where dynamically appearing vehicles are represented by
software agents that should be allocated to a set of dynamically appearing
tasks. We give a comparison and critical analysis of recent research results
focusing on centralized, distributed, and decentralized solution approaches.
Moreover, we propose mathematical models for dynamic versions of the following
assignment problems well known in combinatorial optimization: the assignment
problem, bottleneck assignment problem, fair matching problem, dynamic minimum
deviation assignment problem, $\sum_{k}$-assignment problem, the semiassignment
problem, the assignment problem with side constraints, and the assignment
problem while recognizing agent qualification; all while considering the main
aspect of open vehicle fleets: random arrival of tasks and vehicles (agents)
that may become available after assisting previous tasks or by participating in
the fleet at times based on individual interest.

<p class="mathjax">Recently proposed methods for implicitly representing signals such as images,
scenes, or geometries using coordinate-based neural network architectures often
do not leverage the choice of activation functions, or do so only to a limited
extent. In this paper, we introduce the Hyperbolic Oscillation function (HOSC),
a novel activation function with a controllable sharpness parameter. Unlike any
previous activations, HOSC has been specifically designed to better capture
sudden changes in the input signal, and hence sharp or acute features of the
underlying data, as well as smooth low-frequency transitions. Due to its
simplicity and modularity, HOSC offers a plug-and-play functionality that can
be easily incorporated into any existing method employing a neural network as a
way of implicitly representing a signal. We benchmark HOSC against other
popular activations in an array of general tasks, empirically showing an
improvement in the quality of obtained representations, provide the
mathematical motivation behind the efficacy of HOSC, and discuss its
limitations.

<p class="mathjax">Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate
methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of
simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation,
collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent
progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots,
vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods
and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled
way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based
coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour
in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding
collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm
of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm
behaviour block as a pure function mapping sensing fields into actuation goal
fields, e.g. including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the
expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework
for collective intelligence, we perform a variety of simulations covering
common patterns of flocking, morphogenesis, and collective decision-making.

<p class="mathjax">Communication stands as a potent mechanism to harmonize the behaviors of
multiple agents. However, existing works primarily concentrate on broadcast
communication, which not only lacks practicality, but also leads to information
redundancy. This surplus, one-fits-all information could adversely impact the
communication efficiency. Furthermore, existing works often resort to basic
mechanisms to integrate observed and received information, impairing the
learning process. To tackle these difficulties, we propose Targeted and Trusted
Multi-Agent Communication (T2MAC), a straightforward yet effective method that
enables agents to learn selective engagement and evidence-driven integration.
With T2MAC, agents have the capability to craft individualized messages,
pinpoint ideal communication windows, and engage with reliable partners,
thereby refining communication efficiency. Following the reception of messages,
the agents integrate information observed and received from different sources
at an evidence level. This process enables agents to collectively use evidence
garnered from multiple perspectives, fostering trusted and cooperative
behaviors. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of cooperative multi-agent
tasks, with varying difficulties, involving different scales and ranging from
Hallway, MPE to SMAC. The experiments indicate that the proposed model not only
surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of cooperative performance and
communication efficiency, but also exhibits impressive generalization.

<p class="mathjax">This letter focuses on the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer design for a class
of nonlinear discrete systems under the presence of measurement noise or
external disturbances. A novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition is
developed in this method through the utilisation of the reformulated Lipschitz
property, a new variant of Young inequality and the well-known Linear Parameter
Varying (LPV) approach. One of the key components of the proposed LMI is the
generalised matrix multipliers. The deliberate use of these multipliers enables
us to introduce more numbers of decision variables inside LMIs than the one
illustrated in the literature. It aids in adding some extra degrees of freedom
from a feasibility point of view, thus enhancing the LMI conditions. Thus, the
proposed LMIs are less conservative than existing ones. Later on, the
effectiveness of the developed LMIs and observer is highlighted through the
numerical example and an application of state of charge (SoC) estimation in the
Li-ion battery model.

<p class="mathjax">We present the Radiation Oncology NLP Database (ROND), the first dedicated
Natural Language Processing (NLP) dataset for radiation oncology, an important
medical specialty that has received limited attention from the NLP community in
the past. With the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is an
increasing need for specialized datasets and benchmarks to facilitate research
and development. ROND is specifically designed to address this gap in the
domain of radiation oncology, a field that offers many opportunities for NLP
exploration. It encompasses various NLP tasks including Logic Reasoning, Text
Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Question Answering (QA), Text
Summarization, and Patient-Clinician Conversations, each with a distinct focus
on radiation oncology concepts and application cases. In addition, we have
developed an instruction-tuning dataset consisting of over 20k instruction
pairs (based on ROND) and trained a large language model, CancerChat. This
serves to demonstrate the potential of instruction-tuning large language models
within a highly-specialized medical domain. The evaluation results in this
study could serve as baseline results for future research. ROND aims to
stimulate advancements in radiation oncology and clinical NLP by offering a
platform for testing and improving algorithms and models in a domain-specific
context. The ROND dataset is a joint effort of multiple U.S. health
institutions. The data is available at
https://github.com/zl-liu/Radiation-Oncology-NLP-Database.

<p class="mathjax">Modular soft robots have shown higher potential in sophisticated tasks than
single-module robots. However, the modular structure incurs the complexity of
accurate control and necessitates a control strategy specifically for modular
robots. In this paper, we introduce a data collection strategy and a novel and
accurate bidirectional LSTM configuration controller for modular soft robots
with module number adaptability. Such a controller can control module
configurations in robots with different module numbers. Simulation cable-driven
robots and real pneumatic robots have been included in experiments to validate
the proposed approaches, and we have proven that our controller can be
leveraged even with the increase or decrease of module number. This is the
first paper that gets inspiration from the physical structure of modular robots
and utilizes bidirectional LSTM for module number adaptability. Future work may
include a planning method that bridges the task and configuration spaces and
the integration of an online controller.

<p class="mathjax">Virtual Reality (VR) bares promise of social interactions that can feel more
immersive than other media. Key to this is the ability to accurately animate a
photorealistic avatar of one's likeness while wearing a VR headset. Although
high quality registration of person-specific avatars to headset-mounted camera
(HMC) images is possible in an offline setting, the performance of generic
realtime models are significantly degraded. Online registration is also
challenging due to oblique camera views and differences in modality. In this
work, we first show that the domain gap between the avatar and headset-camera
images is one of the primary sources of difficulty, where a transformer-based
architecture achieves high accuracy on domain-consistent data, but degrades
when the domain-gap is re-introduced. Building on this finding, we develop a
system design that decouples the problem into two parts: 1) an iterative
refinement module that takes in-domain inputs, and 2) a generic avatar-guided
image-to-image style transfer module that is conditioned on current estimation
of expression and head pose. These two modules reinforce each other, as image
style transfer becomes easier when close-to-ground-truth examples are shown,
and better domain-gap removal helps registration. Our system produces
high-quality results efficiently, obviating the need for costly offline
registration to generate personalized labels. We validate the accuracy and
efficiency of our approach through extensive experiments on a commodity
headset, demonstrating significant improvements over direct regression methods
as well as offline registration.

<p class="mathjax">During deep sleep and under anaesthesia spontaneous patterns of cortical
activation frequently take the form of slow travelling waves. Slow wave sleep
is an important cognitive state especially because of its relevance for memory
consolidation. However, despite extensive research the exact mechanisms are
still ill-understood. Novel methods such as high speed widefield imaging of
GCamP activity offer new potentials. Here we show how data recorded from
transgenic mice under anesthesia can be processed to analyze sources, sinks and
patterns of flow. To make the best possible use of the data novel means of data
processing are necessary. Therefore, we (1) give a an brief account on
processes that play a role in generating slow waves and demonstrate (2) a novel
approach to characterize its patterns in GCamP recordings. While slow waves are
highly variable, it shows that some are surprisingly similar. To enable
quantitative means of analysis and examine the structure of such prototypical
events we propose a novel approach for the characterization of slow waves: The
Helmholtz-Decomposition of gradient-based Dense Optical Flow of the pixeldense
GCamP contrast (df/f). It allows to detect the sources and sinks of activation
and discern them from global patterns of neural flow. Aggregated features can
be analyzed with variational autoencoders. The results unravel regularities
between slow waves and shows how they relate to the experimental conditions.
The approach reveals a complex topology of different features in latent slow
wave space and identifies prototypical examples for each stage.

<p class="mathjax">A common theory of choice posits that individuals make choices in a two-step
process, first selecting some subset of the alternatives to consider before
making a selection from the resulting consideration set. However, inferring
unobserved consideration sets (or item consideration probabilities) in this
"consider then choose" setting poses significant challenges, because even
simple models of consideration with strong independence assumptions are not
identifiable, even if item utilities are known. We consider a natural extension
of consider-then-choose models to a top-$k$ ranking setting, where we assume
rankings are constructed according to a Plackett-Luce model after sampling a
consideration set. While item consideration probabilities remain non-identified
in this setting, we prove that knowledge of item utilities allows us to infer
bounds on the relative sizes of consideration probabilities. Additionally,
given a condition on the expected consideration set size, we derive absolute
upper and lower bounds on item consideration probabilities. We also provide
algorithms to tighten those bounds on consideration probabilities by
propagating inferred constraints. Thus, we show that we can learn useful
information about consideration probabilities despite not being able to
identify them precisely. We demonstrate our methods on a ranking dataset from a
psychology experiment with two different ranking tasks (one with fixed
consideration sets and one with unknown consideration sets). This combination
of data allows us to estimate utilities and then learn about unknown
consideration probabilities using our bounds.

<p class="mathjax">We study federated unlearning, a novel problem to eliminate the impact of
specific clients or data points on the global model learned via federated
learning (FL). This problem is driven by the right to be forgotten and the
privacy challenges in FL. We introduce a new framework for exact federated
unlearning that meets two essential criteria: \textit{communication efficiency}
and \textit{exact unlearning provability}. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to tackle both aspects coherently. We start by giving a rigorous
definition of \textit{exact} federated unlearning, which guarantees that the
unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without
the deleted data. We then pinpoint the key property that enables fast exact
federated unlearning: total variation (TV) stability, which measures the
sensitivity of the model parameters to slight changes in the dataset.
Leveraging this insight, we develop a TV-stable FL algorithm called
\texttt{FATS}, which modifies the classical
\texttt{\underline{F}ed\underline{A}vg} algorithm for \underline{T}V
\underline{S}tability and employs local SGD with periodic averaging to lower
the communication round. We also design efficient unlearning algorithms for
\texttt{FATS} under two settings: client-level and sample-level unlearning. We
provide theoretical guarantees for our learning and unlearning algorithms,
proving that they achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable
convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models. We empirically
validate our framework on 6 benchmark datasets, and show its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation
cost, and unlearning efficacy.

<p class="mathjax">Hate speech is harmful content that directly attacks or promotes hatred
against members of groups or individuals based on actual or perceived aspects
of identity, such as racism, religion, or sexual orientation. This can affect
social life on social media platforms as hateful content shared through social
media can harm both individuals and communities. As the prevalence of hate
speech increases online, the demand for automated detection as an NLP task is
increasing. In this work, the proposed method is using transformer-based model
to detect hate speech in social media, like twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp,
Instagram, etc. The proposed model is independent of languages and has been
tested on Italian, English, German, Bengali. The Gold standard datasets were
collected from renowned researcher Zeerak Talat, Sara Tonelli, Melanie Siegel,
and Rezaul Karim. The success rate of the proposed model for hate speech
detection is higher than the existing baseline and state-of-the-art models with
accuracy in Bengali dataset is 89%, in English: 91%, in German dataset 91% and
in Italian dataset it is 77%. The proposed algorithm shows substantial
improvement to the benchmark method.

<p class="mathjax">Interactive systems that facilitate exposure to examples can augment problem
solving performance. However designers of such systems are often faced with
many practical design decisions about how users will interact with examples,
with little clear theoretical guidance. To understand how example interaction
design choices affect whether/how people benefit from examples, we conducted an
experiment where 182 participants worked on a controlled analog to an
exploratory creativity task, with access to examples of varying diversity and
presentation interfaces. Task performance was worse when examples were
presented in a list, compared to contextualized in the exploration space or
shown in a dropdown list. Example lists were associated with more fixation,
whereas contextualized examples were associated with using examples to
formulate a model of the problem space to guide exploration. We discuss
implications of these results for a theoretical framework that maps design
choices to fundamental psychological mechanisms of creative inspiration from
examples.

<p class="mathjax">Various static analysis problems are reformulated as instances of the
Context-Free Language Reachability (CFL-r) problem. One promising way to make
solving CFL-r more practical for large-scale interprocedural graphs is to
reduce CFL-r to linear algebra operations on sparse matrices, as they are
efficiently executed on modern hardware. In this work, we present five
optimizations for a matrix-based CFL-r algorithm that utilize the specific
properties of both the underlying semiring and the widely-used linear algebra
library SuiteSparse:GraphBlas. Our experimental results show that these
optimizations result in orders of magnitude speedup, with the optimized
matrix-based CFL-r algorithm consistently outperforming state-of-the-art CFL-r
solvers across four considered static analyses.

<p class="mathjax">Vehicles today comprise intelligent systems like connected autonomous driving
and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) to enhance the driving
experience, which is enabled through increased connectivity to infrastructure
and fusion of information from different sensing modes. However, the rising
connectivity coupled with the legacy network architecture within vehicles can
be exploited for launching active and passive attacks on critical vehicle
systems and directly affecting the safety of passengers. Machine learning-based
intrusion detection models have been shown to successfully detect multiple
targeted attack vectors in recent literature, whose deployments are enabled
through quantised neural networks targeting low-power platforms. Multiple
models are often required to simultaneously detect multiple attack vectors,
increasing the area, (resource) cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, we
present a case for utilising custom-quantised MLP's (CQMLP) as a multi-class
classification model, capable of detecting multiple attacks from the benign
flow of controller area network (CAN) messages. The specific quantisation and
neural architecture are determined through a joint design space exploration,
resulting in our choice of the 2-bit precision and the n-layer MLP. Our 2-bit
version is trained using Brevitas and optimised as a dataflow hardware model
through the FINN toolflow from AMD/Xilinx, targeting an XCZU7EV device. We show
that the 2-bit CQMLP model, when integrated as the IDS, can detect malicious
attack messages (DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attack) with a very high accuracy
of 99.9%, on par with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.
Furthermore, the dataflow model can perform line rate detection at a latency of
0.11 ms from message reception while consuming 0.23 mJ/inference, making it
ideally suited for integration with an ECU in critical CAN networks.

<p class="mathjax">Social media has become a critical tool for journalists to disseminate their
work, engage with their audience, and connect with sources. Unfortunately,
journalists also regularly endure significant online harassment on social media
platforms, ranging from personal attacks to doxxing to threats of physical
harm. In this paper, we seek to understand how we can make social media usable
for journalists who face constant digital harassment. To begin, we conduct a
set of need-finding interviews to understand where existing platform tools and
newsroom resources fall short in adequately protecting journalists. We map
journalists' unmet needs to concrete design goals, which we use to build
PressProtect, an interface that provides journalists greater agency over
engaging with readers on Twitter/X. Through user testing with eight
journalists, we evaluate PressProtect and find that participants felt it
effectively protected them against harassment and could also generalize to
serve other visible and vulnerable groups. We conclude with a discussion of our
findings and recommendations for social platforms hoping to build defensive
defaults for journalists facing online harassment.

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms are being increasingly used by malicious actors to
share unsafe content, such as images depicting sexual activity, cyberbullying,
and self-harm. Consequently, major platforms use artificial intelligence (AI)
and human moderation to obfuscate such images to make them safer. Two critical
needs for obfuscating unsafe images is that an accurate rationale for
obfuscating image regions must be provided, and the sensitive regions should be
obfuscated (\textit{e.g.} blurring) for users' safety. This process involves
addressing two key problems: (1) the reason for obfuscating unsafe images
demands the platform to provide an accurate rationale that must be grounded in
unsafe image-specific attributes, and (2) the unsafe regions in the image must
be minimally obfuscated while still depicting the safe regions. In this work,
we address these key issues by first performing visual reasoning by designing a
visual reasoning model (VLM) conditioned on pre-trained unsafe image
classifiers to provide an accurate rationale grounded in unsafe image
attributes, and then proposing a counterfactual explanation algorithm that
minimally identifies and obfuscates unsafe regions for safe viewing, by first
utilizing an unsafe image classifier attribution matrix to guide segmentation
for a more optimal subregion segmentation followed by an informed greedy search
to determine the minimum number of subregions required to modify the
classifier's output based on attribution score. Extensive experiments on
uncurated data from social networks emphasize the efficacy of our proposed
method. We make our code available at:

<p class="mathjax">Modeling the complex three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of relational systems is
an important problem in the natural sciences, with applications ranging from
molecular simulations to particle mechanics. Machine learning methods have
achieved good success by learning graph neural networks to model spatial
interactions. However, these approaches do not faithfully capture temporal
correlations since they only model next-step predictions. In this work, we
propose Equivariant Graph Neural Operator (EGNO), a novel and principled method
that directly models dynamics as trajectories instead of just next-step
prediction. Different from existing methods, EGNO explicitly learns the
temporal evolution of 3D dynamics where we formulate the dynamics as a function
over time and learn neural operators to approximate it. To capture the temporal
correlations while keeping the intrinsic SE(3)-equivariance, we develop
equivariant temporal convolutions parameterized in the Fourier space and build
EGNO by stacking the Fourier layers over equivariant networks. EGNO is the
first operator learning framework that is capable of modeling solution dynamics
functions over time while retaining 3D equivariance. Comprehensive experiments
in multiple domains, including particle simulations, human motion capture, and
molecular dynamics, demonstrate the significantly superior performance of EGNO
against existing methods, thanks to the equivariant temporal modeling.

the Internet of Things (IoT), and spatial computing concepts to create
hyper-connected spaces for metaverse applications; envisioning space as zones
that are social, smart, scalable, expressive, and agent-based. These zone
agents serve as applications and agents (partners, assistants, or guides) for
users co-living and co-operating together in a shared spatial context. The zone
agent concept is toward reducing the gap between the physical environment

interactions for future metaverse applications. This integration aims to enrich
user engagement with their environments through intuitive and immersive
experiences and pave the way for innovative human-machine interaction in smart
spaces. Contributions include: i) a theoretical framework for creating XRI
zone/space-agents using Mixed-Reality Agents (MiRAs) and XRI theory, ii) agent

<p class="mathjax">Human cognitive performance is enhanced by the use of tools. For example, a
human can produce a much greater, and more accurate, volume of mathematical
calculation in a unit of time using a calculator or a spreadsheet application
on a computer. Such tools have taken over the burden of lower level cognitive
grunt work but the human still serves the role of the expert performing higher
level thinking and reasoning. Recently, however, unsupervised, deep, machine
learning has produced cognitive systems able to outperform humans in several
domains. When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive
ability of the human is augmented. In some cases, even non experts can achieve,
and even exceed, the performance of experts in a particular domain, synthetic
expertise. A new cognitive system, ChatGPT, has burst onto the scene during the
past year. This paper investigates human cognitive augmentation due to using
ChatGPT by presenting the results of two experiments comparing responses
created using ChatGPT with results created not using ChatGPT. We find using
ChatGPT does not always result in cognitive augmentation and does not yet
replace human judgement, discernment, and evaluation in certain types of tasks.
In fact, ChatGPT was observed to result in misleading users resulting in
negative cognitive augmentation.

<p class="mathjax">The applicability of widely adopted machine learning (ML) methods to
classification is circumscribed by the imperatives of explicability and
uncertainty, particularly evident in domains such as healthcare, behavioural
sciences, and finances, wherein accountability assumes priority. Recently,
Small and Incomplete Dataset Analyser (SaNDA) has been proposed to enhance the
ability to perform classification in such domains, by developing a data
abstraction protocol using a ROC curve-based method. This paper focuses on
column-wise data transformations called abstractions, which are crucial for
SaNDA's classification process and explores alternative abstractions protocols,
such as constant binning and quantiles. The best-performing methods have been
compared against Random Forest as a baseline for explainable methods. The
results suggests that SaNDA can be a viable substitute for Random Forest when
data is incomplete, even with minimal missing values. It consistently maintains
high accuracy even when half of the dataset is missing, unlike Random Forest
which experiences a significant decline in accuracy under similar conditions.

language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo in the
extraction of structured information from scientific documents within the field
of materials science. We introduce a novel methodology for the comparative
analysis of intricate material expressions, emphasising the standardisation of
chemical formulas to tackle the complexities inherent in materials science
information assessment. To this end, we primarily focus on two critical tasks
of information extraction: (i) a named entity recognition (NER) of studied
materials and physical properties and (ii) a relation extraction (RE) between
these entities. The performance of LLMs in executing these tasks is benchmarked
against traditional models based on the BERT architecture and rule-based
approaches. For NER, LLMs fail to outperform the baseline with zero-shot
prompting and exhibit only limited improvement with few-shot prompting.
However, for RE, a GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned with the appropriate strategy
outperforms all models, including the baseline. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4
and GPT-4-Turbo display remarkable reasoning and relationship extraction
capabilities after being provided with merely a couple of examples, surpassing
the baseline. Overall, the results suggest that although LLMs demonstrate
relevant reasoning skills in connecting concepts, for tasks requiring
extracting complex domain-specific entities like materials, specialised models
are currently a better choice.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has garnered
considerable attention due to its robustness against doubly-selective wireless
channels. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity iterative successive
interference cancellation based minimum mean squared error (SIC-MMSE) detection
algorithm for zero-padded OTFS (ZP-OTFS) modulation. In the proposed algorithm,
signals are detected based on layers processed by multiple SIC-MMSE linear
filters for each sub-channel, with interference on the targeted signal layer
being successively canceled either by hard or soft information. To reduce the
complexity of computing individual layer filter coefficients, we also propose a
novel filter coefficients recycling approach in place of generating the exact
form of MMSE filter weights. Moreover, we design a joint detection and decoding
algorithm for ZP-OTFS to enhance error performance. Compared to the
conventional SIC-MMSE detection, our proposed algorithms outperform other
linear detectors, e.g., maximal ratio combining (MRC), for ZP-OTFS with up to 3
dB gain while maintaining comparable computation complexity.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for automated photo acquisition based on
an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot
photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via
a reference picture that is retrieved from a curated gallery. We exploit a
visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize reference
pictures via textual descriptions and use a large language model (LLM) to
retrieve relevant reference pictures based on a user's language query through
text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference picture and the observed
scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of
capturing semantic similarity across significantly varying images. Using these
features, we compute pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world
manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos
taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by
users themselves, as measured by human feedback.

<p class="mathjax">Histologic examination plays a crucial role in oncology research and
diagnostics. The adoption of digital scanning of whole slide images (WSI) has
created an opportunity to leverage deep learning-based image classification
methods to enhance diagnosis and risk stratification. Technical limitations of
current approaches to training deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) result
in suboptimal model performance and make training and deployment of
comprehensive classification models unobtainable. In this study, we introduce a
novel approach that addresses the main limitations of traditional
histopathology classification model training. Our method, termed Learned
Resizing with Efficient Training (LRET), couples efficient training techniques
with image resizing to facilitate seamless integration of larger histology
image patches into state-of-the-art classification models while preserving
important structural information.
<br />We used the LRET method coupled with two distinct resizing techniques to
train three diverse histology image datasets using multiple diverse DCNN
architectures. Our findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in
classification performance and training efficiency. Across the spectrum of
experiments, LRET consistently outperforms existing methods, yielding a
substantial improvement of 15-28% in accuracy for a large-scale, multiclass
tumor classification task consisting of 74 distinct brain tumor types. LRET not
only elevates classification accuracy but also substantially reduces training
times, unlocking the potential for faster model development and iteration. The
implications of this work extend to broader applications within medical imaging
and beyond, where efficient integration of high-resolution images into deep
learning pipelines is paramount for driving advancements in research and
clinical practice.

performed this study because ethical concerns in mobile applications (apps) are
widespread, pose severe threats to end users and society, and lack systematic
analysis and methods for detection and classification. In addition, app store
reviews allow practitioners to collect users' perspectives, crucial for
identifying software flaws, from a geographically distributed and large-scale
audience. For our analysis, we collected five million user reviews, developed a
set of ethical concerns representative of user preferences, and manually
labeled a sample of these reviews. We found that (1) users highly report
ethical concerns about censorship, identity theft, and safety (2) user reviews
with ethical concerns are longer, more popular, and lowly rated, and (3) there
is high automation potential for the classification and filtering of these
reviews. Our results highlight the relevance of using app store reviews for the
systematic consideration of ethical concerns during software evolution.

<p class="mathjax">Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows computations to be directly carried out on
ciphertexts and enables privacy-preserving cloud computing. The computations on
the coefficients of the polynomials involved in HE are always followed by
modular reduction, and the overall complexity of ciphertext multiplication can
be reduced by utilizing the quotient. Our previous design considers the cases
that the dividend is an integer multiple of the modulus and the modulus is in
the format of $2^w-2^u\pm1$, where $u&lt;w/2$. In this paper, the division is
generalized for larger $u$ and dividend not an integer multiple of the modulus.
An algorithm is proposed to compute the quotient and vigorous mathematical
proofs are provided. Moreover, efficient hardware architecture is developed for
implementing the proposed algorithm. Compared to alternative division
approaches that utilize the inverse of the divisor, for $w=32$, the proposed
design achieves at least 9% shorter latency and 79\% area reduction for 75%
possible values of $u$.

<p class="mathjax">Significant progress has been made in training large generative models for
natural language and images. Yet, the advancement of 3D generative models is
hindered by their substantial resource demands for training, along with
inefficient, non-compact, and less expressive representations. This paper
introduces Make-A-Shape, a new 3D generative model designed for efficient
training on a vast scale, capable of utilizing 10 millions publicly-available
shapes. Technical-wise, we first innovate a wavelet-tree representation to
compactly encode shapes by formulating the subband coefficient filtering scheme
to efficiently exploit coefficient relations. We then make the representation
generatable by a diffusion model by devising the subband coefficients packing
scheme to layout the representation in a low-resolution grid. Further, we
derive the subband adaptive training strategy to train our model to effectively
learn to generate coarse and detail wavelet coefficients. Last, we extend our
framework to be controlled by additional input conditions to enable it to
generate shapes from assorted modalities, e.g., single/multi-view images, point
clouds, and low-resolution voxels. In our extensive set of experiments, we
demonstrate various applications, such as unconditional generation, shape
completion, and conditional generation on a wide range of modalities. Our
approach not only surpasses the state of the art in delivering high-quality
results but also efficiently generates shapes within a few seconds, often
achieving this in just 2 seconds for most conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling
complex relationships in graph-structured data. A recent innovation in this
field is the family of Differential Equation-Inspired Graph Neural Networks
(DE-GNNs), which leverage principles from continuous dynamical systems to model
information flow on graphs with built-in properties such as feature smoothing
or preservation. However, existing DE-GNNs rely on first or second-order
temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a neural extension to those
pre-defined temporal dependencies. We show that our model, called TDE-GNN, can
capture a wide range of temporal dynamics that go beyond typical first or

challenged. We demonstrate the benefit of learning the temporal dependencies
using our method rather than using pre-defined temporal dynamics on several

<p class="mathjax">The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years
has resulted in a significant surge in the number of cyber-attacks targeting
these devices. Recent data indicates that the number of such attacks has
increased by over 100 percent, highlighting the urgent need for robust
cybersecurity measures to mitigate these threats. In addition, a cyber-attack
will begin to spread malware across the network once it has successfully
compromised an IoT network. However, to mitigate this attack, a new patch must
be applied immediately. In reality, the time required to prepare and apply the
new patch can vary significantly depending on the nature of the cyber-attack.
In this paper, we address the issue of how to mitigate cyber-attacks before the
new patch is applied by formulating an optimal control strategy that reduces
the impact of malware propagation and minimise the number of infected devices
across IoT networks in the smart home. A novel node-based epidemiological model
susceptible, infected high, infected low, recover first, and recover
complete(SI_HI_LR_FR_C) is established with immediate response state for the
restricted environment. After that, the impact of malware on IoT devices using
both high and low infected rates will be analyzed. Finally, to illustrate the
main results, several numerical analyses are carried out in addition to
simulate the real-world scenario of IoT networks in the smart home, we built a
dataset to be used in the experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in 3D avatar generation have gained significant attentions.
These breakthroughs aim to produce more realistic animatable avatars, narrowing
the gap between virtual and real-world experiences. Most of existing works
employ Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, combined with a differentiable
renderer and text condition, to guide a diffusion model in generating 3D
avatars. However, SDS often generates oversmoothed results with few facial
details, thereby lacking the diversity compared with ancestral sampling. On the
other hand, other works generate 3D avatar from a single image, where the
challenges of unwanted lighting effects, perspective views, and inferior image
quality make them difficult to reliably reconstruct the 3D face meshes with the
aligned complete textures. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D avatar
generation approach termed UltrAvatar with enhanced fidelity of geometry, and
superior quality of physically based rendering (PBR) textures without unwanted
lighting. To this end, the proposed approach presents a diffuse color
extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former
removes the unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors so that the
generated avatars can be rendered under various lighting conditions. The latter
follows two gradient-based guidances for generating PBR textures to render
diverse face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh
geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Due to the rise of privacy concerns, in many practical applications the
training data is aggregated before being shared with the learner, in order to
protect privacy of users' sensitive responses. In an aggregate learning
framework, the dataset is grouped into bags of samples, where each bag is
available only with an aggregate response, providing a summary of individuals'
responses in that bag. In this paper, we study two natural loss functions for
learning from aggregate responses: bag-level loss and the instance-level loss.
In the former, the model is learnt by minimizing a loss between aggregate
responses and aggregate model predictions, while in the latter the model aims
to fit individual predictions to the aggregate responses. In this work, we show
that the instance-level loss can be perceived as a regularized form of the
bag-level loss. This observation lets us compare the two approaches with
respect to bias and variance of the resulting estimators, and introduce a novel
interpolating estimator which combines the two approaches. For linear
regression tasks, we provide a precise characterization of the risk of the
interpolating estimator in an asymptotic regime where the size of the training
set grows in proportion to the features dimension. Our analysis allows us to
theoretically understand the effect of different factors, such as bag size on
the model prediction risk. In addition, we propose a mechanism for
differentially private learning from aggregate responses and derive the optimal
bag size in terms of prediction risk-privacy trade-off. We also carry out
thorough experiments to corroborate our theory and show the efficacy of the
interpolating estimator.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed transmission control
for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unlicensed spectrum bands. We
develop a rigorous interference-aware queuing analysis framework that jointly
considers two inter-dependent factors: (i) limited-size queues with
delay-constrained packet arrival, and (ii) in-band interference introduced by
other ground/aerial users. We aim to optimize the expected throughput by
jointly analyzing these factors. In the queuing analysis, we explore two packet
loss probabilities including, buffer overflow model and time threshold model.
For interference analysis, we investigate the outage probability and packet
losses due to low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We introduce
two algorithms namely, Interference-Aware Transmission Control (IA-TC), and
Interference-Aware Distributed Transmission Control (IA-DTC). These algorithms
maximize the expected throughput by adjusting transmission policies to balance
the trade-offs between packet drop from queues vs. transmission errors due to
low SINRs. We implement the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that the
optimal transmission policy under various scenarios is found.

<p class="mathjax">Domain shift poses a significant challenge in Cross-Domain Facial Expression
Recognition (CD-FER) due to the distribution variation across different
domains. Current works mainly focus on learning domain-invariant features
through global feature adaptation, while neglecting the transferability of
local features. Additionally, these methods lack discriminative supervision
during training on target datasets, resulting in deteriorated feature
representation in target domain. To address these limitations, we propose an
Adaptive Global-Local Representation Learning and Selection (AGLRLS) framework.
The framework incorporates global-local adversarial adaptation and
semantic-aware pseudo label generation to enhance the learning of
domain-invariant and discriminative feature during training. Meanwhile, a
global-local prediction consistency learning is introduced to improve
classification results during inference. Specifically, the framework consists
of separate global-local adversarial learning modules that learn
domain-invariant global and local features independently. We also design a
semantic-aware pseudo label generation module, which computes semantic labels
based on global and local features. Moreover, a novel dynamic threshold
strategy is employed to learn the optimal thresholds by leveraging independent
prediction of global and local features, ensuring filtering out the unreliable
pseudo labels while retaining reliable ones. These labels are utilized for
model optimization through the adversarial learning process in an end-to-end
manner. During inference, a global-local prediction consistency module is
developed to automatically learn an optimal result from multiple predictions.
We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis based on a fair evaluation
benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the
current competing methods by a substantial margin.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for preserving
data privacy in recommendation systems by training models locally. Recently,
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained popularity in recommendation tasks due
to their ability to capture high-order interactions between users and items.
However, privacy concerns prevent the global sharing of the entire user-item
graph. To address this limitation, some methods create pseudo-interacted items
or users in the graph to compensate for missing information for each client.
Unfortunately, these methods introduce random noise and raise privacy concerns.
In this paper, we propose FedRKG, a novel federated recommendation system,
where a global knowledge graph (KG) is constructed and maintained on the server
using publicly available item information, enabling higher-order user-item
interactions. On the client side, a relation-aware GNN model leverages diverse
KG relationships. To protect local interaction items and obscure gradients, we
employ pseudo-labeling and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Extensive
experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive
performance of our approach compared to centralized algorithms while ensuring
privacy preservation. Moreover, FedRKG achieves an average accuracy improvement
of 4% compared to existing federated learning baselines.

<p class="mathjax">The popularization of distributed energy resources transforms end-users from
consumers into prosumers. Inspired by the sharing economy principle, energy
sharing markets for prosumers are proposed to facilitate the utilization of
renewable energy. This paper proposes a novel two-layer energy sharing market
for massive prosumers, which can promote social efficiency by wider-area
sharing. In this market, there is an upper-level wide-area market (WAM) in the
distribution system and numerous lower-level local-area markets (LAMs) in
communities. Prosumers in the same community share energy with each other in
the LAM, which can be uncleared. The energy surplus and shortage of LAMs are
cleared in the WAM. Thanks to the wide-area two-layer structure, the market
outcome is near-social-optimal in large-scale systems. However, the proposed
market forms a complex mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
(MPEC). To solve the problem, we propose an efficient and hierarchically
distributed bidding algorithm. The proposed two-layer market and bidding
algorithm are verified on the IEEE 123-bus system with 11250 prosumers, which
demonstrates the practicality and efficiency for large-scale markets.

software. Tools like Boa provide users with the ability to easily mine these
open-source software repositories at a very large scale, with datasets

generated from any set of Git repositories, with helper scripts to aid in
finding and cloning repositories from GitHub and SourceForge. In this paper, we

represent semantic concepts while maintaining legibility. Conventional methods
using spatial composition and shape substitution are hindered by the
conflicting requirement for achieving seamless spatial fusion between
geometrically dissimilar typefaces and semantics. While recent advances made AI
generation of semantic typography possible, the end-to-end approaches exclude
designer involvement and disregard personalized design. This paper presents
TypeDance, an AI-assisted tool incorporating design rationales with the
generative model for personalized semantic typographic logo design. It
leverages combinable design priors extracted from uploaded image exemplars and
supports type-imagery mapping at various structural granularity, achieving
diverse aesthetic designs with flexible control. Additionally, we instantiate a
comprehensive design workflow in TypeDance, including ideation, selection,
generation, evaluation, and iteration. A two-task user evaluation, including
imitation and creation, confirmed the usability of TypeDance in design across
different usage scenarios

learning space recently, significantly increasing the accuracy of models across
a variety of domains. Researchers have started to question whether such a
sophisticated network structure is actually necessary and whether equally
outstanding results can be reached with reduced inference cost due to its
complicated network topology and high inference cost. In order to prove the
Mixer's efficacy on three datasets Speech Commands, UrbanSound8k, and CASIA
Chinese Sentiment Corpus this paper applies amore condensed version of the
Mixer to an audio classification task and conducts comparative experiments with
the Transformer-based Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)model. In addition,
this paper conducts comparative experiments on the application of several
activation functions in Mixer, namely GeLU, Mish, Swish and Acon-C.
Further-more, the use of various activation functions in Mixer, including GeLU,
Mish, Swish, and Acon-C, is compared in this research through comparison
experiments. Additionally, some AST model flaws are highlighted, and the model
suggested in this study is improved as a result. In conclusion, a model called
the Audio Spectrogram Mixer, which is the first model for audio classification
with Mixer, is suggested in this study and the model's future directions for
improvement are examined.

<p class="mathjax">Collecting relevant and high-quality data is integral to the development of
effective Software Vulnerability (SV) prediction models. Most of the current SV
datasets rely on SV-fixing commits to extract vulnerable functions and lines.
However, none of these datasets have considered latent SVs existing between the
introduction and fix of the collected SVs. There is also little known about the
usefulness of these latent SVs for SV prediction. To bridge these gaps, we
conduct a large-scale study on the latent vulnerable functions in two commonly
used SV datasets and their utilization for function-level and line-level SV
predictions. Leveraging the state-of-the-art SZZ algorithm, we identify more
than 100k latent vulnerable functions in the studied datasets. We find that
these latent functions can increase the number of SVs by 4x on average and
correct up to 5k mislabeled functions, yet they have a noise level of around
6%. Despite the noise, we show that the state-of-the-art SV prediction model
can significantly benefit from such latent SVs. The improvements are up to
24.5% in the performance (F1-Score) of function-level SV predictions and up to
67% in the effectiveness of localizing vulnerable lines. Overall, our study
presents the first promising step toward the use of latent SVs to improve the
quality of SV datasets and enhance the performance of SV prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Open information extraction (OpenIE) aims to extract the schema-free triplets
in the form of (\emph{subject}, \emph{predicate}, \emph{object}) from a given
sentence. Compared with general information extraction (IE), OpenIE poses more
challenges for the IE models, {especially when multiple complicated triplets
exist in a sentence. To extract these complicated triplets more effectively, in
this paper we propose a novel generative OpenIE model, namely \emph{DualOIE},
which achieves a dual task at the same time as extracting some triplets from
the sentence, i.e., converting the triplets into the sentence.} Such dual task
encourages the model to correctly recognize the structure of the given sentence
and thus is helpful to extract all potential triplets from the sentence.
Specifically, DualOIE extracts the triplets in two steps: 1) first extracting a
sequence of all potential predicates, 2) then using the predicate sequence as a
prompt to induce the generation of triplets. Our experiments on two benchmarks
and our dataset constructed from Meituan demonstrate that DualOIE achieves the
best performance among the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the online
A/B test on Meituan platform shows that 0.93\% improvement of QV-CTR and 0.56\%
improvement of UV-CTR have been obtained when the triplets extracted by DualOIE
were leveraged in Meituan's search system.

<p class="mathjax">As blockchain platforms grow exponentially, millions of lines of smart
contract code are being deployed to manage extensive digital assets. However,
vulnerabilities in this mission-critical code have led to significant
exploitations and asset losses. Thorough automated security analysis of smart
contracts is thus imperative. This paper introduces LLM4Fuzz to optimize
automated smart contract security analysis by leveraging large language models
(LLMs) to intelligently guide and prioritize fuzzing campaigns. While
traditional fuzzing suffers from low efficiency in exploring the vast state
space, LLM4Fuzz employs LLMs to direct fuzzers towards high-value code regions
and input sequences more likely to trigger vulnerabilities. Additionally,
LLM4Fuzz can leverage LLMs to guide fuzzers based on user-defined invariants,
reducing blind exploration overhead. Evaluations of LLM4Fuzz on real-world DeFi
projects show substantial gains in efficiency, coverage, and vulnerability
detection compared to baseline fuzzing. LLM4Fuzz also uncovered five critical
vulnerabilities that can lead to a loss of more than $247k.

<p class="mathjax">Unsupervised video object learning seeks to decompose video scenes into
structural object representations without any supervision from depth, optical
flow, or segmentation. We present VONet, an innovative approach that is
inspired by MONet. While utilizing a U-Net architecture, VONet employs an
efficient and effective parallel attention inference process, generating
attention masks for all slots simultaneously. Additionally, to enhance the
temporal consistency of each mask across consecutive video frames, VONet
develops an object-wise sequential VAE framework. The integration of these
innovative encoder-side techniques, in conjunction with an expressive
transformer-based decoder, establishes VONet as the leading unsupervised method
for object learning across five MOVI datasets, encompassing videos of diverse
complexities. Code is available at https://github.com/hnyu/vonet.

<p class="mathjax">Sleep behavior significantly impacts health and acts as an indicator of
physical and mental well-being. Monitoring and predicting sleep behavior with
ubiquitous sensors may therefore assist in both sleep management and tracking
of related health conditions. While sleep behavior depends on, and is reflected
in the physiology of a person, it is also impacted by external factors such as
digital media usage, social network contagion, and the surrounding weather. In
this work, we propose SPAND (Sleep Prediction Architecture using Network
Dynamics), a system that exploits social contagion in sleep behavior through
graph networks and integrates it with physiological and phone data extracted
from ubiquitous mobile and wearable devices for predicting next-day sleep
labels about sleep duration. Our architecture overcomes the limitations of
large-scale graphs containing connections irrelevant to sleep behavior by
devising an attention mechanism. The extensive experimental evaluation
highlights the improvement provided by incorporating social networks in the
model. Additionally, we conduct robustness analysis to demonstrate the system's
performance in real-life conditions. The outcomes affirm the stability of SPAND
against perturbations in input data. Further analyses emphasize the
significance of network topology in prediction performance revealing that users
with higher eigenvalue centrality are more vulnerable to data perturbations.

<p class="mathjax">Dengue fever presents a substantial challenge in developing countries where
sanitation infrastructure is inadequate. The absence of comprehensive
healthcare systems exacerbates the severity of dengue infections, potentially
leading to life-threatening circumstances. Rapid response to dengue outbreaks
is also challenging due to limited information exchange and integration. While
timely dengue outbreak forecasts have the potential to prevent such outbreaks,
the majority of dengue prediction studies have predominantly relied on data
that impose significant burdens on individual countries for collection. In this
study, our aim is to improve health equity in resource-constrained countries by
exploring the effectiveness of high-resolution satellite imagery as a
nontraditional and readily accessible data source. By leveraging the wealth of
publicly available and easily obtainable satellite imagery, we present a
scalable satellite extraction framework based on Sentinel Hub, a cloud-based
computing platform. Furthermore, we introduce DengueNet, an innovative
architecture that combines Vision Transformer, Radiomics, and Long Short-term
Memory to extract and integrate spatiotemporal features from satellite images.
This enables dengue predictions on an epi-week basis. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on five
municipalities in Colombia. We utilized a dataset comprising 780
high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images for training and evaluation. The
performance of DengueNet was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE)
metric. Across the five municipalities, DengueNet achieved an average MAE of
43.92. Our findings strongly support the efficacy of satellite imagery as a
valuable resource for dengue prediction, particularly in informing public
health policies within countries where manually collected data is scarce and
dengue virus prevalence is severe.

<p class="mathjax">Controllable generation of 3D human motions becomes an important topic as the
world embraces digital transformation. Existing works, though making promising
progress with the advent of diffusion models, heavily rely on meticulously
captured and annotated (e.g., text) high-quality motion corpus, a
resource-intensive endeavor in the real world. This motivates our proposed
MotionMix, a simple yet effective weakly-supervised diffusion model that
leverages both noisy and unannotated motion sequences. Specifically, we
separate the denoising objectives of a diffusion model into two stages:
obtaining conditional rough motion approximations in the initial $T-T^*$ steps
by learning the noisy annotated motions, followed by the unconditional
refinement of these preliminary motions during the last $T^*$ steps using
unannotated motions. Notably, though learning from two sources of imperfect
data, our model does not compromise motion generation quality compared to fully
supervised approaches that access gold data. Extensive experiments on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our MotionMix, as a versatile framework,
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performances on text-to-motion,
action-to-motion, and music-to-dance tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In the evolving landscape of scientific publishing, it is important to
understand the drivers of high-impact research, to equip scientists with
actionable strategies to enhance the reach of their work, and to understand
trends in the use modern scientific publishing tools to inform their further
development. Here, based on a large dataset of computer science publications,
we study trends in the use of early preprint publications and revisions on
ArXiv and the use of X (formerly Twitter) for promotion of such papers in the
last 10 years. We find that early submission to ArXiv and promotion on X have
soared in recent years. Estimating the effect that the use of each of these
modern affordances has on the number of citations of scientific publications,
we find that in the first 5 years from an initial publication peer-reviewed
conference papers submitted early to ArXiv gain on average $21.1 \pm 17.4$ more
citations, revised on ArXiv gain $18.4 \pm 17.6$ more citations, and promoted
on X gain $44.4 \pm 8$ more citations. Our results show that promoting one's
work on ArXiv or X has a large impact on the number of citations, as well as
the number of influential citations computed by Semantic Scholar, and thereby
on the career of researchers. We discuss the far-reaching implications of these
findings for future scientific publishing systems and measures of scientific
impact.

<p class="mathjax">In the past decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grabbed the
attention of researchers in academia and industry for their potential use in
critical emergency applications, such as providing wireless services to ground
users and collecting data from areas affected by disasters, due to their
advantages in terms of maneuverability and movement flexibility. The UAVs'
limited resources, energy budget, and strict mission completion time have posed
challenges in adopting UAVs for these applications. Our system model considers
a UAV swarm that navigates an area collecting data from ground IoT devices
focusing on providing better service for strategic locations and allowing UAVs
to join and leave the swarm (e.g., for recharging) in a dynamic way. In this
work, we introduce an optimization model with the aim of minimizing the total
energy consumption and provide the optimal path planning of UAVs under the
constraints of minimum completion time and transmit power. The formulated
optimization is NP-hard making it not applicable for real-time decision making.
Therefore, we introduce a light-weight meta-reinforcement learning solution
that can also cope with sudden changes in the environment through fast
convergence. We conduct extensive simulations and compare our approach to three
state-of-the-art learning models. Our simulation results prove that our
introduced approach is better than the three state-of-the-art algorithms in
providing coverage to strategic locations with fast convergence.

<p class="mathjax">Background Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced with Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPGs), can significantly improve Clinical Decision Support (CDS).
However, methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs are not well studied. Methods
We develop three distinct methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs: Binary
Decision Tree (BDT), Program-Aided Graph Construction (PAGC), and
Chain-of-Thought-Few-Shot Prompting (CoT-FSP). To evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods, we create a set of synthetic patient descriptions and
conduct both automatic and human evaluation of the responses generated by four
LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA, and PaLM 2. Zero-Shot Prompting (ZSP) was
used as the baseline method. We focus on CDS for COVID-19 outpatient treatment
as the case study. Results All four LLMs exhibit improved performance when
enhanced with CPGs compared to the baseline ZSP. BDT outperformed both CoT-FSP
and PAGC in automatic evaluation. All of the proposed methods demonstrated high
performance in human evaluation. Conclusion LLMs enhanced with CPGs demonstrate
superior performance, as compared to plain LLMs with ZSP, in providing accurate
recommendations for COVID-19 outpatient treatment, which also highlights the
potential for broader applications beyond the case study.

<p class="mathjax">The image-level label has prevailed in weakly supervised semantic
segmentation tasks due to its easy availability. Since image-level labels can
only indicate the existence or absence of specific categories of objects,
visualization-based techniques have been widely adopted to provide object
location clues. Considering class activation maps (CAMs) can only locate the
most discriminative part of objects, recent approaches usually adopt an
expansion strategy to enlarge the activation area for more integral object
localization. However, without proper constraints, the expanded activation will
easily intrude into the background region. In this paper, we propose spatial
structure constraints (SSC) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation to
alleviate the unwanted object over-activation of attention expansion.
Specifically, we propose a CAM-driven reconstruction module to directly
reconstruct the input image from deep CAM features, which constrains the
diffusion of last-layer object attention by preserving the coarse spatial
structure of the image content. Moreover, we propose an activation
self-modulation module to refine CAMs with finer spatial structure details by
enhancing regional consistency. Without external saliency models to provide
background clues, our approach achieves 72.7\% and 47.0\% mIoU on the PASCAL
VOC 2012 and COCO datasets, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our
proposed approach.

<p class="mathjax">The mainstream human activity recognition (HAR) algorithms are developed
based on RGB cameras, which are easily influenced by low-quality images (e.g.,
low illumination, motion blur). Meanwhile, the privacy protection issue caused
by ultra-high definition (HD) RGB cameras aroused more and more people's
attention. Inspired by the success of event cameras which perform better on
high dynamic range, no motion blur, and low energy consumption, we propose to
recognize human actions based on the event stream. We propose a lightweight
uncertainty-aware information propagation based Mobile-Former network for
efficient pattern recognition, which aggregates the MobileNet and Transformer
network effectively. Specifically, we first embed the event images using a stem
network into feature representations, then, feed them into uncertainty-aware
Mobile-Former blocks for local and global feature learning and fusion. Finally,
the features from MobileNet and Transformer branches are concatenated for
pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple event-based recognition
datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our model. The source code of
this work will be released at

<p class="mathjax">Multitask learning (MTL) has gained prominence for its ability to jointly
predict multiple tasks, achieving better per-task performance while using fewer
per-task model parameters than single-task learning. More recently,
decoder-focused architectures have considerably improved multitask performance
by refining task predictions using the features of other related tasks.
However, most of these refinement methods fail to simultaneously capture local
and global task-specific representations, as well as cross-task patterns in a
parameter-efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient Multitask
Affinity Learning Network (EMA-Net), which is a lightweight framework that
enhances the task refinement capabilities of multitask networks. EMA-Net
adeptly captures local, global, and cross-task interactions using our novel
Cross-Task Affinity Learning (CTAL) module. The key innovation of CTAL lies in
its ability to manipulate task affinity matrices in a manner that is optimally
suited to apply parameter-efficient grouped convolutions without worrying about
information loss. Our results show that we achieve state-of-the-art MTL
performance for CNN-based decoder-focused models while using substantially
fewer model parameters. Our code is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Ensemble defenses, are widely employed in various security-related
applications to enhance model performance and robustness. The widespread
adoption of these techniques also raises many questions: Are general ensembles
defenses guaranteed to be more robust than individuals? Will stronger adaptive
attacks defeat existing ensemble defense strategies as the cybersecurity arms
race progresses? Can ensemble defenses achieve adversarial robustness to
different types of attacks simultaneously and resist the continually adjusted
adaptive attacks? Unfortunately, these critical questions remain unresolved as
there are no platforms for comprehensive evaluation of ensemble adversarial
attacks and defenses in the cybersecurity domain. In this paper, we propose a
general Cybersecurity Adversarial Robustness Evaluation (CARE) platform aiming
to bridge this gap.

<p class="mathjax">Many iterative algorithms in optimization, computational geometry, computer
algebra, and other areas of computer science require repeated computation of
some algebraic expression whose input changes slightly from one iteration to
the next. Although efficient data structures have been proposed for maintaining
the solution of such algebraic expressions under low-rank updates, most of
these results are only analyzed under exact arithmetic (real-RAM model and
finite fields) which may not accurately reflect the complexity guarantees of
real computers. In this paper, we analyze the stability and bit complexity of
such data structures for expressions that involve the inversion,
multiplication, addition, and subtraction of matrices under the word-RAM model.
We show that the bit complexity only increases linearly in the number of matrix
operations in the expression. In addition, we consider the bit complexity of
maintaining the determinant of a matrix expression. We show that the required
bit complexity depends on the logarithm of the condition number of matrices
instead of the logarithm of their determinant. We also discuss rank maintenance
and its connections to determinant maintenance. Our results have wide
applications ranging from computational geometry (e.g., computing the volume of
a polytope) to optimization (e.g., solving linear programs using the simplex
algorithm).

<p class="mathjax">Though ML practitioners increasingly employ various Responsible ML (RML)
strategies, their methodological approach in practice is still unclear. In
particular, the constraints, assumptions, and choices of practitioners with
technical duties -- such as developers, engineers, and data scientists -- are
often implicit, subtle, and under-scrutinized in HCI and related fields. We
interviewed 22 technically oriented ML practitioners across seven domains to
understand the characteristics of their methodological approaches to RML
through the lens of ideal and non-ideal theorizing of fairness. We find that
practitioners' methodological approaches fall along a spectrum of idealization.
While they structured their approaches through ideal theorizing, such as by
abstracting RML workflow from the inquiry of applicability of ML, they did not
pay deliberate attention and systematically documented their non-ideal
approaches, such as diagnosing imperfect conditions. We end our paper with a
discussion of a new methodological approach, inspired by elements of non-ideal
theory, to structure technical practitioners' RML process and facilitate
collaboration with other stakeholders.

<p class="mathjax">Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms are becoming increasingly
popular in recent years. Online learners need to watch the whole course video
on MOOC platforms to learn the underlying new knowledge, which is often tedious
and time-consuming due to the lack of a quick overview of the covered knowledge
and their structures. In this paper, we propose ConceptThread, a visual
analytics approach to effectively show the concepts and the relations among
them to facilitate effective online learning. Specifically, given that the
majority of MOOC videos contain slides, we first leverage video processing and
speech analysis techniques, including shot recognition, speech recognition and
topic modeling, to extract core knowledge concepts and construct the
hierarchical and temporal relations among them. Then, by using a metaphor of
thread, we present a novel visualization to intuitively display the concepts
based on video sequential flow, and enable learners to perform interactive
visual exploration of concepts. We conducted a quantitative study, two case
studies, and a user study to extensively evaluate ConceptThread. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of ConceptThread in providing
online learners with a quick understanding of the knowledge content of MOOC
videos.

<p class="mathjax">E-mail ``Messages From the President'' to university students, staff, and
faculty have long been used to keep campus communities aware of the latest
policies, events, and news. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, as universities
quickly closed facilities, sent students home, and canceled travel, these
messages took on even greater importance. We report on a content analysis of
bulk emails from different universities' presidents to their students and
employees before and in three stages of the pandemic. We find that these
messages change as universities move towards and through closure. During the
pandemic, 1) presidential bulk emails tend to be more informative, positive,
clearer than before; 2) they tend to use more personal and collective language;
3) university presidents tend to mention more local political leaders and fewer
other university leaders. Our results can inform research on digital crisis
communication and may be useful for researchers interested in automatically
identifying crisis situations from communication streams.

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot object detection(FSOD) aims to design methods to adapt object
detectors efficiently with only few annotated samples. Fine-tuning has been
shown to be an effective and practical approach. However, previous works often
take the classical base-novel two stage fine-tuning procedure but ignore the
implicit stability-plasticity contradiction among different modules.
Specifically, the random re-initialized classifiers need more plasticity to
adapt to novel samples. The other modules inheriting pre-trained weights demand
more stability to reserve their class-agnostic knowledge. Regular fine-tuning
which couples the optimization of these two parts hurts the model
generalization in FSOD scenarios. In this paper, we find that this problem is
prominent in the end-to-end object detector Sparse R-CNN for its
multi-classifier cascaded architecture. We propose to mitigate this
contradiction by a new three-stage fine-tuning procedure by introducing an
addtional plasticity classifier fine-tuning(PCF) stage. We further design the
multi-source ensemble(ME) technique to enhance the generalization of the model
in the final fine-tuning stage. Extensive experiments verify that our method is
effective in regularizing Sparse R-CNN, outperforming previous methods in the
FSOD benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework
is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the
near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with
frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected
true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true
time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are
exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS.
Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel
state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel
training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed
network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal
processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are
leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results
show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and
robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff
between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for
different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can
achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional
energy consumption and hardware cost.

<p class="mathjax">We propose the Multi-Head Gaussian Adaptive Attention Mechanism (GAAM), a
novel probabilistic attention framework, and the Gaussian Adaptive Transformer
(GAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities,
including Speech, Text and Vision. GAAM integrates learnable mean and variance
into its attention mechanism, implemented in a Multi-Headed framework enabling
it to collectively model any Probability Distribution for dynamic recalibration
of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements,
especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art
attention techniques in model performance (up to approximately +20% in
accuracy) by identifying key elements within the feature space. GAAM's
compatibility with dot-product-based attention models and relatively low number
of parameters showcases its adaptability and potential to boost existing
attention frameworks. Empirically, GAAM exhibits superior adaptability and
efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in
speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its
robustness and versatility in handling multi-modal data. Furthermore, we
introduce the Importance Factor (IF), a new learning-based metric that enhances
the explainability of models trained with GAAM-based methods. Overall, GAAM
represents an advancement towards development of better performing and more
explainable attention models across multiple modalities.

<p class="mathjax">Static machine learning methods in gesture recognition assume that training
and test data come from the same underlying distribution. However, in
real-world applications involving gesture recognition on wrist-worn devices,
data distribution may change over time. We formulate this problem of adapting
recognition models to new tasks, where new data patterns emerge, as open-world
gesture recognition (OWGR). We propose leveraging continual learning to make
machine learning models adaptive to new tasks without degrading performance on
previously learned tasks. However, the exploration of parameters for questions
around when and how to train and deploy recognition models requires
time-consuming user studies and is sometimes impractical. To address this
challenge, we propose a design engineering approach that enables offline
analysis on a collected large-scale dataset with various parameters and
compares different continual learning methods. Finally, design guidelines are
provided to enhance the development of an open-world wrist-worn gesture

Previous work shows that PU learning is a promising method for this task.
However, some serious issues remain unresolved, i.e. typical challenges that PU
methods suffer such as unknown class prior and imbalanced data, and the need
for transductive experimental settings. In this paper, we propose a novel PU
learning framework based on density estimation, called puDE, that can handle

<p class="mathjax">Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is known to be an effective solver for many sparse
symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems. For SPD systems, the
convergence theory of AMG is well-understood in terms of the $A$-norm but in a
nonsymmetric setting such an energy norm is non-existent. For this reason,
convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric systems of equations remains an open area
of research. Existing nonsymmetric AMG algorithms in this setting mostly rely
on heuristics motivated by SPD convergence theory. In the SPD setting, the
classical form of optimal AMG interpolation provides a useful insight in
determining the two grid convergence rate of the method. In this work, we
discuss a generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory targeting
nonsymmetric problems by constructing a $2\times 2$ block symmetric indefinite
system so that the Petrov-Galerkin AMG process for the nonsymmetric matrix $A$
can be recast as a Galerkin AMG process for a symmetric indefinite system. We
show that using this generalization of the optimal interpolation theory, one
can obtain the same identity for the two-grid convergence rate as that derived
in the SPD setting for optimal interpolation. We also provide supporting
numerical results for the convergence result and nonsymmetric
advection-diffusion problems.

<p class="mathjax">Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have recently gained prominence in
traffic research, thanks to the advancements in communication technology and
autonomous driving. A variety of longitudinal control strategies for CAVs have
been developed to enhance traffic efficiency, stability, and safety in
mixed-autonomy scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising
strategy for mixed-autonomy platoon control since it can tackle complex
scenarios in real-time. However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based
mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, incorporating safety considerations into
DRL typically relies on designing collision avoidance-based reward functions,
which lack collision-free guarantees. Second, current DRL-based-control
approaches for mixed traffic only consider the safety of CAVs, with little
attention paid to the surrounding HDVs. To address the research gaps, we
introduce a differentiable safety layer that converts DRL actions into safe
actions with collision-free guarantees. This process relies on solving a
differentiable quadratic programming problem that incorporates control barrier
function-based (CBF) safety constraints for both CAV and its following HDVs to
achieve system-level safety. Moreover, constructing CBF constraints needs
system dynamics for the following HDVs, and thus we employ an online system
identification module to estimate the car-following dynamics of the surrounding
HDVs. The proposed safe reinforcement learning approach explicitly integrates
system-level safety constraints into the training process and enables our
method to adapt to varying safety-critical scenarios. Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed method effectively ensures CAV safety and
improves HDV safety in mixed platoon environments while simultaneously
enhancing traffic capacity and string stability.

<p class="mathjax">Training a real-time gesture recognition model heavily relies on annotated
data. However, manual data annotation is costly and demands substantial human
effort. In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel annotation model
that can automatically annotate gesture classes and identify their temporal
ranges. Our ablation study demonstrates that our annotation model design
surpasses the baseline in terms of both gesture classification accuracy (3-4\%
improvement) and localization accuracy (71-75\% improvement). We believe that
this annotation model has immense potential to improve the training of
downstream gesture recognition models using unlabeled datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) is expected to be a
key technique for {the} next-generation wireless networks. However, the
existing DJSCC schemes still face the challenge of channel adaptability as they
are typically trained under specific channel conditions. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework for channel-adaptive DJSCC by utilizing
hypernetworks. To tailor the hypernetwork-based framework for communication
systems, we propose a memory-efficient hypernetwork parameterization and then
develop a channel-adaptive DJSCC network, named Hyper-AJSCC. Compared with
existing adaptive DJSCC based on the attention mechanism, Hyper-AJSCC
introduces much fewer parameters and can be seamlessly combined with various
existing DJSCC networks without any substantial modifications to their neural
network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the better adaptability
to channel conditions and higher memory efficiency of Hyper-AJSCC compared with
state-of-the-art baselines.

<p class="mathjax">It is now well-known that automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems can be
spoofed using various types of adversaries. The usual approach to counteract
ASV systems against such attacks is to develop a separate spoofing
countermeasure (CM) module to classify speech input either as a bonafide, or a
spoofed utterance. Nevertheless, such a design requires additional computation
and utilization efforts at the authentication stage. An alternative strategy
involves a single monolithic ASV system designed to handle both zero-effort
imposter (non-targets) and spoofing attacks. Such spoof-aware ASV systems have
the potential to provide stronger protections and more economic computations.
To this end, we propose to generalize the standalone ASV (G-SASV) against
spoofing attacks, where we leverage limited training data from CM to enhance a
simple backend in the embedding space, without the involvement of a separate CM
module during the test (authentication) phase. We propose a novel yet simple
backend classifier based on deep neural networks and conduct the study via
domain adaptation and multi-task integration of spoof embeddings at the
training stage. Experiments are conducted on the ASVspoof 2019 logical access
dataset, where we improve the performance of statistical ASV backends on the
joint (bonafide and spoofed) and spoofed conditions by a maximum of 36.2% and
49.8% in terms of equal error rates, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Constructions of infinite families of distance-optimal codes in the Hamming

attentions. In this paper, we give the following three results.
<br />1) If $\lambda|q^{sm}-1$ and $\lambda
&lt;\sqrt{\frac{(q^s-1)}{2(q-1)^2(1+\epsilon)}}$, an infinite family of
distance-optimal $q$-ary cyclic sum-rank codes with the block length
$t=\frac{q^{sm}-1}{\lambda}$, the matrix size $s \times s$, the cardinality
$q^{s^2t-s(2m+3)}$ and the minimum sum-rank distance four is constructed.
<br />2) Block length $q^4-1$ and the matrix size $2 \times 2$ distance-optimal
sum-rank codes with the minimum sum-rank distance four and the Singleton defect
four are constructed. These sum-rank codes are close to the sphere packing
bound , the Singleton-like bound and have much larger block length
$q^4-1&gt;&gt;q-1$.
<br />3) For given positive integers $n$ and $m$ satisfying $m&lt;n$, an infinite
family of perfect sum-rank codes with the matrix size $m \times n$, and the
minimum sum-rank distance three is also constructed.
<br />The construction of perfect sum-rank codes of the matrix size $m \times n$,
$1&lt;m&lt;n$, answers the open problem proposed by U. Mart\'{\i}nez-Pe\~{n}as in

<p class="mathjax">While third-party libraries are extensively reused to enhance productivity
during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks
such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis, proposed to
identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure
within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques,
binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in
binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in
reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial
disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques
leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack
robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false
positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce
BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source
code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First,
BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings
and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then
by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI
detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms
of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our
embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving
22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively.
Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in
TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from
59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black
Duck.

<p class="mathjax">In November 2022, OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT, a chatbot based on
supervised and reinforcement learning. Not only can it answer questions
emulating human-like responses, but it can also generate code from scratch or
complete coding templates provided by the user. ChatGPT can generate unique
responses which render any traditional anti-plagiarism tool useless. Its
release has ignited a heated debate about its usage in academia, especially by
students. We have found, to our surprise, that our students at POLITEHNICA
University of Bucharest (UPB) have been using generative AI tools (ChatGPT and
its predecessors) for solving homework, for at least 6 months. We therefore set
out to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and assess its value for educational
purposes. We solved all our coding assignments for the semester from our UPB
Functional Programming course. We discovered that, although ChatGPT provides
correct answers in 68% of the cases, only around half of those are legible
solutions which can benefit students in some form. On the other hand, ChatGPT
has a very good ability to perform code review on student programming homework.
Based on these findings, we discuss the pros and cons of ChatGPT in education.

<p class="mathjax">Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved exceptional
performance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of VLMs
necessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once
attackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time
(energy-latency cost) during inference of VLMs, it will exhaust computational
resources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of
VLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We
find that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated
by maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose
verbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to
induce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design
three loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop
generating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity
loss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the
diversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which
can break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a
temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance
these losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can
increase the length of generated sequences by 7.87 times and 8.56 times
compared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents
potential challenges for various applications. Our code is available at
https://github.com/KuofengGao/Verbose_Images.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents the Holistic and Multi-Granular Surgical Scene
Understanding of Prostatectomies (GraSP) dataset, a curated benchmark that
models surgical scene understanding as a hierarchy of complementary tasks with
varying levels of granularity. Our approach enables a multi-level comprehension
of surgical activities, encompassing long-term tasks such as surgical phases
and steps recognition and short-term tasks including surgical instrument
segmentation and atomic visual actions detection. To exploit our proposed
benchmark, we introduce the Transformers for Actions, Phases, Steps, and
Instrument Segmentation (TAPIS) model, a general architecture that combines a
global video feature extractor with localized region proposals from an
instrument segmentation model to tackle the multi-granularity of our benchmark.
Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the impact of including
segmentation annotations in short-term recognition tasks, highlight the varying
granularity requirements of each task, and establish TAPIS's superiority over
previously proposed baselines and conventional CNN-based models. Additionally,
we validate the robustness of our method across multiple public benchmarks,
confirming the reliability and applicability of our dataset. This work
represents a significant step forward in Endoscopic Vision, offering a novel
and comprehensive framework for future research towards a holistic
understanding of surgical procedures.

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based large language model (LLM) inference serving is now the
backbone of many cloud services. LLM inference consists of a prefill phase and
a decode phase. However, existing LLM deployment practices often overlook the
distinct characteristics of these phases, leading to significant interference.
To mitigate interference, our insight is to carefully schedule and group
inference requests based on their characteristics. We realize this idea in
TetriInfer through three pillars. First, it partitions prompts into fixed-size
chunks so that the accelerator always runs close to its computationsaturated
limit. Second, it disaggregates prefill and decode instances so each can run
independently. Finally, it uses a smart two-level scheduling algorithm
augmented with predicted resource usage to avoid decode scheduling hotspots.
Results show that TetriInfer improves time-to-first-token (TTFT), job
completion time (JCT), and inference efficiency in turns of performance per
dollar by a large margin, e.g., it uses 38% less resources all the while
lowering average TTFT and average JCT by 97% and 47%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Predictive safety filters provide a way of projecting potentially unsafe
inputs onto the set of inputs that guarantee recursive state and input
constraint satisfaction. Unsafe inputs, proposed, e.g. by a human or
learning-based controller, can thereby be filtered by leveraging model
predictive control techniques. In this paper, we extend this framework such
that in addition, robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be
guaranteed by enforcing a decrease of an implicit Lyapunov function which is
constructed using a predicted system trajectory. Differently from previous
results, we show robust asymptotic stability on an extended state consisting of
the system state and a warmstart input sequence and establish robust asymptotic
stability for the augmented dynamics with respect to a predefined disturbance.
The proposed strategy is applied to an automotive lane keeping example in
simulation.

<p class="mathjax">Dynamic adversarial question generation, where humans write examples to stump
a model, aims to create examples that are realistic and informative. However,
the advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a double-edged sword for
human authors: more people are interested in seeing and pushing the limits of
these models, but because the models are so much stronger an opponent, they are
harder to defeat. To understand how these models impact adversarial question
writing process, we enrich the writing guidance with LLMs and retrieval models
for the authors to reason why their questions are not adversarial. While
authors could create interesting, challenging adversarial questions, they
sometimes resort to tricks that result in poor questions that are ambiguous,
subjective, or confusing not just to a computer but also to humans. To address
these issues, we propose new metrics and incentives for eliciting good,
challenging questions and present a new dataset of adversarially authored
questions.

<p class="mathjax">One fruitful formulation of Deep Networks (DNs) enabling their theoretical
study and providing practical guidelines to practitioners relies on Piecewise
Affine Splines. In that realm, a DN's input-mapping is expressed as per-region
affine mapping where those regions are implicitly determined by the model's
architecture and form a partition of their input space. That partition -- which
is involved in all the results spanned from this line of research -- has so far
only been computed on $2/3$-dimensional slices of the DN's input space or
estimated by random sampling. In this paper, we provide the first parallel
algorithm that does exact enumeration of the DN's partition regions. The
proposed algorithm enables one to finally assess the closeness of the commonly
employed approximations methods, e.g. based on random sampling of the DN input
space. One of our key finding is that if one is only interested in regions with
``large'' volume, then uniform sampling of the space is highly efficient, but
that if one is also interested in discovering the ``small'' regions of the
partition, then uniform sampling is exponentially costly with the DN's input
space dimension. On the other hand, our proposed method has complexity scaling
linearly with input dimension and the number of regions.

<p class="mathjax">Rigid body systems usually consider measurements of the pose of the body
using onboard cameras/LiDAR systems, that of linear acceleration using an
accelerometer and of angular velocity using an IMU. However, the measurements
of the linear acceleration and angular velocity are usually biased with an
unknown constant or slowly varying bias. We propose a measurement bias
estimator for such systems under assumption of boundedness of angular velocity.
We also provide continuous estimates to the state of the system, i.e. the pose,
linear velocity, and position of the body. These estimates are globally
exponentially convergent to the state of the rigid body system. We propose two
bias estimators designed with the estimate of the pose in the ambient Euclidean
space of the Special Euclidean group and show global exponential convergence of
the proposed observers to the state of the system. The first observer assumes
knowledge of bounds of the angular velocity, while the second observer uses a
Riccati observer to overcome this limitation. We show the convergence with an
example of a rigid body rotation and translation system on the special
Euclidean group. We show that the observer is able to estimate the bias using
data collected from an Intel Realsense camera.

<p class="mathjax">The increasing reliance on complex algorithmic systems by online platforms
has sparked a growing need for algorithm auditing, a research methodology
evaluating these systems' functionality and societal impact. In this paper, we
systematically review algorithm auditing studies and identify trends in their
methodological approaches, the geographic distribution of authors, and the
selection of platforms, languages, geographies, and group-based attributes in
the focus of auditing research. We present evidence of a significant skew of
research focus toward Western contexts, particularly the US, and a
disproportionate reliance on English language data. Additionally, our analysis
indicates a tendency in algorithm auditing studies to focus on a narrow set of
group-based attributes, often operationalized in simplified ways, which might
obscure more nuanced aspects of algorithmic bias and discrimination. By
conducting this review, we aim to provide a clearer understanding of the
current state of the algorithm auditing field and identify gaps that need to be
addressed for a more inclusive and representative research landscape.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates beam training for extremely large-scale
multiple-input multiple-output systems. By considering both the near field and
far field, a triple-refined hybrid-field beam training scheme is proposed,
where high-accuracy estimates of channel parameters are obtained through three
steps of progressive beam refinement. First, the hybrid-field beam gain
(HFBG)-based first refinement method is developed. Based on the analysis of the
HFBG, the first-refinement codebook is designed and the beam training is
performed accordingly to narrow down the potential region of the channel path.
Then, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based and principle of stationary phase
(PSP)-based second refinement methods are developed. By exploiting the
measurements of the beam training, the ML is used to estimate the channel
parameters. To avoid the high computational complexity of ML, closed-form
estimates of the channel parameters are derived according to the PSP. Moreover,
the Gaussian approximation (GA)-based third refinement method is developed. The
hybrid-field neighboring search is first performed to identify the potential
region of the main lobe of the channel steering vector. Afterwards, by applying
the GA, a least-squares estimator is developed to obtain the high-accuracy
channel parameter estimation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a machine learning based observer for systems evolving on
manifolds is designed such that the state of the observer is restricted to the
Lie group on which the system evolves. Conventional techniques involving
machine learning based observers on systems evolving on Lie groups involve
designing charts for the Lie group, training a machine learning based observer
for each chart, and switching between the trained models based on the state of
the system. We propose a novel deep learning based technique whose predictions
are restricted to a measure 0 subset of Euclidean space without using charts.
Using this network, we design an observer ensuring that the state of the
observer is restricted to the Lie group, and predicting the state using only
one trained algorithm. The deep learning network predicts an ``error term'' on
the Lie algebra of the Lie group, uses the map from the Lie algebra to the
group, and uses the group action and the present state to estimate the state at
the next epoch. This model being purely data driven does not require the model
of the system. The proposed algorithm provides a novel framework for
constraining the output of machine learning networks to a measure 0 subset of a
Euclidean space without chart specific training and without requiring
switching. We show the validity of this method using Monte Carlo simulations
performed of the rigid body rotation and translation system.

<p class="mathjax">Mixed-choice has long been barred from models of asynchronous communication
since it compromises the decidability of key properties of communicating
finite-state machines. Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes
them from fully modelling timeouts -- a core property of web and cloud
services. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) Timeout Asynchronous
Session Types ({TOAST}) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session
types, that permits mixed-choice. {TOAST} deploys timing constraints to
regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We
provide a new behavioural semantics for {TOAST} which guarantees progress in
the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon {TOAST}, we provide a calculus
featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a
$\mathtt{receive\text{-}after}$ pattern, much like Erlang, and capture the
correspondence with TOAST specifications via a type system for which we prove
subject reduction.

<p class="mathjax">Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) can enhance average retrieval effectiveness
over a sufficiently large number of queries. However, PRF often introduces a
drift into the original information need, thus hurting the retrieval
effectiveness of several queries. While a selective application of PRF can
potentially alleviate this issue, previous approaches have largely relied on
unsupervised or feature-based learning to determine whether a query should be
expanded. In contrast, we revisit the problem of selective PRF from a deep
learning perspective, presenting a model that is entirely data-driven and
trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model leverages a
transformer-based bi-encoder architecture. Additionally, to further improve
retrieval effectiveness with this selective PRF approach, we make use of the
model's confidence estimates to combine the information from the original and
expanded queries. In our experiments, we apply this selective feedback on a
number of different combinations of ranking and feedback models, and show that
our proposed approach consistently improves retrieval effectiveness for both
sparse and dense ranking models, with the feedback models being either sparse,
dense or generative.

<p class="mathjax">The projected belief network (PBN) is a generative stochastic network with
tractable likelihood function based on a feed-forward neural network (FFNN).
The generative function operates by "backing up" through the FFNN. The PBN is
two networks in one, a FFNN that operates in the forward direction, and a
generative network that operates in the backward direction. Both networks
co-exist based on the same parameter set, have their own cost functions, and
can be separately or jointly trained. The PBN therefore has the potential to
possess the best qualities of both discriminative and generative classifiers.
To realize this potential, a separate PBN is trained on each class, maximizing
the generative likelihood function for the given class, while minimizing the
discriminative cost for the FFNN against "all other classes". This technique,
called discriminative alignment (PBN-DA), aligns the contours of the likelihood
function to the decision boundaries and attains vastly improved classification
performance, rivaling that of state of the art discriminative networks. The
method may be further improved using a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a component
of the PBN, called PBN-DA-HMM. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of
PBN, PBN-DA, and PBN-DA-HMM. In addition, the results of two new classification
experiments are provided. The first experiment uses air-acoustic events, and
the second uses underwater acoustic data consisting of marine mammal calls. In
both experiments, PBN-DA-HMM attains comparable or better performance as a
state of the art CNN, and attain a factor of two error reduction when combined
with the CNN.

<p class="mathjax">Opinionated users often seek information that aligns with their preexisting
beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence due to confirmation bias. This
conduct hinders their ability to consider alternative stances when searching
the web. Despite this, few studies have analyzed how the diversification of
search results on disputed topics influences the search behavior of highly
opinionated users. To this end, we present a preregistered user study (n = 257)
investigating whether different levels (low and high) of bias metrics and
search results presentation (with or without AI-predicted stances labels) can
affect the stance diversity consumption and search behavior of opinionated
users on three debated topics (i.e., atheism, intellectual property rights, and
school uniforms). Our results show that exposing participants to
(counter-attitudinally) biased search results increases their consumption of
attitude-opposing content, but we also found that bias was associated with a
trend toward overall fewer interactions within the search page. We also found
that 19% of users interacted with queries and search pages but did not select
any search results. When we removed these participants in a post-hoc analysis,
we found that stance labels increased the diversity of stances consumed by
users, particularly when the search results were biased. Our findings highlight
the need for future research to explore distinct search scenario settings to
gain insight into opinionated users' behavior.

<p class="mathjax">Training of modern large neural networks (NN) requires a combination of
parallelization strategies encompassing data, model, or optimizer sharding.
When strategies increase in complexity, it becomes necessary for partitioning
tools to be 1) expressive, allowing the composition of simpler strategies, and
2) predictable to estimate performance analytically. We present PartIR, our
design for a NN partitioning system. PartIR is focused on an incremental
approach to rewriting and is hardware-and-runtime agnostic. We present a simple
but powerful API for composing sharding strategies and a simulator to validate
them. The process is driven by high-level programmer-issued partitioning
tactics, which can be both manual and automatic. Importantly, the tactics are
specified separately from the model code, making them easy to change. We
evaluate PartIR on several different models to demonstrate its predictability,
expressibility, and ability to reach peak performance..

to their environment in a similar way to how plants grow and move with
potential applications where they could be used to navigate through tight
spaces, dangerous terrain, and hard-to-reach areas. This research explores the
application of deep reinforcement Q-learning algorithm for facilitating the
navigation of the soft growing robots in cluttered environments. The proposed
algorithm utilizes the flexibility of the soft robot to adapt and incorporate
the interaction between the robot and the environment into the decision-making
process. Results from simulations show that the proposed algorithm improves the

<p class="mathjax">Category-specific models are provenly valuable methods in 3D single object
tracking (SOT) regardless of Siamese or motion-centric paradigms. However, such
over-specialized model designs incur redundant parameters, thus limiting the
broader applicability of 3D SOT task. This paper first introduces unified
models that can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a
single network with shared model parameters. Specifically, we propose to
explicitly encode distinct attributes associated to different object
categories, enabling the model to adapt to cross-category data. We find that
the attribute variances of point cloud objects primarily occur from the varying
size and shape (e.g., large and square vehicles v.s. small and slender humans).
Based on this observation, we design a novel point set representation learning
network inheriting transformer architecture, termed AdaFormer, which adaptively
encodes the dynamically varying shape and size information from cross-category
data in a unified manner. We further incorporate the size and shape prior
derived from the known template targets into the model's inputs and learning
objective, facilitating the learning of unified representation. Equipped with
such designs, we construct two category-unified models SiamCUT and
MoCUT.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiamCUT and MoCUT exhibit strong
generalization and training stability. Furthermore, our category-unified models
outperform the category-specific counterparts by a significant margin (e.g., on
KITTI dataset, 12% and 3% performance gains on the Siamese and motion
paradigms). Our code will be available.

<p class="mathjax">Considering the appealing distribution gains of distributed antenna systems
(DAS) and passive gains of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a flexible
reconfigurable architecture called reconfigurable distributed antenna and
reflecting surface (RDARS) is proposed. RDARS encompasses DAS and RIS as two
special cases and maintains the advantages of distributed antennas while
reducing the hardware cost by replacing some active antennas with low-cost
passive reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we present a RDARS-aided uplink
multi-user communication system and investigate the system transmission
reliability with the newly proposed architecture. Specifically, in addition to
the distribution gain and the reflection gain provided by the connection and
reflection modes, respectively, we also consider the dynamic mode switching of
each element which introduces an additional degree of freedom (DoF) and thus
results in a selection gain. As such, we aim to minimize the total sum
mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams by jointly optimizing the receive
beamforming matrix, the reflection phase shifts and the channel-aware placement
of elements in the connection mode. To tackle this nonconvex problem with
intractable binary and cardinality constraints, we propose an inexact block
coordinate descent (BCD) based penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with
the guaranteed convergence. Since the PDD algorithm usually suffers from high
computational complexity, a low-complexity greedy-search-based alternating
optimization (AO) algorithm is developed to yield a semi-closed-form solution
with acceptable performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed architecture compared to the conventional fully passive RIS or
DAS. Furthermore, some insights about the practical implementation of RDARS are
provided.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they are not only
used as general-purpose AI assistants but are also customized through further
fine-tuning to meet the requirements of different applications. A pivotal
factor in the success of current LLMs is the alignment process. Current
alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus on training-time alignment and are
often complex and cumbersome to implement. Therefore, we develop
\textbf{InferAligner}, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes
cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. InferAligner utilizes safety
steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations
of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the
target model to provide harmless responses. Experimental results show that our
method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance,
medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the Attack Success Rate
(ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining
almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Terms of Service (ToS) form an integral part of any agreement as it defines
the legal relationship between a service provider and an end-user. Not only do
they establish and delineate reciprocal rights and responsibilities, but they
also provide users with information on essential aspects of contracts that
pertain to the use of digital spaces. These aspects include a wide range of
topics, including limitation of liability, data protection, etc. Users tend to
accept the ToS without going through it before using any application or
service. Such ignorance puts them in a potentially weaker situation in case any
action is required. Existing methodologies for the detection or classification
of unfair clauses are however obsolete and show modest performance. In this
research paper, we present SOTA(State of The Art) results on unfair clause
detection from ToS documents based on unprecedented Fine-tuning BERT in
integration with SVC(Support Vector Classifier). The study shows proficient
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.922 at unfair clause detection, and
superior performance is also shown in the classification of unfair clauses by
each tag. Further, a comparative analysis is performed by answering research

<p class="mathjax">Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and
multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of
environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the
collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires
abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of
cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by
ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with
neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact
rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing
values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support
programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a
distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the
ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction
in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring
values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled
through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding
implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective
processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed
monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the
abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing
applications.

<p class="mathjax">Organoids have garnered attention due to their effectiveness in modeling the
3D structure of organ interactions. However, the communication engineering
perspective has received relatively little attention. One way to achieve
organoids communication is molecular communication (MC). Molecular
communication is a bio-inspired communication paradigm that uses molecules as
information carriers. It is considered one of the most promising methods for
enabling the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) and nanonetworks. BioFETs are
commonly used to implement practical MC receivers. However, most previous
analyses have focused on a planar device, neglecting considerations like the

first FinFET-based MC receiver that covers both the top and side gates with

The performance, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error

<p class="mathjax">Machinery for data analysis often requires a numeric representation of the
input. Towards that, a common practice is to embed components of structured
data into a high-dimensional vector space. We study the embedding of the tuples
of a relational database, where existing techniques are often based on
optimization tasks over a collection of random walks from the database. The
focus of this paper is on the recent FoRWaRD algorithm that is designed for
dynamic databases, where walks are sampled by following foreign keys between
tuples. Importantly, different walks have different schemas, or "walk schemes",
that are derived by listing the relations and attributes along the walk. Also
importantly, different walk schemes describe relationships of different natures
in the database. We show that by focusing on a few informative walk schemes, we
can obtain tuple embedding significantly faster, while retaining the quality.
We define the problem of scheme selection for tuple embedding, devise several
approaches and strategies for scheme selection, and conduct a thorough
empirical study of the performance over a collection of downstream tasks. Our
results confirm that with effective strategies for scheme selection, we can
obtain high-quality embeddings considerably (e.g., three times) faster,
preserve the extensibility to newly inserted tuples, and even achieve an
increase in the precision of some tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Constructing first principles models is a challenging task for nonlinear and
complex systems such as a wastewater treatment unit. In recent years,
data-driven models are widely used to overcome the complexity. However, they
often suffer from issues such as missing, low quality or noisy data. Transfer
learning is a solution for this issue where knowledge from another task is
transferred to target one to increase the prediction performance. In this work,
the objective is increasing the prediction performance of an industrial
wastewater treatment plant by transferring the knowledge of (i) an open-source
simulation model that captures the underlying physics of the process, albeit
with dissimilarities to the target plant, (ii) another industrial plant
characterized by noisy and limited data but located in the same refinery, and
(iii) the model in (ii) and making the objective function of the training
problem physics informed where the physics information derived from the
open-source model in (ii). The results have shown that test and validation
performance are improved up to 27% and 59%, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Rhetorical Structure Theory implies no single discourse interpretation of a
text, and the limitations of RST parsers further exacerbate inconsistent
parsing of similar structures. Therefore, it is important to take into account
that the same argumentative structure can be found in semantically similar
texts with varying rhetorical structures. In this work, the differences between
paraphrases within the same argument scheme are evaluated from a rhetorical
perspective. The study proposes a deep dependency parsing model to assess the
connection between rhetorical and argument structures. The model utilizes
rhetorical relations; RST structures of paraphrases serve as training data
augmentations. The method allows for end-to-end argumentation analysis using a
rhetorical tree instead of a word sequence. It is evaluated on the bilingual
Microtexts corpus, and the first results on fully-fledged argument parsing for
the Russian version of the corpus are reported. The results suggest that
argument mining can benefit from multiple variants of discourse structure.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a secrecy performance study of a wiretap communication
system with finite blocklength (FBL) transmissions over Rayleigh fading
channels, based on the definition of an average information leakage (AIL)
metric. We evaluate the exact and closed-form approximate AIL performance,
assuming that only statistical channel state information (CSI) of the
eavesdropping link is available. Then, we reveal an inherent statistical
relationship between the AIL metric in the FBL regime and the commonly-used
secrecy outage probability in conventional infinite blocklength communications.
Aiming to improve the secure communication performance of the considered
system, we formulate a blocklength optimization problem and solve it via a
low-complexity approach. Next, we present numerical results to verify our
analytical findings and provide various important insights into the impacts of
system parameters on the AIL. Specifically, our results indicate that i)
compromising a small amount of AIL can lead to significant reliability
improvements, and ii) the AIL experiences a secrecy floor in the high
signal-to-noise ratio regime.

<p class="mathjax">Location-based services (LBSs) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) offer
users numerous conveniences. However, the extensive use of LBSs raises concerns
about the privacy of users' trajectories, as adversaries can exploit temporal
correlations between different locations to extract personal information.
Additionally, users have varying privacy requirements depending on the time and
location. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized
trajectory privacy protection mechanism (PTPPM). This mechanism first uses the
temporal correlation between trajectory locations to determine the possible
location set for each time instant. We identify a protection location set (PLS)
for each location by employing the Hilbert curve-based minimum distance search
algorithm. This approach incorporates the complementary features of
geo-indistinguishability and distortion privacy. We put forth a novel
Permute-and-Flip mechanism for location perturbation, which maps its initial
application in data publishing privacy protection to a location perturbation
mechanism. This mechanism generates fake locations with smaller perturbation
distances while improving the balance between privacy and quality of service
(QoS). Simulation results show that our mechanism outperforms the benchmark by
providing enhanced privacy protection while meeting user's QoS requirements.

<p class="mathjax">Single object tracking aims to locate the target object in a video sequence
according to the state specified by different modal references, including the
initial bounding box (BBOX), natural language (NL), or both (NL+BBOX). Due to
the gap between different modalities, most existing trackers are designed for
single or partial of these reference settings and overspecialize on the
specific modality. Differently, we present a unified tracker called UVLTrack,
which can simultaneously handle all three reference settings (BBOX, NL,
NL+BBOX) with the same parameters. The proposed UVLTrack enjoys several merits.
First, we design a modality-unified feature extractor for joint visual and
language feature learning and propose a multi-modal contrastive loss to align
the visual and language features into a unified semantic space. Second, a
modality-adaptive box head is proposed, which makes full use of the target
reference to mine ever-changing scenario features dynamically from video
contexts and distinguish the target in a contrastive way, enabling robust
performance in different reference settings. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that UVLTrack achieves promising performance on seven visual
tracking datasets, three vision-language tracking datasets, and three visual
grounding datasets. Codes and models will be open-sourced at
https://github.com/OpenSpaceAI/UVLTrack.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the emergence of DNA storage systems has led to a widespread
focus on the research of codes correcting insertions, deletions, and classic
substitutions. During the initial investigation, Levenshtein discovered the VT
codes are precisely capable of correcting single insertion/deletion and then
extended the VT construction to single-insertion/deletion/substitution
($1$-ins/del/sub) correcting codes. Inspired by this, we generalize the recent
findings of $1$-del $1$-sub correcting codes with redundancy $6\log_{2}n+O(1)$
to more general $2$-ins/del/sub correcting codes without increasing the
redundancy. Our key technique is to apply higher-order VT syndromes to distinct
objects and accomplish a systematic classification of all error patterns.

<p class="mathjax">Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a vital role in various domains
such as healthcare, networks, and industry. Considering labels are crucial for
detection but difficult to obtain, we turn to TSAD with inexact supervision:
only series-level labels are provided during the training phase, while
point-level anomalies are predicted during the testing phase. Previous works
follow a traditional multi-instance learning (MIL) approach, which focuses on
encouraging high anomaly scores at individual time steps. However, time series
anomalies are not only limited to individual point anomalies, they can also be
collective anomalies, typically exhibiting abnormal patterns over subsequences.
To address the challenge of collective anomalies, in this paper, we propose a
tree-based MIL framework (TreeMIL). We first adopt an N-ary tree structure to
divide the entire series into multiple nodes, where nodes at different levels
represent subsequences with different lengths. Then, the subsequence features
are extracted to determine the presence of collective anomalies. Finally, we
calculate point-level anomaly scores by aggregating features from nodes at
different levels. Experiments conducted on seven public datasets and eight
baselines demonstrate that TreeMIL achieves an average 32.3% improvement in F1-
score compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/fly-orange/TreeMIL.

<p class="mathjax">Some reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can stitch pieces of experience
to solve a task never seen before during training. This oft-sought property is
one of the few ways in which RL methods based on dynamic-programming differ
from RL methods based on supervised-learning (SL). Yet, certain RL methods
based on off-the-shelf SL algorithms achieve excellent results without an
explicit mechanism for stitching; it remains unclear whether those methods
forgo this important stitching property. This paper studies this question for
the problems of achieving a target goal state and achieving a target return
value. Our main result is to show that the stitching property corresponds to a
form of combinatorial generalization: after training on a distribution of
(state, goal) pairs, one would like to evaluate on (state, goal) pairs not seen
together in the training data. Our analysis shows that this sort of
generalization is different from i.i.d. generalization. This connection between
stitching and generalisation reveals why we should not expect SL-based RL
methods to perform stitching, even in the limit of large datasets and models.
Based on this analysis, we construct new datasets to explicitly test for this
property, revealing that SL-based methods lack this stitching property and
hence fail to perform combinatorial generalization. Nonetheless, the connection
between stitching and combinatorial generalisation also suggests a simple
remedy for improving generalisation in SL: data augmentation. We propose a
temporal data augmentation and demonstrate that adding it to SL-based methods
enables them to successfully complete tasks not seen together during training.
On a high level, this connection illustrates the importance of combinatorial
generalization for data efficiency in time-series data beyond tasks beyond RL,
like audio, video, or text.

<p class="mathjax">Ransomware attack effectiveness has increased causing far reaching
consequences that are not fully understood. The ability to disrupt core
services, the global reach, extended duration, and the repetition has increased
their ability to harm organizations. One aspect that needs to be understood
better is the effect on the user. The user in the current environment is
exposed to new technologies that might be adopted, but there are also habits of
using existing systems. The habits have developed over time with trust
increasing in the organization in contact directly and the institutions
supporting it. This research explores whether the global, extended, and
repeated RW attacks reduce the trust and inertia sufficiently to change
long-held habits in using information systems. The model tested measures the
effect of the RW attack on the e-commerce status quo to evaluate if it is
significant enough to overcome the users resistance to change.

<p class="mathjax">Image-based virtual try-on systems,which fit new garments onto human
portraits,are gaining research attention.An ideal pipeline should preserve the
static features of clothes(like textures and logos)while also generating
dynamic elements(e.g.shadows,folds)that adapt to the model's pose and
environment.Previous works fail specifically in generating dynamic features,as
they preserve the warped in-shop clothes trivially with predicted an alpha mask
by composition.To break the dilemma of over-preserving and textures losses,we
propose a novel diffusion-based Product-level virtual try-on pipeline,\ie
PLTON, which can preserve the fine details of logos and embroideries while
producing realistic clothes shading and wrinkles.The main insights are in three
folds:1)Adaptive Dynamic Rendering:We take a pre-trained diffusion model as a
generative prior and tame it with image features,training a dynamic extractor
from scratch to generate dynamic tokens that preserve high-fidelity semantic
information. Due to the strong generative power of the diffusion prior,we can
generate realistic clothes shadows and wrinkles.2)Static Characteristics
Transformation: High-frequency Map(HF-Map)is our fundamental insight for static
representation.PLTON first warps in-shop clothes to the target model pose by a
traditional warping network,and uses a high-pass filter to extract an HF-Map
for preserving static cloth features.The HF-Map is used to generate modulation
maps through our static extractor,which are injected into a fixed U-net to
synthesize the final result.To enhance retention,a Two-stage Blended Denoising
method is proposed to guide the diffusion process for correct spatial layout
and color.PLTON is finetuned only with our collected small-size try-on
dataset.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on 1024 768 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework in mimicking real clothes
dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) often need specialization for
domain-specific tasks. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular approach that
adapts a base model to multiple tasks by adding lightweight trainable adapters.
In this paper, we present CaraServe, a system that efficiently serves many LoRA
adapters derived from a common base model. CaraServe maintains the base model
on GPUs and dynamically loads activated LoRA adapters from main memory. As GPU
loading results in a cold-start that substantially delays token generation,
CaraServe employs a CPU-assisted approach. It early starts the activated
adapters on CPUs for prefilling as they are being loaded onto GPUs; after
loading completes, it then switches to the GPUs for generative LoRA inference.
CaraServe develops a highly optimized synchronization mechanism to efficiently
coordinate LoRA computation on the CPU and GPU. Moreover, CaraServe employs a
rank-aware scheduling algorithm to optimally schedule heterogeneous LoRA
requests for maximum service-level objective (SLO) attainment. We have
implemented CaraServe and evaluated it against state-of-the-art LoRA serving
systems. Our results demonstrate that CaraServe can speed up the average
request serving latency by up to 1.4$\times$ and achieve an SLO attainment of
up to 99%.

<p class="mathjax">Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various visual tasks. However, ViT models suffer from substantial computational
and memory requirements, making it challenging to deploy them on
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization is a popular approach for reducing
model size, but most studies mainly focus on equal bit-width quantization for
the entire network, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. While there are few
works on mixed precision quantization (MPQ) for ViTs, they typically rely on
search space-based methods or employ mixed precision arbitrarily. In this
paper, we introduce LRP-QViT, an explainability-based method for assigning
mixed-precision bit allocations to different layers based on their importance
during classification. Specifically, to measure the contribution score of each
layer in predicting the target class, we employ the Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP) method. LRP assigns local relevance at the output layer and
propagates it through all layers, distributing the relevance until it reaches
the input layers. These relevance scores serve as indicators for computing the
layer contribution score. Additionally, we have introduced a clipped
channel-wise quantization aimed at eliminating outliers from post-LayerNorm
activations to alleviate severe inter-channel variations. To validate and
assess our approach, we employ LRP-QViT across ViT, DeiT, and Swin transformer
models on various datasets. Our experimental findings demonstrate that both our
fixed-bit and mixed-bit post-training quantization methods surpass existing
models in the context of 4-bit and 6-bit quantization.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a natural language prompt-based retrieval augmented generation
(Prompt-RAG), a novel approach to enhance the performance of generative large
language models (LLMs) in niche domains. Conventional RAG methods mostly
require vector embeddings, yet the suitability of generic LLM-based embedding
representations for specialized domains remains uncertain. To explore and
exemplify this point, we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM)
and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents, finding that KM document embeddings
correlated more with token overlaps and less with human-assessed document
relatedness, in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt-RAG, distinct from
conventional RAG models, operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its
performance was assessed through a Question-Answering (QA) chatbot application,
where responses were evaluated for relevance, readability, and informativeness.
The results showed that Prompt-RAG outperformed existing models, including
ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAGs, in terms of relevance and
informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response
latency, the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of
Prompt-RAG, making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG
methods.

<p class="mathjax">There exist excellent codes for an efficient numerical treatment of stiff and
differential-algebraic problems. Let us mention {\sc Radau5} which is based on
the $3$-stage Radau IIA collocation method, and its extension to problems with
discrete delays {\sc Radar5}. The aim of the present work is to present a
technique that permits a direct application of these codes to problems having a
right-hand side with an additional distributed delay term (which is a special
case of an integro-differential equation). Models with distributed delays are
of increasing importance in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics for the study
of the interaction between drugs and the body.
<br />The main idea is to approximate the distribution kernel of the integral term
by a sum of exponential functions or by a quasi-polynomial expansion, and then
to transform the distributed (integral) delay term into a set of ordinary
differential equations. This set is typically stiff and, for some distribution
kernels (e.g., Pareto distribution), it contains discrete delay terms with
constant delay. The original equations augmented by this set of ordinary
differential equations can have a very large dimension, and a careful treatment
of the solution of the arising linear systems is necessary.
<br />The use of the codes {\sc Radau5} and {\sc Radar5} is illustrated at three
examples (two test equations and one problem taken from pharmacodynamics). The
driver programs for these examples are publicly available from the homepages of
the authors.

<p class="mathjax">Masked auto-encoder pre-training has emerged as a prevalent technique for
initializing and enhancing dense retrieval systems. It generally utilizes
additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision
signals and compress contextual information into dense representations.
However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training
technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders
also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed
light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training
with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens
in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon
this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing
the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word
prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical
signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training.
Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance
on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional
parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked
auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.

necessary for purchasing and utilizing health insurance. Evidence shows that
consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology in place of humans, but
the expanding use of AI potentially changes this. This research explores
whether trust and privacy concern are barriers to the adoption of AI in health
insurance. Two scenarios are compared: The first scenario has limited AI that
is not in the interface and its presence is not explicitly revealed to the
consumer. In the second scenario there is an AI interface and AI evaluation,
and this is explicitly revealed to the consumer. The two scenarios were modeled
and compared using SEM PLS-MGA. The findings show that trust is significantly
lower in the second scenario where AI is visible. Privacy concerns are higher
with AI but the difference is not statistically significant within the model.

context, which is one of the most critical subjects in the field. Although,
there exist many feature selection methods, however, these methods face
challenges such as scalability, managing high-dimensional data, dealing with
correlated features, adapting to variable feature importance, and integrating
domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce the ``Adaptive Feature Selection
with Binary Masking" (AFS-BM) which remedies these problems. AFS-BM achieves
this by joint optimization for simultaneous feature selection and model
training. In particular, we do the joint optimization and binary masking to
continuously adapt the set of features and model parameters during the training
process. This approach leads to significant improvements in model accuracy and
a reduction in computational requirements. We provide an extensive set of
experiments where we compare AFS-BM with the established feature selection
methods using well-known datasets from real-life competitions. Our results show
that AFS-BM makes significant improvement in terms of accuracy and requires
significantly less computational complexity. This is due to AFS-BM's ability to
dynamically adjust to the changing importance of features during the training
process, which an important contribution to the field. We openly share our code

<p class="mathjax">The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in
healthcare institutes has generated vast amounts of medical data, offering
significant opportunities for improving healthcare services through deep
learning techniques. However, the complex and diverse modalities and feature
structures in real-world EHR data pose great challenges for deep learning model
design. To address the multi-modality challenge in EHR data, current approaches
primarily rely on hand-crafted model architectures based on intuition and
empirical experiences, leading to sub-optimal model architectures and limited
performance. Therefore, to automate the process of model design for mining EHR
data, we propose a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework named
AutoFM, which can automatically search for the optimal model architectures for
encoding diverse input modalities and fusion strategies. We conduct thorough
experiments on real-world multi-modal EHR data and prediction tasks, and the
results demonstrate that our framework not only achieves significant
performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods but also
discovers meaningful network architectures effectively.

<p class="mathjax">In the current landscape of online abuses and harms, effective content
moderation is necessary to cultivate safe and inclusive online spaces. Yet, the
effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still unclear. Here, we
assess the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive deplatforming operation
that affected nearly 2,000 communities on Reddit. By analyzing 16M comments
posted by 17K users during 14 months, we provide nuanced results on the
effects, both desired and otherwise, of the ban. Among our main findings is
that 15.6% of the affected users left Reddit and that those who remained
reduced their toxicity by 6.6% on average. The ban also caused 5% users to
increase their toxicity by more than 70% of their pre-ban level. However, these
resentful users likely had limited impact on Reddit due to low activity and
little support by peers. Overall, our multifaceted results provide new insights
into the efficacy of deplatforming. Our findings can inform the development of
future moderation interventions and the policing of online platforms.

<p class="mathjax">Analysts frequently need to create visualizations in the data analysis
process to obtain and communicate insights. To reduce the burden of creating
visualizations, previous research has developed various approaches for analysts
to create visualizations from natural language queries. Recent studies have
demonstrated the capabilities of large language models in natural language
understanding and code generation tasks. The capabilities imply the potential
of using large language models to generate visualization specifications from
natural language queries. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of a large
language model to generate visualization specifications on the task of natural
language to visualization (NL2VIS). More specifically, we have opted for
GPT-3.5 and Vega-Lite to represent large language models and visualization
specifications, respectively. The evaluation is conducted on the nvBench
dataset. In the evaluation, we utilize both zero-shot and few-shot prompt
strategies. The results demonstrate that GPT-3.5 surpasses previous NL2VIS
approaches. Additionally, the performance of few-shot prompts is higher than
that of zero-shot prompts. We discuss the limitations of GPT-3.5 on NL2VIS,
such as misunderstanding the data attributes and grammar errors in generated
specifications. We also summarized several directions, such as correcting the
ground truth and reducing the ambiguities in natural language queries, to
improve the NL2VIS benchmark.

<p class="mathjax">Diversity plays a crucial role in improving the performance of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Currently, many diversity-based methods have
been developed to overcome the drawbacks of excessive parameter sharing in
traditional MARL. However, there remains a lack of a general metric to quantify
policy differences among agents. Such a metric would not only facilitate the
evaluation of the diversity evolution in multi-agent systems, but also provide
guidance for the design of diversity-based MARL algorithms. In this paper, we
propose the multi-agent policy distance (MAPD), a general tool for measuring
policy differences in MARL. By learning the conditional representations of
agents' decisions, MAPD can computes the policy distance between any pair of
agents. Furthermore, we extend MAPD to a customizable version, which can
quantify differences among agent policies on specified aspects. Based on the
online deployment of MAPD, we design a multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing
(MADPS) algorithm as an example of the MAPD's applications. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method is effective in measuring differences
in agent policies and specific behavioral tendencies. Moreover, in comparison
to other methods of parameter sharing, MADPS exhibits superior performance.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models (DMs) are a type of generative model that has a huge impact
on image synthesis and beyond. They achieve state-of-the-art generation results
in various generative tasks. A great diversity of conditioning inputs, such as
text or bounding boxes, are accessible to control the generation. In this work,
we propose a conditioning mechanism utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as
feature conditioning to guide the denoising process. Based on set theory, we
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that shows that conditional latent
distribution based on features and classes is significantly different, so that
conditional latent distribution on features produces fewer defect generations
than conditioning on classes. Two diffusion models conditioned on the Gaussian
mixture model are trained separately for comparison. Experiments support our
findings. A novel gradient function called the negative Gaussian mixture
gradient (NGMG) is proposed and applied in diffusion model training with an
additional classifier. Training stability has improved. We also theoretically
prove that NGMG shares the same benefit as the Earth Mover distance
(Wasserstein) as a more sensible cost function when learning distributions
supported by low-dimensional manifolds.

<p class="mathjax">We study propositional proof systems with inference rules that formalize
restricted versions of the ability to make assumptions that hold without loss
of generality, commonly used informally to shorten proofs. Each system we study
is built on resolution. They are called BC${}^-$, RAT${}^-$, SBC${}^-$, and
GER${}^-$, denoting respectively blocked clauses, resolution asymmetric
tautologies, set-blocked clauses, and generalized extended resolution - all
"without new variables." They may be viewed as weak versions of extended
resolution (ER) since they are defined by first generalizing the extension rule
and then taking away the ability to introduce new variables. Except for
SBC${}^-$, they are known to be strictly between resolution and extended
resolution.
<br />Several separations between these systems were proved earlier by exploiting
the fact that they effectively simulate ER. We answer the questions left open:
We prove exponential lower bounds for SBC${}^-$ proofs of a binary encoding of
the pigeonhole principle, which separates ER from SBC${}^-$. Using this new
separation, we prove that both RAT${}^-$ and GER${}^-$ are exponentially
separated from SBC${}^-$. This completes the picture of their relative
strengths.

<p class="mathjax">In the realm of automatic speech recognition (ASR), the quest for models that
not only perform with high accuracy but also offer transparency in their
decision-making processes is crucial. The potential of quality estimation (QE)
metrics is introduced and evaluated as a novel tool to enhance explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) in ASR systems. Through experiments and analyses,
the capabilities of the NoRefER (No Reference Error Rate) metric are explored
in identifying word-level errors to aid post-editors in refining ASR
hypotheses. The investigation also extends to the utility of NoRefER in the
corpus-building process, demonstrating its effectiveness in augmenting datasets
with insightful annotations. The diagnostic aspects of NoRefER are examined,
revealing its ability to provide valuable insights into model behaviors and
decision patterns. This has proven beneficial for prioritizing hypotheses in
post-editing workflows and fine-tuning ASR models. The findings suggest that
NoRefER is not merely a tool for error detection but also a comprehensive
framework for enhancing ASR systems' transparency, efficiency, and
effectiveness. To ensure the reproducibility of the results, all source codes

<p class="mathjax">Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for identifying faults,
failures, threats, and outliers across a range of applications. Recently, deep
learning techniques have been applied to this topic, but they often struggle in
real-world scenarios that are complex and highly dynamic, e.g., the normal data
may consist of multiple distributions, and various types of anomalies may
differ from the normal data to different degrees. In this work, to tackle these
challenges, we propose Distribution-Augmented Contrastive Reconstruction
(DACR). DACR generates extra data disjoint from the normal data distribution to
compress the normal data's representation space, and enhances the feature
extractor through contrastive learning to better capture the intrinsic
semantics from time-series data. Furthermore, DACR employs an attention
mechanism to model the semantic dependencies among multivariate time-series
features, thereby achieving more robust reconstruction for anomaly detection.
Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets in various anomaly
detection scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of DACR in achieving new
state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection.

<p class="mathjax">Because open source software relies on individuals who select their own
tasks, it is often underproduced -- a term used by software engineering
researchers to describe when a piece of software's relative quality is lower
than its relative importance. We examine the social and technical factors
associated with underproduction through a comparison of software packaged by
the Debian GNU/Linux community. We test a series of hypotheses developed from a
reading of prior research in software engineering. Although we find that
software age and programming language age offer a partial explanation for
variation in underproduction, we were surprised to find that the association
between underproduction and package age is weaker at high levels of programming
language age. With respect to maintenance efforts, we find that additional
resources are not always tied to better outcomes. In particular, having higher
numbers of contributors is associated with higher underproduction risk. Also,
contrary to our expectations, maintainer turnover and maintenance by a declared
team are not associated with lower rates of underproduction. Finally, we find
that the people working on bugs in underproduced packages tend to be those who
are more central to the community's collaboration network structure, although
contributors' betweenness centrality (often associated with brokerage in social
networks) is not associated with underproduction.

<p class="mathjax">As automated driving technology advances, the role of the driver to resume
control of the vehicle in conditionally automated vehicles becomes increasingly
critical. In the SAE Level 3 or partly automated vehicles, the driver needs to
be available and ready to intervene when necessary. This makes it essential to
evaluate their readiness accurately. This article presents a comprehensive
analysis of driver readiness assessment by combining head pose features and
eye-tracking data. The study explores the effectiveness of predictive models in
evaluating driver readiness, addressing the challenges of dataset limitations
and limited ground truth labels. Machine learning techniques, including LSTM
architectures, are utilised to model driver readiness based on the
Spatio-temporal status of the driver's head pose and eye gaze. The experiments
in this article revealed that a Bidirectional LSTM architecture, combining both
feature sets, achieves a mean absolute error of 0.363 on the DMD dataset,
demonstrating superior performance in assessing driver readiness. The modular
architecture of the proposed model also allows the integration of additional
driver-specific features, such as steering wheel activity, enhancing its
adaptability and real-world applicability.

<p class="mathjax">Given a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over input and output variables,
reactive synthesis requires us to design a deterministic Mealy machine that
gives the values of outputs at every time step for every sequence of inputs,
such that the LTL formula is satisfied. In this paper, we investigate the
notion of dependent variables in the context of reactive synthesis. Inspired by
successful pre-processing steps in Boolean functional synthesis, we define
dependent variables as output variables that are uniquely assigned, given an
assignment, to all other variables and the history so far. We describe an
automata-based approach for finding a set of dependent variables. Using this,
we show that dependent variables are surprisingly common in reactive synthesis
benchmarks. Next, we develop a novel synthesis framework that exploits
dependent variables to construct an overall synthesis solution. By implementing
this framework using the widely used library Spot, we show that reactive
synthesis using dependent variables can solve some problems beyond the reach of
several existing techniques. Further, among benchmarks with dependent
variables, if the number of non-dependent variables is low (at most 3 in our
experiments), our method is able outperform all state-of-the-art tools for
synthesis.

<p class="mathjax">The need to Fourier transform data sets with irregular sampling is shared by
various domains of science. This is the case for example in astronomy or
sismology. Iterative methods have been developed that allow to reach
approximate solutions. Here an exact solution to the problem for band-limited
periodic signals is presented. The exact spectrum can be deduced from the
spectrum of the non-equispaced data through the inversion of a Toeplitz matrix.
The result applies to data of any dimension. This method also provides an
excellent approximation for non-periodic band-limit signals. The method allows
to reach very high dynamic ranges ($10^{13}$ with double-float precision) which
depend on the regularity of the samples.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, the rapid evolution of computer vision has seen the
emergence of various vision foundation models, each tailored to specific data
types and tasks. While large language models often share a common pretext task,
the diversity in vision foundation models arises from their varying training
objectives. In this study, we delve into the quest for identifying the most
effective vision foundation models for few-shot semantic segmentation, a
critical task in computer vision. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
comparative analysis of four prominent foundation models: DINO V2, Segment
Anything, CLIP, Masked AutoEncoders, and a straightforward ResNet50 pre-trained
on the COCO dataset. Our investigation focuses on their adaptability to new
semantic segmentation tasks, leveraging only a limited number of segmented
images. Our experimental findings reveal that DINO V2 consistently outperforms
the other considered foundation models across a diverse range of datasets and
adaptation methods. This outcome underscores DINO V2's superior capability to
adapt to semantic segmentation tasks compared to its counterparts. Furthermore,
our observations indicate that various adapter methods exhibit similar
performance, emphasizing the paramount importance of selecting a robust feature
extractor over the intricacies of the adaptation technique itself. This insight
sheds light on the critical role of feature extraction in the context of
few-shot semantic segmentation. This research not only contributes valuable
insights into the comparative performance of vision foundation models in the
realm of few-shot semantic segmentation but also highlights the significance of
a robust feature extractor in this domain.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a weakly-supervised framework for the semantic segmentation of
circular-scan synthetic-aperture-sonar (CSAS) imagery. The first part of our
framework is trained in a supervised manner, on image-level labels, to uncover
a set of semi-sparse, spatially-discriminative regions in each image. The
classification uncertainty of each region is then evaluated. Those areas with
the lowest uncertainties are then chosen to be weakly labeled segmentation
seeds, at the pixel level, for the second part of the framework. Each of the
seed extents are progressively resized according to an unsupervised,
information-theoretic loss with structured-prediction regularizers. This
reshaping process uses multi-scale, adaptively-weighted features to delineate
class-specific transitions in local image content. Content-addressable memories
are inserted at various parts of our framework so that it can leverage features
from previously seen images to improve segmentation performance for related
images.
<br />We evaluate our weakly-supervised framework using real-world CSAS imagery
that contains over ten seafloor classes and ten target classes. We show that
our framework performs comparably to nine fully-supervised deep networks. Our
framework also outperforms eleven of the best weakly-supervised deep networks.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance when pre-training on natural imagery.
The average absolute performance gap to the next-best weakly-supervised network
is well over ten percent for both natural imagery and sonar imagery. This gap
is found to be statistically significant.

<p class="mathjax">Timely, personalized feedback is essential for students learning programming,
especially as class sizes expand. LLM-based tools like ChatGPT offer instant
support, but reveal direct answers with code, which may hinder deep conceptual
engagement. We developed CodeAid, an LLM-based programming assistant delivering
helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. For
example, CodeAid can answer conceptual questions, generate pseudo-code with
line-by-line explanations, and annotate student's incorrect code with fix
suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a
12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed,
further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then
interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights on CodeAid.
Findings revealed students primarily used CodeAid for conceptual understanding
and debugging, although a minority tried to obtain direct code. Educators
appreciated CodeAid's educational approach, and expressed concerns about
occasional incorrect feedback and students defaulting to ChatGPT.

<p class="mathjax">With the proliferation of large pre-trained language models (PLMs),
fine-tuning all model parameters becomes increasingly inefficient, particularly
when dealing with numerous downstream tasks that entail substantial training
and storage costs. Several approaches aimed at achieving parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) have been proposed. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
stands out as an archetypal method, incorporating trainable rank decomposition
matrices into each target module. Nevertheless, LoRA does not consider the
varying importance of each layer. To address these challenges, we introduce
PRILoRA, which linearly allocates a different rank for each layer, in an
increasing manner, and performs pruning throughout the training process,
considering both the temporary magnitude of weights and the accumulated
statistics of the input to any given layer. We validate the effectiveness of
PRILoRA through extensive experiments on eight GLUE benchmarks, setting a new
state of the art.

<p class="mathjax">Community management is critical for community stakeholders to
collaboratively build and maintain the community with socio-technical support.
Existing work mainly focuses on the community members and the platform; little
work explores the developers who mediate the relationship between the platform
and community members and build the tools to support their community
management. In this study, we focus on third-party developers (TPDs) for the
live streaming platform Twitch and explore their tool development practices. In
a mixed method with in-depth qualitative analysis, we found that TPDs maintain
complex relationships with different stakeholders (streamers, viewers,
platform, professional developers), and the multi-layered policy restricts
their agency regarding idea innovation and tool development. We argue that HCI
research should redirect the attention from tool users to tool developers
regarding community management and propose close collaboration with the
platform and professional developers and streamlining the development process
with unified took kits and policy documentation.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) has become an effective solution for few-shot
learning in natural language processing. Past work has found that, during this
process, representations of the last prompt token are utilized to store task
reasoning procedures, thereby explaining the working mechanism of in-context
learning. In this paper, we seek to locate and analyze other task-encoding
tokens whose representations store task reasoning procedures. Supported by
experiments that ablate the representations of different token types, we find
that template and stopword tokens are the most prone to be task-encoding
tokens. In addition, we demonstrate experimentally that lexical cues,
repetition, and text formats are the main distinguishing characteristics of
these tokens. Our work provides additional insights into how large language
models (LLMs) leverage task reasoning procedures in ICL and suggests that
future work may involve using task-encoding tokens to improve the computational
efficiency of LLMs at inference time and their ability to handle long
sequences.

<p class="mathjax">Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search (ANNS) is a subroutine in algorithms
routinely employed in information retrieval, pattern recognition, data mining,
image processing, and beyond. Recent works have established that graph-based
ANNS algorithms are practically more efficient than the other methods proposed
in the literature, on large datasets. The growing volume and dimensionality of
data necessitates designing scalable techniques for ANNS. To this end, the
prior art has explored parallelizing graph-based ANNS on GPU leveraging its
high computational power and energy efficiency. The current state-of-the-art
GPU-based ANNS algorithms either (i) require both the index-graph and the data
to reside entirely in the GPU memory, or (ii) they partition the data into
small independent shards, each of which can fit in GPU memory, and perform the
search on these shards on the GPU. While the first approach fails to handle
large datasets due to the limited memory available on the GPU, the latter
delivers poor performance on large datasets due to high data traffic over the
low-bandwidth PCIe bus. In this paper, we introduce BANG, a first-of-its-kind
GPU-based ANNS method which works efficiently on billion-scale datasets that
cannot entirely fit in the GPU memory. BANG stands out by harnessing compressed
data on the GPU to perform distance computations while maintaining the graph on
the CPU. BANG incorporates high-optimized GPU kernels and proceeds in stages
that run concurrently on the GPU and CPU, taking advantage of their
architectural specificities. We evaluate BANG using a single NVIDIA Ampere A100
GPU on ten popular ANN benchmark datasets. BANG outperforms the
state-of-the-art in the majority of the cases. Notably, on the billion-size
datasets, we are significantly faster than our competitors, achieving
throughputs 40x-200x more than the competing methods for a high recall of 0.9.

<p class="mathjax">Many Reinforcement Learning algorithms assume a Markov reward function to
guarantee optimality. However, not all reward functions are known to be Markov.
In this paper, we propose a framework for mapping non-Markov reward functions
into equivalent Markov ones by learning a Reward Machine - a specialized reward
automaton. Unlike the general practice of learning Reward Machines, we do not
require a set of high-level propositional symbols from which to learn. Rather,
we learn \emph{hidden triggers} directly from data that encode them. We
demonstrate the importance of learning Reward Machines versus their
Deterministic Finite-State Automata counterparts, for this task, given their
ability to model reward dependencies in a single automaton. We formalize this
distinction in our learning objective. Our mapping process is constructed as an
Integer Linear Programming problem. We prove that our mappings provide
consistent expectations for the underlying process. We empirically validate our
approach by learning black-box non-Markov Reward functions in the Officeworld
Domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of learning dependencies
between rewards in a new domain, Breakfastworld.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a maintenance policy for a modular system formed by K
independent modules (n-subsystems) subjected to environmental conditions
(shocks). For the modeling of this complex system, the use of the
Matrix-Analytical Method (MAM) is proposed under a layered approach according
to its hierarchical structure. Thus, the operational state of the system (top
layer) depends on the states of the modules (middle layer), which in turn
depend on the states of their components (bottom layer). This allows a detailed
description of the system operation to plan maintenance actions appropriately
and optimally. We propose a hierarchical decision-based maintenance strategy
with periodic inspections as follows: at the time of the inspection, the
condition of the system is first evaluated. If intervention is necessary, the
modules are then checked to make individual decisions based on their states,
and so on. Replacement or repair will be carried out as appropriate. An
optimization problem is formulated as a function of the length of the
inspection period and the intervention cost incurred over the useful life of
the system. Our method shows the advantages, providing compact and
implementable expressions. The model is illustrated on a submarine Electrical
Control Unit (ECU).

<p class="mathjax">Nowadays, the diffusion of information through social networks is a powerful
phenomenon. One common way to model diffusions in social networks is the
Independent Cascade (IC) model. Given a set of infected nodes according to the
IC model, a natural problem is the source detection problem, in which the goal
is to identify the unique node that has started the diffusion. Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a common approach for tackling the source
detection problem, but it is computationally hard.
<br />In this work, we propose an efficient method for the source detection problem
under the MLE approach, which is based on computing the stationary distribution
of a Markov chain. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method compared to other state-of-the-art methods from the literature, both on
random and real-world networks.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models now possess human-level linguistic abilities in many
contexts. This raises the concern that they can be used to deceive and
manipulate on unprecedented scales, for instance spreading political
misinformation on social media. In future, agentic AI systems might also
deceive and manipulate humans for their own ends. In this paper, first, I argue
that AI-generated content should be subject to stricter standards against
deception and manipulation than we ordinarily apply to humans. Second, I offer
new characterizations of AI deception and manipulation meant to support such
standards, according to which a statement is deceptive (manipulative) if it
leads human addressees away from the beliefs (choices) they would endorse under
``semi-ideal'' conditions. Third, I propose two measures to guard against AI
deception and manipulation, inspired by this characterization: "extreme
transparency" requirements for AI-generated content and defensive systems that,
among other things, annotate AI-generated statements with contextualizing
information. Finally, I consider to what extent these measures can protect
against deceptive behavior in future, agentic AIs, and argue that non-agentic
defensive systems can provide an important layer of defense even against more
powerful agentic systems.

<p class="mathjax">Vision-language models such as CLIP have shown impressive capabilities in
encoding texts and images into aligned embeddings, enabling the retrieval of
multimodal data in a shared embedding space. However, these embedding-based
models still face challenges in effectively matching images and texts with
similar visio-linguistic compositionality, as evidenced by their performance on
the recent Winoground dataset. In this paper, we argue that this limitation
stems from two factors: the use of single vector representations for complex
multimodal data, and the absence of step-by-step reasoning in these
embedding-based methods. To address this issue, we make an exploratory step
using a novel generative method that prompts large vision-language models
(e.g., GPT-4) to depict images and perform compositional reasoning. Our method
outperforms other embedding-based methods on the Winoground dataset, and
obtains further improvement of up to 10% accuracy when enhanced with the
optimal description.

<p class="mathjax">Epoch based memory reclamation (EBR) is one of the most popular techniques
for reclaiming memory in lock-free and optimistic locking data structures, due
to its ease of use and good performance in practice. However, EBR is known to
be sensitive to thread delays, which can result in performance degradation.
Moreover, the exact mechanism for this performance degradation is not well
understood. This paper illustrates this performance degradation in a popular
data structure benchmark, and does a deep dive to uncover its root cause-a
subtle interaction between EBR and state of the art memory allocators. In
essence, modern allocators attempt to reduce the overhead of freeing by
maintaining bounded thread caches of objects for local reuse, actually freeing
them (a very high latency operation) only when thread caches become too large.
EBR immediately bypasses these mechanisms whenever a particularly large batch
of objects is freed, substantially increasing overheads and latencies. Beyond
EBR, many memory reclamation algorithms, and data structures, that reclaim
objects in large batches suffer similar deleterious interactions with popular
allocators. We propose a simple algorithmic fix for such algorithms to amortize
the freeing of large object batches over time, and apply this technique to ten
existing memory reclamation algorithms, observing performance improvements for
nine out of ten, and over 50% improvement for six out of ten in experiments on
a high performance lock-free ABtree. We also present an extremely simple token
passing variant of EBR and show that, with our fix, it performs 1.5-2.6x faster
than the fastest known memory reclamation algorithm, and 1.2-1.5x faster than
not reclaiming at all, on a 192 thread four socket Intel system.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce a distributionally robust approach that enhances the reliability
of offline policy evaluation in contextual bandits under general covariate
shifts. Our method aims to deliver robust policy evaluation results in the
presence of discrepancies in both context and policy distribution between
logging and target data. Central to our methodology is the application of
robust regression, a distributionally robust technique tailored here to improve
the estimation of conditional reward distribution from logging data. Utilizing
the reward model obtained from robust regression, we develop a comprehensive
suite of policy value estimators, by integrating our reward model into
established evaluation frameworks, namely direct methods and doubly robust
methods. Through theoretical analysis, we further establish that the proposed
policy value estimators offer a finite sample upper bound for the bias,
providing a clear advantage over traditional methods, especially when the shift
is large. Finally, we designed an extensive range of policy evaluation
scenarios, covering diverse magnitudes of shifts and a spectrum of logging and
target policies. Our empirical results indicate that our approach significantly
outperforms baseline methods, most notably in 90% of the cases under the policy
shift-only settings and 72% of the scenarios under the general covariate shift
settings.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in protein language models have catalyzed significant
progress in peptide sequence representation. Despite extensive exploration in
this field, pre-trained models tailored for peptide-specific needs remain
largely unaddressed due to the difficulty in capturing the complex and
sometimes unstable structures of peptides. This study introduces a novel
multi-view contrastive learning framework PepHarmony for the sequence-based
peptide encoding task. PepHarmony innovatively combines both sequence- and
structure-level information into a sequence-level encoding module through
contrastive learning. We carefully select datasets from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) and AlphaFold database to encompass a broad spectrum of peptide sequences
and structures. The experimental data highlights PepHarmony's exceptional
capability in capturing the intricate relationship between peptide sequences
and structures compared with the baseline and fine-tuned models. The robustness
of our model is confirmed through extensive ablation studies, which emphasize
the crucial roles of contrastive loss and strategic data sorting in enhancing
predictive performance. The proposed PepHarmony framework serves as a notable
contribution to peptide representations, and offers valuable insights for
future applications in peptide drug discovery and peptide engineering. We have

<p class="mathjax">Social media platforms prevent malicious activities by detecting harmful
content of posts and comments. To that end, they employ large-scale deep neural
network language models for sentiment analysis and content understanding. Some
models, like BERT, are complex, and have numerous parameters, which makes them
expensive to operate and maintain. To overcome these deficiencies, industry
experts employ a knowledge distillation compression technique, where a
distilled model is trained to reproduce the classification behavior of the
original model. The distillation processes terminates when the distillation
loss function reaches the stopping criteria. This function is mainly designed
to ensure that the original and the distilled models exhibit alike
classification behaviors. However, besides classification accuracy, there are
additional properties of the original model that the distilled model should
preserve to be considered as an appropriate abstraction. In this work, we
explore whether distilled TinyBERT models preserve confidence values of the
original BERT models, and investigate how this confidence preservation property
could guide tuning hyperparameters of the distillation process.

<p class="mathjax">Context. Advancements in Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing every
application domain, driving unprecedented transformations and fostering
innovation. However, despite these advances, several organizations are
experiencing friction in the adoption of ML-based technologies, mainly due to
the shortage of ML professionals. In this context, Automated Machine Learning
(AutoML) techniques have been presented as a promising solution to democratize
ML adoption. Objective. We aim to provide an overview of the evidence on the
benefits and limitations of using AutoML tools. Method. We conducted a
multivocal literature review, which allowed us to identify 54 sources from the
academic literature and 108 sources from the grey literature reporting on
AutoML benefits and limitations. We extracted reported benefits and limitations
from the papers and applied thematic analysis. Results. We identified 18
benefits and 25 limitations. Concerning the benefits, we highlight that AutoML
tools can help streamline the core steps of ML workflows, namely data
preparation, feature engineering, model construction, and hyperparameter
tuning, with concrete benefits on model performance, efficiency, and
scalability. In addition, AutoML empowers both novice and experienced data
scientists, promoting ML accessibility. On the other hand, we highlight several
limitations that may represent obstacles to the widespread adoption of AutoML.
For instance, AutoML tools may introduce barriers to transparency and
interoperability, exhibit limited flexibility for complex scenarios, and offer
inconsistent coverage of the ML workflow. Conclusions. The effectiveness of
AutoML in facilitating the adoption of machine learning by users may vary
depending on the tool and the context in which it is used. As of today, AutoML
tools are used to increase human expertise rather than replace it, and, as
such, they require skilled users.

<p class="mathjax">Software systems impact society at different levels as they pervasively solve
real-world problems. Modern software systems are often so sophisticated that
their complexity exceeds the limits of human comprehension. These systems must
respond to changing goals, dynamic data, unexpected failures, and security
threats, among other variable factors in real-world environments. Systems'
complexity challenges their interpretability and requires autonomous responses
to dynamic changes. Two main research areas explore autonomous systems'
responses: evolutionary computing and autonomic computing. Evolutionary
computing focuses on software improvement based on iterative modifications to
the source code. Autonomic computing focuses on optimising systems' performance
by changing their structure, behaviour, or environment variables. Approaches
from both areas rely on feedback loops that accumulate knowledge from the
system interactions to inform autonomous decision-making. However, this
knowledge is often limited, constraining the systems' interpretability and
adaptability. This paper proposes a new concept for interpretable and adaptable
software systems: self-sustaining software systems (S4). S4 builds knowledge
loops between all available knowledge sources that define modern software
systems to improve their interpretability and adaptability. This paper
introduces and discusses the S4 concept.

<p class="mathjax">To extend the limited scope of autonomy used in prior missions for operation
in distant and complex environments, there is a need to further develop and
mature autonomy that jointly reasons over multiple subsystems, which we term
system-level autonomy. System-level autonomy establishes situational awareness
that resolves conflicting information across subsystems, which may necessitate
the refinement and interconnection of the underlying spacecraft and environment
onboard models. However, with a limited understanding of the assumptions and
tradeoffs of modeling to arbitrary extents, designing onboard models to support
system-level capabilities presents a significant challenge.
<br />In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the increasing levels of
model fidelity for several key spacecraft subsystems, with the goal of
informing future spacecraft functional- and system-level autonomy algorithms
and the physics-based simulators on which they are validated. We do not argue
for the adoption of a particular fidelity class of models but, instead,
highlight the potential tradeoffs and opportunities associated with the use of
models for onboard autonomy and in physics-based simulators at various fidelity
levels. We ground our analysis in the context of deep space exploration of
small bodies, an emerging frontier for autonomous spacecraft operation in
space, where the choice of models employed onboard the spacecraft may determine
mission success. We conduct our experiments in the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and
Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT), a software suite for developing spacecraft autonomy
algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Back-stepping Experience Replay
(BER), that is compatible with arbitrary off-policy reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. BER aims to enhance learning efficiency in systems with approximate
reversibility, reducing the need for complex reward shaping. The method
constructs reversed trajectories using back-stepping transitions to reach
random or fixed targets. Interpretable as a bi-directional approach, BER
addresses inaccuracies in back-stepping transitions through a distillation of
the replay experience during learning. Given the intricate nature of soft
robots and their complex interactions with environments, we present an
application of BER in a model-free RL approach for the locomotion and
navigation of a soft snake robot, which is capable of serpentine motion enabled
by anisotropic friction between the body and ground. In addition, a dynamic
simulator is developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the BER
algorithm, in which the robot demonstrates successful learning (reaching a 100%
success rate) and adeptly reaches random targets, achieving an average speed
48% faster than that of the best baseline approach.

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial attacks against NLP Deep Learning models are a significant
concern. In particular, adversarial samples exploit the model's sensitivity to
small input changes. While these changes appear insignificant on the semantics
of the input sample, they result in significant decay in model performance. In
this paper, we propose Targeted Paraphrasing via RL (TPRL), an approach to
automatically learn a policy to generate challenging samples that most likely
improve the model's performance. TPRL leverages FLAN T5, a language model, as a
generator and employs a self learned policy using a proximal policy gradient to
generate the adversarial examples automatically. TPRL's reward is based on the
confusion induced in the classifier, preserving the original text meaning
through a Mutual Implication score. We demonstrate and evaluate TPRL's
effectiveness in discovering natural adversarial attacks and improving model
performance through extensive experiments on four diverse NLP classification
tasks via Automatic and Human evaluation. TPRL outperforms strong baselines,
exhibits generalizability across classifiers and datasets, and combines the
strengths of language modeling and reinforcement learning to generate diverse
and influential adversarial examples.

<p class="mathjax">Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation
of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly
leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit
encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach
to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders
(HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method
situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball
with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by
re-training on hyperbolic cluster and centripetal losses. These losses are
designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise
them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained and fine-tuned LMs,
focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting
subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results
demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform both pre-trained and fine-tuned
LMs in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our
re-trained hierarchy encoders.

<p class="mathjax">Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) can cooperatively
accomplish tasks that a single AUV cannot complete. Recently, multi-agent
reinforcement learning has been introduced to control of multi-AUV. However,
designing efficient reward functions for various tasks of multi-AUV control is
difficult or even impractical. Multi-agent generative adversarial imitation
learning (MAGAIL) allows multi-AUV to learn from expert demonstration instead
of pre-defined reward functions, but suffers from the deficiency of requiring
optimal demonstrations and not surpassing provided expert demonstrations. This
paper builds upon the MAGAIL algorithm by proposing multi-agent generative
adversarial interactive self-imitation learning (MAGAISIL), which can
facilitate AUVs to learn policies by gradually replacing the provided
sub-optimal demonstrations with self-generated good trajectories selected by a
human trainer. Our experimental results in a multi-AUV formation control and
obstacle avoidance task on the Gazebo platform with AUV simulator of our lab
show that AUVs trained via MAGAISIL can surpass the provided sub-optimal expert
demonstrations and reach a performance close to or even better than MAGAIL with
optimal demonstrations. Further results indicate that AUVs' policies trained
via MAGAISIL can adapt to complex and different tasks as well as MAGAIL
learning from optimal demonstrations.

<p class="mathjax">Model-based offline reinforcement learning methods (RL) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in many decision-making problems thanks to their
sample efficiency and generalizability. Despite these advancements, existing
model-based offline RL approaches either focus on theoretical studies without
developing practical algorithms or rely on a restricted parametric policy
space, thus not fully leveraging the advantages of an unrestricted policy space
inherent to model-based methods. To address this limitation, we develop MoMA, a
model-based mirror ascent algorithm with general function approximations under
partial coverage of offline data. MoMA distinguishes itself from existing
literature by employing an unrestricted policy class. In each iteration, MoMA
conservatively estimates the value function by a minimization procedure within
a confidence set of transition models in the policy evaluation step, then
updates the policy with general function approximations instead of
commonly-used parametric policy classes in the policy improvement step. Under
some mild assumptions, we establish theoretical guarantees of MoMA by proving
an upper bound on the suboptimality of the returned policy. We also provide a
practically implementable, approximate version of the algorithm. The
effectiveness of MoMA is demonstrated via numerical studies.

<p class="mathjax">Mapping speech tokens to the same feature space as text tokens has become the
paradigm for the integration of speech modality into decoder-only large
language models (LLMs). An alternative approach is to use an encoder-decoder
architecture that incorporates speech features through cross-attention. This
approach, however, has received less attention in the literature. In this work,
we connect the Whisper encoder with ChatGLM3 and provide in-depth comparisons
of these two approaches using Chinese automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
name entity recognition (NER) tasks. We evaluate them not only by conventional
metrics like the F1 score but also by a novel fine-grained taxonomy of ASR-NER
errors. Our experiments reveal that encoder-decoder architecture outperforms
decoder-only architecture with a short context, while decoder-only architecture
benefits from a long context as it fully exploits all layers of the LLM. By
using LLM, we significantly reduced the entity omission errors and improved the
entity ASR accuracy compared to the Conformer baseline. Additionally, we
obtained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) F1 score of 0.805 on the AISHELL-NER test
set by using chain-of-thought (CoT) NER which first infers long-form ASR
transcriptions and then predicts NER labels.

<p class="mathjax">In the face of rapidly expanding online medical literature, automated systems
for aggregating and summarizing information are becoming increasingly crucial
for healthcare professionals and patients. Large Language Models (LLMs), with
their advanced generative capabilities, have shown promise in various NLP
tasks, and their potential in the healthcare domain, particularly for
Closed-Book Generative QnA, is significant. However, the performance of these
models in domain-specific tasks such as medical Q&amp;A remains largely unexplored.
This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the performance of general and
medical-specific distilled LMs for medical Q&amp;A. We aim to evaluate the
effectiveness of fine-tuning domain-specific LMs and compare the performance of
different families of Language Models. The study will address critical
questions about these models' reliability, comparative performance, and
effectiveness in the context of medical Q&amp;A. The findings will provide valuable
insights into the suitability of different LMs for specific applications in the
medical domain.

multiple-node failures of RS codes under the rack-aware storage model, we
employ good polynomials to guide the placement of the conventional RS codes
into racks and then propose a novel repair framework for the resultant
rack-aware RS codes, which can transform its repair to that under the
homogeneous storage model. As applications of our repair framework, firstly we
present the repair scheme of multiple-node failures for some existing
constructions, which can only repair a single-node failure before. Secondly, we
deduce several new constructions of rack-aware RS codes supporting the repair
of multiple-node failures.

<p class="mathjax">With the advance of artificial intelligence (AI), the emergence of Google
Gemini and OpenAI Q* marks the direction towards artificial general
intelligence (AGI). To implement AGI, the concept of interactive AI (IAI) has
been introduced, which can interactively understand and respond not only to
human user input but also to dynamic system and network conditions. In this
article, we explore an integration and enhancement of IAI in networking. We
first comprehensively review recent developments and future perspectives of AI
and then introduce the technology and components of IAI. We then explore the
integration of IAI into the next-generation networks, focusing on how implicit
and explicit interactions can enhance network functionality, improve user
experience, and promote efficient network management. Subsequently, we propose
an IAI-enabled network management and optimization framework, which consists of
environment, perception, action, and brain units. We also design the pluggable
large language model (LLM) module and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
module to build the knowledge base and contextual memory for decision-making in
the brain unit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through case
studies. Finally, we discuss potential research directions for IAI-based
networks.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose leveraging causal generative learning as an
interpretable tool for explaining image classifiers. Specifically, we present a
generative counterfactual inference approach to study the influence of visual
features (i.e., pixels) as well as causal factors through generative learning.
To this end, we first uncover the most influential pixels on a classifier's
decision by varying the value of a causal attribute via counterfactual
inference and computing both Shapely and contrastive explanations for
counterfactual images with these different attribute values. We then establish
a Monte-Carlo mechanism using the generator of a causal generative model in
order to adapt Shapley explainers to produce feature importances for the
human-interpretable attributes of a causal dataset in the case where a
classifier has been trained exclusively on the images of the dataset. Finally,
we present optimization methods for creating counterfactual explanations of
classifiers by means of counterfactual inference, proposing straightforward
approaches for both differentiable and arbitrary classifiers. We exploit the
Morpho-MNIST causal dataset as a case study for exploring our proposed methods
for generating counterfacutl explantions. We employ visual explanation methods
from OmnixAI open source toolkit to compare them with our proposed methods. By
employing quantitative metrics to measure the interpretability of
counterfactual explanations, we find that our proposed methods of
counterfactual explanation offer more interpretable explanations compared to
those generated from OmnixAI. This finding suggests that our methods are
well-suited for generating highly interpretable counterfactual explanations on
causal datasets.

<p class="mathjax">3D open-vocabulary scene understanding aims to recognize arbitrary novel
categories beyond the base label space. However, existing works not only fail
to fully utilize all the available modal information in the 3D domain but also
lack sufficient granularity in representing the features of each modality. In
this paper, we propose a unified multimodal 3D open-vocabulary scene
understanding network, namely UniM-OV3D, which aligns point clouds with image,
language and depth. To better integrate global and local features of the point
clouds, we design a hierarchical point cloud feature extraction module that
learns comprehensive fine-grained feature representations. Further, to
facilitate the learning of coarse-to-fine point-semantic representations from
captions, we propose the utilization of hierarchical 3D caption pairs,
capitalizing on geometric constraints across various viewpoints of 3D scenes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
our method in open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, which
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks
such as ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3IDS and nuScenes. Code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) allows the agent to reproduce expert
behavior with low-dimensional states and actions. However, challenges arise in
handling visual states due to their less distinguishable representation
compared to low-dimensional proprioceptive features. While existing methods
resort to adopt complex network architectures or separate the process of
learning representation and decision-making, they overlook valuable intra-agent
information within demonstrations. To address this problem, this paper proposes
a simple and effective solution by incorporating calibrated contrastive
representative learning into visual AIL framework. Specifically, we present an
image encoder in visual AIL, utilizing a combination of unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning to extract valuable features from visual
states. Based on the fact that the improved agent often produces demonstrations
of varying quality, we propose to calibrate the contrastive loss by treating
each agent demonstrations as a mixed sample. The incorporation of contrastive
learning can be jointly optimized with the AIL framework, without modifying the
architecture or incurring significant computational costs. Experimental results
on DMControl Suite demonstrate our proposed method is sample efficient and can
outperform other compared methods from different aspects.

<p class="mathjax">This paper develops a new approach to the assessment of the
boundedness/stability of some vector nonlinear systems with delays and variable
coefficients. The approach rests on the development of scalar counterparts to
the original vector systems. We show that the solutions to these scalar
auxiliary nonlinear equations with delay and variable coefficients bound from
the above the norms of solutions to the original equations with the matched
history functions. This prompts the assessment of the boundedness/stability
traits of the vector systems through the abridged evaluation of the dynamics of
their scalar counterparts. The latter task is achieved in effortless
simulations or through the application of simplified analytical inferences.
Consequently, we convey some novel boundedness/ stability criteria and estimate
the radiuses of the balls imbedded in the boundedness/stability regions.
Lastly, we authenticate our inferences in representative simulations that also
measure their accuracy.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a significant impact on
various tasks, due to their extensive knowledge and powerful perception and
generation capabilities. However, it still remains an open research problem on
applying MLLMs to low-level vision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple
MLLM-based Image Restoration framework to address this gap, namely Multi-modal
Large Language Model based Restoration Assistant (LLMRA). We exploit the
impressive capabilities of MLLMs to obtain the degradation information for
universal image restoration. By employing a pretrained multi-modal large
language model and a vision language model, we generate text descriptions and
encode them as context embedding with degradation information for the degraded
image. Through the proposed Context Enhance Module (CEM) and Degradation
Context based Transformer Network (DC-former), we integrate these context
embedding into the restoration network, contributing to more accurate and
adjustable image restoration. Based on the dialogue with the users, our method
leverages image degradation priors from MLLMs, providing low-level attributes
descriptions of the input low-quality images and the restored high-quality
images simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance of our LLMRA in universal image restoration tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant
acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block,
molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to
enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to
incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all
features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would
potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To
address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models
as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent
accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by
understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor
customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor.
Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines,
validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation
learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization
to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular
representation methods. Our codes and appendix are available at
https://github.com/SCIR-HI/MolTailor.

<p class="mathjax">Datasets encountered in scientific and engineering applications appear in
complex formats (e.g., images, multivariate time series, molecules, video, text
strings, networks). Graph theory provides a unifying framework to model such
datasets and enables the use of powerful tools that can help analyze,
visualize, and extract value from data. In this work, we present PlasmoData.jl,
an open-source, Julia framework that uses concepts of graph theory to
facilitate the modeling and analysis of complex datasets. The core of our
framework is a general data modeling abstraction, which we call a DataGraph. We
show how the abstraction and software implementation can be used to represent
diverse data objects as graphs and to enable the use of tools from topology,
graph theory, and machine learning (e.g., graph neural networks) to conduct a
variety of tasks. We illustrate the versatility of the framework by using real
datasets: i) an image classification problem using topological data analysis to
extract features from the graph model to train machine learning models; ii) a
disease outbreak problem where we model multivariate time series as graphs to
detect abnormal events; and iii) a technology pathway analysis problem where we
highlight how we can use graphs to navigate connectivity. Our discussion also
highlights how PlasmoData.jl leverages native Julia capabilities to enable
compact syntax, scalable computations, and interfaces with diverse packages.

<p class="mathjax">Despite recent advances in video action recognition achieving strong
performance on existing benchmarks, these models often lack robustness when
faced with natural distribution shifts between training and test data. We
propose two novel evaluation methods to assess model resilience to such
distribution disparity. One method uses two different datasets collected from
different sources and uses one for training and validation, and the other for
testing. More precisely, we created dataset splits of HMDB-51 or UCF-101 for
training, and Kinetics-400 for testing, using the subset of the classes that
are overlapping in both train and test datasets. The other proposed method
extracts the feature mean of each class from the target evaluation dataset's
training data (i.e. class prototype) and estimates test video prediction as a
cosine similarity score between each sample to the class prototypes of each
target class. This procedure does not alter model weights using the target
dataset and it does not require aligning overlapping classes of two different
datasets, thus is a very efficient method to test the model robustness to
distribution shifts without prior knowledge of the target distribution. We
address the robustness problem by adversarial augmentation training -
generating augmented views of videos that are "hard" for the classification
model by applying gradient ascent on the augmentation parameters - as well as
"curriculum" scheduling the strength of the video augmentations. We
experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adversarial
augmentation approach over baselines across three state-of-the-art action
recognition models - TSM, Video Swin Transformer, and Uniformer. The presented
work provides critical insight into model robustness to distribution shifts and
presents effective techniques to enhance video action recognition performance
in a real-world deployment.

<p class="mathjax">Utilization of inter-base station cooperation for information processing has
shown great potential in enhancing the overall quality of communication
services (QoS) in wireless communication networks. Nevertheless, such
cooperations require the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at base
stations (BSs), which is assumed to be perfectly known. However, CSI errors are
inevitable in practice which necessitates beamforming techniques that can
achieve robust performance in the presence of channel estimation errors.
Existing approaches relax the robust beamforming design problems into
semidefinite programming (SDP), which can only achieve a solution that is far
from being optimal. To this end, this paper views robust beamforming design
problems from a bilevel optimization perspective. In particular, we focus on
maximizing the worst-case weighted sum-rate (WSR) in the downlink multi-cell
multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system considering bounded CSI
errors. We first reformulate this problem into a bilevel optimization problem
and then develop an efficient algorithm based on the cutting plane method. A
distributed optimization algorithm has also been developed to facilitate the
parallel processing in practical settings. Numerical results are provided to
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and
complexity, particularly in the presence of CSI uncertainties.

<p class="mathjax">Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country, where the agrarian
sector plays an essential role in accelerating economic growth and enabling the
food security of the people. The performance of this sector has an overwhelming
impact on the primary macroeconomic objectives like food security, employment
generation, poverty alleviation, human resources development, and other
economic and social forces. Although Bangladesh's labor-intensive agriculture
has achieved steady increases in food grain production, it often suffered from
unfavorable weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, low temperature, and
drought. Consequently, these factors hinder the production of food
substantially, putting the country's overall food security in danger. In order
to have a profitable, sustainable, and farmer-friendly agricultural practice,
this paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system powered by a
weather forecast model. With extensive evaluation, the multivariate Stacked
Bi-LSTM Network is employed as the weather forecasting model. The proposed
weather model can forecast Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Sunshine for
any given location in Bangladesh with higher accuracy. These predictions guide
our system to assist the farmers in making feasible decisions about planting,
irrigation, harvesting, and so on. Additionally, our full-fledged system is
capable of alerting the farmers about extreme weather conditions so that
preventive measures can be undertaken to protect the crops. Finally, the system
is also adept at making knowledge-based crop suggestions for the flood and
drought-prone regions of Bangladesh.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic segmentation and stereo matching are two essential components of 3D
environmental perception systems for autonomous driving. Nevertheless,
conventional approaches often address these two problems independently,
employing separate models for each task. This approach poses practical
limitations in real-world scenarios, particularly when computational resources
are scarce or real-time performance is imperative. Hence, in this article, we
introduce S$^3$M-Net, a novel joint learning framework developed to perform
semantic segmentation and stereo matching simultaneously. Specifically,
S$^3$M-Net shares the features extracted from RGB images between both tasks,
resulting in an improved overall scene understanding capability. This feature
sharing process is realized using a feature fusion adaption (FFA) module, which
effectively transforms the shared features into semantic space and subsequently
fuses them with the encoded disparity features. The entire joint learning
framework is trained by minimizing a novel semantic consistency-guided (SCG)
loss, which places emphasis on the structural consistency in both tasks.
Extensive experimental results conducted on the vKITTI2 and KITTI datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint learning framework and its
superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art single-task networks.

<p class="mathjax">Link prediction can help rectify inaccuracies in community detection stemming
from unaccounted-for or overlooked links within networks. Many existing works
use a baseline approach, which incurs unnecessary computational costs due to
its high time complexity. Further, many studies focus on smaller graphs, which
can lead to misleading conclusions. The report introduces two parallel
approaches, called IHub and LHub, which predict links using neighborhood-based
similarity measures on large graphs. LHub is a heuristic approach, which
additionally disregards large hubs - based on the idea that low-degree nodes
contribute significant similarity among neighbors. On a server equipped with
dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, LHub is on average 563x faster
than IHub, especially on web graphs and social networks, while having similar
prediction accuracy. Notably, LHub achieves a link prediction rate of 38.1M
edges/s and improves performance at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of
threads.

<p class="mathjax">Optimal transport (OT) is attracting increasing attention in machine
learning. It aims to transport a source distribution to a target one at minimal
cost. In its vanilla form, the source and target distributions are
predetermined, which contracts to the real-world case involving undetermined
targets. In this paper, we propose Doubly Bounded Optimal Transport (DB-OT),
which assumes that the target distribution is restricted within two boundaries
instead of a fixed one, thus giving more freedom for the transport to find
solutions. Based on the entropic regularization of DB-OT, three scaling-based
algorithms are devised for calculating the optimal solution. We also show that
our DB-OT is helpful for barycenter-based clustering, which can avoid the
excessive concentration of samples in a single cluster. Then we further develop
DB-OT techniques for long-tailed classification which is an emerging and open
problem. We first propose a connection between OT and classification, that is,
in the classification task, training involves optimizing the Inverse OT to
learn the representations, while testing involves optimizing the OT for
predictions. With this OT perspective, we first apply DB-OT to improve the
loss, and the Balanced Softmax is shown as a special case. Then we apply DB-OT
for inference in the testing process. Even with vanilla Softmax trained
features, our extensive experimental results show that our method can achieve
good results with our improved inference scheme in the testing stage.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-access edge computing (MEC)-enabled integrated space-air-ground (SAG)
networks have drawn much attention recently, as they can provide communication
and computing services to wireless devices in areas that lack terrestrial base
stations (TBSs). Leveraging the ample bandwidth in the terahertz (THz)
spectrum, in this paper, we propose MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks with
collaboration among unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We then formulate the
problem of minimizing the energy consumption of devices and UAVs in the
proposed MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks by optimizing tasks offloading
decisions, THz sub-bands assignment, transmit power control, and UAVs
deployment. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming
(MILP) problem with a non-convex structure, which is challenging to solve. We
thus propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to decompose the problem
into four sub-problems: 1) device task offloading decision problem, 2) THz
sub-band assignment and power control problem, 3) UAV deployment problem, and
4) UAV task offloading decision problem. We then propose to use a matching
game, concave-convex procedure (CCP) method, successive convex approximation
(SCA), and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) approaches for
solving the individual subproblems. Finally, extensive simulations are
performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Hyperspectral band selection plays a pivotal role in remote sensing and image
analysis, aiming to identify the most informative spectral bands while
minimizing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering
approach for hyperspectral band selection that offers an embedded solution,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications. Our
proposed method, embedded Hyperspectral Band Selection (EHBS), excels in
selecting the best bands without the need for prior processing, seamlessly
integrating with the downstream task model. This is achieved through the
adaptation of the Stochastic Gates (STG) algorithm, originally designed for
feature selection, for hyperspectral band selection in the context of image
semantic segmentation and the integration of a dynamic optimizer, DoG, which
removes the need for the required tuning the learning rate. To assess the
performance of our method, we introduce a novel metric for evaluating band
selection methods across different target numbers of selected bands quantified
by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). We conduct experiments on two distinct
semantic-segmentation hyperspectral benchmark datasets, demonstrating its
superiority in terms of its resulting accuracy and its ease of use compared to
many common and state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our contributions extend
beyond the realm of hyperspectral band selection. The adaptability of our
approach to other tasks, especially those involving grouped features, opens up
promising avenues for broader applications within the realm of deep learning,
such as feature selection for feature groups. The demonstrated success on the
tested datasets and the potential for application to a variety of tasks
underscore the value of our method as a substantial addition to the field of
computer vision.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, vision-language representation learning has made remarkable
advancements in building up medical foundation models, holding immense
potential for transforming the landscape of clinical research and medical care.
The underlying hypothesis is that the rich knowledge embedded in radiology
reports can effectively assist and guide the learning process, reducing the
need for additional labels. However, these reports tend to be complex and
sometimes even consist of redundant descriptions that make the representation
learning too challenging to capture the key semantic information. This paper
develops a novel iterative vision-language representation learning framework by
proposing a key semantic knowledge-emphasized report refinement method.
Particularly, raw radiology reports are refined to highlight the key
information according to a constructed clinical dictionary and two
model-optimized knowledge-enhancement metrics. The iterative framework is
designed to progressively learn, starting from gaining a general understanding
of the patient's condition based on raw reports and gradually refines and
extracts critical information essential to the fine-grained analysis tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on various downstream
medical image analysis tasks, including disease classification,
region-of-interest segmentation, and phrase grounding. Our framework surpasses
seven state-of-the-art methods in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings,
demonstrating its encouraging potential for different clinical applications.

<p class="mathjax">This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
frequency division duplexing (FDD) communication systems. Since the downlink
and uplink signals are simultaneously transmitted in FDD, the phase shifts at
the RIS should be designed to support both transmissions. Considering a
single-user multiple-input multiple-output system, we formulate a weighted
sum-rate maximization problem to jointly maximize the downlink and uplink
system performance. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, we adopt an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, in which two phase shift optimization
techniques are developed to handle the unit-modulus constraints induced by the
reflection coefficients at the RIS. The first technique exploits the manifold
optimization-based algorithm, while the second uses a lower-complexity AO
approach. Numerical results verify that the proposed techniques rapidly
converge to local optima and significantly improve the overall system
performance compared to existing benchmark schemes.

<p class="mathjax">Representation learning is all about discovering the hidden modular
attributes that generate the data faithfully. We explore the potential of
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DM) in unsupervised learning of the
modular attributes. We build a theoretical framework that connects the
diffusion time-steps and the hidden attributes, which serves as an effective
inductive bias for unsupervised learning. Specifically, the forward diffusion
process incrementally adds Gaussian noise to samples at each time-step, which
essentially collapses different samples into similar ones by losing attributes,
e.g., fine-grained attributes such as texture are lost with less noise added
(i.e., early time-steps), while coarse-grained ones such as shape are lost by
adding more noise (i.e., late time-steps). To disentangle the modular
attributes, at each time-step t, we learn a t-specific feature to compensate
for the newly lost attribute, and the set of all 1,...,t-specific features,
corresponding to the cumulative set of lost attributes, are trained to make up
for the reconstruction error of a pre-trained DM at time-step t. On CelebA,
FFHQ, and Bedroom datasets, the learned feature significantly improves
attribute classification and enables faithful counterfactual generation, e.g.,
interpolating only one specified attribute between two images, validating the
disentanglement quality. Codes are in https://github.com/yue-zhongqi/diti.

<p class="mathjax">Data imbalance presents a significant challenge in various machine learning
(ML) tasks, particularly named entity recognition (NER) within natural language
processing (NLP). NER exhibits a data imbalance with a long-tail distribution,
featuring numerous minority classes (i.e., entity classes) and a single
majority class (i.e., O-class). The imbalance leads to the misclassifications
of the entity classes as the O-class. To tackle the imbalance, we propose a
simple and effective learning method, named majority or minority (MoM)
learning. MoM learning incorporates the loss computed only for samples whose
ground truth is the majority class (i.e., the O-class) into the loss of the
conventional ML model. Evaluation experiments on four NER datasets (Japanese
and English) showed that MoM learning improves prediction performance of the
minority classes, without sacrificing the performance of the majority class and
is more effective than widely known and state-of-the-art methods. We also
evaluated MoM learning using frameworks as sequential labeling and machine
reading comprehension, which are commonly used in NER. Furthermore, MoM
learning has achieved consistent performance improvements regardless of
language, model, or framework.

<p class="mathjax">The manipulation of deformable objects by robotic systems presents a
significant challenge due to their complex and infinite-dimensional
configuration spaces. This paper introduces a novel approach to Deformable
Object Manipulation (DOM) by emphasizing the identification and manipulation of
Structures of Interest (SOIs) in deformable fabric bags. We propose a bimanual
manipulation framework that leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based latent
dynamics model to succinctly represent and predict the behavior of these SOIs.
Our approach involves constructing a graph representation from partial point
cloud data of the object and learning the latent dynamics model that
effectively captures the essential deformations of the fabric bag within a
reduced computational space. By integrating this latent dynamics model with
Model Predictive Control (MPC), we empower robotic manipulators to perform
precise and stable manipulation tasks focused on the SOIs. We have validated
our framework through various empirical experiments demonstrating its efficacy
in bimanual manipulation of fabric bags. Our contributions not only address the
complexities inherent in DOM but also provide new perspectives and
methodologies for enhancing robotic interactions with deformable objects by
concentrating on their critical structural elements. Experimental videos can be

<p class="mathjax">Real-world data are long-tailed, the lack of tail samples leads to a
significant limitation in the generalization ability of the model. Although
numerous approaches of class re-balancing perform well for moderate class
imbalance problems, additional knowledge needs to be introduced to help the
tail class recover the underlying true distribution when the observed
distribution from a few tail samples does not represent its true distribution
properly, thus allowing the model to learn valuable information outside the
observed domain. In this work, we propose to leverage the geometric information
of the feature distribution of the well-represented head class to guide the
model to learn the underlying distribution of the tail class. Specifically, we
first systematically define the geometry of the feature distribution and the
similarity measures between the geometries, and discover four phenomena
regarding the relationship between the geometries of different feature
distributions. Then, based on four phenomena, feature uncertainty
representation is proposed to perturb the tail features by utilizing the
geometry of the head class feature distribution. It aims to make the perturbed
features cover the underlying distribution of the tail class as much as
possible, thus improving the model's generalization performance in the test
domain. Finally, we design a three-stage training scheme enabling feature
uncertainty modeling to be successfully applied. Experiments on
CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 show that our proposed
approach outperforms other similar methods on most metrics. In addition, the
experimental phenomena we discovered are able to provide new perspectives and
theoretical foundations for subsequent studies.

<p class="mathjax">Current advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have predominantly
focused on learning step-based policies that generate actions for each
perceived state. While these methods efficiently leverage step information from
environmental interaction, they often ignore the temporal correlation between
actions, resulting in inefficient exploration and unsmooth trajectories that
are challenging to implement on real hardware. Episodic RL (ERL) seeks to
overcome these challenges by exploring in parameters space that capture the
correlation of actions. However, these approaches typically compromise data
efficiency, as they treat trajectories as opaque \emph{black boxes}. In this
work, we introduce a novel ERL algorithm, Temporally-Correlated Episodic RL
(TCE), which effectively utilizes step information in episodic policy updates,
opening the 'black box' in existing ERL methods while retaining the smooth and
consistent exploration in parameter space. TCE synergistically combines the
advantages of step-based and episodic RL, achieving comparable performance to
recent ERL methods while maintaining data efficiency akin to state-of-the-art
(SoTA) step-based RL.

<p class="mathjax">We address the challenge of acquiring real-world manipulation skills with a
scalable framework.Inspired by the success of large-scale auto-regressive
prediction in Large Language Models (LLMs), we hold the belief that identifying
an appropriate prediction target capable of leveraging large-scale datasets is
crucial for achieving efficient and universal learning. Therefore, we propose
to utilize flow, which represents the future trajectories of 3D points on
objects of interest, as an ideal prediction target in robot learning. To
exploit scalable data resources, we turn our attention to cross-embodiment
datasets. We develop, for the first time, a language-conditioned prediction
model directly from large-scale RGBD human video datasets. Our predicted flow
offers actionable geometric and physics guidance, thus facilitating stable
zero-shot skill transfer in real-world scenarios.We deploy our method with a
policy based on closed-loop flow prediction. Remarkably, without any additional
training, our method achieves an impressive 81% success rate in human-to-robot
skill transfer, covering 18 tasks in 6 scenes. Our framework features the
following benefits: (1) scalability: leveraging cross-embodiment data
resources; (2) universality: multiple object categories, including rigid,
articulated, and soft bodies; (3) stable skill transfer: providing actionable
guidance with a small inference domain-gap. These lead to a new pathway towards
scalable general robot learning. Data, code, and model weights will be made
publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Recommender systems have been widely deployed in various real-world
applications to help users identify content of interest from massive amounts of
information. Traditional recommender systems work by collecting user-item
interaction data in a cloud-based data center and training a centralized model
to perform the recommendation service. However, such cloud-based recommender
systems (CloudRSs) inevitably suffer from excessive resource consumption,
response latency, as well as privacy and security risks concerning both data
and models. Recently, driven by the advances in storage, communication, and
computation capabilities of edge devices, there has been a shift of focus from
CloudRSs to on-device recommender systems (DeviceRSs), which leverage the
capabilities of edge devices to minimize centralized data storage requirements,
reduce the response latency caused by communication overheads, and enhance user
privacy and security by localizing data processing and model training. Despite
the rapid rise of DeviceRSs, there is a clear absence of timely literature
reviews that systematically introduce, categorize and contrast these methods.
To bridge this gap, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of DeviceRSs,
covering three main aspects: (1) the deployment and inference of DeviceRSs (2)
the training and update of DeviceRSs (3) the security and privacy of DeviceRSs.
Furthermore, we provide a fine-grained and systematic taxonomy of the methods
involved in each aspect, followed by a discussion regarding challenges and
future research directions. This is the first comprehensive survey on DeviceRSs
that covers a spectrum of tasks to fit various needs. We believe this survey
will help readers effectively grasp the current research status in this field,
equip them with relevant technical foundations, and stimulate new research
ideas for developing DeviceRSs.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a dynamic landing solution without the need for
onboard exteroceptive sensors and an expensive computation unit, where all
localization and control modules are carried out on the ground in a
non-inertial frame. Our system starts with a relative state estimator of the
aerial robot from the perspective of the landing platform, where the state
tracking of the UAV is done through a set of onboard LED markers and an
on-ground camera; the state is expressed geometrically on manifold, and is
returned by Iterated Extended Kalman filter (IEKF) algorithm. Subsequently, a
motion planning module is developed to guide the landing process, formulating
it as a minimum jerk trajectory by applying the differential flatness property.
Considering visibility and dynamic constraints, the problem is solved using
quadratic programming, and the final motion primitive is expressed through
piecewise polynomials. Through a series of experiments, the applicability of
this approach is validated by successfully landing 18 cm x 18 cm quadrotor on a
43 cm x 43 cm platform, exhibiting performance comparable to conventional
methods. Finally, we provide comprehensive hardware and software details to the
research community for future reference.

<p class="mathjax">Objective: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) is the long-lasting causal
treatment of allergic rhinitis. How to enhance the adherence of patients to
maximize the benefit of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) plays a crucial role in
the management of AIT. This study aims to leverage novel machine learning
models to precisely predict the risk of non-adherence of patients and related
systematic symptom scores, to provide a novel approach in the management of
long-term AIT.
<br />Methods: The research develops and analyzes two models, Sequential Latent
Actor-Critic (SLAC) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), evaluating them based on
scoring and adherence prediction capabilities.
<br />Results: Excluding the biased samples at the first time step, the predictive
adherence accuracy of the SLAC models is from $60\,\%$ to $72\%$, and for LSTM
models, it is $66\,\%$ to $84\,\%$, varying according to the time steps. The
range of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SLAC models is between $0.93$ and
$2.22$, while for LSTM models it is between $1.09$ and $1.77$. Notably, these
RMSEs are significantly lower than the random prediction error of $4.55$.
<br />Conclusion: We creatively apply sequential models in the long-term management
of SCIT with promising accuracy in the prediction of SCIT nonadherence in
Allergic Rhinitis (AR) patients. While LSTM outperforms SLAC in adherence
prediction, SLAC excels in score prediction for patients undergoing SCIT for
AR. The state-action-based SLAC adds flexibility, presenting a novel and
effective approach for managing long-term AIT.

<p class="mathjax">Compared to unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised domain adaptation
(SSDA) aims to significantly improve the classification performance and
generalization capability of the model by leveraging the presence of a small
amount of labeled data from the target domain. Several SSDA approaches have
been developed to enable semantic-aligned feature confusion between labeled (or
pseudo labeled) samples across domains; nevertheless, owing to the scarcity of
semantic label information of the target domain, they were arduous to fully
realize their potential. In this study, we propose a novel SSDA approach named
Graph-based Adaptive Betweenness Clustering (G-ABC) for achieving categorical
domain alignment, which enables cross-domain semantic alignment by mandating
semantic transfer from labeled data of both the source and target domains to
unlabeled target samples. In particular, a heterogeneous graph is initially
constructed to reflect the pairwise relationships between labeled samples from
both domains and unlabeled ones of the target domain. Then, to degrade the
noisy connectivity in the graph, connectivity refinement is conducted by
introducing two strategies, namely Confidence Uncertainty based Node Removal
and Prediction Dissimilarity based Edge Pruning. Once the graph has been
refined, Adaptive Betweenness Clustering is introduced to facilitate semantic
transfer by using across-domain betweenness clustering and within-domain
betweenness clustering, thereby propagating semantic label information from
labeled samples across domains to unlabeled target data. Extensive experiments
on three standard benchmark datasets, namely DomainNet, Office-Home, and
Office-31, indicated that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art SSDA
approaches, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed G-ABC algorithm.

<p class="mathjax">Generative AI models face the challenge of hallucinations that can undermine
users' trust in such systems. We approach the problem of conversational
information seeking as a two-step process, where relevant passages in a corpus
are identified first and then summarized into a final system response. This way
we can automatically assess if the answer to the user's question is present in
the corpus. Specifically, our proposed method employs a sentence-level
classifier to detect if the answer is present, then aggregates these
predictions on the passage level, and eventually across the top-ranked passages
to arrive at a final answerability estimate. For training and evaluation, we
develop a dataset based on the TREC CAsT benchmark that includes answerability
labels on the sentence, passage, and ranking levels. We demonstrate that our
proposed method represents a strong baseline and outperforms a state-of-the-art
LLM on the answerability prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to bridge source and target
domain distributions, with a small number of target labels available, achieving
better classification performance than unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).
However, existing SSDA work fails to make full use of label information from
both source and target domains for feature alignment across domains, resulting
in label mismatch in the label space during model testing. This paper presents
a novel SSDA approach, Inter-domain Mixup with Neighborhood Expansion (IDMNE),
to tackle this issue. Firstly, we introduce a cross-domain feature alignment
strategy, Inter-domain Mixup, that incorporates label information into model
adaptation. Specifically, we employ sample-level and manifold-level data mixing
to generate compatible training samples. These newly established samples,
combined with reliable and actual label information, display diversity and
compatibility across domains, while such extra supervision thus facilitates
cross-domain feature alignment and mitigates label mismatch. Additionally, we
utilize Neighborhood Expansion to leverage high-confidence pseudo-labeled
samples in the target domain, diversifying the label information of the target
domain and thereby further increasing the performance of the adaptation model.
Accordingly, the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements on popular SSDA
benchmarks, including DomainNet, Office-Home, and Office-31.

<p class="mathjax">In simulation of nuclear reactor physics using the Monte Carlo neutron
transport method on GPUs, the sorting of particles play a significant role in
execution performance. Traditionally, CPUs and GPUs are separated devices
connected with low data transfer rate and high data transfer latency. Emerging
computing chips tend to integrate CPUs and GPUs. One example is the Apple
silicon chips with unified memory. Such a unified memory chips has opened doors
for new strategies of collaboration between CPUs and GPUs for Monte Carlo
neutron transport. Sorting particle on CPU and transport on GPU is an example
of such new strategy, which has been suffering the high CPU-GPU data transfer
latency on the traditional devices with separated CPU and GPU. The finding is
that for the Apple M2 max chip, sorting on CPU leads to better performance than
sorting on GPU for the ExaSMR whole core benchmark problems, while for the
HTR-10 high temperature gas reactor fuel pebble problem, sorting on GPU is more
efficient. The features of partially sorted particle order have been identified
to contribute to the higher performance with CPU sort than GPU for the ExaSMR
problem. The in-house code using both CPUs and GPUs achieves 7.5 times power
efficiency that of OpenMC on CPUs for ExaSMR whole core and 50 times for HTR-10
fuel pebble benchmark problems.

<p class="mathjax">The success of AI assistants based on Language Models (LLMs) hinges on
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to comprehend and align with
user intentions. However, traditional alignment algorithms, such as PPO, are
hampered by complex annotation and training requirements. This reliance limits
the applicability of RLHF and hinders the development of professional
assistants tailored to diverse human preferences. In this work, we introduce
\textit{Linear Alignment}, a novel algorithm that aligns language models with
human preferences in one single inference step, eliminating the reliance on
data annotation and model training. Linear alignment incorporates a new
parameterization for policy optimization under divergence constraints, which
enables the extraction of optimal policy in a closed-form manner and
facilitates the direct estimation of the aligned response. Extensive
experiments on both general and personalized preference datasets demonstrate
that linear alignment significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of
LLM alignment across diverse scenarios. Our code and dataset will be published
on \url{https://github.com/Wizardcoast/Linear_Alignment.git}.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) with Transformer architectures have become
phenomenal in natural language processing, multimodal generative artificial
intelligence, and agent-oriented artificial intelligence. The self-attention
module is the most dominating sub-structure inside Transformer-based LLMs.
Computation using general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) inflicts
reckless demand for I/O bandwidth for transferring intermediate calculation
results between memories and processing units. To tackle this challenge, this
work develops a fully customized vanilla self-attention accelerator,
AttentionLego, as the basic building block for constructing spatially
expandable LLM processors. AttentionLego provides basic implementation with
fully-customized digital logic incorporating Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
technology. It is based on PIM-based matrix-vector multiplication and look-up
table-based Softmax design. The open-source code is available online:

<p class="mathjax">One of the common hazards and issues in meteorology and agriculture is the
problem of frost, chilling or freezing. This event occurs when the minimum
ambient temperature falls below a certain value. This phenomenon causes a lot
of damage to the country, especially Fars province. Solving this problem
requires that, in addition to predicting the minimum temperature, we can
provide enough time to implement the necessary measures. Empirical methods have
been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which can predict
the minimum temperature, but not in time. In addition to this, we can use
machine learning methods to model the minimum temperature. In this study, we
have used three methods Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) as deep learning methods, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A
customized loss function designed for methods based on deep learning, which can
be effective in reducing prediction errors. With methods based on deep learning
models, not only do we observe a reduction in RMSE error compared to empirical
methods but also have more time to predict minimum temperature. Thus, we can
model the minimum temperature for the next 24 hours by having the current 24
hours. With the gradient boosting model (XGBoost) we can keep the prediction
time as deep learning and RMSE error reduced. Finally, we experimentally
concluded that machine learning methods work better than empirical methods and
XGBoost model can have better performance in this problem among other
implemented.

<p class="mathjax">While the body of research directed towards constructing and generating
clarifying questions in mixed-initiative conversational search systems is vast,
research aimed at processing and comprehending users' answers to such questions
is scarce. To this end, we present a simple yet effective method for processing
answers to clarifying questions, moving away from previous work that simply
appends answers to the original query and thus potentially degrades retrieval
performance. Specifically, we propose a classifier for assessing usefulness of
the prompted clarifying question and an answer given by the user. Useful
questions or answers are further appended to the conversation history and
passed to a transformer-based query rewriting module. Results demonstrate
significant improvements over strong non-mixed-initiative baselines.
Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates the performance drops when non
useful questions and answers are utilized.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) can solve problems step-by-step. While this
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosts LLMs' performance, it is unclear if
LLMs \textit{know} when to use CoT and whether those CoT are always necessary
to answer the question. This paper shows that LLMs tend to generate redundant
calculations and reasoning on a manually constructed math QA dataset,
GSM8K-Zero. GSM8K-Zero is constructed such that the questions can be answered
without any calculations, but LLMs, including Llama-2 models and Claude-2, tend
to generate lengthy and unnecessary calculations to answer the questions. We
also conduct experiments to explain why LLMs generate redundant calculations
and reasonings. GSM8K-Zero is publicly available at

<p class="mathjax">Transformer-based models are becoming deeper and larger recently. For better
scalability, an underlying training solution in industry is to split billions
of parameters (tensors) into many tasks and then run them across homogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPUs). However, such dedicated compute cluster is
prohibitively expensive in academia and moderate companies. An economic
replacement is to aggregate existing heterogeneous devices and share resources
among multi-tenants. Nevertheless, static hardware configurations and dynamic
resource contention definitely cause straggling tasks, which heavily slows down
the overall training efficiency. Existing works feature contributions mainly
tailored for traditional data parallelism. They cannot work well for the new
tensor parallelism due to strict communication and correctness constraints.
<br />In this paper we first present ZERO-resizing, a novel dynamic workload
balancing technique without any data migration. We tune workloads in real-time
by temporarily resizing matrices involved in core tensor-related computations.
We particularly design data imputation and priority selection policies to
respectively satisfy consistency constraint required by normal training and
reduce the accuracy loss. We also give a lightweight data migration technique
without loss of accuracy, to cope with heavy heterogeneity. Our final
SEMI-migration solution is built on top of these two techniques and can
adaptively distinguish their respective balancing missions, to achieve an
overall success in efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on the
representative Colossal-AI platform validate the effectiveness of our
proposals.

<p class="mathjax">Multimodal video understanding is crucial for analyzing egocentric videos,
where integrating multiple sensory signals significantly enhances action
recognition and moment localization. However, practical applications often
grapple with incomplete modalities due to factors like privacy concerns,
efficiency demands, or hardware malfunctions. Addressing this, our study delves
into the impact of missing modalities on egocentric action recognition,
particularly within transformer-based models. We introduce a novel concept
-Missing Modality Token (MMT)-to maintain performance even when modalities are
absent, a strategy that proves effective in the Ego4D, Epic-Kitchens, and
Epic-Sounds datasets. Our method mitigates the performance loss, reducing it
from its original $\sim 30\%$ drop to only $\sim 10\%$ when half of the test
set is modal-incomplete. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the
adaptability of MMT to different training scenarios and its superiority in
handling missing modalities compared to current methods. Our research
contributes a comprehensive analysis and an innovative approach, opening
avenues for more resilient multimodal systems in real-world settings.

That poses great challenges to the limited memory capacity of current
accelerators (e.g., GPUs). Existing efforts mitigate such bottleneck by
external auxiliary solutions with additional hardware costs, and internal
modifications with potential accuracy penalty. Differently, our analysis
reveals that computations intra- and inter-layers exhibit the spatial-temporal
weak dependency and even complete independency features. That inspires us to
break the traditional layer-by-layer (column) dataflow rule. Now operations are
novelly re-organized into rows throughout all convolution layers. This
lightweight design allows a majority of intermediate data to be removed without
any loss of accuracy. We particularly study the weak dependency between two
consecutive rows. For the resulting skewed memory consumption, we give two
solutions with different favorite scenarios. Evaluations on two representative
networks confirm the effectiveness. We also validate that our middle dataflow
optimization can be smoothly embraced by existing works for better memory
reduction.

<p class="mathjax">Weighted gradual semantics provide an acceptability degree to each argument
representing the strength of the argument, computed based on factors including
background evidence for the argument, and taking into account interactions
between this argument and others. We introduce four important problems linking
gradual semantics and acceptability degrees. First, we reexamine the inverse
problem, seeking to identify the argument weights of the argumentation
framework which lead to a specific final acceptability degree. Second, we ask
whether the function mapping between argument weights and acceptability degrees
is injective or a homeomorphism onto its image. Third, we ask whether argument
weights can be found when preferences, rather than acceptability degrees for
arguments are considered. Fourth, we consider the topology of the space of
valid acceptability degrees, asking whether gaps exist in this space. While
different gradual semantics have been proposed in the literature, in this
paper, we identify a large family of weighted gradual semantics, called
abstract weighted based gradual semantics. These generalise many of the
existing semantics while maintaining desirable properties such as convergence
to a unique fixed point. We also show that a sub-family of the weighted gradual
semantics, called abstract weighted (Lp,lambda,mu,A)-based gradual semantics
and which include well-known semantics, solve all four of the aforementioned
problems.

<p class="mathjax">A vast amount of user behavior data is constantly accumulating on today's
large recommendation platforms, recording users' various interests and tastes.
Preserving knowledge from the old data while new data continually arrives is a
vital problem for recommender systems. Existing approaches generally seek to
save the knowledge implicitly in the model parameters. However, such a
parameter-centric approach lacks scalability and flexibility -- the capacity is
hard to scale, and the knowledge is inflexible to utilize. Hence, in this work,
we propose a framework that turns massive user behavior data to retrievable
knowledge (D2K). It is a data-centric approach that is model-agnostic and easy
to scale up. Different from only storing unary knowledge such as the user-side
or item-side information, D2K propose to store ternary knowledge for
recommendation, which is determined by the complete recommendation factors --
user, item, and context. The knowledge retrieved by target samples can be
directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation algorithms.
Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based knowledge encoder to transform
the old data into knowledge with the user-item-context cross features. A
personalized knowledge adaptation unit is devised to effectively exploit the
information from the knowledge base by adapting the retrieved knowledge to the
target samples. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that D2K
significantly outperforms existing baselines and is compatible with a major
collection of recommendation algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Practical and accurate traffic models play an important role in capturing
real traffic dynamics and then in achieving effective control performance. This
paper studies traffic signal control in a traffic network with multiple
interconnected intersections, where the target is to balance the vehicle
density on each lane by controlling the green times of each phase at every
intersection. Different from traditional road-based modeling schemes, a
two-lane intersection model is first proposed to model the flow propagation in
a more accurate way. A distributed model predictive control (MPC) method is
then presented to assign the green times. To enable the real-time feasibility
of the proposed approach, the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is incorporated with the distributed MPC scheme for solving the problem.
Finally, the simulation studies performed in VISSIM for a six-intersection
traffic network in Dalian, China, show the effectiveness and characteristics of
the proposed method.

<p class="mathjax">ColorVideoVDP is a video and image quality metric that models spatial and
temporal aspects of vision, for both luminance and color. The metric is built
on novel psychophysical models of chromatic spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity
and cross-channel contrast masking. It accounts for the viewing conditions,
geometric, and photometric characteristics of the display. It was trained to
predict common video streaming distortions (e.g. video compression, rescaling,
and transmission errors), and also 8 new distortion types related to AR/VR
displays (e.g. light source and waveguide non-uniformities). To address the
latter application, we collected our novel XR-Display-Artifact-Video quality
dataset (XR-DAVID), comprised of 336 distorted videos. Extensive testing on
XR-DAVID, as well as several datasets from the literature, indicate a
significant gain in prediction performance compared to existing metrics.
ColorVideoVDP opens the doors to many novel applications which require the
joint automated spatiotemporal assessment of luminance and color distortions,
including video streaming, display specification and design, visual comparison
of results, and perceptually-guided quality optimization.

<p class="mathjax">The prevalence of social media presents a growing opportunity to collect and
analyse examples of English varieties. Whilst usage of these varieties was -
and, in many cases, still is - used only in spoken contexts or hard-to-access
private messages, social media sites like Twitter provide a platform for users
to communicate informally in a scrapeable format. Notably, Indian English
(Hinglish), Singaporean English (Singlish), and African-American English (AAE)
can be commonly found online. These varieties pose a challenge to existing
natural language processing (NLP) tools as they often differ orthographically
and syntactically from standard English for which the majority of these tools
are built. NLP models trained on standard English texts produced biased
outcomes for users of underrepresented varieties. Some research has aimed to
overcome the inherent biases caused by unrepresentative data through techniques
like data augmentation or adjusting training models.
<br />We aim to address the issue of bias at its root - the data itself. We curate
a dataset of tweets from countries with high proportions of underserved English
variety speakers, and propose an annotation framework of six categorical
classifications along a pseudo-spectrum that measures the degree of standard
English and that thereby indirectly aims to surface the manifestations of
English varieties in these tweets. Following best annotation practices, our
growing corpus features 170,800 tweets taken from 7 countries, labeled by
annotators who are from those countries and can communicate in
regionally-dominant varieties of English. Our corpus highlights the accuracy
discrepancies in pre-trained language identifiers between western English and
non-western (i.e., less standard) English varieties. We hope to contribute to
the growing literature identifying and reducing the implicit demographic
discrepancies in NLP.

<p class="mathjax">The MagNet Challenge 2023 calls upon competitors to develop data-driven
models for the material-specific, waveform-agnostic estimation of steady-state
power losses in toroidal ferrite cores. The following HARDCORE (H-field and
power loss estimation for Arbitrary waveforms with Residual, Dilated
convolutional neural networks in ferrite COREs) approach shows that a residual
convolutional neural network with physics-informed extensions can serve this
task efficiently when trained on observational data beforehand. One key
solution element is an intermediate model layer which first reconstructs the bh
curve and then estimates the power losses based on the curve's area rendering
the proposed topology physically interpretable. In addition, emphasis was
placed on expert-based feature engineering and information-rich inputs in order
to enable a lean model architecture. A model is trained from scratch for each
material, while the topology remains the same. A Pareto-style trade-off between
model size and estimation accuracy is demonstrated, which yields an optimum at
as low as 1755 parameters and down to below 8\,\% for the 95-th percentile of
the relative error for the worst-case material with sufficient samples.

<p class="mathjax">Semantic Change Detection (SCD) is recognized as both a crucial and
challenging task in the field of image analysis. Traditional methods for SCD
have predominantly relied on the comparison of image pairs. However, this
approach is significantly hindered by substantial imaging differences, which
arise due to variations in shooting times, atmospheric conditions, and angles.
Such discrepancies lead to two primary issues: the under-detection of minor yet
significant changes, and the generation of false alarms due to temporal
variances. These factors often result in unchanged objects appearing markedly
different in multi-temporal images. In response to these challenges, the
MapChange framework has been developed. This framework introduces a novel
paradigm that synergizes temporal-invariant historical map data with
contemporary high-resolution images. By employing this combination, the
temporal variance inherent in conventional image pair comparisons is
effectively mitigated. The efficacy of the MapChange framework has been
empirically validated through comprehensive testing on two public datasets.
These tests have demonstrated the framework's marked superiority over existing
state-of-the-art SCD methods.

<p class="mathjax">Bundle Adjustment (BA) has been proven to improve the accuracy of the LiDAR
mapping. However, the BA method has not been properly employed in a
dead-reckoning navigation system. In this paper, we present a frame-to-frame
(F2F) BA for LiDAR-inertial navigation, named BA-LINS. Based on the direct F2F
point-cloud association, the same-plane points are associated among the LiDAR
keyframes. Hence, the plane-point BA measurement can be constructed using the
same-plane points. The LiDAR BA measurements and the inertial measurement unit
(IMU)-preintegration measurements are tightly integrated under the framework of
factor graph optimization. An effective adaptive covariance estimation
algorithm for LiDAR BA measurements is proposed to further improve the accuracy
of BA-LINS. We conduct exhaustive real-world experiments on public and private
datasets to examine the proposed BA-LINS. The results demonstrate that BA-LINS
yields superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline
system FF-LINS, the absolute translation accuracy and state-estimation
efficiency of BA-LINS are improved by 29.5% and 28.7%, respectively, on the
private dataset. Besides, the ablation experiment results exhibit that the
proposed adaptive covariance estimation algorithm can notably improve the
accuracy and robustness of BA-LINS.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate and rapid railway track segmentation can assist automatic train
driving and is a key step in early warning to fixed or moving obstacles on the
railway track. However, certain existing algorithms tailored for track
segmentation often struggle to meet the requirements of real-time and
efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices. Considering this challenge, we
propose an edge-enabled real-time railway track segmentation algorithm, which
is optimized to be suitable for edge applications by optimizing the network
structure and quantizing the model after training. Initially, Ghost convolution
is introduced to reduce the complexity of the backbone, thereby achieving the
extraction of key information of the interested region at a lower cost. To
further reduce the model complexity and calculation, a new lightweight
detection head is proposed to achieve the best balance between accuracy and
efficiency. Subsequently, we introduce quantization techniques to map the
model's floating-point weights and activation values into lower bit-width
fixed-point representations, reducing computational demands and memory
footprint, ultimately accelerating the model's inference. Finally, we draw
inspiration from GPU parallel programming principles to expedite the
pre-processing and post-processing stages of the algorithm by doing parallel
processing. The approach is evaluated with public and challenging dataset
RailSem19 and tested on Jetson Nano. Experimental results demonstrate that our
enhanced algorithm achieves an accuracy level of 83.3% while achieving a
real-time inference rate of 25 frames per second when the input size is
480x480, thereby effectively meeting the requirements for real-time and
high-efficiency operation.

<p class="mathjax">Learning the dense bird's eye view (BEV) motion flow in a self-supervised
manner is an emerging research for robotics and autonomous driving. Current
self-supervised methods mainly rely on point correspondences between point
clouds, which may introduce the problems of fake flow and inconsistency,
hindering the model's ability to learn accurate and realistic motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel cross-modality self-supervised training framework
that effectively addresses these issues by leveraging multi-modality data to
obtain supervision signals. We design three innovative supervision signals to
preserve the inherent properties of scene motion, including the masked Chamfer
distance loss, the piecewise rigidity loss, and the temporal consistency loss.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed self-supervised
framework outperforms all previous self-supervision methods for the motion
prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an innovative approach to integrating Large Language
Models (LLMs) with Arduino-controlled Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps for
precise color synthesis in automation systems. We propose a novel framework
that employs fine-tuned LLMs to interpret natural language commands and convert
them into specific operational instructions for EHD pump control. This approach
aims to enhance user interaction with complex hardware systems, making it more
intuitive and efficient. The methodology involves four key steps: fine-tuning
the language model with a dataset of color specifications and corresponding
Arduino code, developing a natural language processing interface, translating
user inputs into executable Arduino code, and controlling EHD pumps for
accurate color mixing. Conceptual experiment results, based on theoretical
assumptions, indicate a high potential for accurate color synthesis, efficient
language model interpretation, and reliable EHD pump operation. This research
extends the application of LLMs beyond text-based tasks, demonstrating their
potential in industrial automation and control systems. While highlighting the
limitations and the need for real-world testing, this study opens new avenues
for AI applications in physical system control and sets a foundation for future
advancements in AI-driven automation technologies.

<p class="mathjax">Long text generation, such as novel writing or discourse-level translation
with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current
language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context
window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches
demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference
phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept.
Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, Temp-Lora
embeds this information directly into the model's parameters. In the process of
long text generation, we use a temporary Lora module, progressively trained
with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves
contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's
parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive
experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng
discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora.
Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality
for long texts, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity on a subset of
PG19, and a 29.6% decrease in perplexity along with a 53.2% increase in BLEU
score on GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing
long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational
costs by shortening the context window. While ensuring a slight improvement in
generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL), it enables a reduction of 70.5%
in the FLOPs required for inference and a 51.5% decrease in latency.

<p class="mathjax">Free-text radiology reports present a rich data source for various medical
tasks, but effectively labeling these texts remains challenging. Traditional
rule-based labeling methods fall short of capturing the nuances of diverse
free-text patterns. Moreover, models using expert-annotated data are limited by
data scarcity and pre-defined classes, impacting their performance, flexibility
and scalability. To address these issues, our study offers three main
contributions: 1) We demonstrate the potential of GPT as an adept labeler using
carefully designed prompts. 2) Utilizing only the data labeled by GPT, we
trained a BERT-based labeler, CheX-GPT, which operates faster and more
efficiently than its GPT counterpart. 3) To benchmark labeler performance, we
introduced a publicly available expert-annotated test set, MIMIC-500,
comprising 500 cases from the MIMIC validation set. Our findings demonstrate
that CheX-GPT not only excels in labeling accuracy over existing models, but
also showcases superior efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, supported by
our introduction of the MIMIC-500 dataset for robust benchmarking. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/CheXGPT.

<p class="mathjax">It has long been recognized that it is not enough for a Recommender System
(RS) to provide recommendations based only on their relevance to users. Among
many other criteria, the set of recommendations may need to be diverse in order
to handle uncertainty and offer a meaningful choice. The literature reports
many ways of measuring diversity and ways of improving the diversity of a set
of recommendations, most notably by re-ranking and selecting from a larger set
of candidate recommendations. Driven by promising insights from the literature
on how to incorporate versatile Large Language Models (LLMs) into the RS
pipeline, in this paper, we show how LLMs can be used for diversity re-ranking.
<br />We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for
re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.
Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate
a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with
different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion. We conduct
comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the
GPT and Llama families. We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random
re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR,
xQuAD and RxQuAD). We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random
re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as
the traditional re-ranking methods. We gain insight into prompt design for this
task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a
balance of diversity and relevance). Given that no special knowledge
engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising
approach, and we highlight directions for future research. We open-source the
code of our experiments for reproducibility.

<p class="mathjax">In Information Retrieval, and more generally in Natural Language Processing,
adapting models to specific domains is conducted through fine-tuning. Despite
the successes achieved by this method and its versatility, the need for
human-curated and labeled data makes it impractical to transfer to new tasks,
domains, and/or languages when training data doesn't exist. Using the model
without training (zero-shot) is another option that however suffers an
effectiveness cost, especially in the case of first-stage retrievers. Numerous
research directions have emerged to tackle these issues, most of them in the
context of adapting to a task or a language. However, the literature is scarcer
for domain (or topic) adaptation. In this paper, we address this issue of
cross-topic discrepancy for a sparse first-stage retriever by transposing a
method initially designed for language adaptation. By leveraging pre-training
on the target data to learn domain-specific knowledge, this technique
alleviates the need for annotated data and expands the scope of domain
adaptation. Despite their relatively good generalization ability, we show that
even sparse retrievers can benefit from our simple domain adaptation method.

<p class="mathjax">Recent years have seen significant improvement in absolute camera pose
estimation, paving the way for pervasive markerless Augmented Reality (AR).
However, accurate absolute pose estimation techniques are computation- and
storage-heavy, requiring computation offloading. As such, AR systems rely on
visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between
requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent
absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for
on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose
regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors
(APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy.
To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback
loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system
identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for
the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset
simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and
achieve fast (80\,ms) on-device inference speed.

<p class="mathjax">Identifying the most suitable variables to represent the state is a
fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). These variables must
efficiently capture the information necessary for making optimal decisions. In
order to address this problem, in this paper, we introduce the Transfer Entropy
Redundancy Criterion (TERC), an information-theoretic criterion, which
determines if there is \textit{entropy transferred} from state variables to
actions during training. We define an algorithm based on TERC that provably
excludes variables from the state that have no effect on the final performance
of the agent, resulting in more sample efficient learning. Experimental results
show that this speed-up is present across three different algorithm classes
(represented by tabular Q-learning, Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO)) in a variety of environments. Furthermore, to highlight the
differences between the proposed methodology and the current state-of-the-art
feature selection approaches, we present a series of controlled experiments on
synthetic data, before generalizing to real-world decision-making tasks. We
also introduce a representation of the problem that compactly captures the
transfer of information from state variables to actions as Bayesian networks.

<p class="mathjax">Forest wildfires represent one of the catastrophic events that, over the last
decades, caused huge environmental and humanitarian damages. In addition to a
significant amount of carbon dioxide emission, they are a source of risk to
society in both short-term (e.g., temporary city evacuation due to fire) and
long-term (e.g., higher risks of landslides) cases. Consequently, the
availability of tools to support local authorities in automatically identifying
burned areas plays an important role in the continuous monitoring requirement
to alleviate the aftereffects of such catastrophic events. The great
availability of satellite acquisitions coupled with computer vision techniques
represents an important step in developing such tools. This paper introduces a
novel open dataset that tackles the burned area delineation problem, a binary
segmentation problem applied to satellite imagery. The presented resource
consists of pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 L2A acquisitions of California forest
fires that took place starting in 2015. Raster annotations were generated from
the data released by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Moreover, in conjunction with the dataset, we release three different baselines
based on spectral indexes analyses, SegFormer, and U-Net models.

<p class="mathjax">In inter-domain routing, a packet is not always forwarded along the
Autonomous System (AS) level path determined by the BGP routing protocol. This
is often called control-plane and data-plane (CD) mismatch, which allows for
flexible traffic control, but also leads to operation and security issues. We
systematically analyze this phenomenon with path pairs collected from 128 pairs
of vantage points over more than 5 years, and use multiple IP-to-AS mapping
methods to compare CD paths. What is interesting is that, working at such a
large scale in turn helps us design a novel method to fairly evaluate the
accuracy of various existing mapping methods, and further develop a new mapping
method, i.e., LearnToCorrect, that can correct more than 70\% mapping errors of
the state-of-the-art one. Then we devise to identify real mismatches with
LearnToCorrect, and estimate that the real-mismatch ratio in the wild is
typically less than 6\%. At last, we use our proposed methods to detect routing
security issues, which are previously difficult to accurately find out.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid and widespread dissemination of misinformation through social
networks is a growing concern in today's digital age. This study focused on
modeling fake news diffusion, discovering the spreading dynamics, and designing
control strategies. A common approach for modeling the misinformation dynamics
is SIR-based models. Our approach is an extension of a model called 'SBFC'
which is a SIR-based model. This model has three states, Susceptible, Believer,
and Fact-Checker. The dynamics and transition between states are based on
neighbors' beliefs, hoax credibility, spreading rate, probability of verifying
the news, and probability of forgetting the current state. Our contribution is
to push this model to real social networks by considering different classes of
agents with their characteristics. We proposed two main strategies for
confronting misinformation diffusion. First, we can educate a minor class, like
scholars or influencers, to improve their ability to verify the news or
remember their state longer. The second strategy is adding fact-checker bots to
the network to spread the facts and influence their neighbors' states. Our
result shows that both of these approaches can effectively control the
misinformation spread.

<p class="mathjax">We combine welding process modelling with deformation-diffusion-fracture
(embrittlement) simulations to predict failures in hydrogen transport
pipelines. The focus is on the structural integrity of seam welds, as these are
often the locations most susceptible to damage in gas transport infrastructure.
Finite element analyses are conducted to showcase the ability of the model to
predict cracking in pipeline steels exposed to hydrogen-containing
environments. The validated model is then employed to quantify critical H$_2$
fracture pressures. The coupled, phase field-based simulations conducted
provide insight into the role of existing defects, microstructural
heterogeneity, and residual stresses. We find that under a combination of
deleterious yet realistic conditions, the critical pressure at which fracture
takes place can be as low as 15 MPa. These results bring new mechanistic
insight into the viability of using the existing natural gas pipeline network
to transport hydrogen, and the computational framework presented enables
mapping the conditions under which this can be achieved safely.

<p class="mathjax">Cloud deep learning platforms provide cost-effective deep neural network
(DNN) training for customers who lack computation resources. However, cloud
systems are often untrustworthy and vulnerable to attackers, leading to growing
concerns about model privacy. Recently, researchers have sought to protect data
privacy in deep learning by leveraging CPU trusted execution environments
(TEEs), which minimize the use of cryptography, but existing works failed to
simultaneously utilize the computational resources of GPUs to assist in
training and prevent model leakage. This paper presents Tempo, the first
cloud-based deep learning system that cooperates with TEE and distributed GPUs
for efficient DNN training with model confidentiality preserved. To tackle the
challenge of preserving privacy while offloading linear algebraic operations
from TEE to GPUs for efficient batch computation, we introduce a customized
permutation-based obfuscation algorithm to blind both inputs and model
parameters. An optimization mechanism that reduces encryption operations is
proposed for faster weight updates during backpropagation to speed up training.
We implement Tempo and evaluate it with both training and inference for two
prevalent DNNs. Empirical results indicate that Tempo outperforms baselines and
offers sufficient privacy protection.

<p class="mathjax">Among various satellite actuators, magnetic torquers have been widely
equipped for stabilization and attitude control of small satellites. Although
magnetorquers are generally used with other actuators, such as momentum wheels,
this paper explores a control method where only a magnetic actuation is
available. We applied a nonlinear optimal control method, Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC), to small satellites, employing the generalized
minimal residual (GMRES) method, which generates continuous control inputs.
Onboard magnetic actuation systems often find it challenging to produce smooth
magnetic moments as a control input; hence, we employ the Pulse Width
Modulation (PWM) method, which discretizes a control input and reduces the
burden on actuators. In our case, the PWM approach discretizes control torques
generated by the NMPC scheme. This study's main contributions are investigating
the NMPC and the GMRES method applied to small spacecraft and presenting the
PWM control system's feasibility.

<p class="mathjax">Surgical 3D reconstruction is a critical area of research in robotic surgery,
with recent works adopting variants of dynamic radiance fields to achieve
success in 3D reconstruction of deformable tissues from single-viewpoint
videos. However, these methods often suffer from time-consuming optimization or
inferior quality, limiting their adoption in downstream tasks. Inspired by 3D
Gaussian Splatting, a recent trending 3D representation, we present EndoGS,
applying Gaussian Splatting for deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction.
Specifically, our approach incorporates deformation fields to handle dynamic
scenes, depth-guided supervision to optimize 3D targets with a single
viewpoint, and a spatial-temporal weight mask to mitigate tool occlusion. As a
result, EndoGS reconstructs and renders high-quality deformable endoscopic
tissues from a single-viewpoint video, estimated depth maps, and labeled tool
masks. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos demonstrate that EndoGS
achieves superior rendering quality. Code is available at
https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/EndoGS.

<p class="mathjax">Various actuators are used in spacecraft to achieve attitude stabilization,
including thrusters, momentum wheels, and control moment gyros. Small
satellites, however, have stringent size, weight, and cost constraints, which
makes many actuator choices prohibitive. Consequently, magnetic torquers have
commonly been applied to spacecraft to attenuate angular rates. Approaches for
dealing with under-actuation due to magnetic control torque's dependency on the
magnetic field and required high magnetic flux densities have been previously
considered. Generally speaking, control of a satellite that becomes
under-actuated as a result of on-board failures has been a recurrent theme in
the literature. Methods for controlling spacecraft with fewer actuators than
degrees of freedom are increasingly in demand due to the increased number of
small satellite launches. Magnetic torquers have been extensively investigated
for momentum management of spacecraft with momentum wheels and for nutation
damping of spin satellites, momentum-biased, and dual-spin satellites.
Nonetheless, severely under-actuated small spacecraft that carry only a
single-axis magnetic torquer have not been previously treated. This note
considers the detumbling of a small spacecraft using only a single-axis
magnetic torquer. Even with a three-axis magnetic torquer, the spacecraft is
under-actuated, while, in the case of only a single axis magnetic torquer, the
problem is considerably more demanding. Our note examines the feasibility of
spacecraft attitude control with a single-axis magnetic torquer and possible
control methods that can be used.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing research about complex systems maintenance assumes they consist
of the same type of components. However, systems can be assembled with
heterogeneous components (for example degrading and non-degrading components)
that require different maintenance actions. Since industrial systems become
more and more complex, more research about the maintenance of systems with
heterogeneous components is needed. For this reason, in this paper, a system
consisting of two groups of components: degrading and non-degrading components
is analyzed. The main novelty of this paper is the evaluation of a maintenance
policy at system-level coordinating condition-based maintenance for the
degrading components, delay time to the maintenance and an inspection strategy
for this heterogeneous system. To that end, an analytic cost model is built
using the semi-regenerative processes theory. Furthermore, a safety constraint
related to the reliability of the degrading components is imposed. To find the
optimal maintenance strategy, meta-heuristic algorithms are used.

<p class="mathjax">This research proposes an innovative approach to detumble satellites'
triple-axis angular velocities with only one single-axis magnetic torquer.
Since magnetic torque is generated perpendicularly to magnetorquers, no
intended control torque along the magnetorquer can be produced, which makes
systems underactuated. Our paper introduces a control method using Model
Predictive Control (MPC) and compares it with B-dot control algorithm. By
applying these control laws to Kyushu University Light Curve Inversion (Q-Li)
Demonstration Satellite in numerical simulations, we describe the applicability
of these control laws to underactuated systems.

<p class="mathjax">Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a widely employed tool for micro-/nanoscale
topographic imaging. However, conventional AFM scanning struggles to
reconstruct complex 3D micro-/nanostructures precisely due to limitations such
as incomplete sample topography capturing and tip-sample convolution artifacts.
Here, we propose a multi-view neural-network-based framework with AFM
(MVN-AFM), which accurately reconstructs surface models of intricate
micro-/nanostructures. Unlike previous works, MVN-AFM does not depend on any
specially shaped probes or costly modifications to the AFM system. To achieve
this, MVN-AFM uniquely employs an iterative method to align multi-view data and
eliminate AFM artifacts simultaneously. Furthermore, we pioneer the application
of neural implicit surface reconstruction in nanotechnology and achieve
markedly improved results. Extensive experiments show that MVN-AFM effectively
eliminates artifacts present in raw AFM images and reconstructs various
micro-/nanostructures including complex geometrical microstructures printed via
Two-photon Lithography and nanoparticles such as PMMA nanospheres and ZIF-67
nanocrystals. This work presents a cost-effective tool for micro-/nanoscale 3D
analysis.

<p class="mathjax">Simulation to reality (sim2real) transfer from a dynamics and controls
perspective usually involves re-tuning or adapting the designed algorithms to
suit real-world operating conditions, which often violates the performance
guarantees established originally. This work presents a generalizable framework
for achieving reliable sim2real transfer of autonomy-oriented control systems
using multi-model multi-objective robust optimal control synthesis, which lends
well to uncertainty handling and disturbance rejection with theoretical

scaled autonomous vehicle called Nigel, with independent all-wheel drive and
independent all-wheel steering architecture, whose enhanced configuration space
bodes well for robust control applications. To this end, we present a

<p class="mathjax">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are easily fooled by adversarial perturbations
that are imperceptible to humans. Adversarial training, a process where
adversarial examples are added to the training set, is the current
state-of-the-art defense against adversarial attacks, but it lowers the model's
accuracy on clean inputs, is computationally expensive, and offers less
robustness to natural noise. In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs), which
were designed for efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware and
physical systems, incorporate feedback connections from each layer to the
previous layer, yielding a recurrent, deep-attractor architecture which we
hypothesize should make them naturally robust. Our work is the first to explore
the robustness of EBMs to both natural corruptions and adversarial attacks,
which we do using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We demonstrate that EBMs
are more robust than transformers and display comparable robustness to
adversarially-trained DNNs on gradient-based (white-box) attacks, query-based
(black-box) attacks, and natural perturbations without sacrificing clean
accuracy, and without the need for adversarial training or additional training
techniques.

<p class="mathjax">Continual learning endeavors to equip the model with the capability to
integrate current task knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of past task
knowledge. Inspired by prompt tuning, prompt-based methods maintain a frozen
backbone and train with slight learnable prompts to minimize the catastrophic
forgetting that arises due to updating a large number of backbone parameters.
Nonetheless, these learnable prompts tend to concentrate on the discriminatory
knowledge of the current task while ignoring past task knowledge, leading to
that learnable prompts still suffering from catastrophic forgetting. This paper
introduces a novel rehearsal-free paradigm for continual learning termed
Hierarchical Prompts (H-Prompts), comprising three categories of prompts --
class prompt, task prompt, and general prompt. To effectively depict the
knowledge of past classes, class prompt leverages Bayesian Distribution
Alignment to model the distribution of classes in each task. To reduce the
forgetting of past task knowledge, task prompt employs Cross-task Knowledge
Excavation to amalgamate the knowledge encapsulated in the learned class
prompts of past tasks and current task knowledge. Furthermore, general prompt
utilizes Generalized Knowledge Exploration to deduce highly generalized
knowledge in a self-supervised manner. Evaluations on two benchmarks
substantiate the efficacy of the proposed H-Prompts, exemplified by an average
accuracy of 87.8% in Split CIFAR-100 and 70.6% in Split ImageNet-R.

<p class="mathjax">DEX, or decentralized exchange, is a prominent class of decentralized finance
(DeFi) applications on blockchains, attracting a total locked value worth tens
of billions of USD today.
<br />This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study that uncovers
unfair trades on popular DEX services on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain
(BSC). By joining and analyzing 60 million transactions, we find 671,400 unfair
trades on all six measured DEXes, including Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve. Out
of these unfair trades, we attribute 55,000 instances, with high confidence, to
token thefts that cause a value loss of more than 3.88 million USD.
Furthermore, the measurement study uncovers previously unknown causes of
extractable value and real-world adaptive strategies to these causes. Finally,
we propose countermeasures to redesign secure DEX protocols and to harden
deployed services against the discovered security risks.

<p class="mathjax">Urban mobility efficiency is of utmost importance in big cities. Taxi
vehicles are key elements in daily traffic activity. The advance of ICT and
geo-positioning systems has given rise to new opportunities for improving the
efficiency of taxi fleets in terms of waiting times of passengers, cost and
time for drivers, traffic density, CO2 emissions, etc., by using more informed,
intelligent dispatching. Still, the explicit spatial and temporal components,
as well as the scale and, in particular, the dynamicity of the problem of
pairing passengers and taxis in big towns, render traditional approaches for
solving standard assignment problem useless for this purpose, and call for
intelligent approximation strategies based on domain-specific heuristics.
Furthermore, taxi drivers are often autonomous actors and may not agree to
participate in assignments that, though globally efficient, may not be
sufficently beneficial for them individually. This paper presents a new
heuristic algorithm for taxi assignment to customers that considers taxi
reassignments if this may lead to globally better solutions. In addition, as
such new assignments may reduce the expected revenues of individual drivers, we
propose an economic compensation scheme to make individually rational drivers
agree to proposed modifications in their assigned clients. We carried out a set
of experiments, where several commonly used assignment strategies are compared
to three different instantiations of our heuristic algorithm. The results
indicate that our proposal has the potential to reduce customer waiting times
in fleets of autonomous taxis, while being also beneficial from an economic
point of view.

<p class="mathjax">We present the problem of conservative distributed multi-task learning in
stochastic linear contextual bandits with heterogeneous agents. This extends
conservative linear bandits to a distributed setting where M agents tackle
different but related tasks while adhering to stage-wise performance
constraints. The exact context is unknown, and only a context distribution is
available to the agents as in many practical applications that involve a
prediction mechanism to infer context, such as stock market prediction and
weather forecast. We propose a distributed upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm, DiSC-UCB. Our algorithm constructs a pruned action set during each
round to ensure the constraints are met. Additionally, it includes synchronized
sharing of estimates among agents via a central server using well-structured
synchronization steps. We prove the regret and communication bounds on the
algorithm. We extend the problem to a setting where the agents are unaware of
the baseline reward. For this setting, we provide a modified algorithm,
DiSC-UCB2, and we show that the modified algorithm achieves the same regret and
communication bounds. We empirically validated the performance of our algorithm
on synthetic data and real-world Movielens-100K data.

<p class="mathjax">We explore a stochastic contextual linear bandit problem where the agent
observes a noisy, corrupted version of the true context through a noise channel
with an unknown noise parameter. Our objective is to design an action policy
that can approximate" that of an oracle, which has access to the reward model,
the channel parameter, and the predictive distribution of the true context from
the observed noisy context. In a Bayesian framework, we introduce a Thompson
sampling algorithm for Gaussian bandits with Gaussian context noise. Adopting
an information-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate the Bayesian regret of our
algorithm concerning the oracle's action policy. We also extend this problem to
a scenario where the agent observes the true context with some delay after
receiving the reward and show that delayed true contexts lead to lower Bayesian
regret. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed

the version age of $K_n$ is logarithmic, and the version age of
$\overline{K_n}$ is linear. We study the question `how does the vAoI evolve as
we interpolate between $K_n$ and $\overline{K_n}$' by studying Erd\H{o}s-Reyni

results are proving the existence of a threshold in $G(n,p)$ from rational to

logarithmic version age for constant $d$. We also characterize the version age
of complete bipartite graphs $K_{L,R}$, when we let $L$ vary from $O(1)$ to

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and cost-effective solution
for wildfire monitoring. However, their widespread deployment during wildfires
has been hindered by a lack of operational guidelines and concerns about
potential interference with aircraft systems. Consequently, the progress in
developing deep-learning models for wildfire detection and characterization
using aerial images is constrained by the limited availability, size, and
quality of existing datasets. This paper introduces a solution aimed at
enhancing the quality of current aerial wildfire datasets to align with
advancements in camera technology. The proposed approach offers a solution to
create a comprehensive, standardized large-scale image dataset. This paper
presents a pipeline based on CycleGAN to enhance wildfire datasets and a novel
fusion method that integrates paired RGB images as attribute conditioning in
the generators of both directions, improving the accuracy of the generated
images.

<p class="mathjax">Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices, an even cover in $H$ is a
collection of hyperedges that touch each vertex an even number of times. Even
covers are a generalization of cycles in graphs and are equivalent to linearly
dependent subsets of a system of linear equations modulo $2$. As a result, they
arise naturally in the context of well-studied questions in coding theory and
refuting unsatisfiable $k$-SAT formulas. Analogous to the irregular Moore bound
of Alon, Hoory, and Linial (2002), in 2008, Feige conjectured an extremal
trade-off between the number of hyperedges and the length of the smallest even
cover in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. This conjecture was recently settled up to a
multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of hyperedges (Guruswami,
Kothari, and 1Manohar 2022 and Hsieh, Kothari, and Mohanty 2023). These works
introduce the new technique that relates hypergraph even covers to cycles in
the associated \emph{Kikuchi} graphs. Their analysis of these Kikuchi graphs,
especially for odd $k$, is rather involved and relies on matrix concentration
inequalities.
<br />In this work, we give a simple and purely combinatorial argument that
recovers the best-known bound for Feige's conjecture for even $k$. We also
introduce a novel variant of a Kikuchi graph which together with this argument
improves the logarithmic factor in the best-known bounds for odd $k$. As an
application of our ideas, we also give a purely combinatorial proof of the
improved lower bounds (Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, 2023) on
3-query binary linear locally decodable codes.

<p class="mathjax">While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a
network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model
parameters. In this work, we formalize Differentially Private Hierarchical
Federated Learning (DP-HFL), a DP-enhanced FL methodology that seeks to improve
the privacy-utility tradeoff inherent in FL. Building upon recent proposals for
Hierarchical Differential Privacy (HDP), one of the key concepts of DP-HFL is
adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy
-- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust
models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of
the convergence behavior of DP-HFL, revealing conditions on parameter tuning
under which the model training process converges sublinearly to a stationarity
gap, with this gap depending on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target
privacy level. Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that DP-HFL obtains
substantial improvements in convergence speed over baselines for different
privacy budgets, and validate the impact of network configuration on training.

<p class="mathjax">Face recognition systems are widely deployed in high-security applications
such as for biometric verification at border controls. Despite their high
accuracy on pristine data, it is well-known that digital manipulations, such as
face morphing, pose a security threat to face recognition systems. Malicious
actors can exploit the facilities offered by the identity document issuance
process to obtain identity documents containing morphed images. Thus, subjects
who contributed to the creation of the morphed image can with high probability
use the identity document to bypass automated face recognition systems. In
recent years, no-reference (i.e., single image) and differential morphing
attack detectors have been proposed to tackle this risk. These systems are
typically evaluated in isolation from the face recognition system that they
have to operate jointly with and do not consider the face recognition process.
Contrary to most existing works, we present a novel method for adapting deep
learning-based face recognition systems to be more robust against face morphing
attacks. To this end, we introduce TetraLoss, a novel loss function that learns
to separate morphed face images from its contributing subjects in the embedding
space while still preserving high biometric verification performance. In a
comprehensive evaluation, we show that the proposed method can significantly
enhance the original system while also significantly outperforming other tested
baseline methods.

<p class="mathjax">Approximately 61% of cyber attacks involve adversaries in possession of valid
credentials. Attackers acquire credentials through various means, including
phishing, dark web data drops, password reuse, etc. Multi-factor authentication
(MFA) helps to thwart attacks that use valid credentials, but attackers still
commonly breach systems by tricking users into accepting MFA step up requests
through techniques, such as ``MFA Bombing'', where multiple requests are sent
to a user until they accept one. Currently, there are several solutions to this
problem, each with varying levels of security and increasing invasiveness on
user devices. This paper proposes a token-based enrollment architecture that is
less invasive to user devices than mobile device management, but still offers
strong protection against use of stolen credentials and MFA attacks.

<p class="mathjax">Why do neural networks trained with large learning rates for a longer time
often lead to better generalization? In this paper, we delve into this question
by examining the relation between training and testing loss in neural networks.
Through visualization of these losses, we note that the training trajectory
with a large learning rate navigates through the minima manifold of the
training loss, finally nearing the neighborhood of the testing loss minimum.
Motivated by these findings, we introduce a nonlinear model whose loss
landscapes mirror those observed for real neural networks. Upon investigating
the training process using SGD on our model, we demonstrate that an extended
phase with a large learning rate steers our model towards the minimum norm
solution of the training loss, which may achieve near-optimal generalization,
thereby affirming the empirically observed benefits of late learning rate
decay.

<p class="mathjax">Many evaluation measures are used to evaluate social biases in masked
language models (MLMs). However, we find that these previously proposed
evaluation measures are lacking robustness in scenarios with limited datasets.
This is because these measures are obtained by comparing the
pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores of the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical
samples using an indicator function. The disadvantage is the limited mining of
the PLL score sets without capturing its distributional information. In this
paper, we represent a PLL score set as a Gaussian distribution and use Kullback
Leibler (KL) divergence and Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence to construct
evaluation measures for the distributions of stereotypical and
anti-stereotypical PLL scores. Experimental results on the publicly available

<p class="mathjax">We present the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), an image generative
model that exhibits linear scaling with pixel count, supporting training at
high-resolution (e.g. $1024 \times 1024$) directly in pixel-space. Building on
the Transformer architecture, which is known to scale to billions of
parameters, it bridges the gap between the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets
and the scalability of Transformers. HDiT trains successfully without typical
high-resolution training techniques such as multiscale architectures, latent
autoencoders or self-conditioning. We demonstrate that HDiT performs
competitively with existing models on ImageNet $256^2$, and sets a new
state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-$1024^2$.

<p class="mathjax">Reliably reconstructing physical fields from sparse sensor data is a
challenge that frequently arises in many scientific domains. In practice, the
process generating the data often is not understood to sufficient accuracy.
Therefore, there is a growing interest in using the deep neural network route
to address the problem. This work presents a novel approach that learns a
continuous representation of the physical field using implicit neural
representations (INRs). Specifically, after factorizing spatiotemporal
variability into spatial and temporal components using the separation of
variables technique, the method learns relevant basis functions from sparsely
sampled irregular data points to develop a continuous representation of the
data. In experimental evaluations, the proposed model outperforms recent INR
methods, offering superior reconstruction quality on simulation data from a
state-of-the-art climate model and a second dataset that comprises ultra-high
resolution satellite-based sea surface temperature fields.

This paper presents a solution that utilizes a graphical technique in
combination with a Stochastic method for tuning an active physics-based model.
We generate responsive interactive organ animations with regional properties
(i.e., areas of the model oscillating with different harmonic frequencies) to
reproduce and capture real-world characteristics. Our method builds upon
biological and physical discoveries to procedurally generate internally
controlled rhythmic motions but also enable the solution to be interactive and
adaptive. We briefly review deformation models for medical simulations and
investigate the impediments to combining 'computergraphics' representations
with biomechanical models. Finally, we present a lightweight solution that is
scalable and able to procedurally generate large organ animations. In
particular, simplified geometric representations of deformable structures that

posed on a disk. A benefit of the BEM as opposed to many other numerical
solution techniques is that discretization only occurs on the boundary, i.e.,
the complete domain does not need to be discretized. This provides an advantage
in terms of time and cost. The algorithm's performance is illustrated through

<p class="mathjax">Computer vision encompasses a range of tasks such as object detection,
semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. Despite its relevance to African
communities, research in this field within Africa represents only 0.06% of
top-tier publications over the past decade. This study undertakes a thorough
analysis of 63,000 Scopus-indexed computer vision publications from Africa,
spanning from 2012 to 2022. The aim is to provide a survey of African computer
vision topics, datasets and researchers. A key aspect of our study is the
identification and categorization of African Computer Vision datasets using
large language models that automatically parse abstracts of these publications.
We also provide a compilation of unofficial African Computer Vision datasets
distributed through challenges or data hosting platforms, and provide a full
taxonomy of dataset categories. Our survey also pinpoints computer vision
topics trends specific to different African regions, indicating their unique
focus areas. Additionally, we carried out an extensive survey to capture the
views of African researchers on the current state of computer vision research
in the continent and the structural barriers they believe need urgent
attention. In conclusion, this study catalogs and categorizes Computer Vision
datasets and topics contributed or initiated by African institutions and
identifies barriers to publishing in top-tier Computer Vision venues. This
survey underscores the importance of encouraging African researchers and
institutions in advancing computer vision research in the continent. It also
stresses on the need for research topics to be more aligned with the needs of
African communities.

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic overfitting (CO) in single-step adversarial training (AT)
results in abrupt drops in the adversarial test accuracy (even down to 0%). For
models trained with multi-step AT, it has been observed that the loss function
behaves locally linearly with respect to the input, this is however lost in
single-step AT. To address CO in single-step AT, several methods have been
proposed to enforce local linearity of the loss via regularization. However,
these regularization terms considerably slow down training due to Double
Backpropagation. Instead, in this work, we introduce a regularization term,
called ELLE, to mitigate CO effectively and efficiently in classical AT
evaluations, as well as some more difficult regimes, e.g., large adversarial
perturbations and long training schedules. Our regularization term can be
theoretically linked to curvature of the loss function and is computationally
cheaper than previous methods by avoiding Double Backpropagation. Our thorough
experimental validation demonstrates that our work does not suffer from CO,
even in challenging settings where previous works suffer from it. We also
notice that adapting our regularization parameter during training (ELLE-A)
greatly improves the performance, specially in large $\epsilon$ setups. Our
implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ELLE .

<p class="mathjax">When optimizing real-time systems, designers often face a challenging problem
where the schedulability constraints are non-convex, non-continuous, or lack an
analytical form to understand their properties. Although the optimization
framework NORTH proposed in previous work is general (it works with arbitrary
schedulability analysis) and scalable, it can only handle problems with
continuous variables, which limits its application. In this paper, we extend
the applications of the framework NORTH to problems with a hybrid of continuous
and discrete variables. This is achieved in a coordinate-descent method, where
the continuous and discrete variables are optimized separately during
iterations. The new framework, NORTH+, improves around 20% solution quality
than NORTH in experiments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the problem of finding a minimum-cost $m$-state Markov
chain $(S_0,\ldots,S_{m-1})$ in a large set of chains. The chains studied have
a reward associated with each state. The cost of a chain is its "gain", i.e.,
its average reward under its stationary distribution.
<br />Specifically, for each $k=0,\ldots,m-1$ there is a known set ${\mathbb S}_k$
of type-$k$ states. A permissible Markov chain contains exactly one state of
each type; the problem is to find a minimum-cost permissible chain.
<br />The original motivation was to find a cheapest binary AIFV-$m$ lossless code
on a source alphabet of size $n$. Such a code is an $m$-tuple of trees, in
which each tree can be viewed as a Markov Chain state. This formulation was
then used to address other problems in lossless compression. The known solution
techniques for finding minimum-cost Markov chains were iterative and ran in
exponential time.
<br />This paper shows how to map every possible type-$k$ state into a type-$k$
hyperplane and then define a "Markov Chain Polytope" as the lower envelope of
all such hyperplanes. Finding a minimum-cost Markov chain can then be shown to
be equivalent to finding a "highest" point on this polytope.
<br />The local optimization procedures used in the previous iterative algorithms
are shown to be separation oracles for this polytope. Since these were often
polynomial time, an application of the Ellipsoid method immediately leads to
polynomial time algorithms for these problems.

remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting
to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the
model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot
demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent
development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The
implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward,
leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the
efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to
reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging
results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct
an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and
compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training
procedures, and inference algorithms.

<p class="mathjax">Freely Long-Thinking Transformer (FraiLT) is an improved transformer model
designed to enhance processing capabilities without scaling up size. It
utilizes a recursive approach, iterating over a subset of layers multiple
times, and introduces iteration encodings to maintain awareness across these
cycles. Iteration encoding allows FraiLT to achieve the interpretive depth of
larger models in a compact form. When evaluated on a synthetic story dataset,
FraiLT outperformed larger models, showcasing its ability to deliver
high-quality performance while reducing memory demands. This model represents a
step forward towards more efficient and accessible language models.

<p class="mathjax">We introduce two algorithms for computing tight guarantees on the
probabilistic robustness of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Computing
robustness guarantees for BNNs is a significantly more challenging task than
verifying the robustness of standard Neural Networks (NNs) because it requires
searching the parameters' space for safe weights. Moreover, tight and complete
approaches for the verification of standard NNs, such as those based on
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), cannot be directly used for the
verification of BNNs because of the polynomial terms resulting from the
consecutive multiplication of variables encoding the weights. Our algorithms
efficiently and effectively search the parameters' space for safe weights by
using iterative expansion and the network's gradient and can be used with any
verification algorithm of choice for BNNs. In addition to proving that our
algorithms compute tighter bounds than the SoA, we also evaluate our algorithms
against the SoA on standard benchmarks, such as MNIST and CIFAR10, showing that
our algorithms compute bounds up to 40% tighter than the SoA.

<p class="mathjax">Recent innovations in digital technology offer significant opportunities for
older adults to engage in meaningful activities. To investigate older adults'
perceptions of using existing and emerging technologies for meaningful
activities, we conducted three participatory design workshops and follow-up
interviews with adults aged over 65. The workshops encompassed discussions on
existing technologies for meaningful activities, demonstrations of emerging
technologies such as VR, AR, and AI, and design activities including
prototyping and storyboarding. Our findings show that while participants had
diverse interpretations of meaningful activities, they sought to use
technologies to support continuity in the pursuit of these activities.
Specifically, participants highlighted the importance of safe aging at home,
which provides a pathway for meaningful activities in later life. We further
discuss participants' discerning attitudes when assessing the use of different
technologies for meaningful activities and several values and attributes they
desire when envisioning future technologies, including simplicity, positivity,
proactivity, and integration.

<p class="mathjax">Online user dynamics has been actively studied in recent years and bandwagon
behavior is one of the most representative topics which can provide valuable
insights for user identity change. Many previous studies have characterized
bandwagon users and leveraged such characteristics to tackle practical problems
such as community loyalty prediction. However, very few of them have
investigated bandwagon dynamics from a long-term perspective. In this work, we
focus on characterizing and predicting long-term bandwagon user behaviors in
the context of online fan loyalty. Using a dataset collected from NBA-related
discussion forums on Reddit, we trace the long-term loyalty status of bandwagon
fans to capture their latent behavioral characteristics and then propose a
computational model to predict their next sport season loyalty status with
their home teams. Our analyses reveal that bandwagoning for most fans is a
temporary switch and most of them will be back in the long term. In addition,
online fans with different loyalty levels to their home teams have demonstrated
different behaviors in various aspects, such as activity level, language usage
and reply network properties. We then propose a model based on such behavioral
characteristics to predict their next-season loyalty status. Its promising
performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our behavior characterization.

<p class="mathjax">The study proposes the reformulation of offline reinforcement learning as a
regression problem that can be solved with decision trees. Aiming to predict
actions based on input states, return-to-go (RTG), and timestep information, we
observe that with gradient-boosted trees, the agent training and inference are
very fast, the former taking less than a minute. Despite the simplification
inherent in this reformulated problem, our agent demonstrates performance that
is at least on par with established methods. This assertion is validated by
testing it across standard datasets associated with D4RL Gym-MuJoCo tasks. We
further discuss the agent's ability to generalize by testing it on two extreme
cases, how it learns to model the return distributions effectively even with
highly skewed expert datasets, and how it exhibits robust performance in
scenarios with sparse/delayed rewards.

"cross-modal generation." This point of view allows us to draw parallels
between various methods geared towards working on input text and producing
visual output, without limiting the analysis to narrow sub-areas. It also
results in the identification of common templates in the field, which are then
compared and contrasted both within pools of similar methods and across lines
of research. We provide a breakdown of text-to-image generation into various
flavors of image-from-text methods, video-from-text methods, image editing,
self-supervised and graph-based approaches. In this discussion, we focus on
research papers published at 8 leading machine learning conferences in the
years 2016-2022, also incorporating a number of relevant papers not matching
the outlined search criteria. The conducted review suggests a significant
increase in the number of papers published in the area and highlights research
gaps and potential lines of investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first
review to systematically look at text-to-image generation from the perspective
of "cross-modal generation."

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning-based (DL) models in recommender systems (RecSys) have gained
significant recognition for their remarkable accuracy in predicting user
preferences. However, their performance often lacks a comprehensive evaluation
from a human-centric perspective, which encompasses various dimensions beyond
simple interest matching. In this work, we have developed a robust
human-centric evaluation framework that incorporates seven diverse metrics to
assess the quality of recommendations generated by five recent open-sourced DL
models. Our evaluation datasets consist of both offline benchmark data and
personalized online recommendation feedback collected from 445 real users. We
find that (1) different DL models have different pros and cons in the
multi-dimensional metrics that we test with; (2) users generally want a
combination of accuracy with at least one another human values in the
recommendation; (3) the degree of combination of different values needs to be
carefully experimented to user preferred level.

<p class="mathjax">The fusion of vision and language has brought about a transformative shift in
computer vision through the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
However, the resource-intensive nature of existing VLMs poses a significant
challenge. We need an accessible method for developing the next generation of
VLMs. To address this issue, we propose Zoom-shot, a novel method for
transferring the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP to any pre-trained vision
encoder. We do this by exploiting the multimodal information (i.e. text and
image) present in the CLIP latent space through the use of specifically
designed multimodal loss functions. These loss functions are (1)
cycle-consistency loss and (2) our novel prompt-guided knowledge distillation
loss (PG-KD). PG-KD combines the concept of knowledge distillation with CLIP's
zero-shot classification, to capture the interactions between text and image
features. With our multimodal losses, we train a $\textbf{linear mapping}$
between the CLIP latent space and the latent space of a pre-trained vision
encoder, for only a $\textbf{single epoch}$. Furthermore, Zoom-shot is entirely
unsupervised and is trained using $\textbf{unpaired}$ data. We test the
zero-shot capabilities of a range of vision encoders augmented as new VLMs, on
coarse and fine-grained classification datasets, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art in this problem domain. In our ablations, we find Zoom-shot
allows for a trade-off between data and compute during training; and our
state-of-the-art results can be obtained by reducing training from 20% to 1% of
the ImageNet training data with 20 epochs. All code and models are available on
GitHub.

and academia, there is an increasing need for faster, robust, and generalizable
path planning algorithms. Similarly, given the inherent connection between
control algorithms and multi-robot path planners, there is in turn an increased
demand for fast, efficient, and robust controllers. We propose a scalable joint
path planning and control algorithm for multi-robot systems with constrained
behaviours based on factor graph optimization. We demonstrate our algorithm on
a series of hardware and simulated experiments. Our algorithm is consistently
able to recover from disturbances and avoid obstacles while outperforming

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have seen
considerable advancements and have been applied in diverse fields. Built on the
Transformer architecture, these models are trained on extensive datasets,
enabling them to understand and generate human language effectively. In the
financial domain, the deployment of LLMs is gaining momentum. These models are
being utilized for automating financial report generation, forecasting market
trends, analyzing investor sentiment, and offering personalized financial
advice. Leveraging their natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can
distill key insights from vast financial data, aiding institutions in making
informed investment choices and enhancing both operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of
the emerging integration of LLMs into various financial tasks. Additionally, we
conducted holistic tests on multiple financial tasks through the combination of
natural language instructions. Our findings show that GPT-4 effectively follow
prompt instructions across various financial tasks. This survey and evaluation
of LLMs in the financial domain aim to deepen the understanding of LLMs'
current role in finance for both financial practitioners and LLM researchers,
identify new research and application prospects, and highlight how these
technologies can be leveraged to solve practical challenges in the finance
industry.

report over 5570 bugs, of which 4604 have been patched [11]. While this is
impressive, we have found the average time to find a bug is over 405 days.
Moreover, we have found that current metrics commonly used, such as
time-to-find and number of bugs found, are inaccurate in evaluating Syzbot
since bugs often spend the majority of their lives hidden from the fuzzer. In
this paper, we set out to better understand and quantify Syzbot's performance
and improvement in finding bugs. Our tool, SyzRetrospector, takes a different
approach to evaluating Syzbot by finding the earliest that Syzbot was capable
of finding a bug, and why that bug was revealed. We use SyzRetrospector on a
large scale to analyze 559 bugs and find that bugs are hidden for an average of
331.17 days before Syzbot is even able to find them. We further present
findings on the behaviors of revealing factors, how some bugs are harder to
reveal than others, the trends in delays over the past 6 years, and how bug
location relates to delays. We also provide key takeaways for improving
Syzbot's delays.

<p class="mathjax">Automatic surgical phase recognition is a core technology for modern
operating rooms and online surgical video assessment platforms. Current
state-of-the-art methods use both spatial and temporal information to tackle
the surgical phase recognition task. Building on this idea, we propose the
Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Transformer (MS-AST) for offline surgical phase
recognition and the Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Causal Transformer
(MS-ASCT) for online surgical phase recognition. We use ResNet50 or
EfficientNetV2-M for spatial feature extraction. Our MS-AST and MS-ASCT can
model temporal information at different scales with multi-scale temporal
self-attention and multi-scale temporal cross-attention, which enhances the
capture of temporal relationships between frames and segments. We demonstrate
that our method can achieve 95.26% and 96.15% accuracy on the Cholec80 dataset
for online and offline surgical phase recognition, respectively, which achieves
new state-of-the-art results. Our method can also achieve state-of-the-art
results on non-medical datasets in the video action segmentation domain.

<p class="mathjax">Many recent studies integrate federated learning (FL) with self-supervised
learning (SSL) to take advantage of raw training data distributed across edge
devices. However, edge devices often struggle with high computation and
communication costs imposed by SSL and FL algorithms. To tackle this hindrance,
we propose LW-FedSSL, a layer-wise federated self-supervised learning approach
that allows edge devices to incrementally train one layer of the model at a
time. LW-FedSSL comprises server-side calibration and representation alignment
mechanisms to maintain comparable performance with end-to-end FedSSL while
significantly lowering clients' resource requirements. The server-side
calibration mechanism takes advantage of the resource-rich server in an FL
environment to assist in global model training. Meanwhile, the representation
alignment mechanism encourages closeness between representations of FL local
models and those of the global model. Our experiments show that LW-FedSSL has a
$3.3 \times$ lower memory requirement and a $3.2 \times$ cheaper communication
cost than its end-to-end counterpart. We also explore a progressive training
strategy called Prog-FedSSL that outperforms end-to-end training with a similar
memory requirement and a $1.8 \times$ cheaper communication cost.

<p class="mathjax">Predicting next visit diagnosis using Electronic Health Records (EHR) is an
essential task in healthcare, critical for devising proactive future plans for
both healthcare providers and patients. Nonetheless, many preceding studies
have not sufficiently addressed the heterogeneous and hierarchical
characteristics inherent in EHR data, inevitably leading to sub-optimal
performance. To this end, we propose NECHO, a novel medical code-centric
multimodal contrastive EHR learning framework with hierarchical regularisation.
First, we integrate multifaceted information encompassing medical codes,
demographics, and clinical notes using a tailored network design and a pair of
bimodal contrastive losses, all of which pivot around a medical code
representation. We also regularise modality-specific encoders using a parental
level information in medical ontology to learn hierarchical structure of EHR
data. A series of experiments on MIMIC-III data demonstrates effectiveness of
our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the rise of large-scale vision-language pretrained models like
CLIP, coupled with the technology of Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), has
captured substantial attraction in video action recognition. Nevertheless,
prevailing approaches tend to prioritize strong supervised performance at the
expense of compromising the models' generalization capabilities during
transfer. In this paper, we introduce a novel Multimodal, Multi-task CLIP
adapting framework named \name to address these challenges, preserving both
high supervised performance and robust transferability. Firstly, to enhance the
individual modality architectures, we introduce multimodal adapters to both the
visual and text branches. Specifically, we design a novel visual TED-Adapter,
that performs global Temporal Enhancement and local temporal Difference
modeling to improve the temporal representation capabilities of the visual
encoder. Moreover, we adopt text encoder adapters to strengthen the learning of
semantic label information. Secondly, we design a multi-task decoder with a
rich set of supervisory signals to adeptly satisfy the need for strong
supervised performance and generalization within a multimodal framework.
Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating
exceptional performance in supervised learning while maintaining strong
generalization in zero-shot scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Efficient analysis of point clouds holds paramount significance in real-world
3D applications. Currently, prevailing point-based models adhere to the
PointNet++ methodology, which involves embedding and abstracting point features
within a sequence of spatially overlapping local point sets, resulting in
noticeable computational redundancy. Drawing inspiration from the streamlined
paradigm of pixel embedding followed by regional pooling in Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), we introduce a novel, uncomplicated yet potent
architecture known as PointGL, crafted to facilitate efficient point cloud
analysis. PointGL employs a hierarchical process of feature acquisition through
two recursive steps. First, the Global Point Embedding leverages
straightforward residual Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) to effectuate feature
embedding for each individual point. Second, the novel Local Graph Pooling
technique characterizes point-to-point relationships and abstracts regional
representations through succinct local graphs. The harmonious fusion of
one-time point embedding and parameter-free graph pooling contributes to
PointGL's defining attributes of minimized model complexity and heightened
efficiency. Our PointGL attains state-of-the-art accuracy on the ScanObjectNN
dataset while exhibiting a runtime that is more than 5 times faster and
utilizing only approximately 4% of the FLOPs and 30% of the parameters compared
to the recent PointMLP model. The code for PointGL is available at
https://github.com/Roywangj/PointGL.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to
collaboratively train machine learning models across multiple edge devices
while preserving privacy. The success of FL hinges on the efficiency of
participating models and their ability to handle the unique challenges of
distributed learning. While several variants of Vision Transformer (ViT) have
shown great potential as alternatives to modern convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for centralized training, the unprecedented size and higher
computational demands hinder their deployment on resource-constrained edge
devices, challenging their widespread application in FL. Since client devices
in FL typically have limited computing resources and communication bandwidth,
models intended for such devices must strike a balance between model size,
computational efficiency, and the ability to adapt to the diverse and non-IID
data distributions encountered in FL. To address these challenges, we propose
OnDev-LCT: Lightweight Convolutional Transformers for On-Device vision tasks
with limited training data and resources. Our models incorporate image-specific
inductive biases through the LCT tokenizer by leveraging efficient depthwise
separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local
features, while the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the LCT
encoder implicitly facilitates capturing global representations of images.
Extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets indicate that our models
outperform existing lightweight vision models while having fewer parameters and
lower computational demands, making them suitable for FL scenarios with data
heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks.

<p class="mathjax">Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) aims to learn an alignment model between
videos and class descriptions of seen actions that is transferable to unseen
actions. The text queries (class descriptions) used in existing ZSAR works,
however, are often short action names that fail to capture the rich semantics
in the videos, leading to misalignment. With the intuition that video content
descriptions (e.g., video captions) can provide rich contextual information of
visual concepts in videos, we propose to utilize human annotated video
descriptions to enrich the semantics of the class descriptions of each action.
However, all existing action video description datasets are limited in terms of
the number of actions, the semantics of video descriptions, etc. To this end,
we collect a large-scale action video descriptions dataset named ActionHub,
which covers a total of 1,211 common actions and provides 3.6 million action
video descriptions. With the proposed ActionHub dataset, we further propose a
novel Cross-modality and Cross-action Modeling (CoCo) framework for ZSAR, which
consists of a Dual Cross-modality Alignment module and a Cross-action
Invariance Mining module. Specifically, the Dual Cross-modality Alignment
module utilizes both action labels and video descriptions from ActionHub to
obtain rich class semantic features for feature alignment. The Cross-action
Invariance Mining module exploits a cycle-reconstruction process between the
class semantic feature spaces of seen actions and unseen actions, aiming to
guide the model to learn cross-action invariant representations. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our CoCo framework significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art on three popular ZSAR benchmarks (i.e.,
Kinetics-ZSAR, UCF101 and HMDB51) under two different learning protocols in
ZSAR. We will release our code, models, and the proposed ActionHub dataset.

<p class="mathjax">Health issues and pandemics remain paramount concerns in the contemporary
era. Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI) stands out as a critical
healthcare-associated infection with global implications. Effectively
understanding the mechanisms of infection dissemination within healthcare units
and hospitals is imperative to implement targeted containment measures. In this
study, we address the limitations of prior research by Sulyok et al., where
they delineated two distinct categories of surfaces as high-touch and low-touch
fomites, and subsequently evaluated the viral spread contribution of each
surface utilizing mathematical modeling and Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODE). Acknowledging the indispensable role of spatial features and
heterogeneity in the modeling of hospital and healthcare settings, we employ
agent-based modeling to capture new insights. By incorporating spatial
considerations and heterogeneous patients, we explore the impact of high-touch
and low-touch surfaces on contamination transmission between patients.
Furthermore, the study encompasses a comprehensive assessment of various
cleaning protocols, with differing intervals and detergent cleaning efficacies,
in order to identify the most optimal cleaning strategy and the most important
factor amidst the array of alternatives. Our results indicate that, among
various factors, the frequency of cleaning intervals is the most critical
element for controlling the spread of CDI in a hospital environment.

<p class="mathjax">In decision-making problems with limited training data, policy functions
approximated using deep neural networks often exhibit suboptimal performance.
An alternative approach involves learning a world model from the limited data
and determining actions through online search. However, the performance is
adversely affected by compounding errors arising from inaccuracies in the
learnt world model. While methods like TreeQN have attempted to address these
inaccuracies by incorporating algorithmic structural biases into their
architectures, the biases they introduce are often weak and insufficient for
complex decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce Differentiable Tree
Search (DTS), a novel neural network architecture that significantly
strengthens the inductive bias by embedding the algorithmic structure of a
best-first online search algorithm. DTS employs a learnt world model to conduct
a fully differentiable online search in latent state space. The world model is
jointly optimised with the search algorithm, enabling the learning of a robust
world model and mitigating the effect of model inaccuracies. We address
potential Q-function discontinuities arising from naive incorporation of
best-first search by adopting a stochastic tree expansion policy, formulating
search tree expansion as a decision-making task, and introducing an effective
variance reduction technique for the gradient computation. We evaluate DTS in
an offline-RL setting with a limited training data scenario on Procgen games
and grid navigation task, and demonstrate that DTS outperforms popular
model-free and model-based baselines.

<p class="mathjax">The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has consistently focused on
the experiences of users moderated by social media platforms. Recently,
scholars have noticed that moderation practices could perpetuate biases,
resulting in the marginalization of user groups undergoing moderation. However,
most studies have primarily addressed marginalization related to issues such as
racism or sexism, with little attention given to the experiences of people with
disabilities. In this paper, we present a study on the moderation experiences
of blind users on TikTok, also known as "BlindToker," to address this gap. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 BlindTokers and used thematic
analysis to analyze the data. Two main themes emerged: BlindTokers' situated
content moderation experiences and their reactions to content moderation. We
reported on the lack of accessibility on TikTok's platform, contributing to the
moderation and marginalization of BlindTokers. Additionally, we discovered
instances of harassment from trolls that prompted BlindTokers to respond with
harsh language, triggering further moderation. We discussed these findings in
the context of the literature on moderation, marginalization, and
transformative justice, seeking solutions to address such issues.

<p class="mathjax">Catastrophic forgetting poses a substantial challenge for managing
intelligent agents controlled by a large model, causing performance degradation
when these agents face new tasks. In our work, we propose a novel solution -
the Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT). This method enhances a
transformer-based model by dynamically appending decision tokens during new
task training, thus fostering task-specific policies. Our approach mitigates
forgetting in continual and offline reinforcement learning scenarios. Moreover,
P2DT leverages trajectories collected via traditional reinforcement learning
from all tasks and generates new task-specific tokens during training, thereby
retaining knowledge from previous studies. Preliminary results demonstrate that
our model effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and scales well with
increasing task environments.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents a unique solution to challenges in medical image
processing by incorporating an adaptive curve grey wolf optimization (ACGWO)
algorithm into neural network backpropagation. Neural networks show potential
in medical data but suffer from issues like overfitting and lack of
interpretability due to imbalanced and scarce data. Traditional Gray Wolf
Optimization (GWO) also has its drawbacks, such as a lack of population
diversity and premature convergence. This paper addresses these problems by
introducing an adaptive algorithm, enhancing the standard GWO with a sigmoid
function. This algorithm was extensively compared to four leading algorithms
using six well-known test functions, outperforming them effectively. Moreover,
by utilizing the ACGWO, we increase the robustness and generalization of the
neural network, resulting in more interpretable predictions. Applied to the
publicly accessible Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, our technique surpasses
ten other methods, achieving 86.8% accuracy, indicating its potential for
efficient heart disease prediction in the clinical setting.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have
prominently featured transformer-based models with attention mechanisms.
However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound
influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth
estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that
prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance
various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves
infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate
MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the
feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial
aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details
would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS,
including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and
the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU,
Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">Recent studies have made remarkable progress in histopathology
classification. Based on current successes, contemporary works proposed to
further upgrade the model towards a more generalizable and robust direction
through incrementally learning from the sequentially delivered domains. Unlike
previous parameter isolation based approaches that usually demand massive
computation resources during model updating, we present a memory-efficient
prompt tuning framework to cultivate model generalization potential in
economical memory cost. For each incoming domain, we reuse the existing
parameters of the initial classification model and attach lightweight trainable
prompts into it for customized tuning. Considering the domain heterogeneity, we
perform decoupled prompt tuning, where we adopt a domain-specific prompt for
each domain to independently investigate its distinctive characteristics, and
one domain-invariant prompt shared across all domains to continually explore
the common content embedding throughout time. All domain-specific prompts will
be appended to the prompt bank and isolated from further changes to prevent
forgetting the distinctive features of early-seen domains. While the
domain-invariant prompt will be passed on and iteratively evolve by
style-augmented prompt refining to improve model generalization capability over
time. In specific, we construct a graph with existing prompts and build a
style-augmented graph attention network to guide the domain-invariant prompt
exploring the overlapped latent embedding among all delivered domains for more
domain generic representations. We have extensively evaluated our framework
with two histopathology tasks, i.e., breast cancer metastasis classification
and epithelium-stroma tissue classification, where our approach yielded
superior performance and memory efficiency over the competing methods.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the stabilization problem of networked control systems
(NCSs) with random packet dropouts caused by stochastic channels. To describe
the effects of stochastic channels on the information transmission, the
transmission times are assumed to be deterministic, whereas the packet
transmission is assumed to be random. We first propose a stochastic scheduling
protocol to model random packet dropouts, and address the properties of the
proposed stochastic scheduling protocol. The proposed scheduling protocol
provides a unified modelling framework for a general class of random packet
dropouts due to different stochastic channels. Next, the proposed scheduling
protocol is embedded into the closed-loop system, which leads to a stochastic
hybrid model for NCSs with random packet dropouts. Based on this stochastic
hybrid model, we follow the emulation approach to establish sufficient
conditions to guarantee uniform global asymptotical stability in probability.
In particular, an upper bound on the maximally allowable transmission interval
is derived explicitly for all stochastic protocols satisfying Lyapunov
conditions that guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability in probability.
Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the derived
results.

<p class="mathjax">This work presents a framework for a robot with a multi-fingered hand to
freely utilize daily tools, including functional parts like buttons and
triggers. An approach heatmap is generated by selecting a functional finger,
indicating optimal palm positions on the object's surface that enable the
functional finger to contact the tool's functional part. Once the palm position
is identified through the heatmap, achieving the functional grasp becomes a
straightforward process where the fingers stably grasp the object with
low-dimensional inputs using the eigengrasp. As our approach does not need
human demonstrations, it can easily adapt to various sizes and designs,
extending its applicability to different objects. In our approach, we use
directional manipulability to obtain the approach heatmap. In addition, we add
two kinds of energy functions, i.e., palm energy and functional energy
functions, to realize the eigengrasp. Using this method, each robotic gripper
can autonomously identify its optimal workspace for functional grasping,
extending its applicability to non-anthropomorphic robotic hands. We show that
several daily tools like spray, drill, and remotes can be efficiently used by
not only an anthropomorphic Shadow hand but also a non-anthropomorphic Barrett
hand.

<p class="mathjax">DNA sequence alignment is an important workload in computational genomics.
Reference-guided DNA assembly involves aligning many read sequences against
candidate locations in a long reference genome. To reduce the computational
load of this alignment, candidate locations can be pre-filtered using simpler
alignment algorithms like edit distance. Prior work has explored accelerating
filtering on simulated compute-in-DRAM, due to the massive parallelism of
compute-in-memory architectures. In this paper, we present work-in-progress on
accelerating filtering using a commercial compute-in-SRAM accelerator. We
leverage the recently released Gemini accelerator platform from GSI Technology,
which is the first, to our knowledge, commercial-scale compute-in-SRAM system.
We accelerate the Myers' bit-parallel edit distance algorithm, producing
average speedups of 14.1x over single-core CPU performance. Individual
query/candidate alignments produce speedups of up to 24.1x. These early results
suggest this novel architecture is well-suited to accelerating the filtering
step of sequence-to-sequence DNA alignment.

<p class="mathjax">Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of
key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems.
However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games
with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we
solve this by drawing an analogy with the Ball-and-Box problem, based on which
we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is
equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct
strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy
multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time.
As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly
punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population.
Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the
punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction
of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The
analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were
previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus
allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.

<p class="mathjax">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as the third generation of neural networks,
have gained prominence for their biological plausibility and computational
efficiency, especially in processing diverse datasets. The integration of
attention mechanisms, inspired by advancements in neural network architectures,
has led to the development of Spiking Transformers. These have shown promise in
enhancing SNNs' capabilities, particularly in the realms of both static and
neuromorphic datasets. Despite their progress, a discernible gap exists in
these systems, specifically in the Spiking Self Attention (SSA) mechanism's
effectiveness in leveraging the temporal processing potential of SNNs. To
address this, we introduce the Temporal Interaction Module (TIM), a novel,
convolution-based enhancement designed to augment the temporal data processing
abilities within SNN architectures. TIM's integration into existing SNN
frameworks is seamless and efficient, requiring minimal additional parameters
while significantly boosting their temporal information handling capabilities.
Through rigorous experimentation, TIM has demonstrated its effectiveness in
exploiting temporal information, leading to state-of-the-art performance across
various neuromorphic datasets.

<p class="mathjax">We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric
matrix models. Parametric matrix models are based on matrix equations, and the
design is motivated by the efficiency of reduced basis methods for
approximating solutions of parametric equations. The dependent variables can be
defined implicitly or explicitly, and the equations may use algebraic,
differential, or integral relations. Parametric matrix models can be trained
with empirical data only, and no high-fidelity model calculations are needed.
While originally designed for scientific computing, parametric matrix models
are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine
learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric
matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance
for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric
matrix models produce accurate results within a computational framework that
allows for parameter extrapolation and interpretability.

<p class="mathjax">Artificial intelligence can cause inconvenience, harm, or other unintended
consequences in various ways, including those that arise from defects or
malfunctions in the AI system itself or those caused by its use or misuse.
Responsibility for AI harms or unintended consequences must be addressed to
hold accountable the people who caused such harms and ensure that victims
receive compensation for any damages or losses they may have sustained.
Historical instances of harm caused by AI have led to European Union
establishing an AI Liability Directive. The directive aims to lay down a
uniform set of rules for access to information, delineate the duty and level of
care required for AI development and use, and clarify the burden of proof for
damages or harms caused by AI systems, establishing broader protection for
victims. The future ability of provider to contest a product liability claim
will depend on good practices adopted in designing, developing, and maintaining

<p class="mathjax">This article addresses the challenge of validating the admission committee's
decisions for undergraduate admissions. In recent years, the traditional review
process has struggled to handle the overwhelmingly large amount of applicants'
data. Moreover, this traditional assessment often leads to human bias, which
might result in discrimination among applicants. Although classical machine
learning-based approaches exist that aim to verify the quantitative assessment
made by the application reviewers, these methods lack scalability and suffer
from performance issues when a large volume of data is in place. In this
context, we propose deep learning-based classifiers, namely Feed-Forward and
Input Convex neural networks, which overcome the challenges faced by the
existing methods. Furthermore, we give additional insights into our model by
incorporating an interpretability module, namely LIME. Our training and test
datasets comprise applicants' data with a wide range of variables and
information. Our models achieve higher accuracy compared to the best-performing
traditional machine learning-based approach by a considerable margin of 3.03\%.
Additionally, we show the sensitivity of different features and their relative
impacts on the overall admission decision using the LIME technique.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a novel approach for knowledge distillation (KD) from a
BERT teacher model to an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model using
intermediate layers. To distil the teacher's knowledge, we use an attention
decoder that learns from BERT's token probabilities. Our method shows that
language model (LM) information can be more effectively distilled into an ASR
model using both the intermediate layers and the final layer. By using the
intermediate layers as distillation target, we can more effectively distil LM
knowledge into the lower network layers. Using our method, we achieve better
recognition accuracy than with shallow fusion of an external LM, allowing us to
maintain fast parallel decoding. Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing greedy decoding with
connectionist temporal classification (CTC).

<p class="mathjax">Recently, scene text detection has received significant attention due to its
wide application. However, accurate detection in complex scenes of multiple
scales, orientations, and curvature remains a challenge. Numerous detection
methods adopt the Vatti clipping (VC) algorithm for multiple-instance training
to address the issue of arbitrary-shaped text. Yet we identify several bias
results from these approaches called the "shrinked kernel". Specifically, it
refers to a decrease in accuracy resulting from an output that overly favors
the text kernel. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Expand Kernel
Network (EK-Net) with expand kernel distance to compensate for the previous
deficiency, which includes three-stages regression to complete instance
detection. Moreover, EK-Net not only realize the precise positioning of
arbitrary-shaped text, but also achieve a trade-off between performance and
speed. Evaluation results demonstrate that EK-Net achieves state-of-the-art or
competitive performance compared to other advanced methods, e.g., F-measure of
85.72% at 35.42 FPS on ICDAR 2015, F-measure of 85.75% at 40.13 FPS on CTW1500.

<p class="mathjax">Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is an important method to improve
recommender system performance, especially when observations in target domains
are sparse. However, most existing cross-domain recommendations fail to fully
utilize the target domain's special features and are hard to be generalized to
new domains. The designed network is complex and is not suitable for rapid
industrial deployment. Our method introduces a two-step domain-aware
cross-attention, extracting transferable features of the source domain from
different granularity, which allows the efficient expression of both domain and
user interests. In addition, we simplify the training process, and our model
can be easily deployed on new domains. We conduct experiments on both public
datasets and industrial datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. We have also deployed the model in an online
advertising system and observed significant improvements in both
Click-Through-Rate (CTR) and effective cost per mille (ECPM).

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have exhibit exceptional performance in text-to-image
generation and editing. However, existing methods often face challenges when
handling complex text prompts that involve multiple objects with multiple
attributes and relationships. In this paper, we propose a brand new
training-free text-to-image generation/editing framework, namely Recaption,
Plan and Generate (RPG), harnessing the powerful chain-of-thought reasoning
ability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image
diffusion models. Our approach employs the MLLM as a global planner to
decompose the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler
generation tasks within subregions. We propose complementary regional diffusion
to enable region-wise compositional generation. Furthermore, we integrate
text-guided image generation and editing within the proposed RPG in a
closed-loop fashion, thereby enhancing generalization ability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our RPG outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image
diffusion models, including DALL-E 3 and SDXL, particularly in multi-category
object composition and text-image semantic alignment. Notably, our RPG
framework exhibits wide compatibility with various MLLM architectures (e.g.,
MiniGPT-4) and diffusion backbones (e.g., ControlNet). Our code is available

<p class="mathjax">Skull base surgery is a demanding field in which surgeons operate in and
around the skull while avoiding critical anatomical structures including nerves
and vasculature. While image-guided surgical navigation is the prevailing
standard, limitation still exists requiring personalized planning and
recognizing the irreplaceable role of a skilled surgeon. This paper presents a
collaboratively controlled robotic system tailored for assisted drilling in
skull base surgery. Our central hypothesis posits that this collaborative
system, enriched with haptic assistive modes to enforce virtual fixtures, holds
the potential to significantly enhance surgical safety, streamline efficiency,
and alleviate the physical demands on the surgeon. The paper describes the
intricate system development work required to enable these virtual fixtures
through haptic assistive modes. To validate our system's performance and
effectiveness, we conducted initial feasibility experiments involving a medical
student and two experienced surgeons. The experiment focused on drilling around
critical structures following cortical mastoidectomy, utilizing dental stone
phantom and cadaveric models. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed haptic feedback mechanism enhances the safety of drilling around
critical structures compared to systems lacking haptic assistance. With the aid
of our system, surgeons were able to safely skeletonize the critical structures
without breaching any critical structure even under obstructed view of the
surgical site.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have garnered considerable attention as a
paradigm for novel view synthesis by learning scene representations from
discrete observations. Nevertheless, NeRF exhibit pronounced performance
degradation when confronted with sparse view inputs, consequently curtailing
its further applicability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Geometric,
Semantic, and Photometric Guided NeRF (HG3-NeRF), a novel methodology that can
address the aforementioned limitation and enhance consistency of geometry,
semantic content, and appearance across different views. We propose
Hierarchical Geometric Guidance (HGG) to incorporate the attachment of
Structure from Motion (SfM), namely sparse depth prior, into the scene
representations. Different from direct depth supervision, HGG samples volume
points from local-to-global geometric regions, mitigating the misalignment
caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration
from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of
different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn
the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine
scene representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HG3-NeRF can
outperform other state-of-the-art methods on different standard benchmarks and
achieve high-fidelity synthesis results for sparse view inputs.

<p class="mathjax">Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) employs evolutionary
algorithms to find high-performing neural architectures automatically, and has
achieved great success. However, compared to the empirical success, its
rigorous theoretical analysis has yet to be touched. This work goes preliminary
steps toward the mathematical runtime analysis of ENAS. In particular, we
define a binary classification problem UNIFORM, and formulate an explicit
fitness function to represent the relationship between neural architecture and
classification accuracy. Furthermore, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithm with
mutation to optimize the neural architecture, and obtain the following runtime
bounds: 1) the one-bit mutation finds the optimum in an expected runtime of
$O(n)$ and $\Omega(\log n)$; 2) the multi-bit mutation finds the optimum in an
expected runtime of $\Theta(n)$. These theoretical results show that one-bit
and multi-bit mutations achieve nearly the same performance on UNIFORM. We
provide insight into the choices of mutation in the ENAS community: although
multi-bit mutation can change the step size to prevent a local trap, this may
not always improve runtime. Empirical results also verify the equivalence of
these two mutation operators. This work begins the runtime analysis of ENAS,
laying the foundation for further theoretical studies to guide the design of
ENAS.

<p class="mathjax">Deep learning could be prone to learning shortcuts raised by dataset bias and
result in inaccurate, unreliable, and unfair models, which impedes its adoption
in real-world clinical applications. Despite its significance, there is a
dearth of research in the medical image classification domain to address
dataset bias. Furthermore, the bias labels are often agnostic, as identifying
biases can be laborious and depend on post-hoc interpretation. This paper
proposes learning Adaptive Agreement from a Biased Council (Ada-ABC), a
debiasing framework that does not rely on explicit bias labels to tackle
dataset bias in medical images. Ada-ABC develops a biased council consisting of
multiple classifiers optimized with generalized cross entropy loss to learn the
dataset bias. A debiasing model is then simultaneously trained under the
guidance of the biased council. Specifically, the debiasing model is required
to learn adaptive agreement with the biased council by agreeing on the
correctly predicted samples and disagreeing on the wrongly predicted samples by
the biased council. In this way, the debiasing model could learn the target
attribute on the samples without spurious correlations while also avoiding
ignoring the rich information in samples with spurious correlations. We
theoretically demonstrated that the debiasing model could learn the target
features when the biased model successfully captures dataset bias. Moreover, to
our best knowledge, we constructed the first medical debiasing benchmark from
four datasets containing seven different bias scenarios. Our extensive
experiments practically showed that our proposed Ada-ABC outperformed
competitive approaches, verifying its effectiveness in mitigating dataset bias
for medical image classification. The codes and organized benchmark datasets
will be made publicly available.

<p class="mathjax">Since the development of the conjugate gradient (CG) method in 1952 by
Hestenes and Stiefel, CG, has become an indispensable tool in computational
mathematics for solving positive definite linear systems. On the other hand,
the conjugate residual (CR) method, closely related CG and introduced by
Stiefel in 1955 for the same settings, remains relatively less known outside
the numerical linear algebra community. Since their inception, these methods --
henceforth collectively referred to as conjugate direction methods -- have been
extended beyond positive definite to indefinite, albeit consistent, settings.
Going one step further, in this paper, we investigate theoretical and empirical
properties of these methods under inconsistent systems. Among other things, we
show that small modifications to the original algorithms allow for the
pseudo-inverse solution. Furthermore, we show that CR is essentially equivalent
to the minimum residual method, proposed by Paige and Saunders in 1975, in such
contexts. Lastly, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to shed lights
on their numerical stability (or lack thereof) and their performance for
inconsistent systems. Surprisingly, we will demonstrate that, unlike CR and
contrary to popular belief, CG can exhibit significant numerical instability,
bordering on catastrophe in some instances.

<p class="mathjax">Image-guided robotic interventions represent a transformative frontier in
surgery, blending advanced imaging and robotics for improved precision and
outcomes. This paper addresses the critical need for integrating open-source
platforms to enhance situational awareness in image-guided robotic research. We
present an open-source toolset that seamlessly combines a physics-based
constraint formulation framework, AMBF, with a state-of-the-art imaging
platform application, 3D Slicer. Our toolset facilitates the creation of highly
customizable interactive digital twins, that incorporates processing and
visualization of medical imaging, robot kinematics, and scene dynamics for
real-time robot control. Through a feasibility study, we showcase real-time
synchronization of a physical robotic interventional environment in both 3D
Slicer and AMBF, highlighting low-latency updates and improved visualization.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate 3D object detection in large-scale outdoor scenes, characterized by
considerable variations in object scales, necessitates features rich in both
long-range and fine-grained information. While recent detectors have utilized
window-based transformers to model long-range dependencies, they tend to
overlook fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose MsSVT++, an
innovative Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer that simultaneously captures
both types of information through a divide-and-conquer approach. This approach
involves explicitly dividing attention heads into multiple groups, each
responsible for attending to information within a specific range. The outputs
of these groups are subsequently merged to obtain final mixed-scale features.
To mitigate the computational complexity associated with applying a
window-based transformer in 3D voxel space, we introduce a novel Chessboard
Sampling strategy and implement voxel sampling and gathering operations
sparsely using a hash map. Moreover, an important challenge stems from the
observation that non-empty voxels are primarily located on the surface of
objects, which impedes the accurate estimation of bounding boxes. To overcome
this challenge, we introduce a Center Voting module that integrates newly voted
voxels enriched with mixed-scale contextual information towards the centers of
the objects, thereby improving precise object localization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our single-stage detector, built upon the
foundation of MsSVT++, consistently delivers exceptional performance across
diverse datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation has received increasing
attention due to its low annotation cost. Existing methods mainly rely on Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) to obtain pseudo-labels for training semantic
segmentation models. In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that
long-tailed distribution in training data can cause the CAM calculated through
classifier weights over-activated for head classes and under-activated for tail
classes due to the shared features among head- and tail- classes. This degrades
pseudo-label quality and further influences final semantic segmentation
performance. To address this issue, we propose a Shared Feature Calibration
(SFC) method for CAM generation. Specifically, we leverage the class prototypes
that carry positive shared features and propose a Multi-Scaled
Distribution-Weighted (MSDW) consistency loss for narrowing the gap between the
CAMs generated through classifier weights and class prototypes during training.
The MSDW loss counterbalances over-activation and under-activation by
calibrating the shared features in head-/tail-class classifier weights.
Experimental results show that our SFC significantly improves CAM boundaries
and achieves new state-of-the-art performances. The project is available at
https://github.com/Barrett-python/SFC.

<p class="mathjax">The burgeoning volume of graph data poses significant challenges in storage,
transmission, and particularly the training of graph neural networks (GNNs). To
address these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an innovative
solution. GC focuses on synthesizing a compact yet highly representative graph,
on which GNNs can achieve performance comparable to trained on the large
original graph. The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have
garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey
paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing
research into four categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria:
effectiveness, generalization, fairness, and efficiency. To facilitate an
in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, we examine various methods
under each category and thoroughly discuss two essential components within GC:
optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. Additionally, we
introduce the applications of GC in a variety of fields, and highlight the
present challenges and novel insights in GC, promoting advancements in future
research.

<p class="mathjax">Purpose - Skullbase surgery demands exceptional precision when removing bone
in the lateral skull base. Robotic assistance can alleviate the effect of human
sensory-motor limitations. However, the stiffness and inertia of the robot can
significantly impact the surgeon's perception and control of the tool-to-tissue
interaction forces. Methods - We present a situational-aware, force control
technique aimed at regulating interaction forces during robot-assisted
skullbase drilling. The contextual interaction information derived from the
digital twin environment is used to enhance sensory perception and suppress
undesired high forces. Results - To validate our approach, we conducted initial
feasibility experiments involving a medical and two engineering students. The
experiment focused on further drilling around critical structures following
cortical mastoidectomy. The experiment results demonstrate that robotic
assistance coupled with our proposed control scheme effectively limited
undesired interaction forces when compared to robotic assistance without the
proposed force control. Conclusions - The proposed force control techniques
show promise in significantly reducing undesired interaction forces during
robot-assisted skullbase surgery. These findings contribute to the ongoing
efforts to enhance surgical precision and safety in complex procedures
involving the lateral skull base.

<p class="mathjax">The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought forth an era of
unprecedented connectivity, with an estimated 80 billion smart devices expected
to be in operation by the end of 2025. These devices facilitate a multitude of
smart applications, enhancing the quality of life and efficiency across various
domains. Machine Learning (ML) serves as a crucial technology, not only for
analyzing IoT-generated data but also for diverse applications within the IoT
ecosystem. For instance, ML finds utility in IoT device recognition, anomaly
detection, and even in uncovering malicious activities. This paper embarks on a
comprehensive exploration of the security threats arising from ML's integration
into various facets of IoT, spanning various attack types including membership
inference, adversarial evasion, reconstruction, property inference, model
extraction, and poisoning attacks. Unlike previous studies, our work offers a
holistic perspective, categorizing threats based on criteria such as adversary
models, attack targets, and key security attributes (confidentiality,
availability, and integrity). We delve into the underlying techniques of ML
attacks in IoT environment, providing a critical evaluation of their mechanisms
and impacts. Furthermore, our research thoroughly assesses 65 libraries, both
author-contributed and third-party, evaluating their role in safeguarding model
and data privacy. We emphasize the availability and usability of these
libraries, aiming to arm the community with the necessary tools to bolster
their defenses against the evolving threat landscape. Through our comprehensive
review and analysis, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on
ML-based IoT security, offering valuable insights and practical solutions to
secure ML models and data in the rapidly expanding field of artificial

<p class="mathjax">Few-shot hyperspectral image classification aims to identify the classes of
each pixel in the images by only marking few of these pixels. And in order to
obtain the spatial-spectral joint features of each pixel, the fixed-size
patches centering around each pixel are often used for classification. However,
observing the classification results of existing methods, we found that
boundary patches corresponding to the pixels which are located at the boundary
of the objects in the hyperspectral images, are hard to classify. These
boundary patchs are mixed with multi-class spectral information. Inspired by
this, we propose to augment the prototype network with TransMix for few-shot
hyperspectrial image classification(APNT). While taking the prototype network
as the backbone, it adopts the transformer as feature extractor to learn the
pixel-to-pixel relation and pay different attentions to different pixels. At
the same time, instead of directly using the patches which are cut from the
hyperspectral images for training, it randomly mixs up two patches to imitate
the boundary patches and uses the synthetic patches to train the model, with
the aim to enlarge the number of hard training samples and enhance their
diversity. And by following the data agumentation technique TransMix, the
attention returned by the transformer is also used to mix up the labels of two
patches to generate better labels for synthetic patches. Compared with existing
methods, the proposed method has demonstrated sate of the art performance and
better robustness for few-shot hyperspectral image classification in our
experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Symbols (or more broadly, non-natural language textual representations) such
as numerical sequences, molecular formulas, and table delimiters widely exist,
playing important roles in various tasks such as abstract reasoning, chemical
property prediction, and table question answering. Despite the impressive
natural language comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
their reasoning abilities for symbols remain inadequate, which could attributed
to the difference between symbol representations and general natural languages.
We propose symbol-to-language (S2L), a tuning-free method that enables large
language models to solve symbol-related problems with information expressed in
natural language. Specifically, S2L first converts the symbols involved to
language-based representations, which can be implemented by prompting LLMs or
leveraging external tools, then these language-based representations are
integrated into the original problem via direct substitution or concatenation,
serving as useful input information for LLMs. We evaluate the S2L method using
both API-based (GPT-4, ChatGPT) and open-source (OpenChat) models over eight
symbol-related tasks, ranging from symbol-only abstract reasoning to sentiment
analysis in social media. Experimental results show that S2L consistently leads
to superior performance. For example, by employing S2L for GPT-4, there can be
average significant improvements of +21.9% and +9.5% for subtasks in 1D-ARC and
Dyck language, respectively. Codes and data are available at

<p class="mathjax">When deploying a trained machine learning model in the real world, it is
inevitable to receive inputs from out-of-distribution (OOD) sources. For
instance, in continual learning settings, it is common to encounter OOD samples
due to the non-stationarity of a domain. More generally, when we have access to
a set of test inputs, the existing rich line of OOD detection solutions,
especially the recent promise of distance-based methods, falls short in
effectively utilizing the distribution information from training samples and
test inputs. In this paper, we argue that empirical probability distributions
that incorporate geometric information from both training samples and test
inputs can be highly beneficial for OOD detection in the presence of test
inputs available. To address this, we propose to model OOD detection as a
discrete optimal transport problem. Within the framework of optimal transport,
we propose a novel score function known as the \emph{conditional distribution
entropy} to quantify the uncertainty of a test input being an OOD sample. Our
proposal inherits the merits of certain distance-based methods while
eliminating the reliance on distribution assumptions, a-prior knowledge, and
specific training mechanisms. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms its competitors in OOD
detection.

<p class="mathjax">Network slicing is a key technique in 5G and beyond for efficiently
supporting diverse services. Many network slicing solutions rely on deep
learning to manage complex and high-dimensional resource allocation problems.
However, deep learning models suffer limited generalization and adaptability to
dynamic slicing configurations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that integrates constrained optimization methods and deep learning models,
resulting in strong generalization and superior approximation capability. Based
on the proposed framework, we design a new neural-assisted algorithm to
allocate radio resources to slices to maximize the network utility under
inter-slice resource constraints. The algorithm exhibits high scalability,
accommodating varying numbers of slices and slice configurations with ease. We
implement the proposed solution in a system-level network simulator and
evaluate its performance extensively by comparing it to state-of-the-art
solutions including deep reinforcement learning approaches. The numerical
results show that our solution obtains near-optimal quality-of-service
satisfaction and promising generalization performance under different network
slicing scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Colorectal polyp segmentation (CPS), an essential problem in medical image
analysis, has garnered growing research attention. Recently, the deep
learning-based model completely overwhelmed traditional methods in the field of
CPS, and more and more deep CPS methods have emerged, bringing the CPS into the
deep learning era. To help the researchers quickly grasp the main techniques,
datasets, evaluation metrics, challenges, and trending of deep CPS, this paper
presents a systematic and comprehensive review of deep-learning-based CPS
methods from 2014 to 2023, a total of 115 technical papers. In particular, we
first provide a comprehensive review of the current deep CPS with a novel
taxonomy, including network architectures, level of supervision, and learning
paradigm. More specifically, network architectures include eight subcategories,
the level of supervision comprises six subcategories, and the learning paradigm
encompasses 12 subcategories, totaling 26 subcategories. Then, we provided a
comprehensive analysis the characteristics of each dataset, including the
number of datasets, annotation types, image resolution, polyp size, contrast
values, and polyp location. Following that, we summarized CPS's commonly used
evaluation metrics and conducted a detailed analysis of 40 deep SOTA models,
including out-of-distribution generalization and attribute-based performance
analysis. Finally, we discussed deep learning-based CPS methods' main
challenges and opportunities.

<p class="mathjax">For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry point
to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as
mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user
onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based
applications.
<br />We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued
by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g. Google,
Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a
signature scheme allowing the signer to \textit{sign using their existing
OpenID accounts} and nothing else. This improves the user experience
significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their
existing accounts.
<br />zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. By design, zkLogin
builds on top of the underlying platform's authentication mechanisms, and
derives its security from there. Unlike prior related works however, zkLogin
avoids the use of additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or
oracles) for its security guarantees. zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKP) to ensure that the link between a user's off-chain and on-chain
identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.
<br />We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an
alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease
of web3 on-boarding just with social login, without requiring mnemonics, many
hundreds of thousands zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various
industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, ride
sharing, sports racing and many more.

<p class="mathjax">Health management has become a primary problem as new kinds of diseases and
complex symptoms are introduced to a rapidly growing modern society. Building a
better and smarter healthcare infrastructure is one of the ultimate goals of a
smart city. To the best of our knowledge, neural network models are already
employed to assist healthcare professionals in achieving this goal. Typically,
training a neural network requires a rich amount of data but heterogeneous and
vulnerable properties of clinical data introduce a challenge for the
traditional centralized network. Moreover, adding new inputs to a medical
database requires re-training an existing model from scratch. To tackle these
challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system
trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm. We focused on a novel
strategy to guarantee the safety of patient privacy and overcome the risk of
cyberattacks while enabling large-scale clinical data mining. As a result, we
can leverage rich clinical data for training each local neural network without
the need for exchanging the confidential data of patients. Moreover, we
implemented the proposed scheme as a sequence-to-sequence model architecture
integrating the attention mechanism. Thus, our objective is to provide a
personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable characteristics
that can deliver accurate solutions and assist healthcare professionals in
medical diagnosing.

<p class="mathjax">The fractal dimension of a surface allows its degree of roughness to be
characterised quantitatively. However, limited effort has been attempted to
compute the fractal dimension of surfaces computed from precisely known atomic
coordinates from computational biomolecular and nanomaterial studies. This work
proposes methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the surface of any
three-dimensional object composed of spheres, by representing it as either a
voxelised point cloud or a mathematically exact surface, and computing its
box-counting dimension. Sphractal is published as a Python package that
provides these functionalities, and its utility is demonstrated on a set of
simulated palladium nanoparticle data.

<p class="mathjax">Noisy labels, inevitably existing in pseudo segmentation labels generated
from weak object-level annotations, severely hampers model optimization for
semantic segmentation. Previous works often rely on massive hand-crafted losses
and carefully-tuned hyper-parameters to resist noise, suffering poor
generalization capability and high model complexity. Inspired by recent
advances in meta learning, we argue that rather than struggling to tolerate
noise hidden behind clean labels passively, a more feasible solution would be
to find out the noisy regions actively, so as to simply ignore them during
model optimization. With this in mind, this work presents a novel meta learning
based semantic segmentation method, MetaSeg, that comprises a primary
content-aware meta-net (CAM-Net) to sever as a noise indicator for an arbitrary
segmentation model counterpart. Specifically, CAM-Net learns to generate
pixel-wise weights to suppress noisy regions with incorrect pseudo labels while
highlighting clean ones by exploiting hybrid strengthened features from image
content, providing straightforward and reliable guidance for optimizing the
segmentation model. Moreover, to break the barrier of time-consuming training
when applying meta learning to common large segmentation models, we further
present a new decoupled training strategy that optimizes different model layers
in a divide-and-conquer manner. Extensive experiments on object, medical,
remote sensing and human segmentation shows that our method achieves superior
performance, approaching that of fully supervised settings, which paves a new
promising way for omni-supervised semantic segmentation.

<p class="mathjax">Diffusion models have recently received increasing research attention for
their remarkable transfer abilities in semantic segmentation tasks. However,
generating fine-grained segmentation masks with diffusion models often requires
additional training on annotated datasets, leaving it unclear to what extent
pre-trained diffusion models alone understand the semantic relations of their
generated images. To address this question, we leverage the semantic knowledge
extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and aim to develop an image segmentor
capable of generating fine-grained segmentation maps without any additional
training. The primary difficulty stems from the fact that semantically
meaningful feature maps typically exist only in the spatially lower-dimensional
layers, which poses a challenge in directly extracting pixel-level semantic
relations from these feature maps. To overcome this issue, our framework
identifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations
of low-dimensional feature maps by exploiting SD's generation process and
utilizes them for constructing image-resolution segmentation maps. In extensive
experiments, the produced segmentation maps are demonstrated to be well
delineated and capture detailed parts of the images, indicating the existence
of highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the cross-modal pretraining model has been employed to produce
meaningful pseudo-labels to supervise the training of an image clustering
model. However, numerous erroneous alignments in a cross-modal pre-training
model could produce poor-quality pseudo-labels and degrade clustering
performance. To solve the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel
\textbf{Multi-level Cross-modal Alignment} method to improve the alignments in
a cross-modal pretraining model for downstream tasks, by building a smaller but
better semantic space and aligning the images and texts in three levels, i.e.,
instance-level, prototype-level, and semantic-level. Theoretical results show
that our proposed method converges, and suggests effective means to reduce the
expected clustering risk of our method. Experimental results on five benchmark
datasets clearly show the superiority of our new method.

<p class="mathjax">"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants," Isaac
Newton's renowned statement hints that new knowledge builds upon existing
foundations, which means there exists an interdependent relationship between
knowledge, which, yet uncovered, is implied in the historical development of
scientific systems for hundreds of years. By leveraging natural language
processing techniques, this study introduces an innovative embedding scheme
designed to infer the "knowledge interlocking map." This map, derived from the
research trajectories of millions of scholars, reveals the intricate
connections among knowledge. We validate that the inferred map effectively
delineates disciplinary boundaries and captures the intricate relationships
between diverse concepts. The utility of the interlocking map is showcased
through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy
inferences within the knowledge space and the functional connectivity between
concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we trace the evolution of
knowledge across domains, observing trends such as shifts from "Theoretical" to
"Applied" or "Chemistry" to "Biomedical" along predefined functional
directions. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network
structure, we found that knowledge connects each other with shorter global
pathways, and the interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in
accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel
approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific
literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific
development patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and
accelerating scientific progress.

<p class="mathjax">Deep gradient inversion attacks expose a serious threat to Federated Learning
(FL) by accurately recovering private data from shared gradients. However, the
state-of-the-art heavily relies on impractical assumptions to access excessive
auxiliary data, which violates the basic data partitioning principle of FL. In
this paper, a novel method, Gradient Inversion Attack using Practical Image
Prior (GI-PIP), is proposed under a revised threat model. GI-PIP exploits
anomaly detection models to capture the underlying distribution from fewer
data, while GAN-based methods consume significant more data to synthesize
images. The extracted distribution is then leveraged to regulate the attack
process as Anomaly Score loss. Experimental results show that GI-PIP achieves a
16.12 dB PSNR recovery using only 3.8\% data of ImageNet, while GAN-based
methods necessitate over 70\%. Moreover, GI-PIP exhibits superior capability on
distribution generalization compared to GAN-based methods. Our approach
significantly alleviates the auxiliary data requirement on both amount and
distribution in gradient inversion attacks, hence posing more substantial
threat to real-world FL.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has attracted significant attention
as a distributed framework based on graph neural networks, primarily due to its
capability to break data silos. Existing FGL studies employ community split on
the homophilous global graph by default to simulate federated semi-supervised
node classification settings. Such a strategy assumes the consistency of
topology between the multi-client subgraphs and the global graph, where
connected nodes are highly likely to possess similar feature distributions and
the same label. However, in real-world implementations, the varying
perspectives of local data engineering result in various subgraph topologies,
posing unique heterogeneity challenges in FGL. Unlike the well-known label
Non-independent identical distribution (Non-iid) problems in federated
learning, FGL heterogeneity essentially reveals the topological divergence
among multiple clients, namely homophily or heterophily. To simulate and handle
this unique challenge, we introduce the concept of structure Non-iid split and
then present a new paradigm called \underline{Ada}ptive \underline{F}ederated
\underline{G}raph \underline{L}earning (AdaFGL), a decoupled two-step
personalized approach. To begin with, AdaFGL employs standard multi-client
federated collaborative training to acquire the federated knowledge extractor
by aggregating uploaded models in the final round at the server. Then, each
client conducts personalized training based on the local subgraph and the
federated knowledge extractor. Extensive experiments on the 12 graph benchmark
datasets validate the superior performance of AdaFGL over state-of-the-art
baselines. Specifically, in terms of test accuracy, our proposed AdaFGL
outperforms baselines by significant margins of 3.24\% and 5.57\% on community
split and structure Non-iid split, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Pairwise matching cost aggregation is a crucial step for modern
learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS). Prior works adopt an early aggregation
scheme, which adds up pairwise costs into an intermediate cost. However, we
analyze that this process can degrade informative pairwise matchings, thereby
blocking the depth network from fully utilizing the original geometric matching
cues.To address this challenge, we present a late aggregation approach that
allows for aggregating pairwise costs throughout the network feed-forward
process, achieving accurate estimations with only minor changes of the plain
CasMVSNet.Instead of building an intermediate cost by weighted sum, late
aggregation preserves all pairwise costs along a distinct view channel. This
enables the succeeding depth network to fully utilize the crucial geometric
cues without loss of cost fidelity. Grounded in the new aggregation scheme, we
propose further techniques addressing view order dependence inside the
preserved cost, handling flexible testing views, and improving the depth
filtering process. Despite its technical simplicity, our method improves
significantly upon the baseline cascade-based approach, achieving comparable
results with state-of-the-art methods with favorable computation overhead.

<p class="mathjax">Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with
extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher
categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In
this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all
essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched
categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a
Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to
construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge Organization (KO) and Knowledge Representation (KR) have been the
two mainstream methodologies of knowledge modelling in the Information Science
community and the Artificial Intelligence community, respectively. The
facet-analytical tradition of KO has developed an exhaustive set of guiding
canons for ensuring quality in organising and managing knowledge but has
remained limited in terms of technology-driven activities to expand its scope
and services beyond the bibliographic universe of knowledge. KR, on the other
hand, boasts of a robust ecosystem of technologies and technology-driven
service design which can be tailored to model any entity or scale to any
service in the entire universe of knowledge. This paper elucidates both the
facet-analytical KO and KR methodologies in detail and provides a functional
mapping between them. Out of the mapping, the paper proposes an integrated
KR-enriched KO methodology with all the standard components of a KO methodology
plus the advanced technologies provided by the KR approach. The practical
benefits of the methodological integration has been exemplified through the
flagship application of the Digital University at the University of Trento,
Italy.

<p class="mathjax">Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm
that enables collaborative training on large-scale subgraphs across multiple
local systems. Existing FGL studies fall into two categories: (i) FGL
Optimization, which improves multi-client training in existing machine learning
models; (ii) FGL Model, which enhances performance with complex local models
and multi-client interactions. However, most FGL optimization strategies are
designed specifically for the computer vision domain and ignore graph
structure, presenting dissatisfied performance and slow convergence. Meanwhile,
complex local model architectures in FGL Models studies lack scalability for
handling large-scale subgraphs and have deployment limitations. To address
these issues, we propose Federated Graph Topology-aware Aggregation (FedGTA), a
personalized optimization strategy that optimizes through topology-aware local
smoothing confidence and mixed neighbor features. During experiments, we deploy
FedGTA in 12 multi-scale real-world datasets with the Louvain and Metis split.
This allows us to evaluate the performance and robustness of FedGTA across a
range of scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGTA achieves
state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting high scalability and efficiency.
The experiment includes ogbn-papers100M, the most representative large-scale
graph database so that we can verify the applicability of our method to
large-scale graph learning. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the
first to bridge large-scale graph learning with FGL using this optimization
strategy, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable FGL
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Information acquisition from target perception represents the key enabling
technology of the Internet of Automatic Vehicles (IoAV), which is essential for
the decision-making and control operation of connected automatic vehicles
(CAVs). Exploring target information involves multiple operations on data,
e.g., wireless sensing (for data acquisition), communication (for data
transmission), and computing (for data analysis), which all rely on the
consumption of time-space-frequency-computing (TSFC) multi-domain resources.
Due to the coupled resource sharing of sensing, communication, and computing
procedures, the resource management of information-oriented IoAV is commonly
formulated as a non-convex NP-hard problem. In this article, further combining
the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and computing, we introduce the
integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC), wherein the TSFC
resources are decoupled from the specific processes and shared universally
among sensing, communication, and computing processes. Furthermore, the
information-oriented resource trading platform (IRTP) is established, which
transforms the problem of ISCC resource management into a resource-information
substitution model. Finally, we embed the employment topology structure in IoAV
into neural network architecture, taking advantage of the graph neural network
(GNN) and multi-worker reinforcement learning, and propose the dynamic resource
management strategy based on the asynchronous advantage GNN (A2GNN) algorithm,
which can achieve the convergence both of information gain maximization and
resource consumption minimization, realizing efficient information-oriented
resource management.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid advancement of AI applications, the growing needs for data
privacy and model robustness have highlighted the importance of machine
unlearning, especially in thriving graph-based scenarios. However, most
existing graph unlearning strategies primarily rely on well-designed
architectures or manual process, rendering them less user-friendly and posing
challenges in terms of deployment efficiency. Furthermore, striking a balance
between unlearning performance and framework generalization is also a pivotal
concern. To address the above issues, we propose \underline{\textbf{M}}utual
\underline{\textbf{E}}volution \underline{\textbf{G}}raph
\underline{\textbf{U}}nlearning (MEGU), a new mutual evolution paradigm that
simultaneously evolves the predictive and unlearning capacities of graph
unlearning. By incorporating aforementioned two components, MEGU ensures
complementary optimization in a unified training framework that aligns with the
prediction and unlearning requirements. Extensive experiments on 9 graph
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MEGU in addressing
unlearning requirements at the feature, node, and edge levels. Specifically,
MEGU achieves average performance improvements of 2.7\%, 2.5\%, and 3.2\%
across these three levels of unlearning tasks when compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Furthermore, MEGU exhibits satisfactory training efficiency,
reducing time and space overhead by an average of 159.8x and 9.6x,
respectively, in comparison to retraining GNN from scratch.

<p class="mathjax">Recently, the paradigm of massive ultra-reliable low-latency IoT
communications (URLLC-IoT) has gained growing interest. Reliable delay-critical
uplink transmission in IoT is a challenging task since low-complex devices
typically do not support multiple antennas or demanding signal processing
tasks. However, in many IoT services the data volumes are small and deployments
may include massive number of devices. We consider on a clustered uplink
transmission with two cooperation approaches: First, we focus on scenario where
location-based channel knowledge map (CKM) is applied to enable cooperation.
Second, we consider a scenario where scarce channel side-information is applied
in transmission. In both scenarios we also model and analyse the impact of
erroneous information. In the performance evaluation we apply the recently
introduced data-oriented approach that has gathered significant attention in
the context of short-packet transmissions. Specifically, it introduces a
transient performance metric for small data transmissions, where the amount of
data and available bandwidth play crucial roles. Results show that cooperation
between clustered IoT devices may provide notable benefits in terms of
increased range. It is noticed that the performance is heavily depending on the
strength of the static channel component in the CKM based cooperation. The
channel side-information based cooperation is robust against changes in the
radio environment but sensitive to possible errors in the channel
side-information. Even with large IoT device clusters, side-information errors
may set a limit for the use of services assuming high-reliability and
low-latency. Analytic results are verified against simulations, showing only
minor differences at low probability levels.

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in technologies, such as the 'deepfake' technique, have
paved the way for the generation of various media forgeries. In response to the
potential hazards of these media forgeries, many researchers engage in
exploring detection methods, increasing the demand for high-quality media
forgery datasets. Despite this, existing datasets have certain limitations.
Firstly, most of datasets focus on the manipulation of visual modality and
usually lack diversity, as only a few forgery approaches are considered.
Secondly, the quality of media is often inadequate in clarity and naturalness.
Meanwhile, the size of the dataset is also limited. Thirdly, while many
real-world forgeries are driven by identity, the identity information of the
subject in media is frequently neglected. For detection, identity information
could be an essential clue to boost accuracy. Moreover, official media
concerning certain identities on the Internet can serve as prior knowledge,
aiding both the audience and forgery detectors in determining the true
identity. Therefore, we propose an identity-driven multimedia forgery dataset,
IDForge, which contains 249,138 video shots. All video shots are sourced from
324 wild videos collected of 54 celebrities from the Internet. The fake video
shots involve 9 types of manipulation across visual, audio and textual
modalities. Additionally, IDForge provides extra 214,438 real video shots as a
reference set for the 54 celebrities. Correspondingly, we design an effective
multimedia detection network, Reference-assisted Multimodal Forgery Detection
Network (R-MFDN). Through extensive experiments on the proposed dataset, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MFDN on the multimedia detection task.

<p class="mathjax">Concealed object segmentation (COS) is a challenging task that involves
localizing and segmenting those concealed objects that are visually blended
with their surrounding environments. Despite achieving remarkable success,
existing COS segmenters still struggle to achieve complete segmentation results
in extremely concealed scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical
Coherence Modeling (HCM) segmenter for COS, aiming to address this incomplete
segmentation limitation. In specific, HCM promotes feature coherence by
leveraging the intra-stage coherence and cross-stage coherence modules,
exploring feature correlations at both the single-stage and contextual levels.
Additionally, we introduce the reversible re-calibration decoder to detect
previously undetected parts in low-confidence regions, resulting in further
enhancing segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three
COS tasks, including camouflaged object detection, polyp image segmentation,
and transparent object detection, demonstrate the promising results achieved by
the proposed HCM segmenter.

<p class="mathjax">Property prediction is a fundamental task in crystal material research. To
model atoms and structures, structures represented as graphs are widely used
and graph learning-based methods have achieved significant progress. Bond
angles and bond distances are two key structural information that greatly
influence crystal properties. However, most of the existing works only consider
bond distances and overlook bond angles. The main challenge lies in the time
cost of handling bond angles, which leads to a significant increase in
inference time. To solve this issue, we first propose a crystal structure
modeling based on dual scale neighbor partitioning mechanism, which uses a
larger scale cutoff for edge neighbors and a smaller scale cutoff for angle
neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Atom-Distance-Angle Graph Neural Network
(ADA-GNN) for property prediction tasks, which can process node information and
structural information separately. The accuracy of predictions and inference
time are improved with the dual scale modeling and the specially designed
architecture of ADA-GNN. The experimental results validate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art results in two large-scale material benchmark
datasets on property prediction tasks.

<p class="mathjax">Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are limited to undirected graphs,
whose restricted scope of the captured relational information hinders their
expressive capabilities and deployments in real-world scenarios. Compared with
undirected graphs, directed graphs (digraphs) fit the demand for modeling more
complex topological systems by capturing more intricate relationships between
nodes, such as formulating transportation and financial networks. While some
directed GNNs have been introduced, their inspiration mainly comes from deep
learning architectures, which lead to redundant complexity and computation,
making them inapplicable to large-scale databases. To address these issues, we
propose LightDiC, a scalable variant of the digraph convolution based on the
magnetic Laplacian. Since topology-related computations are conducted solely
during offline pre-processing, LightDiC achieves exceptional scalability,
enabling downstream predictions to be trained separately without incurring
recursive computational costs. Theoretical analysis shows that LightDiC
utilizes directed information to achieve message passing based on the complex
field, which corresponds to the proximal gradient descent process of the
Dirichlet energy optimization function from the perspective of digraph signal
denoising, ensuring its expressiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that
LightDiC performs comparably well or even outperforms other SOTA methods in
various downstream tasks, with fewer learnable parameters and higher training
efficiency. Notably, LightDiC is the first DiGNN to provide satisfactory
results in the most representative large-scale database (ogbn-papers100M).

<p class="mathjax">Given an image and a natural language expression as input, the goal of
referring image segmentation is to segment the foreground masks of the entities
referred by the expression. Existing methods mainly focus on interactive
learning between vision and language to enhance the multi-modal representations
for global context reasoning. However, predicting directly in pixel-level space
can lead to collapsed positioning and poor segmentation results. Its main
challenge lies in how to explicitly model entity localization, especially for
non-salient entities. In this paper, we tackle this problem by executing a
Collaborative Position Reasoning Network (CPRN) via the proposed novel
Row-and-Column interactive (RoCo) and Guided Holistic interactive (Holi)
modules. Specifically, RoCo aggregates the visual features into the row- and
column-wise features corresponding two directional axes respectively. It offers
a fine-grained matching behavior that perceives the associations between the
linguistic features and two decoupled visual features to perform position
reasoning over a hierarchical space. Holi integrates features of the two
modalities by a cross-modal attention mechanism, which suppresses the
irrelevant redundancy under the guide of positioning information from RoCo.
Thus, with the incorporation of RoCo and Holi modules, CPRN captures the visual
details of position reasoning so that the model can achieve more accurate
segmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly focuses
on position reasoning modeling. We also validate the proposed method on three
evaluation datasets. It consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

<p class="mathjax">The ongoing connection and automation of vehicles leads to a closer
interaction of the individual vehicle components, which demands for
consideration throughout the entire development process. In the design phase,
this is achieved through co-simulation of component models. However, complex
co-simulation environments are rarely (re-)used in the verification and
validation phases, in which mixed real-virtual prototypes (e.g.
Hardware-in-the-Loop) are already available. One reason for this are coupling
errors such as time-delays, which inevitably occur in co-simulation of virtual
and real-time systems, and which influence system behavior in an unknown and
generally detrimental way. This contribution introduces a novel, adaptive
method to compensate for constant time-delays in potentially highly nonlinear,
spatially distributed mixed real-virtual prototypes, using small feedforward
neural networks. Their optimal initialization with respect to defined frequency
domain features results from a-priori frequency domain analysis of the entire
coupled system, including coupling faults and compensation methods. A linear
and a nonlinear example demonstrate the method and emphasize its suitability
for nonlinear systems due to online training and adaptation. As the
compensation method requires knowledge only of the bandwidths, the proposed
method is applicable to distributed mixed real-virtual prototypes in general.

<p class="mathjax">Estimating 3D full-body pose from sparse sensor data is a pivotal technique
employed for the reconstruction of realistic human motions in Augmented Reality
and Virtual Reality. However, translating sparse sensor signals into
comprehensive human motion remains a challenge since the sparsely distributed
sensors in common VR systems fail to capture the motion of full human body. In
this paper, we use well-designed Body Pose Graph (BPG) to represent the human
body and translate the challenge into a prediction problem of graph missing
nodes. Then, we propose a novel full-body motion reconstruction framework based
on BPG. To establish BPG, nodes are initially endowed with features extracted
from sparse sensor signals. Features from identifiable joint nodes across
diverse sensors are amalgamated and processed from both temporal and spatial
perspectives. Temporal dynamics are captured using the Temporal Pyramid
Structure, while spatial relations in joint movements inform the spatial
attributes. The resultant features serve as the foundational elements of the
BPG nodes. To further refine the BPG, node features are updated through a graph
neural network that incorporates edge reflecting varying joint relations. Our
method's effectiveness is evidenced by the attained state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in lower body motion, outperforming other baseline
methods. Additionally, an ablation study validates the efficacy of each module
in our proposed framework.

the corresponding eigenvector of a symmetric positive definite matrix pencil.
We reveal implicit convexity of the eigenvalue problem in Euclidean space. A
provable accelerated eigensolver based on preconditioning and implicit
convexity (EPIC) is proposed. Theoretical analysis shows the acceleration of
EPIC with the rate of convergence resembling the expected rate of convergence
of the well-known locally optimal preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOPCG). A
complete proof of the expected rate of convergence of LOPCG is elusive so far.
Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings of EPIC.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, a particle method is used to approximate the solutions of a
"fluid-like" macroscopic traffic flow model for automated vehicles. It is shown
that this method preserves certain differential inequalities that hold for the
macroscopic traffic model: mass is preserved, the mechanical energy is decaying
and an energy functional is also decaying. To demonstrate the advantages of the
particle method under consideration, a comparison with other numerical methods
for viscous compressible fluid models is provided. Since the solutions of the
macroscopic traffic model can be approximated by the solutions of a reduced
model consisting of a single nonlinear heat-type partial differential equation,
the numerical solutions produced by the particle method are also compared with
the numerical solutions of the reduced model. Finally, a traffic simulation
scenario and a comparison with the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model are provided,
illustrating the advantages of the use of automated vehicles.

<p class="mathjax">It is well known that for singular inconsistent range-symmetric linear
systems, the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method determines a least
squares solution without breakdown. The reached least squares solution may be
or not be the pseudoinverse solution. We show that a lift strategy can be used
to obtain the pseudoinverse solution. In addition, we propose a new iterative
method named RSMAR (minimum $\mathbf A$-residual) for range-symmetric linear
systems $\mathbf A\mathbf x=\mathbf b$. At step $k$ RSMAR minimizes $\|\mathbf
A\mathbf r_k\|$ in the $k$th Krylov subspace generated with $\{\mathbf A,
\mathbf r_0\}$ rather than $\|\mathbf r_k\|$, where $\mathbf r_k$ is the $k$th
residual vector and $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the Euclidean vector norm. We show that
RSMAR and GMRES terminate with the same least squares solution when applied to
range-symmetric linear systems. We provide two implementations for RSMAR. Our
numerical experiments show that RSMAR is the most suitable method among
GMRES-type methods for singular inconsistent range-symmetric linear systems.

<p class="mathjax">Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) aims to train segmentation
models using training image data with only image-level supervision. Since
precise pixel-level annotations are not accessible, existing methods typically
focus on producing pseudo masks for training segmentation models by refining
CAM-like heatmaps. However, the produced heatmaps may only capture
discriminative image regions of target object categories or the associated
co-occurring backgrounds. To address the issues, we propose a Semantic Prompt
Learning for WSSS (SemPLeS) framework, which learns to effectively prompt the
CLIP space to enhance the semantic alignment between the segmented regions and
the target object categories. More specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt
Learning and Class-associated Semantic Refinement to learn the prompts that
adequately describe and suppress the image backgrounds associated with each
target object category. In this way, our proposed framework is able to perform
better semantic matching between object regions and the associated text labels,
resulting in desired pseudo masks for training the segmentation model. The
proposed SemPLeS framework achieves SOTA performance on the standard WSSS
benchmarks, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, and demonstrated interpretability with the
semantic visualization of our learned prompts. The codes will be released.

<p class="mathjax">An intelligent driving system should be capable of dynamically formulating
appropriate driving strategies based on the current environment and vehicle
status, while ensuring the security and reliability of the system. However,
existing methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning suffer
from low safety, poor generalization, and inefficient sampling. Additionally,
they cannot accurately predict future driving trajectories, and the accurate
prediction of future driving trajectories is a precondition for making optimal
decisions. To solve these problems, in this paper, we introduce a Safe and
Generalized end-to-end Autonomous Driving System (SGADS) for complex and
various scenarios. Our SGADS incorporates variational inference with
normalizing flows, enabling the intelligent vehicle to accurately predict
future driving trajectories. Moreover, we propose the formulation of robust
safety constraints. Furthermore, we combine reinforcement learning with
demonstrations to augment search process of the agent. The experimental results
demonstrate that our SGADS can significantly improve safety performance,
exhibit strong generalization, and enhance the training efficiency of
intelligent vehicles in complex urban scenarios compared to existing methods.

<p class="mathjax">Density-equalizing maps are a class of mapping methods in which the shape
deformation is driven by prescribed density information. In recent years, they
have been widely used for data visualization on planar domains and planar
parameterization of open surfaces. However, the theory and computation of
density-equalizing maps for closed surfaces are much less explored. In this
work, we develop a novel method for computing spherical density-equalizing maps
for genus-0 closed surfaces. Specifically, we first compute a conformal
parameterization of the given genus-0 closed surface onto the unit sphere.
Then, we perform density equalization on the spherical domain based on the
given density information to achieve a spherical density-equalizing map. The
bijectivity of the mapping is guaranteed using quasi-conformal theory. We
further propose a method for incorporating the harmonic energy and landmark
constraints into our formulation to achieve landmark-aligned spherical
density-equalizing maps balancing different distortion measures. Using the
proposed methods, a large variety of spherical parameterizations can be
achieved. Applications to surface registration, remeshing, and data
visualization are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

<p class="mathjax">Explainable artificial intelligence techniques are becoming increasingly
important with the rise of deep learning applications in various domains. These
techniques aim to provide a better understanding of complex "black box" models
and enhance user trust while maintaining high learning performance. While many
studies have focused on explaining deep learning models in computer vision for
image input, video explanations remain relatively unexplored due to the
temporal dimension's complexity. In this paper, we present a unified framework
for local agnostic explanations in the video domain. Our contributions include:
(1) Extending a fine-grained explanation framework tailored for computer vision
data, (2) Adapting six existing explanation techniques to work on video data by
incorporating temporal information and enabling local explanations, and (3)
Conducting an evaluation and comparison of the adapted explanation methods
using different models and datasets. We discuss the possibilities and choices
involved in the removal-based explanation process for visual data. The
adaptation of six explanation methods for video is explained, with comparisons
to existing approaches. We evaluate the performance of the methods using
automated metrics and user-based evaluation, showing that 3D RISE, 3D LIME, and
3D Kernel SHAP outperform other methods. By decomposing the explanation process
into manageable steps, we facilitate the study of each choice's impact and
allow for further refinement of explanation methods to suit specific datasets

<p class="mathjax">Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation
time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural
network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs.
Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering
efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the
significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data,
we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution
time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost
function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using
distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its
accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation,
incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable
the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a
challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than
considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an
algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores,
addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the
network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our
proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results
indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of
the teacher, even with the retention of only $3\%$ of network parameters.

<p class="mathjax">Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) poses the challenge of identifying
relationships between entities within a document as opposed to the traditional
RE setting where a single sentence is input. Existing approaches rely on
logical reasoning or contextual cues from entities. This paper reframes
document-level RE as link prediction over a knowledge graph with distinct
benefits: 1) Our approach combines entity context with document-derived logical
reasoning, enhancing link prediction quality. 2) Predicted links between
entities offer interpretability, elucidating employed reasoning. We evaluate
our approach on three benchmark datasets: DocRED, ReDocRED, and DWIE. The
results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
models and suggests that incorporating context-based link prediction techniques
can enhance the performance of document-level relation extraction models.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we investigate the problem of simultaneous blind demixing and
super-resolution. Leveraging the subspace assumption regarding unknown point
spread functions, this problem can be reformulated as a low-rank matrix
demixing problem. We propose a convex recovery approach that utilizes the
low-rank structure of each vectorized Hankel matrix associated with the target
matrix. Our analysis reveals that for achieving exact recovery, the number of
samples needs to satisfy the condition $n\gtrsim Ksr \log (sn)$. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate the recovery capabilities and the computational

<p class="mathjax">The safe integration of machine learning modules in decision-making processes
hinges on their ability to quantify uncertainty. A popular technique to achieve
this goal is conformal prediction (CP), which transforms an arbitrary base
predictor into a set predictor with coverage guarantees. While CP certifies the
predicted set to contain the target quantity with a user-defined tolerance, it
does not provide control over the average size of the predicted sets, i.e.,
over the informativeness of the prediction. In this work, a theoretical
connection is established between the generalization properties of the base
predictor and the informativeness of the resulting CP prediction sets. To this
end, an upper bound is derived on the expected size of the CP set predictor
that builds on generalization error bounds for the base predictor. The derived
upper bound provides insights into the dependence of the average size of the CP
set predictor on the amount of calibration data, the target reliability, and
the generalization performance of the base predictor. The theoretical insights
are validated using simple numerical regression and classification tasks.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, a finite deformation phase-field formulation is developed to
investigate the effect of hygrothermal conditions on the
viscoelastic-viscoplastic fracture behavior of epoxy nanocomposites under
cyclic loading. The formulation incorporates a definition of the Helmholtz free
energy, which considers the effect of nanoparticles, moisture content, and
temperature. The free energy is additively decomposed into a deviatoric
equilibrium, a deviatoric non-equilibrium, and a volumetric contribution, with
distinct definitions for tension and compression. The proposed derivation
offers a realistic modeling of damage and viscoplasticity mechanisms in the
nanocomposites by coupling the phase-field damage model with a modified crack
driving force and a viscoelastic-viscoplastic model. Numerical simulations are
conducted to study the cyclic force-displacement response of both dry and
saturated boehmite nanoparticle (BNP)/epoxy samples, considering BNP contents
and temperature. Comparing numerical results with experimental data shows good
agreement at various BNP contents. In addition, the predictive capability of
the phase-field model is evaluated through simulations of single-edge notched
nanocomposite plates subjected to monolithic tensile and shear loading.

<p class="mathjax">This paper presents an annotated dataset of brain MRI images designed to
advance the field of brain symmetry study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
gained interest in analyzing brain symmetry in neonatal infants, and challenges
remain due to the vast size differences between fetal and adult brains.
Classification methods for brain structural MRI use scales and visual cues to
assess hemisphere symmetry, which can help diagnose neonatal patients by
comparing hemispheres and anatomical regions of interest in the brain. Using
the Developing Human Connectome Project dataset, this work presents a dataset
comprising cerebral images extracted as slices across selected portions of
interest for clinical evaluation . All the extracted images are annotated with
the brain's midline. All the extracted images are annotated with the brain's
midline. From the assumption that a decrease in symmetry is directly related to
possible clinical pathologies, the dataset can contribute to a more precise
diagnosis because it can be used to train deep learning model application in
neonatal cerebral MRI anomaly detection from postnatal infant scans thanks to
computer vision. Such models learn to identify and classify anomalies by
identifying potential asymmetrical patterns in medical MRI images. Furthermore,
this dataset can contribute to the research and development of methods using
the relative symmetry of the two brain hemispheres for crucial diagnosis and
treatment planning.

<p class="mathjax">Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for
large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce
the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far,
which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely
eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is
impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal
world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable
LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning
theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will
therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real
world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for
real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time
complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate
our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible
mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the
practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">Learning effective joint representations has been a central task in
multimodal sentiment analysis. Previous methods focus on leveraging the
correlations between different modalities and enhancing performance through
sophisticated fusion techniques. However, challenges still exist due to the
inherent heterogeneity of distinct modalities, which may lead to distributional
gap, impeding the full exploitation of inter-modal information and resulting in
redundancy and impurity in the information extracted from features. To address
this problem, we introduce the Multimodal Information Disentanglement (MInD)
approach. MInD decomposes the multimodal inputs into a modality-invariant
component, a modality-specific component, and a remnant noise component for
each modality through a shared encoder and multiple private encoders. The
shared encoder aims to explore the shared information and commonality across
modalities, while the private encoders are deployed to capture the distinctive
information and characteristic features. These representations thus furnish a
comprehensive perspective of the multimodal data, facilitating the fusion
process instrumental for subsequent prediction tasks. Furthermore, MInD
improves the learned representations by explicitly modeling the task-irrelevant
noise in an adversarial manner. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark
datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and UR-Funny, demonstrate MInD's
superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both multimodal
emotion recognition and multimodal humor detection tasks.

emerging fluid antenna (FA) technology. In particular, a single-antenna source
sends information to a FA reader through the wireless forward (i.e.,
source-to-tag) and backscatter (tag-to-reader) channels. For the considered BC,
we first derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the equivalent
channel at the FA receiver, and then we obtain closed-form expressions of the
outage probability (OP) and delay outage rate (DOR) under a correlated Rayleigh

<p class="mathjax">Over the last years, there has been a change of perspective concerning the
management of information systems, since they are no longer isolated and need
to communicate with others. However, from a semantic point of view, real
communication is difficult to achieve due to the heterogeneity of the systems.
We present a proposal which, considering information systems are represented by
software agents, provides a framework that favours a semantic communication
among them, overcoming the heterogeneity of their agent communication
languages. The main components of the framework are a suite of ontologies --
conceptualizing communication acts -- that will be used for generating the
communication conversion, and an Event Calculus interpretation of the
communications, which will be used for formalizing the notion of a satisfactory
conversion. Moreover, we present a motivating example in order to complete the
explanation of the whole picture.

<p class="mathjax">Knowledge distillation has emerged as a highly effective method for bridging
the representation discrepancy between large-scale models and lightweight
models. Prevalent approaches involve leveraging appropriate metrics to minimize
the divergence or distance between the knowledge extracted from the teacher
model and the knowledge learned by the student model. Centered Kernel Alignment
(CKA) is widely used to measure representation similarity and has been applied
in several knowledge distillation methods. However, these methods are complex
and fail to uncover the essence of CKA, thus not answering the question of how
to use CKA to achieve simple and effective distillation properly. This paper
first provides a theoretical perspective to illustrate the effectiveness of
CKA, which decouples CKA to the upper bound of Maximum Mean Discrepancy~(MMD)
and a constant term. Drawing from this, we propose a novel Relation-Centered
Kernel Alignment~(RCKA) framework, which practically establishes a connection
between CKA and MMD. Furthermore, we dynamically customize the application of
CKA based on the characteristics of each task, with less computational source
yet comparable performance than the previous methods. The extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, and MS-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on almost all teacher-student pairs for image

<p class="mathjax">Sparse identification of differential equations aims to compute the analytic
expressions from the observed data explicitly. However, there exist two primary
challenges. Firstly, it exhibits sensitivity to the noise in the observed data,
particularly for the derivatives computations. Secondly, existing literature
predominantly concentrates on single-fidelity (SF) data, which imposes
limitations on its applicability due to the computational cost. In this paper,
we present two novel approaches to address these problems from the view of
uncertainty quantification. We construct a surrogate model employing the
Gaussian process regression (GPR) to mitigate the effect of noise in the
observed data, quantify its uncertainty, and ultimately recover the equations
accurately. Subsequently, we exploit the multi-fidelity Gaussian processes
(MFGP) to address scenarios involving multi-fidelity (MF), sparse, and noisy
observed data. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methodologies through several numerical experiments.

<p class="mathjax">Binarization of document images is an important pre-processing step in the
field of document analysis. Traditional image binarization techniques usually
rely on histograms or local statistics to identify a valid threshold to
differentiate between different aspects of the image. Deep learning techniques
are able to generate binarized versions of the images by learning
context-dependent features that are less error-prone to degradation typically
occurring in document images. In recent years, many deep learning-based methods
have been developed for document binarization. But which one to choose? There
have been no studies that compare these methods rigorously. Therefore, this
work focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning-based methods under
the same evaluation protocol. We evaluate them on different Document Image
Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets and obtain very heterogeneous results. We
show that the DE-GAN model was able to perform better compared to other models
when evaluated on the DIBCO2013 dataset while DP-LinkNet performed best on the
DIBCO2017 dataset. The 2-StageGAN performed best on the DIBCO2018 dataset while
SauvolaNet outperformed the others on the DIBCO2019 challenge. Finally, we make
the code, all models and evaluation publicly available
(https://github.com/RichSu95/Document_Binarization_Collection) to ensure
reproducibility and simplify future binarization evaluations.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-instance scenes are especially challenging for end-to-end visuomotor
(image-to-control) learning algorithms. "Pipeline" visual servo control
algorithms use separate detection, selection and servo stages, allowing
algorithms to focus on a single object instance during servo control.
End-to-end systems do not have separate detection and selection stages and need
to address the visual ambiguities introduced by the presence of arbitrary
number of visually identical or similar objects during servo control. However,
end-to-end schemes avoid embedding errors from detection and selection stages
in the servo control behaviour, are more dynamically robust to changing scenes,
and are algorithmically simpler. In this paper, we present a real-time
end-to-end visuomotor learning algorithm for multi-instance reaching. The
proposed algorithm uses a monocular RGB image and the manipulator's joint
angles as the input to a light-weight fully-convolutional network (FCN) to
generate control candidates. A key innovation of the proposed method is
identifying the optimal control candidate by regressing a control-Lyapunov
function (cLf) value. The multi-instance capability emerges naturally from the
stability analysis associated with the cLf formulation. We demonstrate the
proposed algorithm effectively reaching and grasping objects from different
categories on a table-top amid other instances and distractors from an
over-the-shoulder monocular RGB camera.
<br />The network is able to run up to approximately 160 fps during inference on
one GTX 1080 Ti GPU.

<p class="mathjax">Facial expression recognition is vital for human behavior analysis, and deep
learning has enabled models that can outperform humans. However, it is unclear
how closely they mimic human processing. This study aims to explore the
similarity between deep neural networks and human perception by comparing
twelve different networks, including both general object classifiers and
FER-specific models. We employ an innovative global explainable AI method to
generate heatmaps, revealing crucial facial regions for the twelve networks
trained on six facial expressions. We assess these results both quantitatively
and qualitatively, comparing them to ground truth masks based on Friesen and
Ekman's description and among them. We use Intersection over Union (IoU) and
normalized correlation coefficients for comparisons. We generate 72 heatmaps to
highlight critical regions for each expression and architecture. Qualitatively,
models with pre-trained weights show more similarity in heatmaps compared to
those without pre-training. Specifically, eye and nose areas influence certain
facial expressions, while the mouth is consistently important across all models
and expressions. Quantitatively, we find low average IoU values (avg. 0.2702)
across all expressions and architectures. The best-performing architecture
averages 0.3269, while the worst-performing one averages 0.2066. Dendrograms,
built with the normalized correlation coefficient, reveal two main clusters for
most expressions: models with pre-training and models without pre-training.
Findings suggest limited alignment between human and AI facial expression
recognition, with network architectures influencing the similarity, as similar
architectures prioritize similar facial regions.

<p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a privacy-preserving data fusion method for traffic state
estimation (TSE). Unlike existing works that assume all data sources to be
accessible by a single trusted party, we explicitly address data privacy
concerns that arise in the collaboration and data sharing between multiple data
owners, such as municipal authorities (MAs) and mobility providers (MPs). To
this end, we propose a novel vertical federated learning (FL) approach, FedTSE,
that enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train and apply a TSE
model without having to exchange their private data. To enhance the
applicability of the proposed FedTSE in common TSE scenarios with limited
availability of ground-truth data, we further propose a privacy-preserving
physics-informed FL approach, i.e., FedTSE-PI, that integrates traffic models
into FL. Real-world data validation shows that the proposed methods can protect
privacy while yielding similar accuracy to the oracle method without privacy
considerations.

<p class="mathjax">In recent years, autonomous agents have surged in real-world environments
such as our homes, offices, and public spaces. However, natural human-robot
interaction remains a key challenge. In this paper, we introduce an approach
that synergistically exploits the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
and multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) to enable humans to interact
naturally with autonomous robots through conversational dialogue. We leveraged
the LLMs to decode the high-level natural language instructions from humans and
abstract them into precise robot actionable commands or queries. Further, we
utilised the VLMs to provide a visual and semantic understanding of the robot's
task environment. Our results with 99.13% command recognition accuracy and
97.96% commands execution success show that our approach can enhance
human-robot interaction in real-world applications. The video demonstrations of
this paper can be found at https://osf.io/wzyf6 and the code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly with the
emergence of large language models (LLMs), have sparked a rethinking of
artificial general intelligence possibilities. The increasing human-like
capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research,
leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In
this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the
combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common
technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first
direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a
powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the
second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as
social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By
conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress
facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper
introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and
social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to
understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and
social science of AI, and also summarized state-of-art experiment simulation
platforms to facilitate research in these two directions. We believe that as AI
technology continues to advance and intelligent agents find increasing
applications in our daily lives, the significance of the combination of AI and
social science will become even more prominent.

<p class="mathjax">Various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in analyzing data
in non-Euclidean spaces, however, they have limitations such as oversmoothing,
i.e., information becomes excessively averaged as the number of hidden layers
increases. The issue stems from the intrinsic formulation of conventional graph
convolution where the nodal features are aggregated from a direct neighborhood
per layer across the entire nodes in the graph. As setting different number of
hidden layers per node is infeasible, recent works leverage a diffusion kernel
to redefine the graph structure and incorporate information from farther nodes.
Unfortunately, such approaches suffer from heavy diagonalization of a graph
Laplacian or learning a large transform matrix. In this regards, we propose a
diffusion learning framework, where the range of feature aggregation is
controlled by the scale of a diffusion kernel. For efficient computation, we
derive closed-form derivatives of approximations of the graph convolution with
respect to the scale, so that node-wise range can be adaptively learned. With a
downstream classifier, the entire framework is made trainable in an end-to-end
manner. Our model is tested on various standard datasets for node-wise
classification for the state-of-the-art performance, and it is also validated
on a real-world brain network data for graph classifications to demonstrate its
practicality for Alzheimer classification.

<p class="mathjax">One relevant aspect in the development of the Semantic Web framework is the
achievement of a real inter-agents communication capability at the semantic
level. The agents should be able to communicate and understand each other using
standard communication protocols freely, that is, without needing a laborious a
priori preparation, before the communication takes place. For that setting we
present in this paper a proposal that promotes to describe standard
communication protocols using Semantic Web technology (specifically, OWL-DL and
SWRL). Those protocols are constituted by communication acts. In our proposal
those communication acts are described as terms that belong to a communication
acts ontology, that we have developed, called CommOnt. The intended semantics
associated to the communication acts in the ontology is expressed through
social commitments that are formalized as fluents in the Event Calculus. In
summary, OWL-DL reasoners and rule engines help in our proposal for reasoning
about protocols. We define some comparison relationships (dealing with notions
of equivalence and specialization) between protocols used by agents from
different systems.

<p class="mathjax">Accurate crop yield prediction is of utmost importance for informed
decision-making in agriculture, aiding farmers, and industry stakeholders.
However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as
environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Combining
heterogeneous data views poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the
view-specific contribution to the predictive task. We present a novel
multi-view learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops
(soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our
multi-view input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2
satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season,
complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic
information. To effectively fuse the data, we introduce a Multi-view Gated
Fusion (MVGF) model, comprising dedicated view-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU)
module. The view-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying
temporal resolutions by learning a view-specific representation. These
representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are
computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the
view-representations. The MVGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m
resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MVGF outperforms conventional
models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the
data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina,
the MVGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction,
while at field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around
0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based
on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each
data source to the prediction task.

<p class="mathjax">Sign language recognition (SLR) plays a vital role in facilitating
communication for the hearing-impaired community. SLR is a weakly supervised
task where entire videos are annotated with glosses, making it challenging to
identify the corresponding gloss within a video segment. Recent studies
indicate that the main bottleneck in SLR is the insufficient training caused by
the limited availability of large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we
present SignVTCL, a multi-modal continuous sign language recognition framework
enhanced by visual-textual contrastive learning, which leverages the full
potential of multi-modal data and the generalization ability of language model.
SignVTCL integrates multi-modal data (video, keypoints, and optical flow)
simultaneously to train a unified visual backbone, thereby yielding more robust
visual representations. Furthermore, SignVTCL contains a visual-textual
alignment approach incorporating gloss-level and sentence-level alignment to
ensure precise correspondence between visual features and glosses at the level
of individual glosses and sentence. Experimental results conducted on three
datasets, Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily, demonstrate that SignVTCL
achieves state-of-the-art results compared with previous methods.

<p class="mathjax">Semantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a
machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0
scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this
paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called
ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a
type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the
ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for
the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in
Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different
types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct
modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties
for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial
connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally
the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of
machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close
collaboration with domain experts.

<p class="mathjax">In this work, we propose a Self-Supervised training strategy specifically
designed for combinatorial problems. One of the main obstacles in applying
supervised paradigms to such problems is the requirement of expensive target
solutions as ground-truth, often produced with costly exact solvers. Inspired
by Semi- and Self-Supervised learning, we show that it is possible to easily
train generative models by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one
according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we
iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its
self-supervision, completely removing the need for optimality information. We
prove the effectiveness of this Self-Labeling strategy on the Job Shop
Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much
attention from the Reinforcement Learning community. We propose a generative
model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with our strategy.
Experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this
approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and current
state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning proposals.

<p class="mathjax">Existing binary Transformers are promising in edge deployment due to their
compact model size, low computational complexity, and considerable inference
accuracy.However, deploying binary Transformers faces challenges on prior
processors due to inefficient execution of quantized matrix multiplication
(QMM) and the energy consumption overhead caused by multi-precision
activations.To tackle the challenges above, we first develop a computation flow
abstraction method for binary Transformers to improve QMM execution efficiency
by optimizing the computation order.Furthermore, a binarized energy-efficient
Transformer accelerator, namely BETA, is proposed to boost the efficient
deployment at the edge.Notably, BETA features a configurable QMM engine,
accommodating diverse activation precisions of binary Transformers and offering
high-parallelism and high-speed for QMMs with impressive energy
efficiency.Experimental results evaluated on ZCU102 FPGA show BETA achieves an
average energy efficiency of 174 GOPS/W, which is 1.76~21.92x higher than prior
FPGA-based accelerators, showing BETA's good potential for edge Transformer
acceleration.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-Label Classification (MLC) is a common task in the legal domain, where
more than one label may be assigned to a legal document. A wide range of
methods can be applied, ranging from traditional ML approaches to the latest
Transformer-based architectures. In this work, we perform an evaluation of
different MLC methods using two public legal datasets, POSTURE50K and
EURLEX57K. By varying the amount of training data and the number of labels, we
explore the comparative advantage offered by different approaches in relation
to the dataset properties. Our findings highlight DistilRoBERTa and LegalBERT
as performing consistently well in legal MLC with reasonable computational
demands. T5 also demonstrates comparable performance while offering advantages
as a generative model in the presence of changing label sets. Finally, we show
that the CrossEncoder exhibits potential for notable macro-F1 score
improvements, albeit with increased computational costs.

<p class="mathjax">The main objective of this paper is to solve the optimization problem that is
associated with the classification of DNA samples in PCR plates for Sanger
sequencing. To achieve this goal, we design an integer linear programming
model. Given that the real instances involve the classification of thousands of
samples and the linear model can only be solved for small instances, the paper
includes a heuristic to cope with bigger problems. The heuristic algorithm is
based on the simulated annealing technique. This algorithm obtains satisfactory
solutions to the problem in a short amount of time. It has been tested with
real data and yields improved results compared to some commercial software
typically used in (clinical) laboratories. Moreover, the algorithm has already
been implemented in the laboratory and is being successfully used.

<p class="mathjax">This study presents a comprehensive overview of PIML techniques in the
context of condition monitoring. The central concept driving PIML is the
incorporation of known physical laws and constraints into machine learning
algorithms, enabling them to learn from available data while remaining
consistent with physical principles. Through fusing domain knowledge with
data-driven learning, PIML methods offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability
in comparison to purely data-driven approaches. In this comprehensive survey,
detailed examinations are performed with regard to the methodology by which
known physical principles are integrated within machine learning frameworks, as
well as their suitability for specific tasks within condition monitoring.
Incorporation of physical knowledge into the ML model may be realized in a
variety of methods, with each having its unique advantages and drawbacks. The
distinct advantages and limitations of each methodology for the integration of
physics within data-driven models are detailed, considering factors such as
computational efficiency, model interpretability, and generalizability to
different systems in condition monitoring and fault detection. Several case
studies and works of literature utilizing this emerging concept are presented
to demonstrate the efficacy of PIML in condition monitoring applications. From
the literature reviewed, the versatility and potential of PIML in condition
monitoring may be demonstrated. Novel PIML methods offer an innovative solution
for addressing the complexities of condition monitoring and associated
challenges. This comprehensive survey helps form the foundation for future work
in the field. As the technology continues to advance, PIML is expected to play
a crucial role in enhancing maintenance strategies, system reliability, and
overall operational efficiency in engineering systems.

Models (LLMs) by compressing their mathematical reasoning capabilities into
sub-billion parameter Small Language Models (SLMs) without compromising
performance. We introduce Equation-of-Thought Distillation (EoTD), a novel
technique that encapsulates the reasoning process into equation-based
representations to construct an EoTD dataset for fine-tuning SLMs.
Additionally, we propose the Mix Thoughts Distillation (MTD) framework to
enhance the reasoning performance of SLMs. This involves creating a reasoning
dataset with multiple thought processes and using it for fine-tuning. Our
experimental findings demonstrate that EoTD significantly boosts the reasoning
abilities of SLMs, while MTD enables these models to achieve state-of-the-art

<p class="mathjax">Although the goal of achieving semantic interoperability of electronic health
records (EHRs) is pursued by many researchers, it has not been accomplished
yet. In this paper, we present a proposal that smoothes out the way toward the
achievement of that goal. In particular, our study focuses on medical diagnoses
statements. In summary, the main contributions of our ontology-based proposal
are the following: first, it includes a canonical ontology whose EHR-related
terms focus on semantic aspects. As a result, their descriptions are
independent of languages and technology aspects used in different organizations
to represent EHRs. Moreover, those terms are related to their corresponding
codes in well-known medical terminologies. Second, it deals with modules that
allow obtaining rich ontological representations of EHR information managed by
proprietary models of health information systems. The features of one specific
module are shown as reference. Third, it considers the necessary mapping axioms
between ontological terms enhanced with so-called path mappings. This feature
smoothes out structural differences between heterogeneous EHR representations,
allowing proper alignment of information.

<p class="mathjax">Recently modular monolith architecture has attracted the attention of
practitioners, as Google proposed "Service Weaver" framework to enable
developers to write applications as modular monolithic and deploy them as a set
of microservices. Google considered it as a framework that has the best of both
worlds and it seems to be a trend in software architecture. This paper aims to
understand the definition of the modular monolith in industry and investigate
frameworks and cases building modular monolith architecture. We conducted a
systematic grey literature review, and the results show that modular monolith
combines the advantages of monoliths with microservices. We found three
frameworks and four cases of building modular monolith architecture. In
general, the modular monolith is an alternative way to microservices, and it
also could be a previous step before systems migrate to microservices.

typical of PCNs such as the public Lightning Network -- is largely (possibly
fully) retained. We study the system by simulating a scaled-down version of a
hypothetical European CBDC, exploring the trade-offs among liquidity locked by
market operators, payment success rate, throughput, latency, and load on the
underpinning blockchain.

<p class="mathjax">Document structure analysis (aka document layout analysis) is crucial for
understanding the physical layout and logical structure of documents, with
applications in information retrieval, document summarization, knowledge
extraction, etc. In this paper, we concentrate on Hierarchical Document
Structure Analysis (HDSA) to explore hierarchical relationships within
structured documents created using authoring software employing hierarchical
schemas, such as LaTeX, Microsoft Word, and HTML. To comprehensively analyze
hierarchical document structures, we propose a tree construction based approach
that addresses multiple subtasks concurrently, including page object detection
(Detect), reading order prediction of identified objects (Order), and the
construction of intended hierarchical structure (Construct). We present an
effective end-to-end solution based on this framework to demonstrate its
performance. To assess our approach, we develop a comprehensive benchmark
called Comp-HRDoc, which evaluates the above subtasks simultaneously. Our
end-to-end system achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale
document layout analysis datasets (PubLayNet and DocLayNet), a high-quality
hierarchical document structure reconstruction dataset (HRDoc), and our
Comp-HRDoc benchmark. The Comp-HRDoc benchmark will be released to facilitate
further research in this field.

<p class="mathjax">3D virtual simulation, which generates diversified test scenarios and tests
full-stack of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSes) modules dynamically as a
whole, is a promising approach for Safety of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF)
ADS testing. However, as different configurations of a test scenario will
affect the sensor perceptions and environment interaction, e.g. light pulses
emitted by the LiDAR sensor will undergo backscattering and attenuation, which
is usually overlooked by existing works, leading to false positives or wrong
results. Moreover, the input space of an ADS is extremely large, with infinite
number of possible initial scenarios and mutations, along both temporal and
spatial domains.
<br />This paper proposes a first-principles based sensor modeling and environment
interaction scheme, and integrates it into CARLA simulator. With this scheme, a
long-overlooked category of adverse weather related corner cases are
discovered, along with their root causes. Moreover, a meta-heuristic algorithm
is designed based on several empirical insights, which guide both seed
scenarios and mutations, significantly reducing the search dimensions of
scenarios and enhancing the efficiency of corner case identification.
Experimental results show that under identical simulation setups, our algorithm
discovers about four times as many corner cases as compared to state-of-the-art
work.

<p class="mathjax">Recent research has underscored the increasing preference of users for
human-like interactions with machines. Consequently, facial expression
recognition has gained significance as a means of imparting social robots with
the capacity to discern the emotional states of users. In this investigation,
we assess the suitability of deep learning approaches, known for their
remarkable performance in this domain, for recognizing facial expressions in
individuals with intellectual disabilities, which has not been yet studied in
the literature, to the best of our knowledge. To address this objective, we
train a set of twelve distinct convolutional neural networks in different
approaches, including an ensemble of datasets without individuals with
intellectual disabilities and a dataset featuring such individuals. Our
examination of the outcomes achieved by the various models under distinct
training conditions, coupled with a comprehensive analysis of critical facial
regions during expression recognition facilitated by explainable artificial
intelligence techniques, revealed significant distinctions in facial
expressions between individuals with and without intellectual disabilities, as
well as among individuals with intellectual disabilities. Remarkably, our
findings demonstrate the feasibility of facial expression recognition within
this population through tailored user-specific training methodologies, which
enable the models to effectively address the unique expressions of each user.

<p class="mathjax">Multi-agent systems, augmented with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrate
significant capabilities for collective intelligence. However, the potential
misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks.
To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with
multi-agent systems remains limited. From the perspective of agent psychology,
we discover that the dark psychological states of agents can lead to severe
safety issues. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework
grounded in agent psychology. In our framework, we focus on three aspects:
identifying how dark personality traits in agents might lead to risky
behaviors, designing defense strategies to mitigate these risks, and evaluating
the safety of multi-agent systems from both psychological and behavioral
perspectives. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the
collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' propensity for
self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation
between agents' psychological assessments and their dangerous behaviors. We
anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights
for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our
data and code publicly accessible at https:/github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.

<p class="mathjax">Allocation games are zero-sum games that model the distribution of resources
among multiple agents. In this paper, we explore the interplay between an
elastic sense of subjective identity and its impact on notions of fairness in
allocation. An elastic sense of identity in agents is known to lead to
responsible decision-making in non-cooperative, non-zero-sum games like
Prisoners' Dilemma, and is a desirable feature to add into agent models.
However, when it comes to allocation, an elastic sense of identity can be shown
to exacerbate inequities in allocation, giving no rational incentive for agents
to act fairly towards one another. This lead us to introduce a sense of
fairness as an innate characteristic of autonomous agency. For this, we
implement the well-known Ultimatum Game between two agents, where their elastic
sense of self (controlled by a parameter called $\gamma$) and a sense of
fairness (controlled by a parameter called $\tau$) are both varied. We study
the points at which agents find it no longer rational to identify with the
other agent, and uphold their sense of fairness, and vice versa. Such a study
also helps us discern the subtle difference between responsibility and fairness
when it comes to autonomous agency.

<p class="mathjax">In the marketing field, understanding consumer heterogeneity, which is the
internal or psychological difference among consumers that cannot be captured by
behavioral logs, has long been a critical challenge. However, a number of
consumers today usually post their evaluation on the specific product on the
online platform, which can be the valuable source of such unobservable
differences among consumers. Several previous studies have shown the validity
of the analysis on text modality, but on the other hand, such analyses may not
necessarily demonstrate sufficient predictive accuracy for text alone, as they
may not include information readily available from cross-sectional data, such
as consumer profile data. In addition, recent advances in machine learning
techniques, such as large-scale language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning
have made it possible to deal with the various kind of dataset simultaneously,
including textual data and the traditional cross-sectional data, and the joint
representations can be effectively obtained from multiple modalities.
Therefore, this study constructs a product evaluation model that takes into
account consumer heterogeneity by multimodal learning of online product reviews
and consumer profile information. We also compare multiple models using
different modalities or hyper-parameters to demonstrate the robustness of
multimodal learning in marketing analysis.

conducting TESLA cavities being the driving example. Due to the shape
uncertainty, the resulting eigenvalues and eigenmodes are also uncertain and it
is well known that the eigenvalues may exhibit crossings or bifurcations under
perturbation. We discuss how the shape uncertainties can be modelled using the
domain mapping approach and how the deformation mapping can be expressed as
coefficients in Maxwell's equations. Using derivatives of these coefficients
and derivatives of the eigenpairs, we follow a perturbation approach to compute
approximations of mean and covariance of the eigenpairs. For small
perturbations, these approximations are faster and more accurate than Monte
Carlo or similar sampling-based strategies. Numerical experiments for a
three-dimensional 9-cell TESLA cavity are presented.

<p class="mathjax">Insurers increasingly use AI. We distinguish two situations in which insurers
use AI: (i) data-intensive underwriting, and (ii) behaviour-based insurance.
(i) First, insurers can use AI for data analysis to assess risks:
data-intensive underwriting. Underwriting is, in short, calculating risks and
amending the insurance premium accordingly. (ii) Second, insurers can use AI to
monitor the behaviour of consumers in real-time: behaviour-based insurance. For
example, some car insurers give a discount if a consumer agrees to being
tracked by the insurer and drives safely. While the two trends bring many
advantages, they may also have discriminatory effects. This paper focuses on
the following question. Which discrimination-related effects may occur if
insurers use data-intensive underwriting and behaviour-based insurance? We
focus on two types of discrimination-related effects: discrimination and other
unfair differentiation. (i) Discrimination harms certain groups who are
protected by non-discrimination law, for instance people with certain
ethnicities. (ii) Unfair differentiation does not harm groups that are
protected by non-discrimination law, but it does seem unfair. We introduce four
factors to consider when assessing the fairness of insurance practices. The
paper builds on literature from various disciplines including law, philosophy,
and computer science.

<p class="mathjax">Proof assistants like Coq are increasingly popular to help mathematicians
carry out proofs of the results they conjecture. However, formal proofs remain
highly technical and are especially difficult to reuse. In this paper, we
present a framework to carry out a posteriori script transformations. These
transformations are meant to be applied as an automated post-processing step,
once the proof has been completed. As an example, we present a transformation
which takes an arbitrary large proof script and produces an equivalent
single-line proof script, which can be executed by Coq in one single step.
Other applications, such as fully expanding a proof script (for debugging
purposes), removing all named hypotheses, etc. could be developed within this
framework. We apply our tool to various Coq proof scripts, including some from
the GeoCoq library.

Automated Reasoning Tools developed in GeoGebra Discovery, providing different
examples of the performance of these new features. We describe the new
ShowProof command, that outputs both the sequence of the different steps
performed by GeoGebra Discovery to confirm a certain statement, as well as a
number intending to grade the difficulty or interest of the assertion. The
proposal of this assessment measure, involving the comparison of the expression

<p class="mathjax">Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) has received widespread
attention recently, and among its variants, ordered reliability bits GRAND
(ORBGRAND) is particularly attractive due to its efficient utilization of soft
information and its amenability to hardware implementation. It has been
recently shown that ORBGRAND is almost capacity-achieving in additive white
Gaussian noise channels under antipodal input. In this work, we first extend
the analysis of ORBGRAND achievable rate to memoryless binary-input bit
channels with general output conditional probability distributions. The
analytical result also sheds insight into understanding the gap between the
ORBGRAND achievable rate and the channel mutual information. As an application
of the analysis, we study the ORBGRAND achievable rate of bit-interleaved coded
modulation (BICM). Numerical results indicate that for BICM, the gap between
the ORBGRAND achievable rate and the channel mutual information is typically
small, and hence suggest the feasibility of ORBGRAND for channels with
high-order coded modulation schemes.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we present an approach to automated solving of triangle
ruler-and-compass construction problems using finite-domain constraint solvers.
The constraint model is described in the MiniZinc modeling language, and is
based on the automated planning. The main benefit of using general constraint
solvers for such purpose, instead of developing dedicated tools, is that we can
rely on the efficient search that is already implemented within the solver,
enabling us to focus on geometric aspects of the problem. We may also use the
solver's built-in optimization capabilities to search for the shortest possible
constructions. We evaluate our approach on 74 solvable problems from the
Wernick's list, and compare it to the dedicated triangle construction solver
ArgoTriCS. The results show that our approach is comparable to dedicated tools,
while it requires much less effort to implement. Also, our model often finds
shorter constructions, thanks to the optimization capabilities offered by the
constraint solvers.

<p class="mathjax">In 1926-1927, Tarski designed a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry which
reached its final form in a manuscript by Schwabh\"auser, Szmielew and Tarski
in 1983. The differences amount to simplifications obtained by Tarski and
Gupta. Gupta presented an independent version of Tarski's system of geometry,
thus establishing that his version could not be further simplified without
modifying the axioms. To obtain the independence of one of his axioms, namely
Pasch's axiom, he proved the independence of one of its consequences: the
previously eliminated symmetry of betweenness. However, an independence model
for the non-degenerate part of Pasch's axiom was provided by Szczerba for
another version of Tarski's system of geometry in which the symmetry of
betweenness holds. This independence proof cannot be directly used for Gupta's
version as the statements of the parallel postulate differ.
<br />In this paper, we present our progress towards obtaining an independent
version of a variant of Gupta's system. Compared to Gupta's version, we split
Pasch's axiom into this previously eliminated axiom and its non-degenerate part
and change the statement of the parallel postulate. We verified the
independence properties by mechanizing counter-models using the Coq
proof-assistant.

<p class="mathjax">The pursue of what are properties that can be identified to permit an
automated reasoning program to generate and find new and interesting theorems
is an interesting research goal (pun intended). The automatic discovery of new
theorems is a goal in itself, and it has been addressed in specific areas, with
different methods. The separation of the "weeds", uninteresting, trivial facts,
from the "wheat", new and interesting facts, is much harder, but is also being
addressed by different authors using different approaches. In this paper we
will focus on geometry. We present and discuss different approaches for the
automatic discovery of geometric theorems (and properties), and different
metrics to find the interesting theorems among all those that were generated.
After this description we will introduce the first result of this article: an
undecidability result proving that having an algorithmic procedure that decides
for every possible Turing Machine that produces theorems, whether it is able to
produce also interesting theorems, is an undecidable problem. Consequently, we
will argue that judging whether a theorem prover is able to produce interesting
theorems remains a non deterministic task, at best a task to be addressed by
program based in an algorithm guided by heuristics criteria. Therefore, as a
human, to satisfy this task two things are necessary: an expert survey that
sheds light on what a theorem prover/finder of interesting geometric theorems
is, and - to enable this analysis - other surveys that clarify metrics and
approaches related to the interestingness of geometric theorems. In the
conclusion of this article we will introduce the structure of two of these
surveys - the second result of this article - and we will discuss some future
work.

<p class="mathjax">We address, through the automated reasoning tools in GeoGebra Discovery, a
problem from a regional phase of the Austrian Mathematics Olympiad 2023. Trying
to solve this problem gives rise to four different kind of feedback: the almost
instantaneous, automated solution of the proposed problem; the measure of its
complexity, according to some recent proposals; the automated discovery of a
generalization of the given assertion, showing that the same statement is true
over more general polygons than those mentioned in the problem; and the
difficulties associated to the analysis of the surprising and involved high
number of degenerate cases that appear when using the LocusEquation command in
this problem. In our communication we will describe and reflect on these
diverse issues, enhancing its exemplar role for showing some of the advantages,
problems, and current fields of development of GeoGebra Discovery.

first examples, which model bicircular moves in the same direction, are
classical curves (epicycloids, etc.). Then, we explore bicircular moves in
reverse direction and tricircular moves in 2D and 3D, to explore complex
visualisations of extraplanetary movements. These moves are studied in a plane
setting. Then, adding increasing complexity, we explore them in a non planar
setting (which is a closer model of the real situation). The exploration is

<p class="mathjax">For a rational parameterization of a curve, it is desirable that its angular
speed is as uniform as possible. Hence, given a rational parameterization, one
wants to find re-parameterization with better uniformity. One natural way is to
use piecewise rational reparameterization. However, it turns out that the
piecewise rational reparameterization does not help when the angular speed of
the given rational parameterization is zero at some points on the curve. In
this paper, we show how to overcome the challenge by using piecewise radical

<p class="mathjax">While auxiliary information has become a key to enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs), relatively little is known about how well LLMs merge these contexts,
specifically generated and retrieved. To study this, we formulate a task
specifically designed to identify whether the answers, derived from the
integration of generated and retrieved contexts, are attributed to either
generated or retrieved contexts. To support this task, we develop a methodology
to construct datasets with conflicting contexts, where each question is paired
with both generated and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the
correct answer. Our experiments reveal a significant bias in LLMs towards
generated contexts, as evidenced across state-of-the-art open (Llama2-7b/13b)
and closed (GPT 3.5/4) systems. We further identify two key factors
contributing to this bias: i) Contexts generated by LLMs typically show greater
similarity to the questions, increasing their likelihood of selection; ii) The
segmentation process used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness,
thereby hindering their full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the
understanding of how LLMs merge diverse contexts, offering valuable insights
for advancing current augmentation methods for LLMs.

<p class="mathjax">The enhancement of 3D object detection is pivotal for precise environmental
perception and improved task execution capabilities in autonomous driving.
LiDAR point clouds, offering accurate depth information, serve as a crucial
information for this purpose. Our study focuses on key challenges in 3D target
detection. To tackle the challenge of expanding the receptive field of a 3D
convolutional kernel, we introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM).
This module achieves adaptive expansion of the 3D convolutional kernel's
receptive field, balancing the expansion with acceptable computational loads.
This innovation reduces operations, expands the receptive field, and allows the
model to dynamically adjust to different object requirements. Simultaneously,
we identify redundant information in 3D features. Employing the Feature
Selection Module (FSM) quantitatively evaluates and eliminates non-important
features, achieving the separation of output box fitting and feature
extraction. This innovation enables the detector to focus on critical features,
resulting in model compression, reduced computational burden, and minimized
candidate frame interference. Extensive experiments confirm that both DFFM and
FSM not only enhance current benchmarks, particularly in small target
detection, but also accelerate network performance. Importantly, these modules
exhibit effective complementarity.

<p class="mathjax">Multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving various vision problems. However, fusing features of
different scales alwaysresults in large model sizes, impeding the application
of multiscale CNNs in RGB-D saliency detection. In this paper, we propose a
customized feature fusion module, called Saliency Enhanced Feature Fusion
(SEFF), for RGB-D saliency detection. SEFF utilizes saliency maps of the
neighboring scales to enhance the necessary features for fusing, resulting in
more representative fused features. Our multiscale RGB-D saliency detector uses
SEFF and processes images with three different scales. SEFF is used to fuse the
features of RGB and depth images, as well as the features of decoders at
different scales. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have
demonstrated the superiority of our method over ten SOTA saliency detectors.

<p class="mathjax">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving as adaptable platforms for a
wide range of applications such as precise inspections, emergency response, and
remote sensing. Autonomous UAV swarms require efficient and stable
communication during deployment for a successful mission execution. For
instance, the periodic exchange of telemetry data between all swarm members
provides the foundation for formation flight and collision avoidance. However,
due to the mobility of the vehicles and instability of wireless transmissions,
maintaining a secure and reliable all-to-all communication remains challenging.
This paper investigates encrypted and authenticated multi-hop broadcast
communication based on the transmission of custom IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi data

<p class="mathjax">An emerging technology to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy
efficiency (EE) of wireless communication systems is reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS), which is shown to be very powerful in single-carrier systems.
However, in multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems, RIS may not be as promising as in single-carrier systems since an
independent optimization of RIS elements at each sub-carrier is impossible in
multi-carrier systems. Thus, this paper investigates the performance of various
RIS technologies like regular (reflective and passive), simultaneously transmit
and reflect (STAR), and multi-sector beyond diagonal (BD) RIS in multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM broadcast channels (BC). This
requires to formulate and solve a joint MIMO precoding and RIS optimization
problem. The obtained solution reveals that RIS can significantly improve the
system performance even when the number of RIS elements is relatively low.
Moreover, we develop resource allocation schemes for STAR-RIS and multi-sector
BD-RIS in MIMO OFDM BCs, and show that these RIS technologies can outperform a
regular RIS, especially when the regular RIS cannot assist the communications
for all the users.

<p class="mathjax">Tour guidance in virtual museums encourages multi-modal interactions to boost
user experiences, concerning engagement, immersion, and spatial awareness.
Nevertheless, achieving the goal is challenging due to the complexity of
comprehending diverse user needs and accommodating personalized user
preferences. Informed by a formative study that characterizes guidance-seeking
contexts, we establish a multi-modal interaction design framework for virtual
tour guidance. We then design VirtuWander, a two-stage innovative system using
domain-oriented large language models to transform user inquiries into diverse
guidance-seeking contexts and facilitate multi-modal interactions. The
feasibility and versatility of VirtuWander are demonstrated with virtual
guiding examples that encompass various touring scenarios and cater to
personalized preferences. We further evaluate VirtuWander through a user study
within an immersive simulated museum. The results suggest that our system
enhances engaging virtual tour experiences through personalized communication
and knowledgeable assistance, indicating its potential for expanding into
real-world scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in
time series analysis, distinguished by its focus on extensive input sequences,
in contrast to the constrained lengths typical of traditional approaches. While
longer sequences inherently convey richer information, potentially enhancing
predictive precision, prevailing techniques often respond by escalating model
complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters,
incorporating parameter-intensive elements like positional encodings,
feed-forward networks and self-attention mechanisms. This complexity, however,
leads to prohibitive model scale, particularly given the time series data's
semantic simplicity. Motivated by the pursuit of parsimony, our research
employs conditional correlation and auto-correlation as investigative tools,
revealing significant redundancies within the input data. Leveraging these
insights, we introduce the HDformer, a lightweight Transformer variant enhanced
with hierarchical decomposition. This novel architecture not only inverts the
prevailing trend toward model expansion but also accomplishes precise
forecasting with drastically fewer computations and parameters. Remarkably,
HDformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art LTSF models, while requiring
over 99\% fewer parameters. Through this work, we advocate a paradigm shift in
LTSF, emphasizing the importance to tailor the model to the inherent dynamics
of time series data-a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not
invariably better.

<p class="mathjax">Low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation satellite networks have shown great
potential to extend the coverage capability of conventional terrestrial
networks. How to systematically define, quantify, and assess the technical
performance of LEO mega-constellation satellite networks remains an open issue.
In this paper, we propose a comprehensive key performance indicator (KPI)
framework for mega-constellation based LEO satellite networks. An efficient LEO
constellation oriented performance evaluation methodology is then carefully
designed by resorting to the concept of interfering area and spherical
geographic cell. We have carried out rigorous system-level simulations and
provided numerical results to assess the KPI framework. It can be observed that
the achieved area traffic capacity of the reference LEO constellation is around
4 Kbps/km2, with service availability ranging from 0.36 to 0.39. Besides, the
average access success probability and handover failure rate is approximate to
96% and 10%, respectively, in the nearest satellite association scheme.

<p class="mathjax">This paper considers the problem of recovering a tensor with an underlying
low-tubal-rank structure from a small number of corrupted linear measurements.
Traditional approaches tackling such a problem require the computation of
tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD), that is a computationally
intensive process, rendering them impractical for dealing with large-scale
tensors. Aim to address this challenge, we propose an efficient and effective
low-tubal-rank tensor recovery method based on a factorization procedure akin
to the Burer-Monteiro (BM) method. Precisely, our fundamental approach involves
decomposing a large tensor into two smaller factor tensors, followed by solving
the problem through factorized gradient descent (FGD). This strategy eliminates
the need for t-SVD computation, thereby reducing computational costs and
storage requirements. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the
convergence of FGD under both noise-free and noisy situations. Additionally, it
is worth noting that our method does not require the precise estimation of the
tensor tubal-rank. Even in cases where the tubal-rank is slightly
overestimated, our approach continues to demonstrate robust performance. A
series of experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that, as compared to
other popular ones, our approach exhibits superior performance in multiple
scenarios, in terms of the faster computational speed and the smaller
convergence error.

<p class="mathjax">As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance,
evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally,
there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning
abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU,
a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark
designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge
and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and
strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU.
<br />CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college
exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art &amp; Design,
Business, Science, Health &amp; Medicine, Humanities &amp; Social Science, and Tech &amp;
Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and
comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps,
tables, music sheets, and chemical structures.
<br />CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific
knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one
proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%,
indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to
build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and
promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.

parcels to target locations. In the PFM condition, operators were informed of
the estimated completion times given the number of drones deployed, whereas in
the No-PFM condition, operators did not have this information. The operators
could control the mission by adding or removing drones from the mission and
thereby, increasing or decreasing the overall mission cost. The evaluation of
human-swarm performance relied on four key metrics: the time taken to complete
tasks, the number of agents involved, the total number of tasks accomplished,
and the overall cost associated with the human-swarm task. Our results show
that PFM modelling at runtime improves mission performance without
significantly affecting the operator's workload or the system's usability.

<p class="mathjax">Many existing coverless steganography methods establish a mapping
relationship between cover images and hidden data. There exists an issue that
the number of images stored in the database grows exponentially as the
steganographic capacity rises. The need for a high steganographic capacity
makes it challenging to build an image database. To improve the image library
utilization and anti-attack capability of the steganography system, we present
an efficient coverless scheme based on dynamically matched substrings. YOLO is
employed for selecting optimal objects, and a mapping dictionary is established
between these objects and scrambling factors. With the aid of this dictionary,
each image is effectively assigned to a specific scrambling factor, which is
used to scramble the receiver's sequence key. To achieve sufficient
steganography capability based on a limited image library, all substrings of
the scrambled sequences hold the potential to hide data. After completing the
secret information matching, the ideal number of stego images will be obtained
from the database. According to experimental results, this technology
outperforms most previous works on data load, transmission security, and hiding
capacity. Under typical geometric attacks, it can recover 79.85\% of secret
information on average. Furthermore, only approximately 200 random images are
needed to meet a capacity of 19 bits per image.

<p class="mathjax">In inverse problems, the goal is to estimate unknown model parameters from
noisy observational data. Traditionally, inverse problems are solved under the
assumption of a fixed forward operator describing the observation model. In
this article, we consider the extension of this approach to situations where we
have a dynamic forward model, motivated by applications in scientific
computation and engineering. We specifically consider this extension for a
derivative-free optimizer, the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). We introduce
and justify a new methodology called dynamic-EKI, which is a particle-based
method with a changing forward operator. We analyze our new method, presenting
results related to the control of our particle system through its covariance
structure. This analysis includes moment bounds and an ensemble collapse, which
are essential for demonstrating a convergence result. We establish convergence
in expectation and validate our theoretical findings through experiments with
dynamic-EKI applied to a 2D Darcy flow partial differential equation.

<p class="mathjax">Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) aims to evaluate image quality in line
with human perception, without reference benchmarks. Currently, deep learning
BIQA methods typically depend on using features from high-level tasks for
transfer learning. However, the inherent differences between BIQA and these
high-level tasks inevitably introduce noise into the quality-aware features. In
this paper, we take an initial step towards exploring the diffusion model for
feature denoising in BIQA, namely Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA
(PFD-IQA), which aims to remove noise from quality-aware features.
Specifically, (i) We propose a {Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation
module to establish two auxiliary tasks to discover potential low-level
features in images that are used to aggregate perceptual text conditions for
the diffusion model. (ii) We propose a Perceptual Prior-based Feature
Refinement strategy, which matches noisy features to predefined denoising
trajectories and then performs exact feature denoising based on text
conditions. Extensive experiments on eight standard BIQA datasets demonstrate
the superior performance to the state-of-the-art BIQA methods, i.e., achieving
the PLCC values of 0.935 ( vs. 0.905 in KADID) and 0.922 ( vs. 0.894 in LIVEC).

<p class="mathjax">A semi-implicit two-phase double-point Material Point Method (MPM)
formulation, based on the incremental fractional-step method to model large
deformation geotechnical problems has been derived. The semi-implicit
formulation has two advantages compared with the explicit approach: the time
step is independent of the water phase, and the pore pressure field is more
stable. The semi-implicit MPM models based on the incremental fractional-step
method available in the literature consist of modelling the soil and water
mixture using a single set of material points only, in order to save
computational time. In this study, we further derive this formulation with two
sets of material points to represent the soil and water phases separately. The
stress oscillations that are frequently found in the water and soil phases are
stabilised with this approach. A new stabilisation method is developed based on
the modified F-bar method. The proposed method is validated with two numerical
examples under small and large deformations, respectively. After that, Nor-Sand
constitutive soil model is used to simulate landslides. Numerical examples show
an excellent performance of the proposed coupled MPM and the stabilisation
method. The formulation with two sets of material points yields significantly
different but more reliable results in the landslides analysis, compared with
the single-point approach. Additionally, this research shows that the
additional computational cost caused by the additional water material points is
acceptable. Therefore, it is recommended to use two sets of material points for
certain large deformation geotechnical problems.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces the RUMBoost model, a novel discrete choice modelling
approach that combines the interpretability and behavioural robustness of
Random Utility Models (RUMs) with the generalisation and predictive ability of
deep learning methods. We obtain the full functional form of non-linear utility
specifications by replacing each linear parameter in the utility functions of a
RUM with an ensemble of gradient boosted regression trees. This enables
piece-wise constant utility values to be imputed for all alternatives directly
from the data for any possible combination of input variables. We introduce
additional constraints on the ensembles to ensure three crucial features of the
utility specifications: (i) dependency of the utilities of each alternative on
only the attributes of that alternative, (ii) monotonicity of marginal
utilities, and (iii) an intrinsically interpretable functional form, where the
exact response of the model is known throughout the entire input space.
Furthermore, we introduce an optimisation-based smoothing technique that
replaces the piece-wise constant utility values of alternative attributes with
monotonic piece-wise cubic splines to identify non-linear parameters with
defined gradient. We demonstrate the potential of the RUMBoost model compared
to various ML and Random Utility benchmark models for revealed preference mode
choice data from London. The results highlight the great predictive performance
and the direct interpretability of our proposed approach. Furthermore, the
smoothed attribute utility functions allow for the calculation of various
behavioural indicators and marginal utilities. Finally, we demonstrate the
flexibility of our methodology by showing how the RUMBoost model can be
extended to complex model specifications, including attribute interactions,
correlation within alternative error terms and heterogeneity within the
population.

<p class="mathjax">Downscaling (DS) of meteorological variables involves obtaining
high-resolution states from low-resolution meteorological fields and is an
important task in weather forecasting. Previous methods based on deep learning
treat downscaling as a super-resolution task in computer vision and utilize
high-resolution gridded meteorological fields as supervision to improve
resolution at specific grid scales. However, this approach has struggled to
align with the continuous distribution characteristics of meteorological
fields, leading to an inherent systematic bias between the downscaled results
and the actual observations at meteorological stations. In this paper, we
extend meteorological downscaling to arbitrary scattered station scales,
establish a brand new benchmark and dataset, and retrieve meteorological states
at any given station location from a coarse-resolution meteorological field.
Inspired by data assimilation techniques, we integrate observational data into
the downscaling process, providing multi-scale observational priors. Building
on this foundation, we propose a new downscaling model based on hypernetwork
architecture, namely HyperDS, which efficiently integrates different
observational information into the model training, achieving continuous scale
modeling of the meteorological field. Through extensive experiments, our
proposed method outperforms other specially designed baseline models on
multiple surface variables. Notably, the mean squared error (MSE) for wind
speed and surface pressure improved by 67% and 19.5% compared to other methods.
We will release the dataset and code subsequently.

<p class="mathjax">The safety of autonomous driving systems, particularly self-driving vehicles,
remains of paramount concern. These systems exhibit affine nonlinear dynamics
and face the challenge of executing predefined control tasks while adhering to
state and input constraints to mitigate risks. However, achieving safety
control within the framework of control input constraints, such as collision
avoidance and maintaining system states within secure boundaries, presents
challenges due to limited options. In this study, we introduce a novel approach
to address safety concerns by transforming safety conditions into control
constraints with a relative degree of 1. This transformation is facilitated
through the design of control barrier functions, enabling the creation of a
safety control system for affine nonlinear networks. Subsequently, we formulate
a robust control strategy that incorporates safety protocols and conduct a
comprehensive analysis of its stability and reliability. To illustrate the
effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a specific problem involving
adaptive cruise control. Through simulations, we validate the efficiency of our
model in ensuring safety without compromising control performance. Our approach
signifies significant progress in the field, providing a practical solution to
enhance safety for autonomous driving systems operating within the context of
affine nonlinear dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">With the rapid development of low-cost consumer electronics and cloud
computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are widely adopted for supporting
next-generation distributed systems such as smart cities and industrial control
systems. IoT devices are often susceptible to cyber attacks due to their open
deployment environment and limited computing capabilities for stringent
security controls. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as one
of the effective ways of securing IoT networks by monitoring and detecting
abnormal activities. However, existing IDS approaches rely on centralized
servers to generate behaviour profiles and detect anomalies, causing high
response time and large operational costs due to communication overhead.
Besides, sharing of behaviour data in an open and distributed IoT network
environment may violate on-device privacy requirements. Additionally, various
IoT devices tend to capture heterogeneous data, which complicates the training
of behaviour models. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning (FL) to
collaboratively train a decentralized shared model of IDS, without exposing
training data to others. Furthermore, we propose an effective method called
Federated Learning Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (FLEKD) to mitigate the
heterogeneity problems across various clients. FLEKD enables a more flexible
aggregation method than conventional model fusion techniques. Experiment
results on the public dataset CICIDS2019 demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms local training and traditional FL in terms of both speed and
performance and significantly improves the system's ability to detect unknown
attacks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework's performance in three
potential real-world scenarios and show FLEKD has a clear advantage in
experimental results.

<p class="mathjax">The advancement of machine learning and symbolic approaches have underscored
their strengths and weaknesses in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While
machine learning approaches are powerful in identifying patterns in data, they
often fall short in learning commonsense and the factual knowledge required for
the NLP tasks. Meanwhile, the symbolic methods excel in representing
knowledge-rich data. However, they struggle to adapt dynamic data and
generalize the knowledge. Bridging these two paradigms through hybrid
approaches enables the alleviation of weaknesses in both while preserving their
strengths. Recent studies extol the virtues of this union, showcasing promising
results in a wide range of NLP tasks. In this paper, we present an overview of
hybrid approaches used for NLP. Specifically, we delve into the
state-of-the-art hybrid approaches used for a broad spectrum of NLP tasks

<p class="mathjax">Conformal risk control (CRC) is a recently proposed technique that applies
post-hoc to a conventional point predictor to provide calibration guarantees.
Generalizing conformal prediction (CP), with CRC, calibration is ensured for a
set predictor that is extracted from the point predictor to control a risk
function such as the probability of miscoverage or the false negative rate. The
original CRC requires the available data set to be split between training and
validation data sets. This can be problematic when data availability is
limited, resulting in inefficient set predictors. In this paper, a novel CRC
method is introduced that is based on cross-validation, rather than on
validation as the original CRC. The proposed cross-validation CRC (CV-CRC)
extends a version of the jackknife-minmax from CP to CRC, allowing for the
control of a broader range of risk functions. CV-CRC is proved to offer
theoretical guarantees on the average risk of the set predictor. Furthermore,
numerical experiments show that CV-CRC can reduce the average set size with
respect to CRC when the available data are limited.

<p class="mathjax">Enabling multi-fingered robots to grasp and manipulate objects with
human-like dexterity is especially challenging during the dynamic, continuous
hand-object interactions. Closed-loop feedback control is essential for
dexterous hands to dynamically finetune hand poses when performing precise
functional grasps. This work proposes an adaptive motion planning method based
on deep reinforcement learning to adjust grasping poses according to real-time
feedback from joint torques from pre-grasp to goal grasp. We find the
multi-joint torques of the dexterous hand can sense object positions through
contacts and collisions, enabling real-time adjustment of grasps to generate
varying grasping trajectories for objects in different positions. In our
experiments, the performance gap with and without force feedback reveals the
important role of force feedback in adaptive manipulation. Our approach
utilizing force feedback preliminarily exhibits human-like flexibility,
adaptability, and precision.

<p class="mathjax">Speech is a common input method for mobile embedded devices, but cloud-based
speech recognition systems pose privacy risks. Disentanglement-based encoders,
designed to safeguard user privacy by filtering sensitive information from
speech signals, unfortunately require substantial memory and computational
resources, which limits their use in less powerful devices. To overcome this,
we introduce a novel system, XXX, optimized for such devices. XXX is built on
the insight that speech understanding primarily relies on understanding the
entire utterance's long-term dependencies, while privacy concerns are often
linked to short-term details. Therefore, XXX focuses on selectively masking
these short-term elements, preserving the quality of long-term speech
understanding. The core of XXX is an innovative differential mask generator,
grounded in interpretable learning, which fine-tunes the masking process. We
tested XXX on the STM32H7 microcontroller, assessing its performance in various
potential attack scenarios. The results show that XXX maintains speech
understanding accuracy and privacy at levels comparable to existing encoders,
but with a significant improvement in efficiency, achieving up to 53.3$\times$
faster processing and a 134.1$\times$ smaller memory footprint.

<p class="mathjax">Accurately simulating real world object dynamics is essential for various
applications such as robotics, engineering, graphics, and design. To better
capture complex real dynamics such as contact and friction, learned simulators
based on graph networks have recently shown great promise. However, applying
these learned simulators to real scenes comes with two major challenges: first,
scaling learned simulators to handle the complexity of real world scenes which
can involve hundreds of objects each with complicated 3D shapes, and second,
handling inputs from perception rather than 3D state information. Here we
introduce a method which substantially reduces the memory required to run
graph-based learned simulators. Based on this memory-efficient simulation
model, we then present a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs
which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can
be processed by graph network simulator. We show that our method uses
substantially less memory than previous graph-based simulators while retaining
their accuracy, and that the simulators learned in synthetic environments can
be applied to real world scenes captured from multiple camera angles. This
paves the way for expanding the application of learned simulators to settings
where only perceptual information is available at inference time.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the message complexity of verifying whether a given subgraph of
the communication network forms a tree with specific properties both in the
KT-$\rho$ (nodes know their $\rho$-hop neighborhood, including node IDs) and
the KT-$0$ (nodes do not have this knowledge) models. We develop a rather
general framework that helps in establishing tight lower bounds for various
tree verification problems. We also consider two different verification
requirements: namely that every node detects in the case the input is
incorrect, as well as the requirement that at least one node detects. The
results are stronger than previous ones in the sense that we assume that each
node knows the number $n$ of nodes in the graph (in some cases) or an $\alpha$
approximation of $n$ (in other cases). For spanning tree verification, we show
that the message complexity inherently depends on the quality of the given
approximation of $n$: We show a tight lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ for the case
$\alpha \ge \sqrt{2}$ and a much better upper bound (i.e., $O(n \log n)$) when
nodes are given a tighter approximation. On the other hand, our framework also
yields an $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the message complexity of verifying a
minimum spanning tree (MST), which reveals a polynomial separation between ST
verification and MST verification. This result holds for randomized algorithms
with perfect knowledge of the network size, and even when just one node detects
illegal inputs, thus improving over the work of Kor, Korman, and Peleg (2013).
For verifying a $d$-approximate BFS tree, we show that the same lower bound
holds even if nodes know $n$ exactly, however, the lower bound is sensitive to
$d$, which is the stretch parameter.

<p class="mathjax">Pattern discovery plays a central role in both descriptive and predictive
tasks across multiple domains. Actionable patterns must meet rigorous
statistical significance criteria and, in the presence of target variables,
further uphold discriminative power. Our work addresses the underexplored area
of guiding pattern discovery by integrating statistical significance and
discriminative power criteria into state-of-the-art algorithms while preserving
pattern quality. We also address how pattern quality thresholds, imposed by
some algorithms, can be rectified to accommodate these additional criteria. To
test the proposed methodology, we select the triclustering task as the guiding
pattern discovery case and extend well-known greedy and multi-objective
optimization triclustering algorithms, $\delta$-Trimax and TriGen, that use
various pattern quality criteria, such as Mean Squared Residual (MSR), Least
Squared Lines (LSL), and Multi Slope Measure (MSL). Results from three case
studies show the role of the proposed methodology in discovering patterns with
pronounced improvements of discriminative power and statistical significance
without quality deterioration, highlighting its importance in supervisedly
guiding the search. Although the proposed methodology is motivated over
multivariate time series data, it can be straightforwardly extended to pattern
discovery tasks involving multivariate, N-way (N&gt;3), transactional, and
sequential data structures.

<p class="mathjax">We propose a novel stereo-confidence that can be measured externally to
various stereo-matching networks, offering an alternative input modality choice
of the cost volume for learning-based approaches, especially in safety-critical
systems. Grounded in the foundational concepts of disparity definition and the
disparity plane sweep, the proposed stereo-confidence method is built upon the
idea that any shift in a stereo-image pair should be updated in a corresponding
amount shift in the disparity map. Based on this idea, the proposed
stereo-confidence method can be summarized in three folds. 1) Using the
disparity plane sweep, multiple disparity maps can be obtained and treated as a
3-D volume (predicted disparity volume), like the cost volume is constructed.
2) One of these disparity maps serves as an anchor, allowing us to define a
desirable (or ideal) disparity profile at every spatial point. 3) By comparing
the desirable and predicted disparity profiles, we can quantify the level of
matching ambiguity between left and right images for confidence measurement.
Extensive experimental results using various stereo-matching networks and
datasets demonstrate that the proposed stereo-confidence method not only shows
competitive performance on its own but also consistent performance improvements
when it is used as an input modality for learning-based stereo-confidence
methods.

<p class="mathjax">Anemia is a prevalent medical condition that typically requires invasive
blood tests for diagnosis and monitoring. Electronic health records (EHRs) have
emerged as valuable data sources for numerous medical studies. EHR-based
hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction is non-invasive and rapid but still
faces some challenges due to the fact that EHR data is typically an irregular
multivariate time series containing a significant number of missing values and
irregular time intervals. To address these issues, we introduce HgbNet, a
machine learning-based prediction model that emulates clinicians'
decision-making processes for hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction. The
model incorporates a NanDense layer with a missing indicator to handle missing
values and employs attention mechanisms to account for both local irregularity
and global irregularity. We evaluate the proposed method using two real-world
datasets across two use cases. In our first use case, we predict hemoglobin
level/anemia degree at moment T+1 by utilizing records from moments prior to
T+1. In our second use case, we integrate all historical records with
additional selected test results at moment T+1 to predict hemoglobin
level/anemia degree at the same moment, T+1. HgbNet outperforms the best
baseline results across all datasets and use cases. These findings demonstrate
the feasibility of estimating hemoglobin levels and anemia degree from EHR
data, positioning HgbNet as an effective non-invasive anemia diagnosis solution
that could potentially enhance the quality of life for millions of affected
individuals worldwide. To our knowledge, HgbNet is the first machine learning
model leveraging EHR data for hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction.

Language Models (ALMs) that involves identifying the most likely author of a
questioned document based on the perplexity of the questioned document
calculated for a set of causal language models fine-tuned on the writings of a

the CCAT50 dataset and the Blogs50 datasets. We find that ALMs achieves a

assess the performance of ALMs on shorter texts, we also conducted text

local information from a very limited neighborhood around each node, suffering
from loss of multi-modal information and overheads of excessive computation. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural
Network (TTG-NN), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning
built upon persistent homology, graph convolution, and tensor operations. This
new method incorporates tensor learning to simultaneously capture Tensor-view
Topological (TT), as well as Tensor-view Graph (TG) structural information on
both local and global levels. Computationally, to fully exploit graph topology
and structure, we propose two flexible TT and TG representation learning
modules that disentangle feature tensor aggregation and transformation and
learn to preserve multi-modal structure with less computation. Theoretically,
we derive high probability bounds on both the out-of-sample and in-sample mean
squared approximation errors for our proposed Tensor Transformation Layer
(TTL). Real data experiments show that the proposed TTG-NN outperforms 20
state-of-the-art methods on various graph benchmarks.

<p class="mathjax">In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems,
where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as the
leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as the follower) are
given by partition matroids with a common ground set. In contrast to classical
network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget
constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to
several independent cardinality constraints and engage in a zero-sum game.
While a single-level linear integer programming problem over a partition
matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered
bilevel problem is NP-hard, even when the objective function coefficients are
all binary. On a positive note, it turns out that, if the number of cardinality
constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered
class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes.
Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a
dynamic programming-based approach, and a 2-flip local search algorithm for the
leader.

<p class="mathjax">Context - The exponential growth of data is becoming a significant concern.
Managing this data has become incredibly challenging, especially when dealing
with various sources in different formats and speeds. Moreover, Ensuring data
quality has become increasingly crucial for effective decision-making and
operational processes. Data Architecture is crucial in describing, collecting,
storing, processing, and analyzing data to meet business needs. Providing an
abstract view of data-intensive applications is essential to ensure that the
data is transformed into valuable information. We must take these challenges
seriously to ensure we can effectively manage and use the data to our
advantage. Objective - To establish an architecture framework that enables a
comprehensive description of the data architecture and effectively streamlines
data quality monitoring. Method - The architecture framework utilizes Model
Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. Its backing of data-intensive architecture
descriptions empowers with an automated generation for data quality checks.
Result - The Framework offers a comprehensive solution for data-intensive
applications to model their architecture efficiently and monitor the quality of
their data. It automates the entire process and ensures precision and
consistency in data. With DAT, architects and analysts gain access to a
powerful tool that simplifies their workflow and empowers them to make informed
decisions based on reliable data insights. Conclusion - We have evaluated the
DAT on more than five cases within various industry domains, demonstrating its
exceptional adaptability and effectiveness.

<p class="mathjax">Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm
that has gained strong momentum in recent years. In federated learning, a
central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the
models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data.
Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to
encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is
largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly
problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be
strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting
methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side
such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be
impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy,
TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and
can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task,
especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs
for next global aggregation. TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector
machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out
regularization on class embeddings. We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple
datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent
validation with non-iid data distribution. Our results show that TurboSVM-FL
can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate
and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including
accuracy, F1 score, and MCC.

<p class="mathjax">It is necessary to develop efficient DNNs deployed on edge devices with
limited computation resources. However, the compressed networks often execute
new tasks in the target domain, which is different from the source domain where
the original network is trained. It is important to investigate the robustness
of compressed networks in two types of data distribution shifts: domain shifts
and adversarial perturbations. In this study, we discover that compressed
models are less robust to distribution shifts than their original networks.
Interestingly, larger networks are more vulnerable to losing robustness than
smaller ones, even when they are compressed to a similar size as the smaller
networks. Furthermore, compact networks obtained by knowledge distillation are
much more robust to distribution shifts than pruned networks. Finally,
post-training quantization is a reliable method for achieving significant
robustness to distribution shifts, and it outperforms both pruned and distilled
models in terms of robustness.

<p class="mathjax">In stereo-matching knowledge distillation methods of the self-supervised
monocular depth estimation, the stereo-matching network's knowledge is
distilled into a monocular depth network through pseudo-depth maps. In these
methods, the learning-based stereo-confidence network is generally utilized to
identify errors in the pseudo-depth maps to prevent transferring the errors.
However, the learning-based stereo-confidence networks should be trained with
ground truth (GT), which is not feasible in a self-supervised setting. In this
paper, we propose a method to identify and filter errors in the pseudo-depth
map using multiple disparity maps by checking their consistency without the
need for GT and a training process. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms the previous methods and works well on various
configurations by filtering out erroneous areas where the stereo-matching is
vulnerable, especially such as textureless regions, occlusion boundaries, and
reflective surfaces.

<p class="mathjax">The classic question of whether one should walk or run in the rain to remain
the least wet has inspired a myriad of solutions ranging from physically
performing test runs in raining conditions to mathematically modeling human
movement through rain. This manuscript approaches the classical problem by
simulating movement through rainfall using MATLAB. Our simulation was
generalizable to include snowfall as well. An increase in walking speed
resulted in a corresponding decrease in raindrop and snowflake collisions. When
raindrops or snowflakes were given a horizontal movement vector due to wind, a
local minimum in collisions was achieved when moving in parallel with the same
horizontal speed as the raindrop; no local minimum was detected with
antiparallel movement. In general, our simulation revealed that the faster one
moves, the drier one remains.

<p class="mathjax">The rapidly evolving field of robotics necessitates methods that can
facilitate the fusion of multiple modalities. Specifically, when it comes to
interacting with tangible objects, effectively combining visual and tactile
sensory data is key to understanding and navigating the complex dynamics of the
physical world, enabling a more nuanced and adaptable response to changing
environments. Nevertheless, much of the earlier work in merging these two
sensory modalities has relied on supervised methods utilizing datasets labeled
by humans.This paper introduces MViTac, a novel methodology that leverages
contrastive learning to integrate vision and touch sensations in a
self-supervised fashion. By availing both sensory inputs, MViTac leverages
intra and inter-modality losses for learning representations, resulting in
enhanced material property classification and more adept grasping prediction.
Through a series of experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our method
and its superiority over existing state-of-the-art self-supervised and
supervised techniques. In evaluating our methodology, we focus on two distinct
tasks: material classification and grasping success prediction. Our results
indicate that MViTac facilitates the development of improved modality encoders,
yielding more robust representations as evidenced by linear probing
assessments.

<p class="mathjax">Mathematical optimization is now widely regarded as an indispensable modeling
and solution tool for the design of wireless communications systems. While
optimization has played a significant role in the revolutionary progress in
wireless communication and networking technologies from 1G to 5G and onto the
future 6G, the innovations in wireless technologies have also substantially
transformed the nature of the underlying mathematical optimization problems
upon which the system designs are based and have sparked significant
innovations in the development of methodologies to understand, to analyze, and
to solve those problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of
recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless
communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of
mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system
design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated
mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an
overview of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms,
from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to
distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful
solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing and/or
developing suitable optimization algorithms (or neural network architectures)
that can exploit the underlying problem structure. We conclude the paper by
identifying several open research challenges and outlining future research
directions.

<p class="mathjax">During the diagnostic process, doctors incorporate multimodal information
including imaging and the medical history - and similarly medical AI
development has increasingly become multimodal. In this paper we tackle a more
subtle challenge: doctors take a targeted medical history to obtain only the
most pertinent pieces of information; how do we enable AI to do the same? We
develop a wrapper method named MINT (Make your model INTeractive) that
automatically determines what pieces of information are most valuable at each
step, and ask for only the most useful information. We demonstrate the efficacy
of MINT wrapping a skin disease prediction model, where multiple images and a
set of optional answers to $25$ standard metadata questions (i.e., structured
medical history) are used by a multi-modal deep network to provide a
differential diagnosis. We show that MINT can identify whether metadata inputs
are needed and if so, which question to ask next. We also demonstrate that when
collecting multiple images, MINT can identify if an additional image would be
beneficial, and if so, which type of image to capture. We showed that MINT
reduces the number of metadata and image inputs needed by 82% and 36.2%
respectively, while maintaining predictive performance. Using real-world AI
dermatology system data, we show that needing fewer inputs can retain users
that may otherwise fail to complete the system submission and drop off without
a diagnosis. Qualitative examples show MINT can closely mimic the step-by-step
decision making process of a clinical workflow and how this is different for
straight forward cases versus more difficult, ambiguous cases. Finally we
demonstrate how MINT is robust to different underlying multi-model classifiers
and can be easily adapted to user requirements without significant model
re-training.

<p class="mathjax">The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks
Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before
gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into
parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization
improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the
computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient
calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally
capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose
Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the
accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant
computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in
detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM
regarding training optimization and generalization. Code is available at
https://github.com/MarlonBecker/MSAM.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this paper is automatic character-aware subtitle generation.
Given a video and a minimal amount of metadata, we propose an audio-visual
method that generates a full transcript of the dialogue, with precise speech
timestamps, and the character speaking identified. The key idea is to first use
audio-visual cues to select a set of high-precision audio exemplars for each
character, and then use these exemplars to classify all speech segments by
speaker identity. Notably, the method does not require face detection or
tracking. We evaluate the method over a variety of TV sitcoms, including
Seinfeld, Fraiser and Scrubs. We envision this system being useful for the
automatic generation of subtitles to improve the accessibility of the vast
amount of videos available on modern streaming services. Project page :

<p class="mathjax">Many complex robotic manipulation tasks can be decomposed as a sequence of
pick and place actions. Training a robotic agent to learn this sequence over
many different starting conditions typically requires many iterations or
demonstrations, especially in 3D environments. In this work, we propose Fourier
Transporter (\ours{}) which leverages the two-fold $\SE(d)\times\SE(d)$
symmetry in the pick-place problem to achieve much higher sample efficiency.
\ours{} is an open-loop behavior cloning method trained using expert
demonstrations to predict pick-place actions on new environments. \ours{} is
constrained to incorporate symmetries of the pick and place actions
independently. Our method utilizes a fiber space Fourier transformation that
allows for memory-efficient construction. We test our proposed network on the
RLbench benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results across various tasks.

<p class="mathjax">3D Clothing modeling and datasets play crucial role in the entertainment,
animation, and digital fashion industries. Existing work often lacks detailed
semantic understanding or uses synthetic datasets, lacking realism and
personalization. To address this, we first introduce CloSe-D: a novel
large-scale dataset containing 3D clothing segmentation of 3167 scans, covering
a range of 18 distinct clothing classes. Additionally, we propose CloSe-Net,
the first learning-based 3D clothing segmentation model for fine-grained
segmentation from colored point clouds. CloSe-Net uses local point features,
body-clothing correlation, and a garment-class and point features-based
attention module, improving performance over baselines and prior work. The
proposed attention module enables our model to learn appearance and
geometry-dependent clothing prior from data. We further validate the efficacy
of our approach by successfully segmenting publicly available datasets of
people in clothing. We also introduce CloSe-T, a 3D interactive tool for
refining segmentation labels. Combining the tool with CloSe-T in a continual
learning setup demonstrates improved generalization on real-world data.

<p class="mathjax">Neuromorphic systems, inspired by the complexity and functionality of the
human brain, have gained interest in academic and industrial attention due to
their unparalleled potential across a wide range of applications. While their
capabilities herald innovation, it is imperative to underscore that these
computational paradigms, analogous to their traditional counterparts, are not
impervious to security threats. Although the exploration of neuromorphic
methodologies for image and video processing has been rigorously pursued, the
realm of neuromorphic audio processing remains in its early stages. Our results
highlight the robustness and precision of our FPGA-based neuromorphic system.
Specifically, our system showcases a commendable balance between desired signal
and background noise, efficient spike rate encoding, and unparalleled
resilience against adversarial attacks such as FGSM and PGD. A standout feature
of our framework is its detection rate of 94%, which, when compared to other
methodologies, underscores its greater capability in identifying and mitigating
threats within 5.39 dB, a commendable SNR ratio. Furthermore, neuromorphic
computing and hardware security serve many sensor domains in mission-critical
and privacy-preserving applications.

<p class="mathjax">We study the generalization performance of gradient methods in the
fundamental stochastic convex optimization setting, focusing on its dimension
dependence. First, for full-batch gradient descent (GD) we give a construction
of a learning problem in dimension $d=O(n^2)$, where the canonical version of
GD (tuned for optimal performance of the empirical risk) trained with $n$
training examples converges, with constant probability, to an approximate
empirical risk minimizer with $\Omega(1)$ population excess risk. Our bound
translates to a lower bound of $\Omega (\sqrt{d})$ on the number of training
examples required for standard GD to reach a non-trivial test error, answering
an open question raised by Feldman (2016) and Amir, Koren, and Livni (2021b)
and showing that a non-trivial dimension dependence is unavoidable.
Furthermore, for standard one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show
that an application of the same construction technique provides a similar
$\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ lower bound for the sample complexity of SGD to reach a
non-trivial empirical error, despite achieving optimal test performance. This
again provides an exponential improvement in the dimension dependence compared
to previous work (Koren, Livni, Mansour, and Sherman, 2022), resolving an open
question left therein.

<p class="mathjax">Bug tracking systems store many bug reports, some of which are related to
security. Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict
some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the
project can avoid threats and attacks. However, in the real world, the ratio of
security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction
model with raw data may result in inaccurate results. Faced with the massive
challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use
text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security
bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make
the dataset as balanced as possible. Nevertheless, there are still two
challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual
information. 2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset. To tackle
these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that
generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and
accurately detect security bug reports. Unlike previous studies, it first
converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which
are based on word2vec. Then, it trains a generative model through conditional
variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security
labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'. Finally, balanced data
are used to train a security bug report classifier. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from
Chromium and four Apache projects. The experimental results show that SEDAC
outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around
14.24%-50.10%.

Differential Equations), a framework for the verification of cyber-physical
systems. We describe the semantic foundations of the framework's formalisation
in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. A user-friendly language specification

various engineering workflows. New additions to the framework increase both its
expressivity and proof automation. Specifically, formalisations related to
forward diamond correctness specifications, certification of unique solutions
to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as flows, and invariant reasoning for

<p class="mathjax">We study the problem of stereo singing voice cancellation, a subtask of music
source separation, whose goal is to estimate an instrumental background from a
stereo mix. We explore how to achieve performance similar to large
state-of-the-art source separation networks starting from a small, efficient
model for real-time speech separation. Such a model is useful when memory and
compute are limited and singing voice processing has to run with limited
look-ahead. In practice, this is realised by adapting an existing mono model to
handle stereo input. Improvements in quality are obtained by tuning model
parameters and expanding the training set. Moreover, we highlight the benefits
a stereo model brings by introducing a new metric which detects attenuation
inconsistencies between channels. Our approach is evaluated using objective
offline metrics and a large-scale MUSHRA trial, confirming the effectiveness of
our techniques in stringent listening tests.

<p class="mathjax">While shallow decision trees may be interpretable, larger ensemble models
like gradient-boosted trees, which often set the state of the art in machine
learning problems involving tabular data, still remain black box models. As a
remedy, the Shapley value (SV) is a well-known concept in explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) research for quantifying additive feature
attributions of predictions. The model-specific TreeSHAP methodology solves the
exponential complexity for retrieving exact SVs from tree-based models.
Expanding beyond individual feature attribution, Shapley interactions reveal
the impact of intricate feature interactions of any order. In this work, we
present TreeSHAP-IQ, an efficient method to compute any-order additive Shapley
interactions for predictions of tree-based models. TreeSHAP-IQ is supported by
a mathematical framework that exploits polynomial arithmetic to compute the
interaction scores in a single recursive traversal of the tree, akin to Linear
TreeSHAP. We apply TreeSHAP-IQ on state-of-the-art tree ensembles and explore
interactions on well-established benchmark datasets.

<p class="mathjax">Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be
hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors.
However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language
models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated
text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only
requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method,
called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training
data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs
without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate
Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide
range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from
ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being
trained on any ChatGPT data.

<p class="mathjax">Memory bandwidth is known to be a performance bottleneck for FPGA
accelerators, especially when they deal with large multi-dimensional data-sets.
A large body of work focuses on reducing of off-chip transfers, but few authors
try to improve the efficiency of transfers. This paper addresses the later
issue by proposing (i) a compiler-based approach to accelerator's data layout
to maximize contiguous access to off-chip memory, and (ii) data packing and
runtime compression techniques that take advantage of this layout to further
improve memory performance. We show that our approach can decrease the I/O
cycles up to $7\times$ compared to un-optimized memory accesses.

<p class="mathjax">While structure learning achieves remarkable performance in high-resource
languages, the situation differs for under-represented languages due to the
scarcity of annotated data. This study focuses on assessing the efficacy of
transfer learning in enhancing dependency parsing for Javanese, a language
spoken by 80 million individuals but characterized by limited representation in
natural language processing. We utilized the Universal Dependencies dataset
consisting of dependency treebanks from more than 100 languages, including
Javanese. We propose two learning strategies to train the model: transfer
learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL). While TL only uses a
source language to pre-train the model, the HTL method uses a source language
and an intermediate language in the learning process. The results show that our
best model uses the HTL method, which improves performance with an increase of
10% for both UAS and LAS evaluations compared to the baseline model.

<p class="mathjax">The liberalisation of the European passenger railway markets through the
European Directive EU 91/440/EEC states a new scenario where different Railway
Undertakings compete with each other in a bidding process for time slots. The
infrastructure resources are provided by the Infrastructure Manager, who
analyses and assesses the bids received, allocating the resources to each
Railway Undertaking. Time slot allocation is a fact that drastically influences
the market equilibrium. In this paper, we address the time slot allocation
problem within the context of a liberalized passenger railway market as a
multi-objective model. The Infrastructure Manager is tasked with selecting a
point from the Pareto front as the solution to the time slot allocation
problem. We propose two criteria for making this selection: the first one
allocates time slots to each company according to a set of priorities, while
the second one introduces a criterion of fairness in the treatment of companies
to incentive competition. The assessment of the impact of these rules on market
equilibrium has been conducted on a liberalized high-speed corridor within the
Spanish railway network.

large-scale, highly adaptive crowdsourced information systems. These software
platforms can potentially nourish multiple software and requirements
engineering tasks based on user reviews and other natural language documents,
including feedback analysis, recommender systems and topic modelling.
Consequently, researchers often endeavour to overcome domain-specific
challenges, including integration of heterogeneous data sources, large-scale
data collection and adaptation of a publicly available data set for a given
research scenario. In this paper, we present MApp-KG, a combination of software
resources and data artefacts in the field of mobile app repositories to support
extended knowledge generation tasks. Our contribution aims to provide a
framework for automatically constructing a knowledge graph modelling a
domain-specific catalogue of mobile apps. Complementarily, we distribute
MApp-KG in a public triplestore and as a static data snapshot, which may be
promptly employed for future research and reproduction of our findings.

<p class="mathjax">Mirroring non-verbal social cues such as affect or movement can enhance
human-human and human-robot interactions in the real world. The robotic
platforms and control methods also impact people's perception of human-robot
interaction. However, limited studies have compared robot imitation across
different platforms and control methods. Our research addresses this gap by
conducting two experiments comparing people's perception of affective mirroring
between the iCub and Pepper robots and movement mirroring between vision-based
iCub control and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based iCub control. We
discovered that the iCub robot was perceived as more humanlike than the Pepper
robot when mirroring affect. A vision-based controlled iCub outperformed the
IMU-based controlled one in the movement mirroring task. Our findings suggest
that different robotic platforms impact people's perception of robots'
mirroring during HRI. The control method also contributes to the robot's
mirroring performance. Our work sheds light on the design and application of
different humanoid robots in the real world.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due
to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing
tasks. These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language
understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance.
However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific
corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations.
Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for
tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the
underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that
require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling
factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets.
Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past
and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing,
we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA
performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM
limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can
better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks. The code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/jwallat/temporalblindspots}.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, the problem of using one active unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
and four passive UAVs to localize a 3D target UAV in real time is investigated.
In the considered model, each passive UAV receives reflection signals from the
target UAV, which are initially transmitted by the active UAV. The received
reflection signals allow each passive UAV to estimate the signal transmission
distance which will be transmitted to a base station (BS) for the estimation of
the position of the target UAV. Due to the movement of the target UAV, each
active/passive UAV must optimize its trajectory to continuously localize the
target UAV. Meanwhile, since the accuracy of the distance estimation depends on
the signal-to-noise ratio of the transmission signals, the active UAV must
optimize its transmit power. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power of the active UAV
and trajectories of both active and passive UAVs so as to maximize the target
UAV positioning accuracy. To solve this problem, a Z function decomposition
based reinforcement learning (ZD-RL) method is proposed. Compared to value
function decomposition based RL (VD-RL), the proposed method can find the
probability distribution of the sum of future rewards to accurately estimate
the expected value of the sum of future rewards thus finding better transmit
power of the active UAV and trajectories for both active and passive UAVs and
improving target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the
proposed ZD-RL method can reduce the positioning errors by up to 39.4% and
64.6%, compared to VD-RL and independent deep RL methods, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">The success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in language
model alignment is strongly dependent on the quality of the underlying reward
model. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve reward model
quality by generating synthetic preference data, thereby augmenting the
training dataset with on-policy, high-quality preference pairs. Motivated by
the promising results of Best-of-N sampling strategies in language model
training, we extend their application to reward model training. This results in
a self-training strategy to generate preference pairs by selecting the best and
worst candidates in a pool of responses to a given query. Empirically, we find
that this approach improves the performance of any reward model, with an effect
comparable to the addition of a similar quantity of human preference data. This
work opens up new avenues of research for improving RLHF for language model
alignment, by offering synthetic preference generation as a solution to reward
modeling challenges.

<p class="mathjax">Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a
wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are
used to describe a task to the model. However, the performance of ICL varies
significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why
this happens or what factors will influence its choice. In this work, we first
revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model
aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and
model-dependent. We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration
selection method, \textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that
\textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its
contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a
simple and effective recipe for ICL. Empirically, our method yields consistent
improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different
model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and
stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified
explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods. Code will be released.

<p class="mathjax">Cooking recipes are one of the most readily available kinds of procedural
text. They consist of natural language instructions that can be challenging to
interpret. In this paper, we propose a model to identify relevant information
from recipes and generate a graph to represent the sequence of actions in the
recipe. In contrast with other approaches, we use an unsupervised approach. We
iteratively learn the graph structure and the parameters of a $\mathsf{GNN}$
encoding the texts (text-to-graph) one sequence at a time while providing the
supervision by decoding the graph into text (graph-to-text) and comparing the
generated text to the input. We evaluate the approach by comparing the
identified entities with annotated datasets, comparing the difference between
the input and output texts, and comparing our generated graphs with those
generated by state of the art methods.

<p class="mathjax">Blockchains are decentralized systems that provide trustable execution
guarantees. Smart contracts are programs written in specialized programming
languages running on blockchains that govern how tokens and cryptocurrency are
sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke other smart contracts during the
execution of transactions always initiated by external users.
<br />Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified, so techniques like runtime
verification are very appealing for improving their reliability. However, the
conventional model of computation of smart contracts is transactional: once
operations commit, their effects are permanent and cannot be undone.
<br />In this paper, we proposed the concept of future monitors which allows
monitors to remain waiting for future transactions to occur before committing
or aborting. This is inspired by optimistic rollups, which are modern
blockchain implementations that increase efficiency (and reduce cost) by
delaying transaction effects. We exploit this delay to propose a model of
computation that allows (bounded) future monitors. We show our monitors correct
respect of legacy transactions, how they implement future bounded monitors and
how they guarantee progress. We illustrate the use of future bounded monitors
to implement correctly multi-transaction flash loans.

<p class="mathjax">In-context learning (ICL) has consistently demonstrated superior performance
over zero-shot performance in large language models (LLMs). However, the
understanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstream
performance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG)
tasks. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilities
of LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-context
demonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). Our preliminary
investigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) is
predominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverse
perturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the task
instruction. We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across different
model families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced by
noise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend to
show enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbed
demonstrations. This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed by
several factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source or
target), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning for
downstream tasks if applicable. Further investigation is warranted to develop a
comprehensive understanding of these factors in future research.

<p class="mathjax">In a modern DBMS, working memory is frequently the limiting factor when
processing in-memory analytic query operations such as joins, sorting, and
aggregation. Existing resource estimation approaches for a DBMS estimate the
resource consumption of a query by computing an estimate of each individual
database operator in the query execution plan. Such an approach is slow and
error-prone as it relies upon simplifying assumptions, such as uniformity and
independence of the underlying data. Additionally, the existing approach
focuses on individual queries separately and does not factor in other queries
in the workload that may be executed concurrently. In this research, we are
interested in query performance optimization under concurrent execution of a
batch of queries (a workload). Specifically, we focus on predicting the memory
demand for a workload rather than providing separate estimates for each query
within it. We introduce the problem of workload memory prediction and formalize
it as a distribution regression problem. We propose Learned Workload Memory
Prediction (LearnedWMP) to improve and simplify estimating the working memory
demands of workloads. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show
that LearnedWMP reduces the memory estimation error of the
state-of-the-practice method by up to 47.6%. Compared to an alternative
single-query model, during training and inferencing, the LearnedWMP model and
its variants were 3x to 10x faster. Moreover, LearnedWMP-based models were at
least 50% smaller in most cases. Overall, the results demonstrate the
advantages of the LearnedWMP approach and its potential for a broader impact on
query performance optimization.

<p class="mathjax">In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks,
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as transformative tools for
dynamic and adaptive connectivity. However, dynamically adjusting their
position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational
challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced
communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and
full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV
mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for
UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF)
protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user
fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy.
Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption
characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing
appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that
capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and
their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple
access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is
formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that
the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore
the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory
and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of
UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.

<p class="mathjax">In parcel delivery, the "last mile" from the parcel hub to the customer is
costly, especially for time-sensitive delivery tasks that have to be completed
within hours after arrival. Recently, crowdshipping has attracted increased
attention as a new alternative to traditional delivery modes. In crowdshipping,
private citizens ("the crowd") perform short detours in their daily lives to
contribute to parcel delivery in exchange for small incentives. However,
achieving desirable crowd behavior is challenging as the crowd is highly
dynamic and consists of autonomous, self-interested individuals. Leveraging
crowdshipping for time-sensitive deliveries remains an open challenge. In this
paper, we present an agent-based approach to on-time parcel delivery with
crowds. Our system performs data stream processing on the couriers' smartphone
sensor data to predict delivery delays. Whenever a delay is predicted, the
system attempts to forge an agreement for transferring the parcel from the
current deliverer to a more promising courier nearby. Our experiments show that
through accurate delay predictions and purposeful task transfers many delays
can be prevented that would occur without our approach.

<p class="mathjax">Computational modeling of the melt pool dynamics in laser-based powder bed
fusion metal additive manufacturing (PBF-LB/M) promises to shed light on
fundamental defect generation mechanisms. These processes are typically
accompanied by rapid evaporation so that the evaporation-induced recoil
pressure and cooling arise as major driving forces for fluid dynamics and
temperature evolution. The magnitude of these interface fluxes depends
exponentially on the melt pool surface temperature, which, therefore, must be
predicted with high accuracy. The present work utilizes a diffuse interface
model based on a continuum surface flux (CSF) description on the interfaces to
study dimensionally reduced thermal two-phase problems representing PBF-LB/M in
a finite element framework. It is demonstrated that the extreme temperature
gradients combined with the high ratios of material properties between metal
and ambient gas lead to significant errors in the interface temperatures and
fluxes when classical CSF approaches, along with typical interface thicknesses
and discretizations, are applied. A novel parameter-scaled CSF approach is
proposed, which is constructed to yield a smoother temperature rate in the
diffuse interface region, significantly increasing the solution accuracy. The
interface thickness required to predict the temperature field with a given
level of accuracy is less restrictive by at least one order of magnitude for
the proposed parameter-scaled CSF approach compared to classical CSF,
drastically reducing computational costs. Finally, we showcased the general
applicability of the parameter-scaled CSF to a three-dimensional simulation of
stationary laser melting of PBF-LB/M considering the fully coupled
thermo-hydrodynamic multi-phase problem, including phase change.

<p class="mathjax">While large language models (LLMs) are still being adopted to new domains and
utilized in novel applications, we are experiencing an influx of the new
generation of foundation models, namely multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs). These models integrate verbal and visual information, opening new
possibilities to demonstrate more complex reasoning abilities at the
intersection of the two modalities. However, despite the revolutionizing
prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited.
In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of
open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive
Matrices. Our experiments expose the difficulty of solving such problems while
showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We
also reveal critical shortcomings with individual visual and textual modules,
subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings. Finally, to improve MLLMs'
performance, we experiment with various methods, such as Chain-of-Thought
prompting, resulting in a significant (up to 100%) boost in performance.

<p class="mathjax">The goal of this paper is to rigorously interrogate conventional wisdom about
centralization in block-building (due to, e.g., MEV and private order flow) and
the outsourcing of block-building by validators to specialists (i.e.,
proposer-builder separation):
<br />1. Does heterogeneity in skills and knowledge across block producers
inevitably lead to centralization?
<br />2. Does proposer-builder separation eliminate heterogeneity and preserve
decentralization among proposers?
<br />This paper develops mathematical models and results that offer answers to
these questions:
<br />1. In a game-theoretic model with endogenous staking, heterogeneous block
producer rewards, and staking costs, we quantify the extent to which
heterogeneous rewards lead to concentration in the equilibrium staking
distribution.

reinvest rewards into staking, we quantify, as a function of the block producer
heterogeneity, the rate at which stake concentrates on the most sophisticated
block producers.

<p class="mathjax">Despite the intuition that the same population size is not needed throughout
the run of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), most EAs use a fixed population
size. This paper presents an empirical study on the possible benefits of a
Simple Variable Population Sizing (SVPS) scheme on the performance of Genetic
Algorithms (GAs). It consists in decreasing the population for a GA run
following a predetermined schedule, configured by a speed and a severity
parameter. The method uses as initial population size an estimation of the
minimum size needed to supply enough building blocks, using a fixed-size
selectorecombinative GA converging within some confidence interval toward good
solutions for a particular problem. Following this methodology, a scalability
analysis is conducted on deceptive, quasi-deceptive, and non-deceptive trap
functions in order to assess whether SVPS-GA improves performances compared to
a fixed-size GA under different problem instances and difficulty levels.
Results show several combinations of speed-severity where SVPS-GA preserves the
solution quality while improving performances, by reducing the number of
evaluations needed for success.

<p class="mathjax">Programming can be challenging for novices, but it is difficult to provide
high-quality, comprehensive, and timely support at scale. Generative AI and its
products, like ChatGPT, can create a solution for most introductory programming
problems. However, students may become overly reliant on these tools for quick
code generation and homework completion, leading to reduced engagement and
limited learning. In this work, we present \sys{}, a system that utilizes large
language models (LLM) while still promoting students' cognitive engagement.
\sys{} provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students.
In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order
to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with 800 incorrect student code
demonstrated that \sys{} can efficiently create high-quality (correct,
personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles for students. In a within-subjects
experiment with 18 novice programmers, most students rated using \sys{} as more
engaging, and they preferred \sys{} for learning rather than simply receiving
an AI-generated solution. Additionally, students recalled more new elements
from the supported practice to the posttest after using \sys{}, compared to
when they simply received a direct solution. Qualitative observations and
interviews provided evidence for the benefits of \sys{} including emphasizing
algorithmic thinking, fostering continuity in learning, promoting metacognitive
reflection, and boosting student confidence. We conclude by suggesting future
designs for applying generative AI in a way that minimizes over-reliance and
enhances learning.

<p class="mathjax">As deep neural networks become adopted in high-stakes domains, it is crucial
to be able to identify when inference inputs are Out-of-Distribution (OOD) so
that users can be alerted of likely drops in performance and calibration
despite high confidence. Among many others, existing methods use the following
two scores to do so without training on any apriori OOD examples: a learned
temperature and an energy score. In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned
Temperature Energy (or "AbeT" for short), a method which combines these prior
methods in novel ways with effective modifications. Due to these contributions,
AbeT lowers the False Positive Rate at $95\%$ True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by
$35.39\%$ in classification (averaged across all ID and OOD datasets measured)
compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or
requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide
empirical insights as to how our model learns to distinguish between
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID
samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we
show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and
pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic
segmentation, respectively - with an AUROC increase of $5.15\%$ in object
detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\%$ and an increase in AUPRC
of $34.20\%$ on average in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of
the art.

<p class="mathjax">Introduction Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)-Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) models were studied to provide sequential relationships for each
timepoint in MRIs of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this pilot
study, we compared three QCNN-LSTM models for binary classification of MS
disability benchmarked against classical neural network architectures. Our
hypothesis is that quantum models will provide competitive performance. Methods
Matrix Product State (MPS), reverse Multistate Entanglement Renormalization
Ansatz (MERA), and Tree-Tensor Network (TTN) circuits were paired with LSTM
layer to process near-annual MRI data of patients diagnosed with MS. These were
benchmarked against a Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-LSTM and a Video Vision
Transformer (ViViT). Predicted logits were measured against ground truth labels
of each patient's Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS) using binary
cross-entropy loss. Training/validation/holdout testing was partitioned using
5-fold cross validation with a total split of 60:20:20. Levene's test of
variance was used to measure statistical difference and Student's t-test for
paired model differences in mean. Results The MPS-LSTM, reverse MERA-LSTM, and
TTN-LSTM had holdout testing ROC-AUC of 0.70, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively
(p-value 0.915). VGG16-LSTM and ViViT performed similarly with ROC-AUC of 0.73
and 0.77, respectively (p-value 0.631). Overall variance and mean were not
statistically significant (p-value 0.713), however, time to train was
significantly faster for the QCNN-LSTMs (39.4 sec per fold vs. 224 and 218,
respectively, p-value &lt;0.001). Conclusion QCNN-LSTM models perform
competitively to their classical counterparts with greater efficiency in train
time. Clinically, these can add value in terms of efficiency to time-dependent
deep learning prediction of disease progression based upon medical imaging.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding and recognizing emotions are important and challenging issues
in the metaverse era. Understanding, identifying, and predicting fear, which is
one of the fundamental human emotions, in virtual reality (VR) environments
plays an essential role in immersive game development, scene development, and
next-generation virtual human-computer interaction applications. In this
article, we used VR horror games as a medium to analyze fear emotions by
collecting multi-modal data (posture, audio, and physiological signals) from 23
players. We used an LSTM-based model to predict fear with accuracies of 65.31%
and 90.47% under 6-level classification (no fear and five different levels of
fear) and 2-level classification (no fear and fear), respectively. We
constructed a multi-modal natural behavior dataset of immersive human fear
responses (VRMN-bD) and compared it with existing relevant advanced datasets.
The results show that our dataset has fewer limitations in terms of collection
method, data scale and audience scope. We are unique and advanced in targeting
multi-modal datasets of fear and behavior in VR stand-up interactive
environments. Moreover, we discussed the implications of this work for
communities and applications. The dataset and pre-trained model are available
at https://github.com/KindOPSTAR/VRMN-bD.

<p class="mathjax">While Spin Waves (SW) interaction provides natural support for low power
Majority (MAJ) gate implementations many hurdles still exists on the road
towards the realization of practically relevant SW circuits. In this paper we
leave the SW interaction avenue and propose Threshold Logic (TL) inspired SW
computing, which relies on successive phase rotations applied to one single SW
instead of on the interference of an odd number of SWs. After providing a short
TL inside we introduce the SW TL gate concept and discuss the way to mirror TL
gate weight and threshold values into physical phase-shifter parameters.
Subsequently, we design and demonstrate proper operation of a SW TL based Full
Adder (FA) by means of micro-magnetic simulations. We conclude the paper by
providing inside on the potential advantages of our proposal by means of a
conceptual comparison of MAJ and TL based FA implementations.

<p class="mathjax">Hamiltonian Operator Inference has been introduced in [Sharma, H., Wang, Z.,
Kramer, B., Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 431, p.133122, 2022] to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) for Hamiltonian systems. This
approach constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of
the Hamiltonian function. Such ROMs can keep the intrinsic structure of the
system, allowing them to capture the physics described by the governing
equations. In this work, we extend this approach to more general systems that
are either conservative or dissipative in energy, and which possess a gradient
structure. We derive the optimization problems for inferring
structure-preserving ROMs that preserve the gradient structure. We further
derive an {\em a priori} error estimate for the reduced-order approximation. To
test the algorithms, we consider semi-discretized partial differential
equations with gradient structure, such as the parameterized wave and
Korteweg-de-Vries equations in the conservative case and the one- and
two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equations in the dissipative case. The numerical
results illustrate the accuracy, structure-preservation properties, and
predictive capabilities of the gradient-preserving Operator Inference ROMs.

<p class="mathjax">The representation degeneration problem is a phenomenon that is widely
observed among self-supervised learning methods based on Transformers. In NLP,
it takes the form of anisotropy, a singular property of hidden representations
which makes them unexpectedly close to each other in terms of angular distance
(cosine-similarity). Some recent works tend to show that anisotropy is a
consequence of optimizing the cross-entropy loss on long-tailed distributions
of tokens. We show in this paper that anisotropy can also be observed
empirically in language models with specific objectives that should not suffer
directly from the same consequences. We also show that the anisotropy problem
extends to Transformers trained on other modalities. Our observations suggest
that anisotropy is actually inherent to Transformers-based models.

<p class="mathjax">Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) provides bandwidth-efficient
learning by leveraging the inherent superposition property of wireless
channels. Personalized federated learning balances performance for users with
diverse datasets, addressing real-life data heterogeneity. We propose the first
personalized OTA-FL scheme through multi-task learning, assisted by personal
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for each user. We take a cross-layer
approach that optimizes communication and computation resources for global and
personalized tasks in time-varying channels with imperfect channel state
information, using multi-task learning for non-i.i.d data. Our PROAR-PFed
algorithm adaptively designs power, local iterations, and RIS configurations.
We present convergence analysis for non-convex objectives and demonstrate that
PROAR-PFed outperforms state-of-the-art on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

<p class="mathjax">In 2018, Yang et al. introduced a novel and effective approach, using maximum
distance separable (MDS) codes, to mitigate the impact of elasticity in cloud
computing systems. This approach is referred to as coded elastic computing.
Some limitations of this approach include that it assumes all virtual machines
have the same computing speeds and storage capacities, and it cannot tolerate
stragglers for matrix-matrix multiplications. In order to resolve these
limitations, in this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial optimization
framework, named uncoded storage coded transmission elastic computing (USCTEC),
for heterogeneous speeds and storage constraints, aiming to minimize the
expected computation time for matrix-matrix multiplications, under the
consideration of straggler tolerance. Within this framework, we propose optimal
solutions with straggler tolerance under relaxed storage constraints. Moreover,
we propose a heuristic algorithm that considers the heterogeneous storage
constraints. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms
baseline solutions utilizing cyclic storage placements, in terms of both
expected computation time and storage size.

<p class="mathjax">Social identities play an important role in the dynamics of human societies,
and it can be argued that some sense of identification with a larger cause or
idea plays a critical role in making humans act responsibly. Often social
activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion --
like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social
changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social
identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an
agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how
this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of
identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an
application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social
identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.

<p class="mathjax">Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions,
especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial
expressions, presents challenges. Existing measures, relying on direct
observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity. In cerebral palsy,
pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.
Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of
enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.
<br />Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals
with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system
based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.
<br />Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases,
including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the
Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.
Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109
preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral
palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding
System observational scale.
<br />Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset,
achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%. Explainable
artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for
pain identification across models.
<br />Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for
robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and
communication disabilities. The creation of a larger dataset specific to
cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool
for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions. The insights gained
could extend to other complex neurological conditions.

<p class="mathjax">Image segmentation is a clustering task whereby each pixel is assigned a
cluster label. Remote sensing data usually consists of multiple bands of
spectral images in which there exist semantically meaningful land cover
subregions, co-registered with other source data such as LIDAR (LIght Detection
And Ranging) data, where available. This suggests that, in order to account for
spatial correlation between pixels, a feature vector associated with each pixel
may be a vectorized tensor representing the multiple bands and a local patch as
appropriate. Similarly, multiple types of texture features based on a pixel's
local patch would also be beneficial for encoding locally statistical
information and spatial variations, without necessarily labelling pixel-wise a
large amount of ground truth, then training a supervised model, which is
sometimes impractical. In this work, by resorting to label only a small
quantity of pixels, a new semi-supervised segmentation approach is proposed.
Initially, over all pixels, an image data matrix is created in high dimensional
feature space. Then, t-SNE projects the high dimensional data onto 3D
embedding. By using radial basis functions as input features, which use the
labelled data samples as centres, to pair with the output class labels, a
modified canonical correlation analysis algorithm, referred to as RBF-CCA, is
introduced which learns the associated projection matrix via the small labelled
data set. The associated canonical variables, obtained for the full image, are
applied by k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed semi-supervised RBF-CCA
algorithm has been implemented on several remotely sensed multispectral images,
demonstrating excellent segmentation results.

<p class="mathjax">Understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships is a fundamental
capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. While Vision
Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA
benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as
recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or
size differences. We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning
capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim
to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning
data. To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach. We first
develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to
2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. We then investigate
various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training
pipeline, and VLM architecture. Our work features the first internet-scale 3D
spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By training a VLM on such data, we
significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial
VQA. Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream
applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its
quantitative estimation capability. Project website:

<p class="mathjax">Strategies synthesized using formal methods can be complex and often require
infinite memory, which does not correspond to the expected behavior when trying
to model Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). To capture such behaviors, natural
strategies are a recently proposed framework striking a balance between the
ability of agents to strategize with memory and the model-checking complexity,
but until now has been restricted to fully deterministic settings. For the
first time, we consider the probabilistic temporal logics PATL and PATL* under
natural strategies (NatPATL and NatPATL*, resp.). As main result we show that,
in stochastic MAS, NatPATL model-checking is NP-complete when the active
coalition is restricted to deterministic strategies. We also give a 2NEXPTIME
complexity result for NatPATL* with the same restriction. In the unrestricted
case, we give an EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL and 3EXPSPACE complexity for
NatPATL*.

analysis of an energy-efficient control is addressed in the framework of
Networked Control System (NCS). The control scheme under study integrates
periodic event-triggered control, packet-based control, time-varying Kalman

reducing energy consumption and bandwidth usage. The robust stability against
time-varying model uncertainties is analyzed by means of a suficient condition

<p class="mathjax">We propose to employ a recently developed IoT-based wireless technology, so
called low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), to exploit their long range, low
power, and inherent compatibility to cloud storage and computing. We create a
remotely-operated minimum-maintenance wireless solution for four major seismic
applications of interest. By proposing appropriate network architecture and
data coordination (aggregation and transmission) designs we show that neither
the low data-rate nor the low duty-cycle of LPWANs impose fundamental issues in
handling a considerable amount of data created by complex seismic scenarios as
long as the application is delay-tolerant. In order to confirm this claim, we
cast our ideas into a practical large-scale networking design for simultaneous
seismic monitoring and interferometry and carry out an analysis on the data
generation and transmission rates. Finally, we present some results from a
small-scale field test in which we have employed our IoT-based wireless nodes
for real-time seismic quality control (QC) over clouds.

Reconstruction Model designed to predict human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

Furthermore, to enhance the model's applicability for in-the-wild scenarios

model. This generative extension addresses the inherent variations in human
body shapes when observed from a single view, and makes it possible to

<p class="mathjax">Detecting anomalies in poultry houses is crucial for maintaining optimal
chicken health conditions, minimizing economic losses and bolstering
profitability. This paper presents a novel real-time framework for analyzing
chicken behavior in cage-free poultry houses to detect abnormal behaviors.
Specifically, two significant abnormalities, namely inactive broiler and
huddling behavior, are investigated in this study. The proposed framework
comprises three key steps: (1) chicken detection utilizing a state-of-the-art
deep learning model, (2) tracking individual chickens across consecutive frames
with a fast tracker module, and (3) detecting abnormal behaviors within the
video stream. Experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
the proposed algorithm in accurately assessing chicken behavior. The results
illustrate that our framework provides a precise and efficient solution for
real-time anomaly detection, facilitating timely interventions to maintain
chicken health and enhance overall productivity on poultry farms. Github:

<p class="mathjax">Multi-label classification problems with thousands of classes are hard to
solve with in-context learning alone, as language models (LMs) might lack prior
knowledge about the precise classes or how to assign them, and it is generally
infeasible to demonstrate every class in a prompt. We propose a general
program, $\texttt{Infer--Retrieve--Rank}$, that defines multi-step interactions
between LMs and retrievers to efficiently tackle such problems. We implement
this program using the $\texttt{DSPy}$ programming model, which specifies
in-context systems in a declarative manner, and use $\texttt{DSPy}$ optimizers
to tune it towards specific datasets by bootstrapping only tens of few-shot
examples. Our primary extreme classification program, optimized separately for
each task, attains state-of-the-art results across three benchmarks (HOUSE,
TECH, TECHWOLF). We apply the same program to a benchmark with vastly different
characteristics and attain competitive performance as well (BioDEX). Unlike
prior work, our proposed solution requires no finetuning, is easily applicable
to new tasks, alleviates prompt engineering, and requires only tens of labeled
examples. Our code is public at https://github.com/KarelDO/xmc.dspy.

<p class="mathjax">We propose Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization (DITTO), a general-purpose
frame-work for controlling pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at
inference-time via optimizing initial noise latents. Our method can be used to
optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target
(stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency.
We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation
including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody,
and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying
model. When we compare our approach against related training, guidance, and
optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance
on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on
controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the
door for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models.

<p class="mathjax">A basic question within the emerging field of mechanistic interpretability is
the degree to which neural networks learn the same underlying mechanisms. In
other words, are neural mechanisms universal across different models? In this
work, we study the universality of individual neurons across GPT2 models
trained from different initial random seeds, motivated by the hypothesis that
universal neurons are likely to be interpretable. In particular, we compute
pairwise correlations of neuron activations over 100 million tokens for every
neuron pair across five different seeds and find that 1-5\% of neurons are
universal, that is, pairs of neurons which consistently activate on the same
inputs. We then study these universal neurons in detail, finding that they
usually have clear interpretations and taxonomize them into a small number of
neuron families. We conclude by studying patterns in neuron weights to
establish several universal functional roles of neurons in simple circuits:
deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token
distribution, and predicting the next token to (not) be within a particular
set.

<p class="mathjax">Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices often leverage the local network to
communicate with the corresponding companion app or other devices. This has
benefits in terms of efficiency since it offloads the cloud. ENISA and NIST
security guidelines underscore the importance of enabling default local
communication for safety and reliability. Indeed, an IoT device should continue
to function in case the cloud connection is not available. While the security
of cloud-device connections is typically strengthened through the usage of
standard protocols, local connectivity security is frequently overlooked.
Neglecting the security of local communication opens doors to various threats,
including replay attacks. In this paper, we investigate this class of attacks
by designing a systematic methodology for automatically testing IoT devices
vulnerability to replay attacks. Specifically, we propose a tool, named
REPLIOT, able to test whether a replay attack is successful or not, without
prior knowledge of the target devices. We perform thousands of automated
experiments using popular commercial devices spanning various vendors and
categories. Notably, our study reveals that among these devices, 51% of them do
not support local connectivity, thus they are not compliant with the
reliability and safety requirements of the ENISA/NIST guidelines. We find that
75% of the remaining devices are vulnerable to replay attacks with REPLIOT
having a detection accuracy of 0.98-1. Finally, we investigate the possible
causes of this vulnerability, discussing possible mitigation strategies.

<p class="mathjax">Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through
reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit
failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without
meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when
designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL
process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose
Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then
averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that
fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same
pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the
traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under
distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our
experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that
WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for
example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy
RL fine-tuned with a single RM.

<p class="mathjax">Representing textual information as real-numbered embeddings has become the
norm in NLP. Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language
models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a
business model. This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous
research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from
embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them.
However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other
languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. %As many international and
multilingual companies leverage EaaS, there is an urgent need for research into
multilingual LLM security. To this end, this work investigates LLM security
from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion. Concretely, we define
the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with
special attention to a cross-domain scenario. Our findings reveal that
multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than
their monolingual counterparts. This stems from the reduced data requirements
for achieving comparable inversion performance in settings where the underlying
language is not known a-priori. To our knowledge, this work is the first to
delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our
findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in
the area of NLP Security.

<p class="mathjax">Side-channel analysis has been proven effective at detecting hardware Trojans
in integrated circuits (ICs). However, most detection techniques rely on large
external probes and antennas for data collection and require a long measurement
time to detect Trojans. Such limitations make these techniques impractical for
run-time deployment and ineffective in detecting small Trojans with subtle
side-channel signatures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
Programmable Sensor Array (PSA) for run-time hardware Trojan detection,
localization, and identification. PSA is a tampering-resilient integrated
on-chip magnetic field sensor array that can be re-programmed to change the
sensors' shape, size, and location. Using PSA, EM side-channel measurement
results collected from sensors at different locations on an IC can be analyzed
to localize and identify the Trojan. The PSA has better performance than
conventional external magnetic probes and state-of-the-art on-chip single-coil
magnetic field sensors. We fabricated an AES-128 test chip with four AES
Hardware Trojans. They were successfully detected, located, and identified with
the proposed on-chip PSA within 10 milliseconds using our proposed cross-domain
analysis.

<p class="mathjax">This paper documents the results from the highly successful Lunar flashlight
Optical Navigation Experiment with a Star tracker (LONEStar). Launched in
December 2022, Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a NASA-funded technology demonstration
mission. After a propulsion system anomaly prevented capture in lunar orbit, LF
was ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into heliocentric space. NASA
subsequently transferred ownership of LF to Georgia Tech to conduct an unfunded
extended mission to demonstrate further advanced technology objectives,
including LONEStar. From August-December 2023, the LONEStar team performed
on-orbit calibration of the optical instrument and a number of different OPNAV
experiments. This campaign included the processing of nearly 400 images of star
fields, Earth and Moon, and four other planets (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn). LONEStar provided the first on-orbit demonstrations of heliocentric
navigation using only optical observations of planets. Of special note is the
successful in-flight demonstration of (1) instantaneous triangulation with
simultaneous sightings of two planets with the LOST algorithm and (2) dynamic
triangulation with sequential sightings of multiple planets.

<p class="mathjax">Fine-tuning and inference with large Language Models (LM) are generally known
to be expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces
training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not
improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference
efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases
training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we
introduce APT that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the
early stage of fine-tuning, APT dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for
fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for
efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up
to 98% task performance when pruning RoBERTa and T5 models with 40% parameters
left while keeping 86.4% LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters
remained. Furthermore, APT speeds up LMs fine-tuning by up to 8x and reduces
large LMs memory training footprint by up to 70%.

<p class="mathjax">Remarkable progress has been made in recent years in the fields of vision,
language, and robotics. We now have vision models capable of recognizing
objects based on language queries, navigation systems that can effectively
control mobile systems, and grasping models that can handle a wide range of
objects. Despite these advancements, general-purpose applications of robotics
still lag behind, even though they rely on these fundamental capabilities of
recognition, navigation, and grasping. In this paper, we adopt a systems-first
approach to develop a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework called
OK-Robot. By combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for object detection,
navigation primitives for movement, and grasping primitives for object
manipulation, OK-Robot offers a integrated solution for pick-and-drop
operations without requiring any training. To evaluate its performance, we run
OK-Robot in 10 real-world home environments. The results demonstrate that
OK-Robot achieves a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop tasks,
representing a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation
(OVMM) with nearly 1.8x the performance of prior work. On cleaner, uncluttered
environments, OK-Robot's performance increases to 82%. However, the most
important insight gained from OK-Robot is the critical role of nuanced details
when combining Open Knowledge systems like VLMs with robotic modules. Videos of
our experiments are available on our website: https://ok-robot.github.io

<p class="mathjax">Logic synthesis, a pivotal stage in chip design, entails optimizing chip
specifications encoded in hardware description languages like Verilog into
highly efficient implementations using Boolean logic gates. The process
involves a sequential application of logic minimization heuristics (``synthesis
recipe"), with their arrangement significantly impacting crucial metrics such
as area and delay. Addressing the challenge posed by the broad spectrum of
design complexities - from variations of past designs (e.g., adders and
multipliers) to entirely novel configurations (e.g., innovative processor
instructions) - requires a nuanced `synthesis recipe` guided by human expertise
and intuition. This study conducts a thorough examination of learning and
search techniques for logic synthesis, unearthing a surprising revelation:
pre-trained agents, when confronted with entirely novel designs, may veer off
course, detrimentally affecting the search trajectory. We present ABC-RL, a
meticulously tuned $\alpha$ parameter that adeptly adjusts recommendations from
pre-trained agents during the search process. Computed based on similarity
scores through nearest neighbor retrieval from the training dataset, ABC-RL
yields superior synthesis recipes tailored for a wide array of hardware
designs. Our findings showcase substantial enhancements in the
Quality-of-result (QoR) of synthesized circuits, boasting improvements of up to
24.8% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, ABC-RL achieves an
impressive up to 9x reduction in runtime (iso-QoR) when compared to current
state-of-the-art methodologies.

<p class="mathjax">We study the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a memoryless
source model in the asymptotic limit of large block-lengths. Our perception
measure is based on a divergence between the distributions of the source and
reconstruction sequences conditioned on the encoder output, which was first
proposed in [1], [2]. We consider the case when there is no shared randomness
between the encoder and the decoder. For the case of discrete memoryless
sources we derive a single-letter characterization of the RDP function, thus
settling a problem that remains open for the marginal metric introduced in Blau
and Michaeli [3] (with no shared randomness). Our achievability scheme is based
on lossy source coding with a posterior reference map proposed in [4]. For the
case of continuous valued sources under squared error distortion measure and
squared quadratic Wasserstein perception measure we also derive a single-letter
characterization and show that a noise-adding mechanism at the decoder suffices
to achieve the optimal representation. For the case of zero perception loss, we
show that our characterization interestingly coincides with the results for the
marginal metric derived in [5], [6] and again demonstrate that zero perception
loss can be achieved with a $3$-dB penalty in the minimum distortion. Finally
we specialize our results to the case of Gaussian sources. We derive the RDP
function for vector Gaussian sources and propose a waterfilling type solution.
We also partially characterize the RDP function for a mixture of vector
Gaussians.

<p class="mathjax">Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging test in
clinical practice. Recent advances in the development of vision-language
foundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated
CXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making
and improve patient outcomes. However, developing FMs that can accurately
interpret CXRs is challenging due to the (1) limited availability of
large-scale vision-language datasets in the medical image domain, (2) lack of
vision and language encoders that can capture the complexities of medical data,
and (3) absence of evaluation frameworks for benchmarking the abilities of FMs
on CXR interpretation. In this work, we address these challenges by first
introducing \emph{CheXinstruct} - a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset
curated from 28 publicly-available datasets. We then present \emph{CheXagent} -
an instruction-tuned FM capable of analyzing and summarizing CXRs. To build
CheXagent, we design a clinical large language model (LLM) for parsing
radiology reports, a vision encoder for representing CXR images, and a network
to bridge the vision and language modalities. Finally, we introduce
\emph{CheXbench} - a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate FMs
across 8 clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks. Extensive quantitative
evaluations and qualitative reviews with five expert radiologists demonstrate
that CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs
on CheXbench tasks. Furthermore, in an effort to improve model transparency, we
perform a fairness evaluation across factors of sex, race and age to highlight
potential performance disparities. Our project is at

<p class="mathjax">Recent advances in Deep Learning and Computer Vision have been successfully
leveraged to serve marginalized communities in various contexts. One such area
is Sign Language - a primary means of communication for the deaf community.
However, so far, the bulk of research efforts and investments have gone into
American Sign Language, and research activity into low-resource sign languages
- especially Bangla Sign Language - has lagged significantly. In this research
paper, we present a new word-level Bangla Sign Language dataset - BdSL40 -
consisting of 611 videos over 40 words, along with two different approaches:
one with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network model and another with a novel Graph
Neural Network approach for the classification of BdSL40 dataset. This is the
first study on word-level BdSL recognition, and the dataset was transcribed
from Indian Sign Language (ISL) using the Bangla Sign Language Dictionary
(1997). The proposed GNN model achieved an F1 score of 89%. The study
highlights the significant lexical and semantic similarity between BdSL, West
Bengal Sign Language, and ISL, and the lack of word-level datasets for BdSL in
the literature. We release the dataset and source code to stimulate further
research.

<p class="mathjax">A fundamental issue in the $\lambda$-calculus is to find appropriate notions
for meaningfulness. Inspired by well-known results for the call-by-name
$\lambda$-calculus (CbN), where meaningful terms are identified to the solvable
ones, this paper validates the challenging claim that the notion of potential
valuability (aka scrutability), previously introduced in the literature,
adequately represents meaningfulness in the call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus
(CbV). Akin to CbN, this claim is corroborated by proving two essential
properties. The first one is genericity, stating that meaningless subterms have
no bearing on evaluating normalizing terms. To prove this, we use a novel
approach based on stratified reduction, indifferently applicable to CbN and
CbV. The second property concerns consistency of the smallest congruence
relation resulting from equating all meaningless terms (without equating all
terms). We also show that such a congruence has a unique consistent and maximal
extension, which coincides with a natural notion of observational equivalence.
Our results thus supply the formal concepts and tools that validate the
informal notion of meaningfulness underlying CbN and CbV.

<p class="mathjax">The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at
efficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity while ensuring
its safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality
dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the
water quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the
optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality
dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple
these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs
between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper examines the
dependency and influence from a control-theoretic standpoint. More
specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality
controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We
examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as
well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve
this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability
metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is
attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We
assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with
a wide range of numerical scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that was initially developed for
exploiting pre-trained large language models has recently emerged as an
effective approach to perform transfer learning on computer vision tasks.
However, the effectiveness of PEFT on medical vision foundation models is still
unclear and remains to be explored. As a proof of concept, we conducted a
detailed empirical study on applying PEFT to chest radiography foundation
models. Specifically, we delved into LoRA, a representative PEFT method, and
compared it against full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) on two self-supervised
radiography foundation models across three well-established chest radiograph
datasets. Our results showed that LoRA outperformed FFT in 13 out of 18
transfer learning tasks by at most 2.9% using fewer than 1% tunable parameters.
Combining LoRA with foundation models, we set up new state-of-the-art on a
range of data-efficient learning tasks, such as an AUROC score of 80.6% using
1% labeled data on NIH ChestX-ray14. We hope this study can evoke more
attention from the community in the use of PEFT for transfer learning on
medical imaging tasks. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/RL4M/MED-PEFT.

<p class="mathjax">Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models aim to accurately assign a
semantic label to each pixel in an image from a set of arbitrary
open-vocabulary texts. In order to learn such pixel-level alignment, current
approaches typically rely on a combination of (i) image-level VL model (e.g.
CLIP), (ii) ground truth masks, and (iii) custom grouping encoders. In this
paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong
performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages
pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from
publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model
directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained,
S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring
fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data
and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that
our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future
research.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning a small data sample of
size $n$ drawn from a mixture of $2$ sub-gaussian distributions. In particular,
we analyze computational efficient algorithms proposed by the same author, to
partition data into two groups approximately according to their population of
origin given a small sample. This work is motivated by the application of
clustering individuals according to their population of origin using $p$
markers, when the divergence between any two of the populations is small. We
build upon the semidefinite relaxation of an integer quadratic program that is
formulated essentially as finding the maximum cut on a graph, where edge
weights in the cut represent dissimilarity scores between two nodes based on
their $p$ features. Here we use $\Delta^2 :=p \gamma$ to denote the $\ell_2^2$
distance between two centers (mean vectors), namely, $\mu^{(1)}$, $\mu^{(2)}$
$\in$ $\mathbb{R}^p$. The goal is to allow a full range of tradeoffs between
$n, p, \gamma$ in the sense that partial recovery (success rate $&lt; 100\%$) is
feasible once the signal to noise ratio $s^2 := \min\{np \gamma^2, \Delta^2\}$
is lower bounded by a constant. Importantly, we prove that the
misclassification error decays exponentially with respect to the SNR $s^2$.
This result was introduced earlier without a full proof. We therefore present
the full proof in the present work. Finally, for balanced partitions, we
consider a variant of the SDP1, and show that the new estimator has a superb
debiasing property. This is novel to the best of our knowledge.

<p class="mathjax">This research explores a relatively unexplored area of predicting
cryptocurrency staking rewards, offering potential insights to researchers and
investors. We investigate two predictive methodologies: a) a straightforward
sliding-window average, and b) linear regression models predicated on
historical data. The findings reveal that ETH staking rewards can be forecasted
with an RMSE within 0.7% and 1.1% of the mean value for 1-day and 7-day
look-aheads respectively, using a 7-day sliding-window average approach.
Additionally, we discern diverse prediction accuracies across various
cryptocurrencies, including SOL, XTZ, ATOM, and MATIC. Linear regression is
identified as superior to the moving-window average for perdicting in the short
term for XTZ and ATOM. The results underscore the generally stable and
predictable nature of staking rewards for most assets, with MATIC presenting a
noteworthy exception.

<p class="mathjax">We show that it is possible to understand and identify a decision maker's
subjective causal judgements by observing her preferences over interventions.
Following Pearl [2000], we represent causality using causal models (also called
structural equations models), where the world is described by a collection of
variables, related by equations. We show that if a preference relation over
interventions satisfies certain axioms (related to standard axioms regarding
counterfactuals), then we can define (i) a causal model, (ii) a probability
capturing the decision-maker's uncertainty regarding the external factors in
the world and (iii) a utility on outcomes such that each intervention is
associated with an expected utility and such that intervention $A$ is preferred
to $B$ iff the expected utility of $A$ is greater than that of $B$. In
addition, we characterize when the causal model is unique. Thus, our results
allow a modeler to test the hypothesis that a decision maker's preferences are
consistent with some causal model and to identify causal judgements from
observed behavior.

<p class="mathjax">In order to efficiently explore the chemical space of all possible small
molecules, a common approach is to compress the dimension of the system to
facilitate downstream machine learning tasks. Towards this end, we present a
data driven approach for clustering potential energy landscapes of molecular
structures by applying recently developed Network Embedding techniques, to
obtain latent variables defined through the embedding function. To scale up the
method, we also incorporate an entropy sensitive adaptive scheme for
hierarchical sampling of the energy landscape, based on Metadynamics and
Transition Path Theory. By taking into account the kinetic information implied
by a system's energy landscape, we are able to interpret dynamical node-node
relationships in reduced dimensions. We demonstrate the framework through
Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters and a human DNA sequence.

<p class="mathjax">Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known not
to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and
theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have
established that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the
dimensionality of the problem compared to e.g. mean field families. This is
particularly critical to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables;
their dimensionality increases with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one
gets an iteration complexity with an explicit $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dependence on
the dataset size $N$. In this paper, we explore a theoretical middle ground
between mean-field variational families and full-rank families: structured
variational families. We rigorously prove that certain scale matrix structures
can achieve a better iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, implying better
scaling with respect to $N$. We empirically verify our theoretical results on
large-scale hierarchical models.

<p class="mathjax">Speaker embeddings carry valuable emotion-related information, which makes
them a promising resource for enhancing speech emotion recognition (SER),
especially with limited labeled data. Traditionally, it has been assumed that
emotion information is indirectly embedded within speaker embeddings, leading
to their under-utilization. Our study reveals a direct and useful link between
emotion and state-of-the-art speaker embeddings in the form of intra-speaker
clusters. By conducting a thorough clustering analysis, we demonstrate that
emotion information can be readily extracted from speaker embeddings. In order
to leverage this information, we introduce a novel contrastive pretraining
approach applied to emotion-unlabeled data for speech emotion recognition. The
proposed approach involves the sampling of positive and the negative examples
based on the intra-speaker clusters of speaker embeddings. The proposed
strategy, which leverages extensive emotion-unlabeled data, leads to a
significant improvement in SER performance, whether employed as a standalone
pretraining task or integrated into a multi-task pretraining setting.

<p class="mathjax">We develop qutrit circuit models for discrete-time three-state quantum walks
on Cayley graphs corresponding to Dihedral groups $D_N$ and the additive groups
of integers modulo any positive integer $N$. The proposed circuits comprise of
elementary qutrit gates such as qutrit rotation gates, qutrit-$X$ gates and
two-qutrit controlled-$X$ gates. First, we propose qutrit circuit
representation of special unitary matrices of order three, and the block
diagonal special unitary matrices with $3\times 3$ diagonal blocks, which
correspond to multi-controlled $X$ gates and permutations of qutrit Toffoli
gates. We show that one-layer qutrit circuit model need $O(3nN)$ two-qutrit
control gates and $O(3N)$ one-qutrit rotation gates for these quantum walks
when $N=3^n$. Finally, we numerically simulate these circuits to mimic its
performance such as time-averaged probability of finding the walker at any
vertex on noisy quantum computers. The simulated results for the time-averaged
probability distributions for noisy and noiseless walks are further compared
using KL-divergence and total variation distance. These results show that noise
in gates in the circuits significantly impacts the distributions than amplitude
damping or phase damping errors.

<p class="mathjax">Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot
voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually
apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding
the complete source speech, and limiting their deployment to real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming
LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given
arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming
capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a
temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic
and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the
dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance
degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the
context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context
foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic
context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context;
2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding
corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability.
Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without
any future look-ahead. Experimental results demonstrate StreamVoice's streaming
conversion capability while maintaining zero-shot performance comparable to
non-streaming VC systems.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum kernels hold great promise for offering computational advantages over
classical learners, with the effectiveness of these kernels closely tied to the
design of the quantum feature map. However, the challenge of designing
effective quantum feature maps for real-world datasets, particularly in the
absence of sufficient prior information, remains a significant obstacle. In
this study, we present a data-driven approach that automates the design of
problem-specific quantum feature maps. Our approach leverages feature-selection
techniques to handle high-dimensional data on near-term quantum machines with
limited qubits, and incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently
evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. Through
extensive numerical simulations on different datasets, we demonstrate the
superiority of our proposal over prior methods, especially for the capability
of eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map
with prediction advantages. Our work not only unlocks the potential of quantum
kernels for enhancing real-world tasks but also highlights the substantial role
of deep learning in advancing quantum machine learning.

<p class="mathjax">Routine blood pressure (BP) monitoring, crucial for health assessment, faces
challenges such as limited access to medical-grade equipment and expertise.
Portable cuff BP devices, on the other hand, are cumbersome to carry all day
and often cost-prohibitive in less developed countries. Besides, these
sphygmomanometer-based devices can cause discomfort and disrupt blood flow
during measurement. This study explores the use of smartphones for continuous
BP monitoring, focusing on overcoming the trust barriers associated with the
opacity of machine learning models in predicting BP from low-quality PPG
signals. Our approach included developing models based on cardiovascular
literature, using simple statistical methods to estimate BP from smartphone PPG
signals with comprehensive data pre-processing, applying SHAP for enhanced
interpretability and feature identification, and comparing our methods against
standard references using Bland-Altman analysis. Validated with data from 125
participants, the study demonstrated significant correlations in waveform
features between smartphone and reference BP monitoring devices. The
cross-validation of linear regression [MAE=9.86 and 8.01 mmHg for systolic
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively] and
random forest model (MAE=8.91 and 6.68 mmHg for SBP and DBP) using
waveform-only variables demonstrated the feasibility of using a smartphone to
estimate BP. Although SHAP analysis identified key feature sets, Bland-Altman
results did not fully meet established thresholds (84.64% and 94.69% of MAE&lt;15
mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively). The study suggests the potential of
smartphone cameras to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of machine
learning models for daily BP estimation, but also indicates that smartphone
PPG-based BP prediction is not yet a replacement for traditional medical
devices.

<p class="mathjax">In modern radar systems, precise target localization using azimuth and
velocity estimation is paramount. Traditional unbiased estimation methods have
leveraged gradient descent algorithms to reach the theoretical limits of the
Cram\'er Rao Bound (CRB) for the error of the parameter estimates. In this
study, we present a data-driven neural network approach that outperforms these
traditional techniques, demonstrating improved accuracies in target azimuth and
velocity estimation. Using a representative simulated scenario, we show that
our proposed neural network model consistently achieves improved parameter
estimates due to its inherently biased nature, yielding a diminished mean
squared error (MSE). Our findings underscore the potential of employing deep
learning methods in radar systems, paving the way for more accurate
localization in cluttered and dynamic environments.

but little work has been done to address the effect of adversarial attacks on
segmentation models trained on MRI datasets. In light of the grave consequences
that such attacks could cause, we explore four models from the U-Net family and
examine their responses to the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack. We
conduct FGSM attacks on each of them and experiment with various schemes to
conduct the attacks. In this paper, we find that medical imaging segmentation
models are indeed vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that there is a
negligible correlation between parameter size and adversarial attack success.
Furthermore, we show that using a different loss function than the one used for
training yields higher adversarial attack success, contrary to what the FGSM
authors suggested. In future efforts, we will conduct the experiments detailed
in this paper with more segmentation models and different attacks. We will also
attempt to find ways to counteract the attacks by using model ensembles or
special data augmentations. Our code is available at

<p class="mathjax">Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an essential imaging modality nowadays, but the image
quality of CBCT still lags behind the high quality standards established by the
conventional Computed Tomography. We propose LIRE+, a learned iterative scheme
for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction, which is a substantially
faster and more parameter-efficient alternative to the recently proposed LIRE
method. LIRE+ is a rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible
primal-dual iterative scheme for CBCT reconstruction. Memory usage is optimized
by relying on simple reversible residual networks in primal/dual cells and
patch-wise computations inside the cells during forward and backward passes,
while increased inference speed is achieved by making the primal-dual scheme
multiscale so that the reconstruction process starts at low resolution and with
low resolution primal/dual latent vectors. A LIRE+ model was trained and
validated on a set of 260 + 22 thorax CT scans and tested using a set of 142
thorax CT scans with additional evaluation with and without finetuning on an
out-of-distribution set of 79 Head and Neck (HN) CT scans. Our method surpasses
classical and deep learning baselines, including LIRE, on the thorax test set.
For a similar inference time and with only 37 % of the parameter budget, LIRE+
achieves a +0.2 dB PSNR improvement over LIRE, while being able to match the
performance of LIRE in 45 % less inference time and with 28 % of the parameter
budget. Rotational equivariance ensures robustness of LIRE+ to patient
orientation, while LIRE and other deep learning baselines suffer from
substantial performance degradation when patient orientation is unusual. On the
HN dataset in the absence of finetuning, LIRE+ is generally comparable to LIRE
in performance apart from a few outlier cases, whereas after identical
finetuning LIRE+ demonstates a +1.02 dB PSNR improvement over LIRE.

complex computational problems faster than can be done by classical methods.
There are many prototype-based clustering methods in use today, and selection
of the starting nodes for the center points is often done randomly. For
prototype-based clustering algorithms, this could lead to much slower
convergence times. One of the causes of this may be prototype-based clustering
accepting a local minima as a valid solution when there are possibly better
solutions. Quantum computing, specifically quantum annealing, offers a solution
to these problems by mapping the initial centroid problem to an Ising
Hamiltonian where over time the lowest energy in the spectrum correlates to a
valid, but better solution. A first approach to this problem utilizing quantum
annealing was known as Quantum Optimized Centroid Initialization (QOCI), but
this approach has some limitations both in results and performance. We will
present a modification of QOCI known as Adaptive Quantum Optimized Centroid
Initialization (AQOCI) which addresses many of the limitations in QOCI. The
results presented are comparable to those obtained using classical techniques
as well as being superior to those results found using QOCI.

<p class="mathjax">Constant gain least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithms have a wide range of
applications in trajectory tracking problems, but the formal convergence of LMS
in mean square is not yet fully established. This work provides an upper bound
on the constant gain that guarantees a bounded mean-squared error of LMS for a
general design vector. These results highlight the role of the fourth-order
moment of the design vector. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability
of this upper bound in setting a constant gain in LMS, while existing criteria
may fail. We also provide the associated error bound, which can be applied to
design vectors with linearly dependent elements.

<p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of decentralized optimization in networks with
communication delays. To accommodate delays, we need decentralized optimization
algorithms that work on directed graphs. Existing approaches require nodes to
know their out-degree to achieve convergence. We propose a novel gossip-based
algorithm that circumvents this requirement, allowing decentralized
optimization in networks with communication delays. We prove that our algorithm
converges on non-convex objectives, with the same main complexity order term as
centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and show that the graph topology
and the delays only affect the higher order terms. We provide numerical
simulations that illustrate our theoretical results.

<p class="mathjax">Fish fin rays constitute a sophisticated control system for ray-finned fish,
facilitating versatile locomotion within complex fluid environments. Despite
extensive research on the kinematics and hydrodynamics of fish locomotion, the
intricate control strategies in fin-ray actuation remain largely unexplored.
While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in managing
complex nonlinear dynamics; its trial-and-error nature limits its application
to problems involving computationally demanding environmental interactions.
This study introduces a cutting-edge off-policy DRL algorithm, interacting with
a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) environment to acquire intricate fin-ray
control strategies tailored for various propulsive performance objectives. To
enhance training efficiency and enable scalable parallelism, an innovative
asynchronous parallel training (APT) strategy is proposed, which fully
decouples FSI environment interactions and policy/value network optimization.
The results demonstrated the success of the proposed method in discovering
optimal complex policies for fin-ray actuation control, resulting in a superior
propulsive performance compared to the optimal sinusoidal actuation function
identified through a parametric grid search. The merit and effectiveness of the
APT approach are also showcased through comprehensive comparison with
conventional DRL training strategies in numerical experiments of controlling
nonlinear dynamics.

<p class="mathjax">Quantum circuit simulation is a challenging computational problem crucial for
quantum computing research and development. The predominant approaches in this
area center on tensor networks, prized for their better concurrency and less
computation than methods using full quantum vectors and matrices. However, even
with the advantages, array-based tensors can have significant redundancy. We
present a novel open-source framework that harnesses tensor decision diagrams
to eliminate overheads and achieve significant speedups over prior approaches.
On average, it delivers a speedup of 37$\times$ over Google's TensorNetwork
library on redundancy-rich circuits, and 25$\times$ and 144$\times$ over
quantum multi-valued decision diagram and prior tensor decision diagram
implementation, respectively, on Google random quantum circuits. To achieve
this, we introduce a new linear-complexity rank simplification algorithm,
Tetris, and edge-centric data structures for recursive tensor decision diagram
operations. Additionally, we explore the efficacy of tensor network contraction
ordering and optimizations from binary decision diagrams.

<p class="mathjax">We make use of an entropic property to establish a convergence theorem (Main
Theorem), which reveals that the conditional entropy measures the asymptotic
Gaussianity. As an application, we establish the {\it entropic conditional
central limit theorem} (CCLT), which is stronger than the classical CCLT. As
another application, we show that continuous input under iterated Hadamard
transform, almost every distribution of the output conditional on the values of
the previous signals will tend to Gaussian, and the conditional distribution is
in fact insensitive to the condition. The results enable us to make a theoretic
study concerning Hadamard compression, which provides a solid theoretical
analysis supporting the simulation results in previous literature. We show also
that the conditional Fisher information can be used to measure the asymptotic
Gaussianity.

<p class="mathjax">Wireless sensor network (WSN) underpinning the smart-grid Internet of Things
(SG-IoT) has been a popular research topic in recent years due to its great
potential for enabling a wide range of important applications. However, the
energy consumption (EC) characteristic of sensor nodes is a key factor that
affects the operational performance (e.g., lifetime of sensors) and the total
cost of ownership of WSNs. In this paper, to find the modulation techniques
suitable for WSNs, we investigate the EC characteristic of continuous phase
modulation (CPM), which is an attractive modulation scheme candidate for WSNs
because of its constant envelope property. We first develop an EC model for the
sensor nodes of WSNs by considering the circuits and a typical communication
protocol that relies on automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based retransmissions to
ensure successful data delivery. Then, we use this model to analyze the EC
characteristic of CPM under various configurations of modulation parameters.
Furthermore, we compare the EC characteristic of CPM with that of other
representative modulation schemes, such as offset quadrature phase-shift keying
(OQPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which are commonly used in
communication protocols of WSNs. Our analysis and simulation results provide
insights into the EC characteristics of multiple modulation schemes in the
context of WSNs; thus, they are beneficial for designing energy-efficient
SG-IoT in the beyond-5G (B5G) and the 6G era.

<p class="mathjax">Lung cancer is one of the significant causes of cancer-related deaths
globally. Early detection and treatment improve the chances of survival.
Traditionally CT scans have been used to extract the most significant lung
infection information and diagnose cancer. This process is carried out manually
by an expert radiologist. The imbalance in the radiologists-to-population ratio
in a country like India implies significant work pressure on them and thus
raises the need to automate a few of their responsibilities. The tendency of
modern-day Deep Neural networks to make overconfident mistakes limit their
usage to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a new task-specific loss
function to calibrate the neural network to reduce the risk of overconfident
mistakes. We use the state-of-the-art Multi-class Difference in Confidence and
Accuracy (MDCA) loss in conjunction with the proposed task-specific loss
function to achieve the same. We also integrate post-hoc calibration by
performing temperature scaling on top of the train-time calibrated model. We
demonstrate 5.98% improvement in the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and a
17.9% improvement in Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) as compared to the
best-performing SOTA algorithm.

both fitting to the existing experimental data and satisfying abstract criteria

<p class="mathjax">Reinforcement Learning (RL) consists of designing agents that make
intelligent decisions without human supervision. When used alongside function
approximators such as Neural Networks (NNs), RL is capable of solving extremely
complex problems. Deep Q-Learning, a RL algorithm that uses Deep NNs, achieved
super-human performance in some specific tasks. Nonetheless, it is also
possible to use Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as function approximators
in RL algorithms. This work empirically studies the performance and
trainability of such VQC-based Deep Q-Learning models in classic control
benchmark environments. More specifically, we research how data re-uploading
affects both these metrics. We show that the magnitude and the variance of the
gradients of these models remain substantial throughout training due to the
moving targets of Deep Q-Learning. Moreover, we empirically show that
increasing the number of qubits does not lead to an exponential vanishing
behavior of the magnitude and variance of the gradients for a PQC approximating
a 2-design, unlike what was expected due to the Barren Plateau Phenomenon. This
hints at the possibility of VQCs being specially adequate for being used as
function approximators in such a context.

<p class="mathjax">Given two labeled data-sets $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$, we design a
simple and efficient greedy algorithm to reweigh the loss function such that
the limiting distribution of the neural network weights that result from
training on $\mathcal{S}$ approaches the limiting distribution that would have
resulted by training on $\mathcal{T}$.
<br />On the theoretical side, we prove that when the metric entropy of the input
data-sets is bounded, our greedy algorithm outputs a close to optimal
reweighing, i.e., the two invariant distributions of network weights will be
provably close in total variation distance. Moreover, the algorithm is simple
and scalable, and we prove bounds on the efficiency of the algorithm as well.
<br />Our algorithm can deliberately introduce distribution shift to perform (soft)
multi-criteria optimization. As a motivating application, we train a neural net
to recognize small molecule binders to MNK2 (a MAP Kinase, responsible for cell
signaling) which are non-binders to MNK1 (a highly similar protein). We tune
the algorithm's parameter so that overall change in holdout loss is negligible,
but the selectivity, i.e., the fraction of top 100 MNK2 binders that are MNK1
non-binders, increases from 54\% to 95\%, as a result of our reweighing. Of the
43 distinct small molecules predicted to be most selective from the enamine
catalog, 2 small molecules were experimentally verified to be selective, i.e.,
they reduced the enzyme activity of MNK2 below 50\% but not MNK1, at 10$\mu$M
-- a 5\% success rate.

<p class="mathjax">In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation
satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multi-stage
Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total
observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through
the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent
satellites. In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which
the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear
programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal
solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial
explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally
efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a
myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments
demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield
high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline
MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the
advantages of multi-stage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and
no-reconfiguration scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture
search (QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential
quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Most QAS
algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and thus
generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the
search process. Predictor-based QAS algorithms can alleviate this problem by
directly estimating the performance of circuits according to their structures.
However, a high-performance predictor generally requires very time-consuming
labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum circuits. Recently, a
classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing
that architecture search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised
representation learning from the search process. Whether unsupervised
representation learning can help QAS without any predictor is still an open
topic. In this work, we propose a framework QAS with unsupervised
representation learning and visualize how unsupervised architecture
representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with similar
connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework
enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture
representation learning so that the learned representation can be directly
applied to different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is
predictor-free eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum
circuits. During the search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and
Bayesian Optimization to directly search on the latent representation, and
compare them with the method Random Search. The results show our framework can
more efficiently get well-performing candidate circuits within a limited number
of searches.

<p class="mathjax">Binucci et al. [Graph Drawing 2023] have recently introduced the concept of
min-k-planar graphs as a generalization of k-planar graphs. In a min-k-planar
drawing edges can, generally, be crossed many times, but for any two crossing
edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In their
introductory paper, the authors made an assumption (quite usual in this area)
that they only consider simple (good) drawings; i.e., drawings in which no two
edges have two points in common. We show that this assumption on min-k-planar

<p class="mathjax">Forecasting speculative stock prices is essential for effective investment
risk management that drives the need for the development of innovative
algorithms. However, the speculative nature, volatility, and complex sequential
dependencies within financial markets present inherent challenges which
necessitate advanced techniques. This paper proposes a novel framework, CAB-XDE
(customized attention BiLSTM-XGB decision ensemble), for predicting the daily
closing price of speculative stock Bitcoin-USD (BTC-USD). CAB-XDE framework
integrates a customized bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the
attention mechanism and the XGBoost algorithm. The customized BiLSTM leverages
its learning capabilities to capture the complex sequential dependencies and
speculative market trends. Additionally, the new attention mechanism
dynamically assigns weights to influential features, thereby enhancing
interpretability, and optimizing effective cost measures and volatility
forecasting. Moreover, XGBoost handles nonlinear relationships and contributes
to the proposed CAB-XDE framework robustness. Additionally, the weight
determination theory-error reciprocal method further refines predictions. This
refinement is achieved by iteratively adjusting model weights. It is based on
discrepancies between theoretical expectations and actual errors in individual
customized attention BiLSTM and XGBoost models to enhance performance. Finally,
the predictions from both XGBoost and customized attention BiLSTM models are
concatenated to achieve diverse prediction space and are provided to the
ensemble classifier to enhance the generalization capabilities of CAB-XDE. The
proposed CAB-XDE framework is empirically validated on volatile Bitcoin market,
sourced from Yahoo Finance and outperforms state-of-the-art models with a MAPE
of 0.0037, MAE of 84.40, and RMSE of 106.14.

<p class="mathjax">Even with several advancements in multilingual modeling, it is challenging to
recognize multiple languages using a single neural model, without knowing the
input language and most multilingual models assume the availability of the
input language. In this work, we propose a novel bilingual end-to-end (E2E)
modeling approach, where a single neural model can recognize both languages and
also support switching between the languages, without any language input from
the user. The proposed model has shared encoder and prediction networks, with
language-specific joint networks that are combined via a self-attention
mechanism. As the language-specific posteriors are combined, it produces a
single posterior probability over all the output symbols, enabling a single
beam search decoding and also allowing dynamic switching between the languages.
The proposed approach outperforms the conventional bilingual baseline with
13.3%, 8.23% and 1.3% word error rate relative reduction on Hindi, English and
code-mixed test sets, respectively.

<p class="mathjax">Nonparametric models are of great interest in various scientific and
engineering disciplines. Classical kernel methods, while numerically robust and
statistically sound in low-dimensional settings, become inadequate in
higher-dimensional settings due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper,
we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS),
specifically designed to estimate density functions and nonparametric
regression functions in higher dimensions with a reduced curse of
dimensionality. Our framework conceptualizes multivariable functions as
infinite-size matrices, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by
numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in estimation
problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a
series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS
shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network estimators and
classical kernel methods in numerous density estimation and nonparametric
regression models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to
support its ability to deliver nonparametric estimation with a reduced curse of
dimensionality.

<p class="mathjax">Approximate Thompson sampling with Langevin Monte Carlo broadens its reach
from Gaussian posterior sampling to encompass more general smooth posteriors.
However, it still encounters scalability issues in high-dimensional problems
when demanding high accuracy. To address this, we propose an approximate
Thompson sampling strategy, utilizing underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, where
the latter is the go-to workhorse for simulations of high-dimensional
posteriors. Based on the standard smoothness and log-concavity conditions, we
study the accelerated posterior concentration and sampling using a specific
potential function. This design improves the sample complexity for realizing
logarithmic regrets from $\mathcal{\tilde O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{\tilde
O}(\sqrt{d})$. The scalability and robustness of our algorithm are also
empirically validated through synthetic experiments in high-dimensional bandit
problems.

<p class="mathjax">Polyp segmentation is a key aspect of colorectal cancer prevention, enabling
early detection and guiding subsequent treatments. Intelligent diagnostic
tools, including deep learning solutions, are widely explored to streamline and
potentially automate this process. However, even with many powerful network
architectures, there still comes the problem of producing accurate edge
segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a novel network, namely RTA-Former,
that employs a transformer model as the encoder backbone and innovatively
adapts Reverse Attention (RA) with a transformer stage in the decoder for
enhanced edge segmentation. The results of the experiments illustrate that
RTA-Former achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in five polyp
segmentation datasets. The strong capability of RTA-Former holds promise in
improving the accuracy of Transformer-based polyp segmentation, potentially
leading to better clinical decisions and patient outcomes. Our code will be
publicly available on GitHub.

<p class="mathjax">Visible (VIS) imagery of satellites has various important applications in
meteorology, including monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs). However, it is
unavailable at night because of the lack of sunlight. This study presents a
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model that generates highly
accurate nighttime visible reflectance using infrared (IR) bands and sunlight
direction parameters as input. The model was trained and validated using target
area observations of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime. This
study also presents the first nighttime model validation using the Day/Night
Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The daytime
statistical results of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Correlation
Coefficient (CC), and Bias are 0.885, 28.3, 0.0428, 0.984, and -0.0016
respectively, completely surpassing the model performance of previous studies.
The nighttime statistical results of SSIM, PSNR, RMSE, and CC are 0.821, 24.4,
0.0643, and 0.969 respectively, which are slightly negatively impacted by the
parallax between satellites. We performed full-disk model validation which
proves our model could also be readily applied in the tropical ocean without
TCs in the northern hemisphere. This model contributes to the nighttime
monitoring of meteorological phenomena by providing accurate AI-generated
visible imagery with adjustable virtual sunlight directions.

<p class="mathjax">Neural Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is a powerful technology that can
generate speech using neural networks. One of the most remarkable features of
TTS synthesis is its capability to produce speech in the voice of different
speakers. This paper introduces voice cloning and speech synthesis
https://pypi.org/project/voice-cloning/ an open-source python package for
helping speech disorders to communicate more effectively as well as for
professionals seeking to integrate voice cloning or speech synthesis
capabilities into their projects. This package aims to generate synthetic
speech that sounds like the natural voice of an individual, but it does not
replace the natural human voice. The architecture of the system comprises a
speaker verification system, a synthesizer, a vocoder, and noise reduction.
Speaker verification system trained on a varied set of speakers to achieve
optimal generalization performance without relying on transcriptions.
Synthesizer is trained using both audio and transcriptions that generate Mel
spectrogram from a text and vocoder which converts the generated Mel
Spectrogram into corresponding audio signal. Then the audio signal is processed
by a noise reduction algorithm to eliminate unwanted noise and enhance speech
clarity. The performance of synthesized speech from seen and unseen speakers
are then evaluated using subjective and objective evaluation such as Mean
Opinion Score (MOS), Gross Pitch Error (GPE), and Spectral distortion (SD). The
model can create speech in distinct voices by including speaker characteristics
that are chosen randomly.

<p class="mathjax">This research investigates the impact of dynamic interactions with
time-varying topologies on the evolution of cooperative behaviours in social
dilemmas. Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing
pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and
synchronicity on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our
work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or
periodic participation of individuals in these games, acknowledging real-life
variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences.
We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game
payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights
into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that
maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic
interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate region of activation
probability yields the highest cooperation level, especially under strong
dilemma conditions. This suggests that a balance between inactivity security
and interaction frequency is crucial. Furthermore, local synchronization of
interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time
differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of
dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. Our findings provide an
intuitive understanding of node-based temporality and probabilistic
interactions, contributing to the broader discourse on resolving social
dilemmas.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel (HDAG - Harmonic Detection for Auditory Gain)
method for speech intelligibility enhancement in noisy scenarios. In the
proposed scheme, a series of selective Gammachirp filters are adopted to
emphasize the harmonic components of speech reducing the masking effects of
acoustic noises. The fundamental frequency are estimated by the HHT-Amp
technique. Harmonic patterns estimated with low accuracy are detected and
adjusted according the FSFFE low/high pitch separation. The central frequencies
of the filterbank are defined considering the third octave subbands which are
best suited to cover the regions most relevant to intelligibility. Before
signal reconstruction, the gammachirp filtered components are amplified by gain
factors regulated by FSFFE classification. The proposed HDAG solution and three
baseline techniques are examined considering six background noises with four
signal-to-noise ratios. Three objective measures are adopted for the evaluation
of speech intelligibility and quality. Several experiments are conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better speech intelligibility
improvement when compared to the competing approaches. A perceptual listening
test is further considered and corroborates with the objective results.

<p class="mathjax">This work introduces a time domain personalized method (pGTFF0) to achieve
intelligibility improvement of noisy speech for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
situation. For this proposal, harmonic features estimated from speech frames
are considered as center frequencies of Gammatone auditory filterbanks. A gain
factor is further applied to the output of the filtered samples. The key goal
is the emulation of an external noise filtering tailored for individuals with
ASD. A perceptual listening test demonstrates that ASD volunteers attained
lower intelligibility rates than Neurotypical (NT). The proposed solution is
compared to three competing approaches considering four acoustic noises at
different signal-to-noise ratios. Two objective measures (ESTOI and PESQ) are
also adopted for evaluation. The experimental results show that the
personalized solution outperformed the competing approaches in terms of

<p class="mathjax">Medical image segmentation takes an important position in various clinical
applications. Deep learning has emerged as the predominant solution for
automated segmentation of volumetric medical images. 2.5D-based segmentation
models bridge computational efficiency of 2D-based models and spatial
perception capabilities of 3D-based models. However, prevailing 2.5D-based
models often treat each slice equally, failing to effectively learn and exploit
inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performances. In
this paper, a novel Momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer
(MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice
information at multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders.
Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability
among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain the
consistency of slice representations. Moreover, an IF-Swin transformer module
is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. The MOSformer is
evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), establishing a
new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% of DSC, respectively.
These promising results indicate its competitiveness in medical image
segmentation. Codes and models of MOSformer will be made publicly available
upon acceptance.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid progress in personalized speech generation technology, including
personalized text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), poses a challenge
in distinguishing between generated and real speech for human listeners,
resulting in an urgent demand in protecting speakers' voices from malicious
misuse. In this regard, we propose a speaker protection method based on
adversarial attacks. The proposed method perturbs speech signals by minimally
altering the original speech while rendering downstream speech generation
models unable to accurately generate the voice of the target speaker. For
validation, we employ the open-source pre-trained YourTTS model for speech
generation and protect the target speaker's speech in the white-box scenario.
Automatic speaker verification (ASV) evaluations were carried out on the
generated speech as the assessment of the voice protection capability. Our
experimental results show that we successfully perturbed the speaker encoder of
the YourTTS model using the gradient-based I-FGSM adversarial perturbation
method. Furthermore, the adversarial perturbation is effective in preventing
the YourTTS model from generating the speech of the target speaker. Audio
samples can be found in
https://voiceprivacy.github.io/Adeversarial-Speech-with-YourTTS.

<p class="mathjax">Given the broad application of infrared technology across diverse fields,
there is an increasing emphasis on investigating super-resolution techniques
for infrared images within the realm of deep learning. Despite the impressive
results of current Transformer-based methods in image super-resolution tasks,
their reliance on the self-attentive mechanism intrinsic to the Transformer
architecture results in images being treated as one-dimensional sequences,
thereby neglecting their inherent two-dimensional structure. Moreover, infrared
images exhibit a uniform pixel distribution and a limited gradient range,
posing challenges for the model to capture effective feature information.
Consequently, we suggest a potent Transformer model, termed Large Kernel
Transformer (LKFormer), to address this issue. Specifically, we have designed a
Large Kernel Residual Depth-wise Convolutional Attention (LKRDA) module with
linear complexity. This mainly employs depth-wise convolution with large
kernels to execute non-local feature modeling, thereby substituting the
standard self-attentive layer. Additionally, we have devised a novel
feed-forward network structure called Gated-Pixel Feed-Forward Network (GPFN)
to augment the LKFormer's capacity to manage the information flow within the
network. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that our method surpasses
the most advanced techniques available, using fewer parameters and yielding
considerably superior performance.

<p class="mathjax">We study the robustness of learned image compression models against
adversarial attacks and present a training-free defense technique based on
simple image transform functions. Recent learned image compression models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks that result in poor compression rate, low
reconstruction quality, or weird artifacts. To address the limitations, we
propose a simple but effective two-way compression algorithm with random input
transforms, which is conveniently applicable to existing image compression
models. Unlike the na\"ive approaches, our approach preserves the original
rate-distortion performance of the models on clean images. Moreover, the
proposed algorithm requires no additional training or modification of existing
models, making it more practical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed techniques through extensive experiments under multiple compression
models, evaluation metrics, and attack scenarios.

<p class="mathjax">Several of the classical results in social choice theory demonstrate that in
order for many voting systems to be well-behaved the set domain of individual
preferences must satisfy some kind of restriction, such as being single-peaked
on a political axis. As a consequence it becomes interesting to measure how
diverse the preferences in a well-behaved domain can be.
<br />In this paper we introduce an egalitarian approach to measuring preference
diversity, focusing on the abundance of distinct suborders one subsets of the
alternative. We provide a common generalisation of the frequently used concepts
of ampleness and copiousness.
<br />We give a detailed investigation of the abundance for Condorcet domains. Our
theorems imply a ceiling for the local diversity in domains on large sets of
alternatives, which show that in this measure Black's single-peaked domain is
in fact optimal. We also demonstrate that for some numbers of alternatives,
there are Condorcet domains which have largest local diversity without having
maximum order.

<p class="mathjax">Crypto donations now represent a significant fraction of charitable giving
worldwide. Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale
of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes,
have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT
charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial
gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about the
motivations of donors in these charity fundraisers, resulting in a negative
social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to
understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate
these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the
causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's
later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing
times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of
heterogeneity, based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the
purchased charity NFTs (a sign of strategic generosity), and based on an
individual's degree of social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that
charity-NFT "relisters" experience significant penalties in the market, in
terms of the prices they are able to command on other NFT listings,
particularly among those who relist quickly and those who are more socially
exposed. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and
traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online
philanthropy more broadly.

<p class="mathjax">This paper introduces a novel multimodal and high-resolution human brain
cerebellum lobule segmentation method. Unlike current tools that operate at
standard resolution ($1 \text{ mm}^{3}$) or using mono-modal data, the proposed
method improves cerebellum lobule segmentation through the use of a multimodal
and ultra-high resolution ($0.125 \text{ mm}^{3}$) training dataset. To develop
the method, first, a database of semi-automatically labelled cerebellum lobules
was created to train the proposed method with ultra-high resolution T1 and T2
MR images. Then, an ensemble of deep networks has been designed and developed,
allowing the proposed method to excel in the complex cerebellum lobule
segmentation task, improving precision while being memory efficient. Notably,
our approach deviates from the traditional U-Net model by exploring alternative
architectures. We have also integrated deep learning with classical machine
learning methods incorporating a priori knowledge from multi-atlas
segmentation, which improved precision and robustness. Finally, a new online
pipeline, named DeepCERES, has been developed to make available the proposed
method to the scientific community requiring as input only a single T1 MR image
at standard resolution.

<p class="mathjax">On-device Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models trained on speech data of
a large population might underperform for individuals unseen during training.
This is due to a domain shift between user data and the original training data,
differed by user's speaking characteristics and environmental acoustic
conditions. ASR personalisation is a solution that aims to exploit user data to
improve model robustness. The majority of ASR personalisation methods assume
labelled user data for supervision. Personalisation without any labelled data
is challenging due to limited data size and poor quality of recorded audio
samples. This work addresses unsupervised personalisation by developing a novel
consistency based training method via pseudo-labelling. Our method achieves a
relative Word Error Rate Reduction (WERR) of 17.3% on unlabelled training data
and 8.1% on held-out data compared to a pre-trained model, and outperforms the
current state-of-the art methods.

<p class="mathjax">The eigenvalue problem, a cornerstone in linear algebra, provides profound
insights into studying matrix properties. Quantum algorithms addressing this
problem have hitherto been constrained to special normal matrices assuming
spectral decomposition, leaving the extension to general matrices an open
challenge. In this work, we present a novel family of quantum algorithms
tailored for solving the eigenvalue problem for general matrices, encompassing
scenarios with complex eigenvalues or even defective matrices. Our approach
begins by tackling the task of searching for an eigenvalue without additional
constraints. For diagonalizable matrices, our algorithm has $\tilde
O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity with an error $\varepsilon$, achieving the
nearly Heisenberg scaling. Subsequently, we study the identification of
eigenvalues closest to a specified point or line, extending the results for
ground energy and energy gap problems in Hermitian matrices. We achieve an
accuracy scaling of $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for general diagonalizable
matrices, further refining to $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ under the condition
of real eigenvalues or constant distance from the reference point. The
algorithm's foundation lies in the synergy of three techniques: the
relationship between eigenvalues of matrix $A$ and the minimum singular value
of $A-\mu I$, quantum singular value threshold subroutine extended from quantum
singular-value estimation, and problem-specific searching algorithms. Our
algorithms find applications in diverse domains, including estimating the
relaxation time of Markov chains, solving Liouvillian gaps in open quantum
systems, and verifying PT-symmetry broken/unbroken phases. These applications
underscore the significance of our quantum eigensolvers for problems across
various disciplines.

<p class="mathjax">The Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a non-conventional architecture that
takes inspiration from physical annealing processes to solve Ising problems
heuristically. Its dynamics are naturally continuous and described by a set of
ordinary differential equations that have been proven to be useful for the
optimization of continuous variables non-convex quadratic optimization
problems. The dynamics of such Continuous Variable CIMs (CV-CIM) encourage
optimization via optical pulses whose amplitudes are determined by the negative
gradient of the objective; however, standard gradient descent is known to be
trapped by local minima and hampered by poor problem conditioning. In this
work, we propose to modify the CV-CIM dynamics using more sophisticated pulse
injections based on tried-and-true optimization techniques such as momentum and
Adam. Through numerical experiments, we show that the momentum and Adam updates
can significantly speed up the CV-CIM's convergence and improve sample
diversity over the original CV-CIM dynamics. We also find that the
Adam-CV-CIM's performance is more stable as a function of feedback strength,
especially on poorly conditioned instances, resulting in an algorithm that is
more robust, reliable, and easily tunable. More broadly, we identify the CIM
dynamical framework as a fertile opportunity for exploring the intersection of
classical optimization and modern analog computing.

<p class="mathjax">This paper studies the computational offloading of CNN inference in dynamic
multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks. To address the uncertainties in
communication time and computation resource availability, we propose a novel
semantic compression method, autoencoder-based CNN architecture (AECNN), for
effective semantic extraction and compression in partial offloading. In the
semantic encoder, we introduce a feature compression module based on the
channel attention mechanism in CNNs, to compress intermediate data by selecting
the most informative features. In the semantic decoder, we design a lightweight
decoder to reconstruct the intermediate data through learning from the received
compressed data to improve accuracy. To effectively trade-off communication,
computation, and inference accuracy, we design a reward function and formulate
the offloading problem of CNN inference as a maximization problem with the goal
of maximizing the average inference accuracy and throughput over the long term.
To address this maximization problem, we propose a graph reinforcement
learning-based AECNN (GRL-AECNN) method, which outperforms existing works
DROO-AECNN, GRL-BottleNet++ and GRL-DeepJSCC under different dynamic scenarios.
This highlights the advantages of GRL-AECNN in offloading decision-making in
dynamic MEC.

<p class="mathjax">The automatic classification of X-ray detections is a necessary step in
extracting astrophysical information from compiled catalogs of astrophysical
sources. Classification is useful for the study of individual objects,
statistics for population studies, as well as for anomaly detection, i.e., the
identification of new unexplored phenomena, including transients and spectrally
extreme sources. Despite the importance of this task, classification remains
challenging in X-ray astronomy due to the lack of optical counterparts and
representative training sets. We develop an alternative methodology that
employs an unsupervised machine learning approach to provide probabilistic
classes to Chandra Source Catalog sources with a limited number of labeled
sources, and without ancillary information from optical and infrared catalogs.
We provide a catalog of probabilistic classes for 8,756 sources, comprising a
total of 14,507 detections, and demonstrate the success of the method at
identifying emission from young stellar objects, as well as distinguishing
between small-scale and large-scale compact accretors with a significant level
of confidence. We investigate the consistency between the distribution of
features among classified objects and well-established astrophysical hypotheses
such as the unified AGN model. This provides interpretability to the
probabilistic classifier. Code and tables are available publicly through
GitHub. We provide a web playground for readers to explore our final
classification at https://umlcaxs-playground.streamlit.app.

<p class="mathjax">A pervasive phenomenon in machine learning applications is distribution
shift, where training and deployment conditions for a machine learning model
differ. As distribution shift typically results in a degradation in
performance, much attention has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that
mitigate these detrimental effects. In this paper, we study the effect of
distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification, specifically
focusing on $L_{\infty}$-misspecified regression and adversarial covariate
shift, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate
distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or
standard least squares regression, can result in undesirable misspecification
amplification where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the
density ratio between the training and testing distributions. As our main
result, we develop a new algorithm -- inspired by robust optimization
techniques -- that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting in no
misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates.
As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in
offline and online reinforcement learning with misspecification and establish
new separations between previously studied structural conditions and notions of
coverage.
